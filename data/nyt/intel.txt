Full text: Companies like OpenAI and Google are running out of the data used to train artificial intelligence systems. Can new methods continue years of rapid progress?
Demis Hassabis, one of the most influential artificial intelligence experts in the world, has a warning for the rest of the tech industry: Don't expect chatbots to continue to improve as quickly as they have over the last few years.
A.I. researchers have for some time been relying on a fairly simple concept to improve their systems: The more data culled from the internet that they pumped into large language models -- the technology behind chatbots -- the better those systems performed.
But Dr. Hassabis, who oversees Google DeepMind, the company's primary A.I. lab, now says that method is running out of steam simply because tech companies are running out of data.
"Everyone in the industry is seeing diminishing returns," Dr. Hassabis said this month in an interview with The New York Times as he prepared to accept a Nobel Prize for his work on artificial intelligence.
Dr. Hassabis is not the only A.I. expert warning of a slowdown. Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem that to many was unthinkable just a few years ago: They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.
That problem is starting to surface even as billions of dollars continue to be poured into A.I. development. On Tuesday, Databricks, an A.I. data company, said it was closing in on $ 10 billion in funding -- the largest-ever private funding round for a start-up. And the biggest companies in tech are signaling that they have no plans to slow down their spending on the giant data centers that run A.I. systems.
Not everyone in the A.I. world is concerned. Some, like OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, say that progress will continue at the same pace, albeit with some twists on old techniques. Dario Amodei, the chief executive of the A.I. start-up Anthropic, and Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, are also bullish.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. OpenAI has denied the claims.)
The roots of the debate trace back to 2020 when Jared Kaplan, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, published a research paper showing that large language models steadily grew more powerful and lifelike as they analyzed more data.
Researchers called Dr. Kaplan's findings "the Scaling Laws." Just as students learn more by reading more books, A.I. systems improved as they ingested increasingly large amounts of digital text culled from the internet, including news articles, chat logs and computer programs. Seeing the raw power of this phenomenon, companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta raced to get their hands on as much internet data as possible, cutting corners, ignoring corporate policies and even debating whether they should skirt the law, according to an examination this year by The Times.
It was the modern equivalent of Moore's Law, the oft-quoted maxim coined in the 1960s by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. He showed that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubled every two years or so, steadily increasing the power of the world's computers. Moore's Law held up for 40 years. But eventually, it started to slow.
The problem is, neither the Scaling Laws nor Moore's Law is an immutable law of nature. They're simply smart observations. One held up for decades. The others may have a much shorter shelf life. Google and Dr. Kaplan's new employer, Anthropic, cannot just throw more text at their A.I. systems, because there is little text left to throw.
"There were extraordinary returns over the last three or four years as the Scaling Laws were getting going," Dr. Hassabis said. "But we are no longer getting the same progress."
Dr. Hassabis said that existing techniques would continue to improve A.I. in some ways. But he said he believed that entirely new ideas were needed to reach the goal that Google and many others were chasing: a machine that can match the power of the human brain.
Ilya Sutskever, who was instrumental in pushing the industry to think big as a researcher at both Google and OpenAI before leaving OpenAI to create a start-up this spring, made the same point during a speech last week. "We've achieved peak data, and there'll be no more," he said. "We have to deal with the data that we have. There's only one internet."
Dr. Hassabis and others are exploring a different approach. They are developing ways for large language models to learn from their own trial and error. By working through various math problems, for instance, language models can learn which methods lead to the right answer and which do not. In essence, the models train on data that they themselves generate. Researchers call this "synthetic data."
OpenAI recently released a new system, called OpenAI o1, that was built this way. But the method works only in areas like math and computing programming, where there is a firm distinction between right and wrong.
Even in these areas, A.I. systems have a way of making mistakes and making things up. That can hamper efforts to build A.I. "agents" that can write their own computer programs and take actions on behalf of internet users, which experts see as one of A.I.'s most important skills.
Sorting through the wider expanses of human knowledge is even more difficult.
"These methods only work in areas where things are empirically true, like math and science," said Dylan Patel, chief analyst for the research firm SemiAnalysis, who closely follows the rise of A.I. technologies. "The humanities and the arts, moral and philosophical problems are much more difficult."
People like Mr. Altman of OpenAI say that these new techniques will continue to push the technology ahead. But if progress reaches a plateau, the implications could be far-reaching, even for Nvidia, which has become one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to the A.I. boom.
During a call with analysts last month, Mr. Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, was asked how the company was helping customers work through a potential slowdown and what the repercussions might be for its business. He said that evidence showed there were still gains being made, but that businesses were also testing new processes and techniques on A.I. chips.
"As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great," Mr. Huang said.
Though he is confident about Nvidia's prospects, some of the company's biggest customers acknowledge that they must prepare for the possibility that A.I. will not advance as quickly as expected.
"We have had to grapple with this. Is this thing real or not?" said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers at Meta. "It is a great question because of all the dollars that are being thrown into this across the board."

What Economists Could Learn From 'Seinfeld': [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "It has sometimes been remarked that asking five economists a question will generate 10 different answers," Larry Summers, then the secretary of the Treasury, observed at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee nearly 25 years ago. On the issue the committee was discussing that day, however, "there has been only one answer." He was speaking of "welcoming China into the global economic system," which economists guaranteed would bring better jobs and greater prosperity to Americans.
It didn't work out as promised. Rather than improve the fortunes of American workers, globalization has encouraged companies to shift their production to countries where governments hand out favors and workers come cheap. U.S. industrial output has, at best, remained flat since the mid-2000s, and workers in the manufacturing sector have been getting less productive for more than a decade.
The United States has fallen behind China and others in fields from semiconductors to batteries to commercial airliners, just as business leaders like Andy Grove, Intel's chief executive back in its glory days, cautioned it would. The trade deficit has exploded, even in the advanced technology products that were supposed to benefit from access to new markets. Across the country, communities have collapsed, and deaths of despair have surged.
Which is why it's remarkable to see economists invoking the same faulty assumptions and models that got us into this mess, in order to make the case against Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, says they "would be a disaster" and "very, very bad." Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, calls them "lunacy" and "horrifying." All 39 academic economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal "strongly oppose" the idea.
It all makes me think of a situation in which George Costanza, the "Seinfeld" sad sack, finds himself in one episode. "It became very clear to me, sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong," he tells Jerry. "Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat -- it's all been wrong."
"If every instinct you have is wrong," Jerry reasons, "then the opposite would have to be right." So George decides to change course. Instead of his usual tuna on toast, he orders chicken salad on rye and immediately lands a date as a result. When interviewing with the New York Yankees, instead of praising George Steinbrenner's management, he launches into a critique and gets his dream job.
It would be wonderful to see economists willing to try a new course when the one they've pursued has failed so spectacularly for so long. Instead, they are doubling down on their mistakes.
Their most basic mistake is the continued reliance on the theory of comparative advantage. The theory, a mainstay of Econ 101 courses, says that countries should specialize in what they are relatively more efficient at and then benefit from trading the resulting output. An advanced economy like the United States might lose its textile manufacturing, say, but become the worldwide hub for the production of cutting-edge computer chips.
The theory works great in the classroom, but in reality it wasn't just T-shirts that ended up going overseas. The most sophisticated industries have left, too. The United States ran consistent trade surpluses in advanced technology products until China joined the World Trade Organization. In 2002, that surplus flipped to a deficit that in 2023 exceeded $ 200 billion, with the United States importing more than $ 3 of advanced tech products for every $ 2 it exported.
To spin this failure, some free traders have tried reframing their case in terms of individual freedom. Thus, "real globalization" is not "container ships, wonky terms like trade deficit or dry governmental agreements"; it is "billions of humans freely cooperating for mutual gain," according to a new project from the libertarian Cato Institute. Similarly, the University of Michigan professor Betsey Stevenson, formerly a member of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, tried to reassure MSNBC viewers in November that "it's not countries that trade; it's people that trade," adding: "I get a great new beverage refrigerator from China, and they maybe get some economic services from me or some insight into economics. That's trading."
It would be surprising if many of the Uyghurs performing forced labor in the supply chains of China's refrigerator exporters are doing so in return for economic advice from Ms. Stevenson.
Our enormous trade imbalance can exist only because a large share of the foreign goods entering the United States are never exchanged for American-made goods. Rather, each year we let other countries gobble up another $ 1 trillion of our real estate, corporations and i.o.u.s, promising that we will pay someday. As Warren Buffett once warned, "We have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own." In the process, we've erased millions of livelihoods.
Economists don't know what to make of these imbalances. "Foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting," the Federal Reserve governor Edward Gramlich assured the world back in 2004. Jason Furman, a colleague of Ms. Stevenson's at the White House, went further, recently declaring that "economists understand imports are actually the good thing that is what we enjoy, it's the benefit we get from trade. Exports are the unfortunate thing we do just so we can get those desirable imports." The fewer manufacturing jobs in the United States, by this logic, the better.
Committed to their discredited framework, economists continue to rely on the models built on it. The Peterson Institute, for instance, uses a model known as G-Cubed to predict that the United States would suffer higher prices, lower incomes and reduced manufacturing output if it withdrew the permanent normal trade relations granted to China in 2000. Economists have been using that model since the 1990s to produce studies guaranteeing that free trade will always work out well for all sides. The Budget Lab at Yale has produced its own negative assessments of Mr. Trump's proposals using the Global Trade Analysis Project model, which one recent Federal Reserve study warned "had essentially zero predictive accuracy" in its efforts at forecasting results from previous trade deals.
As the hit man Anton Chigurh asks his next victim, Carson Wells, in Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men," "If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?"
Few things are harder to change than the minds of experts who have staked their reputations on a particular theory. Even in the most objective fields, the physicist Max Planck observed, "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it." Fortunately, a democracy does not have to wait so long.
Oren Cass is the chief economist at American Compass, a conservative economic think tank, and writes the newsletter Understanding America.

Hedlyne Goes For Maximum of Two Lines
The Biden administration brought new, sweeping accusations of fraud on Friday against three of the largest banks in the country -- but President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration will have the opportunity to drop the case as soon as next month.
The allegations involve Zelle, the money transfer app that is co-owned by seven of the nation's largest banks and competes with Venmo, Cash App and other smartphone-based payment apps. As has been regularly reported, Zelle is a hotbed for scammers, and the lawsuit on Friday from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said more than $ 800 million had been swindled from clients of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
While fraud on Zelle can involve any number of complicated steps, it can be as simple as a grifter's convincing an individual to send payment for an item, such as concert tickets, and then failing to deliver the promised good or service. Banks have long argued they aren't responsible for reimbursing such losses to customers who voluntarily transfer money out of personal accounts, but the consumer bureau said they ought to be. In a 91-page complaint submitted in Arizona federal court, it laid out some of what it said were hundreds of thousands of instances of fraud enabled by the three banks.
"What they built became a gold mine for criminals -- a system that made it easy for fraudsters to move money quickly while making it nearly impossible for customers to get their money back," the agency's director, Rohit Chopra, said.
The lawsuit was the latest in what has become a late blitz of action from the consumer bureau, one of the more hated agencies for many Republicans, who argue that it is reflexively anti-business. This month, the incoming chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, unsuccessfully called for the bureau to pause its rule making until Mr. Trump takes office.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that it was finalizing an award of up to $ 4.745 billion to South Korea's Samsung Electronics and up to $ 1.61 billion for Texas Instruments to expand chips production.
The Samsung award is about $ 1.7 billion smaller than the preliminary award announced in April of up to $ 6.4 billion and reflects its revised smaller investment plans, the department said.
A Commerce spokesperson said the department "changed this award to align with market conditions and the scope of the investment the company is making. Samsung feels that this award represents a strong commitment to their Texas and U.S. efforts and is a sustainable long-term plan for them."
In April, administration officials said Samsung planned to invest roughly $ 45 billion to build two chip production facilities, a research center and a packaging facility by 2030. On Friday, Commerce said Samsung plans to invest $ 37 billion and complete the projects by the end of the decade.
Samsung did not immediately comment but Samsung Electronics executive Young Hyun Jun said in a statement released by Commerce that the agreement "represents another milestone as we continue to invest and build a state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem in the U.S."
Texas Instruments has pledged to investment more than $ 18 billion through 2029 in two new factories in Texas and one in Utah, which are expected to create 2,000 manufacturing jobs. The company is getting $ 900 million for its Texas operations and $ 700 million.
Congress in August 2022 approved a $ 39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $ 75 billion in government lending authority.
Last month, Commerce finalized an award of up to $ 7.86 billion for Intel down from $ 8.5 billion announced in March after the California-based chips maker won a separate $ 3 billion award from the Pentagon. REUTERS

In 1996, years before helping to found the experimental rock institution Animal Collective, David Portner and Brian Weitz were Baltimore high school pals who diligently hunted for the soundtrack album that perfectly meshed their love of the unorthodox sound worlds of musique concrète and the thrills of horror movies: "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." "It wasn't really till years later that I found out that it had never been released," Portner said.
"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" changed the horror business when it splattered out in 1974, turning a spartan budget into a $ 30 million juggernaut and laying groundwork for the blood-soaked slasher genre that dominated the 1980s. Among its many innovations was its unconventional score, an abstract suite of bone-chilling scrapes, metallic clanks, ominous drones and mysterious stingers.
This symphony of discordance, recorded by the film's director Tobe Hooper and the sound man Wayne Bell, emerged three full years before the first commercially available industrial music from Throbbing Gristle. It anticipated the tape-traded noise music underground that flourished in places like Japan in the 1990s and the American Midwest in the '00s. But with the master tapes ostensibly lost and Hooper seemingly uninterested in an official release, the "Chain Saw" score survived mostly as a bootleg, often just the entire 83-minute film dubbed to audio cassette from a VHS or Laserdisc.
That half-century of tape hiss and YouTube rips will end in March with a vinyl release on the boutique soundtrack label Waxwork Records. (Pre-orders start this week.)
"It was kind of like a holy grail. Was it even possible to do it?" said the Waxwork co-founder Kevin Bergeron, who had been doggedly pursuing the release for more than a decade. "Everyone has asked. Literally every label from Sony to Waxwork. Major labels to independents to randos living with their parents. Everyone wanted to release it. What would it take to make it happen? No one had any sort of intel, like what would it cost or what would it take."
Bell had held on to a few of the original tapes, but a majority were assumed lost. After the success of "Chain Saw," Hooper left Austin for Hollywood, leaving behind a storage shed full of personal effects. But the "Chain Saw" tapes were not absorbing water damage or rotting away in some hot Texas garage: They would be quietly donated to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, lovingly archived alongside Albert Einstein's notes, a Frida Kahlo self-portrait and a Gutenberg Bible.
"Suddenly they're artifacts," Bell said in a recent video interview. "Sometimes you need to wear gloves to handle this stuff. So the idea of threading it up on a machine and listening to exactly know what you've got? I just had to go by what little notes I had in 1974 and, by eye, just recognizing my handwriting and remembering what tapes we had." He finally got to hear the digitized version of their audio this year.
With $ 16 in his bank account, Bergeron first reached out to Bell in 2013, before Waxwork even stamped its first LP. After years playing guitar in horror-centric punk and thrash bands, Bergeron started Waxwork with his girlfriend, Sue Ellen Soto, with the idea of becoming the "Criterion Collection of soundtracks" by releasing albums with newly commissioned artwork, liner notes from the filmmakers and whimsically colored vinyl. Bergeron sent almost-monthly correspondence to Bell for a decade. All emails to Hooper, up to his death in 2017, went unanswered.
"A big pitch of mine was, 'Look, there's a lot of parallels between how we conduct business and how you guys conduct business,"' said Bergeron, who sees a corollary between Waxwork's D.I.Y. ethic and the spirit of idealistic hippies in the desert cobbling together a horror movie. "I would hate to see this precious thing that they've guarded for 50 years get in the hands of a major or someone that's going to do some Hollywood accounting and rip people off."
Getting the requisite tapes and permissions was an odyssey, but making a coherent album from them would prove a different challenge entirely. As an editor, Bell, 73, is now a seasoned veteran with credits on more than a dozen Richard Linklater movies. He said the estimated 10 to 12 hours of sound on the "Chain Saw" tapes was of good fidelity and would allow the listener to "really hear into this music." However, nothing was mixed down. This meant a three-month process of reconstructing the familiar cacophony from the original raw materials, hand-scrawled notes and 50-year-old memories.
"It's putting together a thousand-piece puzzle of very similar-shaped and similar-looking pieces," he explained.
The tapes contained the sounds as they were originally recorded in the 1970s: Bell and Hooper experimenting and laughing on the carpeted floor of a spare bedroom belonging to the director's then-girlfriend, Paulette Gochnour. The body of an upright bass was used as a reverb chamber and its metal bridge served as a mount for a mobile made of can lids. Cymbals were scraped against the strings of a lap steel guitar. Lithography plates were flapped around like dish towels. Children's percussion instruments were chimed and rattled. When Bell heard Gochnour cooking with an 11-inch sauce pan, its bell-like tone inspired him to fill it halfway with water and strike it with a timpani mallet.
"Just because the sound comes from a stringed instrument, you could torture it such that you don't know that that's a string instrument or it doesn't necessarily sound musical," said Bell, who had already honed these techniques in playful jam sessions with Hooper. "Clearly these sounds had emotional properties, they made you think this or that, would trigger the mind. So it was a fertility that was right there already for us."
After these sounds were pieced together and matched with the grainy footage of Leatherface's murder spree, they took on a life that extended far beyond the borders of Texas. In '80s London, where "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was banned outright, the Iphar label sold cassette bootlegs of the score alongside first-generation extreme noise artists like Ramleh, S.P.K. and Consumer Electronics. Alternative metal bands in the '90s including Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson peppered their albums with "Chain Saw" dialogue and sounds. The fleet-fingered oddball guitarist Buckethead professed that he would solo over the drone feast that follows the actor William Vail getting bludgeoned to death with a hammer. The director Nicolas Winding Refn pushed the composer Cliff Martinez to put more "Chain Saw" influence in the game-changing synth soundtrack to "Drive" from 2011.
Aaron Dilloway, a solo artist and onetime member of the noise band Wolf Eyes, called the "Chain Saw" score "ground zero for noise music." He recorded the entire film to audio cassette and would play it in the van on Wolf Eyes tours, and once accompanied the rest of the band using "Chain Saw" audio played on a variable speed cassette player. (He accidentally concluded the set with an incredibly spooky recording of the actor Paul A. Partain's disembodied voice calling out for Jerry the van driver.)
"Nothing sounds like that. Nothing," Dilloway said of Hooper and Bell's score. "I mean, there's little bits and stuff here and there, but nothing's been able to get that screech like that -- eeeeeerrrgh. There's nothing else like it. And it's always just been stuck in my head. You want to strive for that. Make something as scary and as unique as that sound."
Portner, who records as Avey Tare, spent Animal Collective's earliest days in New York without a practice space or much room to hold instruments. "It was a way of seeing that you could make music with anything," he said of the score. "You could have as much of a dramatic effect or emotional effect just banging on pots and pans if that's all that was around."
With the official Waxwork release -- complete with two never-heard-before cues -- the "Chain Saw" score's legacy is secure, though its story may not be finished. Bell estimated that he had 95 percent of the material, but said there was still a single missing tape he would like to incorporate to complete the picture.
"There's a cue that I knew I didn't have," he explained, "and I didn't want to do an ersatz version of that. 'Cause it's very important that it be what 'Chain Saw' fans expect. I've felt a big responsibility to deliver this. A responsibility to myself and to Tobe and to the film, but also to the fans."
Starting in 2022, he even started appearing at horror conventions. He found the gaggle of cosplaying "Chain Saw" fans to be interesting and likable.
Said Bell with a laugh, "I've never been around so many Leatherfaces in my life."

China Opens Investigation Into Nvidia For Antitrust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The move by Chinese regulators came a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced U.S. technology to China.
China's antimonopoly regulator announced on Monday that it was investigating potential violations of antitrust law by Nvidia, the American company that makes a vast majority of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems.
The inquiry, a rare move by Beijing, comes a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced American technology to China. In the days since, the Chinese government announced that it would ban the export of several rare minerals to the United States and imposed sanctions on more than a dozen U.S. defense firms and defense industry executives.
Together, the moves by Beijing signal its willingness to engage in supply chain warfare as the policy contest over trade and the control of technology escalates between the world's two largest economies.
The battle has made A.I. chips into one of the world's most sought-after technologies, and Nvidia has cornered the market, accounting for 90 percent of global sales by the end of last year. Nvidia's dominance helped it become one of the most valuable companies in the world over the past year.
Graham Webster, an academic focused on geopolitics and technology at Stanford University, said China had a variety of tools it could use to go after foreign companies and show its opposition to U.S. policy. "Nvidia is a pretty obvious target," he added.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday that it was investigating Nvidia for violating commitments made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company that makes computer networking equipment. The Chinese regulator approved Nvidia's acquisition of the company in 2020 with conditions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China.
Nvidia said in a statement that it was "happy to answer" questions from China's regulators. "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," the statement said.
As the Biden administration has progressively tightened restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China, the company has responded by offering less powerful versions of its chips to the Chinese market.
Officials in Washington, in trying to prevent Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and the machines to make them, say that the technology is essential not just for smartphones and chatbots but also for military superiority.
Chinese tech companies have resorted to stockpiling the chips, while also turning to smugglers and front companies to secure supplies. At the same time, Beijing is pouring large sums of money into its own chip companies in an attempt to make its tech sector less reliant on foreign technology.
"Well before the Biden administration, the Chinese government wanted greater self-reliance on key technologies," said Mr. Webster, a scholar at the program on geopolitics, technology and governance at Stanford.
The Biden administration has been considering further restrictions on global sales of A.I. chips that could affect Nvidia and its competitors. One new rule could impose more requirements on companies from the United States and other countries when shipping advanced A.I. chips to China, to try to ensure they are not breaking existing U.S. rules, according to two people familiar with the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The new rule would build on letters that the U.S. government sent to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, two of the world's largest chip companies, ordering them to stop sending advanced chips to China. The Biden administration had discovered that TSMC made some components for A.I. chips produced by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, in violation of export controls.
Another pending rule from Washington could impose licensing requirements and caps on the number of chips that could be sold in certain countries, as well as security standards for those buying larger clusters of A.I. chips.
Alan Estevez, a U.S. Department of Commerce official who oversees export controls, declined to comment on the pending rules, but said that the department was continuing to investigate how TSMC chips could end up in Huawei's A.I. products.
The Chinese government's antitrust investigation of Nvidia is not the first time Beijing has targeted American chipmakers.
In October, a think tank with ties to China's internet regulatory agency called for a review of Intel, the American tech company, for selling products that "constantly harmed" China's national security and interests. The last company subject to a cybersecurity review was the American chip maker Micron, which was ultimately cut off from supplying chips to a significant portion of the Chinese market. Another American chipmaker, Qualcomm, paid a $ 975 million fine in 2015 after the Chinese government investigated it for antimonopoly violations.
Last week, Chinese industry groups representing companies in a range of business sectors, including semiconductors and auto manufacturing, called for Chinese companies to purchase more chips domestically or from countries other than the United States.
"American chip products are no longer safe and reliable, and related Chinese industries will have to be cautious in purchasing American chips," the China Semiconductor Industry Association said, following the U.S. decision to impose export controls.
As Nvidia has grown, revenue from China has become less important to the company overall. During its most recent fiscal year, Nvidia's sales there fell to 14 percent of its total business from 19 percent.
But no Chinese company has been able to make chips as advanced as Nvidia's.
"China still wants Nvidia technology, in part or in whole," said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies. "Its market share dominance was well established in China long before export controls."
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Nvidia's sales practices and its most recent acquisitions. The U.S. inquiry is largely concerned with the company's power to determine how a scarce but essential technology is being allocated.
Competitors and customers around the world have complained about Nvidia's ownership of critical pieces of the A.I. supply chain. In addition to making the chips crucial to building A.I. systems, the company controls software that manages data centers and sells some of the leading equipment that controls high-performance computers.

Full text: In 2019, a team of Google researchers said they had built a machine capable of performing tasks that were not possible with traditional supercomputers. They described this machine, called a quantum computer, as a turning point in the evolution of information technology.
Some scientists disputed the claim. In the years since, as traditional supercomputers grew more powerful, they matched the feats of Google's quantum computer.
On Monday, Google unveiled a new quantum computer that may end this back-and-forth race with traditional machines and that points to a future in which quantum computers could drive advances in areas like drug discovery and artificial intelligence.
Google said its quantum computer, based on a computer chip called Willow, needed less than five minutes to perform a mathematical calculation that one of the world's most powerful supercomputers could not complete in 10 septillion years, a length of time that exceeds the age of the known universe.
Quantum computing -- the result of decades of research into a type of physics called quantum mechanics -- is still an experimental technology. But Google's achievement shows that scientists are steadily improving techniques that could allow quantum computing to live up to the enormous expectations that have surrounded this big idea for decades.
"When quantum computing was originally envisioned, many people -- including many leaders in the field -- felt that it would never be a practical thing," said Mikhail Lukin, a professor of physics at Harvard and a co-founder of the quantum computing start-up QuEra. "What has happened over the last year shows that it is no longer science fiction."
Many other tech giants, including Microsoft, Intel and IBM, are building similar technology as the United States jockeys with China for supremacy in this increasingly important field. As the United States has pushed forward, primarily through corporate giants and start-up companies, the Chinese government has said it is pumping more than $ 15.2 billion into quantum research.
The mathematical calculation performed by Google's machine was a test designed solely to gauge the progress of quantum computing -- not a task that could be useful in other fields, like medicine. Though researchers believe that quantum computers will one day make today's classical machines look archaic, the technology still makes too many mistakes to be truly useful.
Google's quantum computer also uses a form of error correction -- a way of reducing mistakes -- that could allow this kind of machine to reach its potential. In a research paper published on Monday in the science journal Nature, Google said its machine had surpassed the "error correction threshold," a milestone that scientists have been working toward for decades.
That means quantum computers are on a path to a moment, still well into the future, when they can overcome their mistakes and perform calculations that could accelerate the progress of drug discovery. They could also break the encryption that protects computers vital to national security.
"What we really want these machines to do is run applications that people really care about," said John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology who specializes in quantum computing. "Though it still might be decades away, we will eventually see the impact of quantum computing on our everyday lives."
A traditional computer like a laptop or a smartphone stores numbers in silicon chips and manipulates those numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on. It performs these calculations by processing "bits" of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.
But a quantum computer defies common sense. It relies on the mind-bending ways that some objects behave at the subatomic level or when exposed to extreme cold, like the exotic metal that Google chills to nearly 460 degrees below zero inside its quantum computer.
Quantum bits, or "qubits," behave very differently from normal bits. A single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time when it is either extremely small or extremely cold. By harnessing that behavior, scientists can build a qubit that holds a combination of 1 and 0. This means that two qubits can hold four values at once. And as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.
Scientists first proposed this kind of machine in the 1980s. But qubits are fragile, which means that stringing even a few of them together requires years of work.
Labs in academia, industry and government have used a wide variety of techniques to build these machines, including systems based on particles of light or tiny charged particles trapped in electromagnetic fields. Like IBM and Intel, Google builds "superconducting qubits," where certain metals are cooled to extremely low temperatures.
With its latest superconducting computer, Google has claimed "quantum supremacy," meaning it has built a machine capable of tasks that are beyond what any traditional computer can do. But these tasks are esoteric. They involve generating random numbers that can't necessarily be applied to practical applications, like drug discovery.
Google and its rivals are still working toward what scientists call "quantum advantage," when a quantum computer can accelerate the progress of other fields like chemistry and artificial intelligence or perform tasks that businesses or consumers find useful. The problem is that quantum computers still make too many errors.
But scientists have spent nearly three decades developing techniques -- which are mind-bending in their own right -- for getting around this problem. Now, Google has shown that as it increases the number of qubits, it can exponentially reduce the number of errors through complex analysis.
Experts believe it is only a matter of time before a quantum computer reaches its vast potential.
"People no longer doubt it will be done," Dr. Lukin said. "The question now is: When?"

Intel Names 2 to Board Amid C.E.O. Search
Intel on Thursday named two chip industry veterans to its board on Thursday, as the struggling semiconductor firm looks for a new top boss after the recent ouster of Pat Gelsinger.
The chipmaker said Eric Meurice, former C.E.O. of chip-making equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim C.E.O. of Microchip Technology, are the new additions to its board. Both previously worked at Intel.
Intel has struggled to keep up with advanced chip-making, falling well behind rivals such as Nvidia in designing chips that power artificial intelligence and TSMC in making smaller and more efficient semiconductors.
Mr. Gelsinger, whose removal as C.E.O. was announced on Monday, was supposed to restore Intel's lead in chip-making, but his costly bet on contract manufacturing has seen the company shrink to a market value more than 30 times smaller than Nvidia. REUTERS

Kroger Beats Estimates,
But Its Outlook Narrows
Kroger topped quarterly same-store sales expectations on Thursday, benefiting from a surge in customers shopping at its stores and online.
The grocer, which competes with giants like Walmart and Amazon.com, has been ramping up its e-commerce investments to keep pace with customers who prefer shopping online.
Kroger rivaled Walmart's Thanksgiving deals with its own holiday offers. It sold Thanksgiving meals for less than $ 5 and launched a 12-day deal offering.
Kroger's third-quarter identical sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.3 percent, beating expectations of a 1.77 percent rise, according to data compiled by LSEG, while its adjusted earnings per share of 98 cents was in line with estimates.
But the chain narrowed its annual forecasts, saying annualized sales will be about $ 3 billion lower because of the sale of its specialty pharmacy unit. REUTERS

E.V. Reliability Improves, But Lags Gas Models
The reliability of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids has dramatically improved, narrowing a wide gap with gas-powered automobiles, according to the latest survey by Consumer Reports.
But vehicles with internal combustion engines and gas-electric hybrids are still far more dependable, the survey found.
Consumer Reports subscribers, who filled out surveys during much of 2024, reported that electric vehicles had 42 percent more problems than gas autos on average. But that was down from 79 percent more in the 2023 survey. The survey released Thursday measured reliability of vehicles mainly from the 2022, 2023 and 2024 model years.
Plug-ins had 70 percent more problems than gas vehicles, but that was less than half the difference found in last year's survey.
Consumer Reports said its survey found that Subaru was the most reliable brand for the first time. ASSOCIATED PRESS

China Escalates Tech War With Ban on Rare Mineral Exports to the U.S.: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The move escalates supply chain warfare and comes a day after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced American technology to China.
China said on Tuesday that it would begin banning the export of several rare minerals to the United States, an escalation of the tech war between the world's two biggest powers. The move comes a day after the Biden administration tightened Chinese access to advanced American technology.
The ban signals Beijing's willingness to engage in supply chain warfare by blocking the export of important components used to make valuable products, like weaponry and semiconductors.
Sales of gallium, germanium, antimony and so-called superhard materials to the United States would be halted immediately on the grounds that they have dual military and civilian uses, China's Ministry of Commerce said. The export of graphite would also be subject to stricter review.
China is central to many global supply chains, but it generally refrained from clamping down on its own exports during the first Trump administration, preferring instead to take more limited actions like buying soybeans from Brazil instead of the United States. But senior Chinese officials are worried that President-elect Donald J. Trump plans more stringent policies during his coming term in office.
Mr. Trump has promised to put hefty tariffs on goods from China and further sever the trading relationship between the countries. The move on Tuesday -- one of the most aggressive steps China has taken to counter increasingly restrictive policies from the U.S. government -- could foreshadow more economic conflict as Mr. Trump enters the White House.
China produces nearly all the world's supply of critical minerals needed to make advanced technologies such as semiconductors. Beijing has been tightening its grip on the materials to retaliate for clampdowns on American technology exports to China over the past two years.
China created a legal framework last year for controlling exports of gallium and germanium, which are used in semiconductors, and on Sept. 15 China added antimony, which is used in military explosives. In October, China began requiring its exporters of rare earth metals, used in everything from advanced semiconductors to smart bombs, to disclose, step by step, how the minerals would be used in Western supply chains.
China's exports of gallium and germanium briefly halted a year ago until officials in Beijing devised a system for approving such transactions. Shipments to the United States have never fully recovered, forcing the United States to rely more on the purchase of semi-processed materials from other countries like Japan that buy directly from China.
The move by China on Tuesday echoed an unannounced embargo on exports of rare earth metals to Japan that Beijing imposed for two months in 2010 during a territorial dispute between the countries. That embargo produced considerable distress among manufacturers in Japan worried about dwindling supplies, because China provides as much as 99 percent of the world's supply of some rare earth metals.
The United States could be somewhat less vulnerable to China's measures now than Japan was then. Many chemical factories in the United States have closed in recent decades, so the country already buys semi-processed materials from countries other than China.
The Chinese ban on superhard mineral exports could provoke particular unhappiness in America's national security community. That ban appeared to be aimed at Chinese exports of tungsten, which is vital for making armor-piercing bullets and shells, said Oliver Friesen, the chief executive of Guardian Metal Resources, a London company that is planning to mine tungsten in Nevada.
It will take close to three years to establish a new tungsten mine in Nevada, he said, adding: "We're moving things along quite quickly."
When the Biden administration broadened tariffs in September that Mr. Trump imposed in his first term, it added a 25 percent tariff on imports of tungsten from China -- part of an effort to persuade tungsten users in the United States to find more dependable suppliers elsewhere.
Even before China instituted the ban Tuesday, it had begun limiting its overall antimony exports tightly enough that global prices for the material have doubled in the past three months.
According to the United States Geological Survey, China has been supplying 54 percent of the germanium used by the United States, a material used in infrared technology and fiber optics.
The United States has not mined its own gallium, used in semiconductors, since 1987. Japan supplies 26 percent of American imports of gallium, China 21 percent and Germany 19 percent, along with several smaller suppliers.
Halting exports of critical minerals can backfire. After China temporarily halted exports to Japan in 2010, the Japanese government helped Lynas, a company in Australia, to develop a large rare earth metals mine there as an alternative supplier.
On Monday, the Biden administration expanded its curbs on technology to China by prohibiting the sale of certain types of chips and machinery and adding more than 100 Chinese companies to a restricted-trade list. American officials characterized the limits as a routine action to update the existing curbs and close loopholes that some businesses had used to circumvent prohibitions.
It was the third significant action in the past three years in the Biden administration's bid to prevent China from catching up to the United States in cutting-edge technologies. The Biden administration has steadily expanded other restrictions on doing business with China, like curbing U.S. investment in certain Chinese industries, and blocking Chinese electric vehicles out of concern their operating systems could share data with Beijing.
Mr. Trump has promised his own aggressive measures that would further cut down on trade between the countries. For example, he campaigned on a promise to add tariffs of 60 percent or more on Chinese products and remove so-called permanent normal trade relations with China, which would also result in higher tariffs on Chinese goods.
China criticized the technology curbs by the United States, calling them "illegal."
"Such practices seriously undermine the international economic and trade order, disrupt the stability of global production and the supply chain, and harms the interests of all countries," said Lin Jian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In response to U.S. technology curbs, Chinese industry groups representing business sectors, including semiconductors and auto manufacturing, also released statements on Tuesday calling for Chinese companies to purchase more chips domestically or from countries other than the United States.
"American chip products are no longer safe and reliable, and related Chinese industries will have to be cautious in purchasing American chips," the China Semiconductor Industry Association said.
These associations include some of the world's largest consumers of semiconductors, so the warning could have financial implications for U.S. chip makers.
U.S. companies like Micron and Intel were previously targeted by national security investigations in China that threatened to cut them off from a major market. Chinese government officials have also been discouraged from using foreign-made devices, threatening Apple's market share.
In a statement, John Neuffer, the president of the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association, said that the group was evaluating the impact of the proposals and that "any claims that American chips are 'no longer safe or reliable' are simply inaccurate."
The association had "long urged that export controls should be narrow and targeted to meet specific national security objectives," he said. "We encourage both governments to avoid further escalation."

Intel's Chief Executive Is Out Amid Chipmaker's Struggles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pat Gelsinger stepped down after nearly four years at the helm of the onetime highflying company, Intel said Monday.
Over the weekend, Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, was given a choice by the company's board of directors: Resign or be fired.
Intel's board had concluded that Mr. Gelsinger had to depart after his plans to turn around the iconic semiconductor maker were not showing results quickly enough, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Other challenges had piled up, with the company's stock plunging more than 50 percent this year.
On Monday, Intel announced that Mr. Gelsinger had retired as of Dec. 1. The 63-year-old Intel veteran, who took the helm in 2021 after an 11-year absence from the company, also resigned from the board. He will be replaced for now by two executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the company said, adding that it would continue its search for a permanent chief executive.
The abrupt change was the latest sign of the 56-year-old company's fall from grace. Intel was one of the pioneers that gave Silicon Valley its name and for years was one of the world's best-known tech names. But the company has been mired in recent years in innovation struggles and has ceded ground to rivals including Nvidia, the reigning maker of artificial intelligence chips.
"We have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence," Frank Yeary, who will serve as interim executive chair on Intel's board, said in a statement.
Mr. Gelsinger said in the statement that the move was bittersweet. "It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics," he added.
Bloomberg earlier reported some details of Mr. Gelsinger's exit.
Intel's struggles reached the point this year that Wall Street analysts began considering it a potential takeover candidate or a target for a breakup. The change also came amid signs that the company's latest production process, a technology at the center of Mr. Gelsinger's turnaround plan, might not restore Intel to a leadership position next year as he promised.
Intel, which makes chips that handle calculations in a majority of the world's computers, lost its lead in developing manufacturing technology to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company toward the end of the last decade. It also missed out on supplying processors for mobile phones and, more recently, the booming market for A.I. applications.
Mr. Gelsinger embarked on an ambitious plan to introduce five new production processes in four years while remaking Intel as a manufacturer for other chip designers, as well as producing its own products. He also spent much of his time pushing the Biden administration and Congress to pass the CHIPS Act, which was designed to encourage more U.S. production of the foundational silicon components.
As part of that lobbying effort, Mr. Gelsinger committed to building new U.S. factories and promised that Intel would catch up to TSMC's technology by 2025.
But Mr. Gelsinger also hired aggressively as Intel's latest microprocessors ran into slower demand and stiff competition. Revenue plunged more than 30 percent from 2021 through 2023. In October, the company posted a $ 16.6 billion quarterly loss, the biggest in its history.
Along the way, Intel's market valuation withered as Nvidia turned into one of the world's most valuable companies.
Mr. Gelsinger, acknowledging that Intel's costs and revenue were out of balance, announced 15,000 job cuts. After a board meeting in September, he announced further belt tightening, including delaying plans for a new factory in Germany.
Mr. Gelsinger said that month that he still had the board's support. But Mr. Yeary's statement suggested that the board was not satisfied with Intel's focus on making its chips more competitive with offerings from Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices.
"As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do," Mr. Yeary wrote. "Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them."
Part of that effort will be elevating Ms. Holthaus, who rose through Intel's sales and marketing ranks to be an executive vice president of its client computing group. She was named chief executive of Intel products on Monday.
Mr. Zinsner, who will help run Intel during a transition period, was hired in January 2022 as chief financial officer after a stint at Micron Technology.
Intel's shares rose about 5 percent in premarket trading after the company announced Mr. Gelsinger's exit, but ended the day down less than 1 percent.
Mr. Gelsinger first joined Intel in 1979, eventually ascending to become the company's chief technology officer during his initial 30-year stint at the chipmaker. That tenure coincided with the era when Intel grew into the dominant supplier of chips for personal computers and, later, the server systems that power the internet.
Mr. Gelsinger later left Intel, eventually leading the software maker VMware before rejoining Intel in early 2021. He vowed to restore the company's engineering-led corporate culture that was instilled by Andy Grove, the onetime Intel chief who died in 2016.
But that culture had always bound Intel too closely to its lucrative franchise in chips for computers, making it difficult to move into new markets. Mr. Gelsinger's style and some of his tactics also did not sit well with some Intel engineering leaders, who complained privately that he had lost touch with industry changes and put too much emphasis on building new factories rather than Intel's products.
His crusade to create new manufacturing processes, which determine the computing power of chips, also ran into problems.
Some customers were recently informed by Intel that its most advanced manufacturing processes, which it calls 18a and 16a, were far behind TSMC, a chip industry official briefed on Intel's progress said. TSMC is producing 30 percent of its leading-edge chips, known as 2 nanometer chips, without any flaws, while Intel's new process produces less than 10 percent of its 18a chips without flaws, the person said.
The difference in the production quality between TSMC and Intel means that customers would have to spend more money with Intel to produce the same number of chips, so it makes more sense to choose TSMC.
An Intel spokeswoman said the new manufacturing processes were meeting the company's expectations and progressing on schedule.
Mr. Gelsinger's turnaround plan partly hinged on the U.S. government's providing financial support for its manufacturing expansion. As the Biden administration pushed the CHIPS Act, Mr. Gelsinger pledged to spend $ 100 billion in the next five years on U.S. manufacturing, including building two plants in Ohio.
In March, the Biden administration made an initial commitment of $ 8.5 billion to support Intel's plan in Ohio, as well as manufacturing expansions in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon. But when the government announced its ultimate grant last week, it reduced that total to $ 7.8 billion and said Intel would be spending $ 90 billion by the end of the decade, with only one plant slated to be completed in Ohio.
The deal with the Commerce Department includes restrictions that could affect Intel's ability to sell stakes in its chip-manufacturing unit if the company ceases to own at least 50.1 percent of that business. In some circumstances, the Commerce Department might have to approve external investment transactions involving the business, according to a securities filing. Such restrictions could hinder any spinoff of Intel's chip-making foundry business.
Some analysts and industry experts had also questioned Mr. Gelsinger's strategy of becoming a chip-making foundry for other companies while keeping that business a unit of Intel, rather than spinning it off entirely.
Former Intel board members, including Reed Hundt and David Yoffie, urged the company to split into two parts -- one for manufacturing chips, the other for designing them. They argued that potential chip designers that compete with Intel would shy away from using its manufacturing processes as part of a combined company.
Mr. Gelsinger had already announced plans to make Intel's chip-making business an independent subsidiary, arguing that the time was not right for a complete spinoff. His departure suggested that the structure of Intel's business could be reconsidered.
Intel said on Monday that the leadership structure of its foundry business would remain unchanged.
"Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability," Mr. Yeary said.
Analysts said they were more surprised by the timing of the announcement than by Mr. Gelsinger's departure. The main question, they said, is what comes next.
"There don't seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride," Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note on Monday.

Rising Tech Stocks Send Wall Street to Another Record: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Technology stocks pulled Wall Street to another record amid a mixed Monday of trading.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent from its high set on Friday to post a record for the 54th time this year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128 points, or 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent.
Super Micro Computer, a stock that's been on an A.I.-driven roller coaster, soared 28.7 percent to lead the market.
Following allegations of misconduct and the resignation of its public auditor, the maker of servers used in artificial-intelligence technology said an investigation found no evidence of misconduct by its management or by the company's board. It also said that it doesn't expect to restate its past financials and that it will find a new chief financial officer, appoint a general counsel and strengthen its governance.
Big Tech stocks also helped prop up the market. Gains of 1.8 percent for Microsoft and 3.2 percent for Meta Platforms were the two strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.
Intel was another propellant in the morning, but it lost an early gain to fall 0.5 percent after the chip company said its chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, has retired and stepped down from the board. Intel is looking for Mr. Gelsinger's replacement, and its chair said it's "committed to restoring investor confidence." Intel recently lost its spot in the Dow Jones industrial average to Nvidia, which has skyrocketed in the frenzy around A.I.
Stellantis, meanwhile, skidded after the announcement of its chief executive's departure. Carlos Tavares stepped down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citroën and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales and an inventory backlog at dealerships. The world's fourth-largest auto maker's stock fell 6.3 percent in Milan.
The majority of stocks in the S&P 500 likewise fell.
Retailers were mixed amid what's expected to be the best Cyber Monday on record and coming off Black Friday. Target, which recently gave a forecast for the holiday season that left investors discouraged, fell 1.2 percent. Walmart, which gave a more optimistic forecast, rose 0.2 percent.
Amazon, which looks to benefit from online sales from Cyber Monday, climbed 1.4 percent.
The stock market largely took Donald J. Trump's latest threat on tariffs in stride. The president-elect on Saturday threatened 100 percent tariffs against a group of developing economies if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. Trump said he wants the group, headlined by Brazil, Russia, India and China, to promise it won't create a new currency or otherwise try to undercut the U.S. dollar.
The dollar has been the currency of choice for global trade. Speculation has also been around a long time that other currencies could knock it off its mantel, but no contender has come close.
The U.S. dollar's value rose Monday against several other currencies, but one of its strongest moves likely had less to do with the tariff threats. The euro fell amid a political battle in Paris over the French government's budget. The euro sank 0.7 percent against the U.S. dollar and broke below $ 1.05.
In the bond market, Treasury yields gave up early gains to hold relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed above 4.23 percent during the morning before falling back to 4.17 percent. That was just below its level of 4.18 percent late Friday.
A report showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted again last month, but not by as much as economists expected.
This week will bring the October job openings report, weekly unemployment benefits data and the November jobs report. They could steer the next moves for Federal Reserve, which recently began pulling interest rates lower to support the economy.
Economists expect Friday's headliner report to show U.S. employers accelerated their hiring in November.

Shouldn't Ireland Be the Happiest Country in Europe?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ireland's current condition might best be described as an embarrassment of riches. A country that was long one of the poorest in Western Europe now has an abundance of public and private wealth and an economy that is open to the world. It has even proved relatively resistant to the temptation of the far right that has proved so appealing elsewhere; perhaps nostalgia for an imagined golden age doesn't hold much appeal when memories of poverty, mass emigration and the repression imposed by conservative Catholicism are so fresh in the minds of a well-educated, socially liberal population.
But as Ireland gets ready to go to the polls for a general election on Friday, it's apparent that there are the same dark subplots here that have made the position of other incumbent governments across the democratic world so precarious.
If politics were a numbers game, the current Irish government -- a coalition between the two traditional center-right parties, Fine Gael (led by the current prime minister, Simon Harris) and Fianna Fail, along with the Green Party -- would be the surefire winner. A decade ago, there were around two million people at work in the Irish economy. Now the number seems to be rising inexorably toward three million. Unemployment is at historically low levels, and government debt as a proportion of the size of the economy is less than half what it was in 2014.
But people don't vote for statistics, as the Democrats discovered, to their detriment, in the U.S. elections. The economics that matter most are those of daily life, and knowing that the country is doing well can make voters even more annoyed if they feel that they are missing out. In Ireland the sense of disconnection between the macro and micro is exacerbated by its peculiar path to riches: The great driver of its transformation is external. For U.S. multinationals looking for a base in the European Union, Ireland's low corporate tax rate, highly educated work force and stable politics, combined with the familiarity of the English language, a common law system and close historical and cultural ties, have exerted a magnetic attraction.
Think of an American multinational -- Apple, Pfizer, Meta, Microsoft, Intel, Boston Scientific -- and the chances are that it is one of the thousand or so U.S. companies with an Irish operation. These companies spend more than $ 40 billion a year in a country with a population of just over five million. To put that in context, the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Ireland in 2022 stood at $ 574 billion, roughly triple the total in China and India put together.
As well as paying a lot of wages, these companies give the Irish treasury a windfall of corporate taxes -- the full-year total could reach a new high of about 30 billion euros this year. With this much money coming in, the government has been able to live every politician's dream: cutting income taxes while increasing public spending and reducing debt. Instead of the hard choices that the leaders of most democracies feel obliged to offer their electorates, Ireland is coasting.
Envious readers might wonder why Ireland needs to have an election at all. Can't the politicians who have delivered these wonders simply be returned to office by acclamation? But the truth is that Ireland does not feel like a very happy place. Part of this is the frustration of fulfilled desires. Ireland has the two things its patriots dreamed of for centuries: political independence and economic prosperity. For a long time, we were an "if only" society -- if only the English had not colonized us, if only we were not so poor, if only the church had not become so overweeningly powerful. Those six little letters covered a multitude of failings. They don't anymore. Ireland's problems today stem from the collective choices it has freely made for itself.
For just as the country acts as a showpiece for the upsides of extreme globalization, it also demonstrates the downsides. Ireland's public services and infrastructure significantly lag its warp-speed economy, creating a place that feels somehow both overdeveloped and underdeveloped. And on its own, the globalized market economy does not produce the public goods necessary for a decent quality of life. Ireland may be awash with money, but its young people can no longer afford to buy homes; sky-high rents are making it impossible for many to live in the main cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway; homelessness and child poverty have risen; access to health care is uneven and uncertain; public transport and public schools are often overcrowded; physical infrastructure is seriously inadequate; and the pace of transition to a carbon-free economy has been painfully slow.
But nowhere is the gap between the glowing statistics and anxious feelings more evident than on the most basic issue of all, population growth. This ought to be an extremely good news story. Ireland's history of mass emigration left it with a strange legacy: It is the only developed country I know of whose population is still much lower than it was in 1840. But the past decade has seen a long overdue rebound, and now about one-fifth of those living in Ireland were born elsewhere. This is globalization in the flesh.
But for years the handling of this immigration -- especially of a large influx of refugees from Ukraine and asylum seekers from Asia and Africa -- has been somewhat chaotic. The failure of successive governments to adequately expand housing, infrastructure and public services has created a political opening for the far right and allowed the slogan "Ireland is full," to seem both absurd and credible. This is still one of the least densely populated countries in Western Europe, but it can seem badly congested.
Voters are expected to narrowly stay with the center-right coalition. (Irish people may find their pragmatic centrists a little dull, but there's nothing like watching the antics of some of the alternatives in the United States and Europe to remind you that dullness can have a lot to recommend it.) Hard-line nationalist groups and independents will probably make inroads -- not enough to affect the balance of power but sufficient to give them a foothold in mainstream politics.
The biggest loser could be Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which won the popular vote in the 2020 election. Already established as the largest party in Northern Ireland, it had high hopes of being able to lead the next government in Dublin, with promises to share the corporate tax windfall more equitably, fix the housing crisis and advance its cherished cause of a united Ireland. But it has been hurt by competition for anti-establishment votes from the far right and by a series of internal scandals.
What most Irish politicians, set on offering the electorate tax cuts and higher spending, are not talking about is the looming second Trump administration and the threat of a trade war between the United States and Europe that could catch Ireland in the middle. For now, they are pretending not to see what might be on that horizon.
Ireland has staked everything on globalization, a gamble that has so far returned handsome winnings. But there are no islands of contentment in oceans of political and economic turmoil.

China Sharpens Weapon for Possible Trade War: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A series of swipes at American companies show how China could take the initiative in a new trade war, using its economic dominance to exact pain.
In the world of cheap drones, Skydio was the great American hope. Its autonomous flying machines gave the U.S. defense and police agencies an alternative to Chinese manufacturers, free from the security concerns tied to dependence on Chinese supply chains.
But Skydio's vulnerabilities came into sharp focus days before the U.S. presidential election, when the Chinese authorities imposed sanctions and severed the company's access to essential battery supplies.
Overnight, the San Mateo, Calif.-based Skydio, the largest American maker of drones, scrambled to find new suppliers. The move slowed Skydio's deliveries to its customers, which include the U.S. military.
"This is an attack on Skydio, but it's also an attack on you," Adam Bry, the chief executive, told customers.
Behind the move was a message from China's leaders to Donald J. Trump, who would go on to win the election with a promise of new China sanctions and tariffs: Hit us and we'll strike back harder.
From the campaign trail to his cabinet appointments, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he believes a confrontation with China over trade and technology is inevitable. In the first Trump administration, the Chinese government took mostly symbolic and equivalent measures after U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions. This time, China is poised to escalate its responses, experts say, and could aim aggressive and targeted countermeasures at American companies.
"During Trade War 1.0, Beijing was fairly careful to meet the tariffs that the U.S. put in place," said Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "Now they are signaling their tolerance for accepting and dishing out pain," he said. "It's clear for political reasons that Beijing is not willing to stand by and watch as significant new waves of tariffs come in."
China has had time to prepare. During Mr. Trump's first term, officials in Beijing began drafting laws that mirror U.S. tactics, allowing them to create blacklists and impose sanctions on American companies, cutting them off from critical resources. The goal has been to use China's status as the world's factory floor to exact punishment.
Since 2019, China has created what it called an "unreliable entity list" to penalize companies that undermine national interests, introduced rules to punish firms that comply with U.S. restrictions on Chinese entities and expanded its export-control laws. The broader reach of these laws enables Beijing to potentially choke global access to critical materials like rare earths and lithium -- essential components in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles.
The new tools are part of what one Communist Party publication described as an effort to "provide legal support for countering hegemonism and power politics and safeguarding the interests of the country and the people."
Collectively, the strategy marks a calculated shift to counter Mr. Trump's expected policies when he takes office. The fallout could significantly disrupt operations for American companies.
That raises the stakes for businesses and the economy as the new U.S. administration readies its first salvo in what could become a more ruthless second round of trade conflict between the United States and China.
Washington's relationship with Beijing was already fraught. President Biden has largely continued Mr. Trump's confrontational policies, punishing some Chinese companies with sanctions and restricting others from the U.S. market. This month, the U.S. government announced a ban on 29 Chinese companies over connections to forced labor in the country's western region of Xinjiang.
On Monday, Mr. Trump went further. The president-elect said he would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on all products coming into the country from China.
China has given a preview of the lengths it is willing to go to counter U.S. government sanctions.
In September, China accused PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, of "discriminating" against products in Xinjiang and launched an investigation under its unreliable entities list framework. It was the first time that Beijing punished a foreign company for removing Xinjiang cotton from its supply chain to meet U.S. trade rules.
A few weeks later, a think tank with ties to China's internet regulatory agency called for a review of Intel, the American chip company, for selling products that "constantly harmed" China's national security and interests. The last company subject to a cybersecurity review, the American chip maker Micron, was ultimately cut off from supplying chips to a significant portion of the Chinese market.
The Chinese rules leave both PVH and Intel stuck in the tussle between the two global superpowers. Other companies might soon find themselves in a similar position. The conundrum for firms is whether and how to follow U.S. trade restrictions, when doing so could trigger Chinese reprisals.
Forcing companies to question their business practices might be China's intention, experts say. At the same time, Chinese officials need to strike a balance in their punishments. If they go too far in penalizing foreign companies, they could scare away investors when financial markets are worried about China's economy.
And in some cases, Chinese companies still need what the United States offers, including microchips in electronic devices or soybeans that Chinese farmers feed their cattle. Many of China's state-owned enterprises still use computers powered by Intel chips.
"They have this dilemma where they want to signal to the U.S. government but they don't want to scare foreign investors and companies too much," said Andrew Gilholm, a China expert at Control Risks, a consulting firm. "They want companies to know that there is a cost to being too enthusiastic about complying with U.S. and other regulations."
The strategy, he said, is evolving into one that looks more like "supply chain warfare."
Still, for the many companies that rely more on China than China does on them, Beijing has the ability to exact major pain. Skydio, the drone maker, had spent years building a supply chain outside China but remained reliant on the country for one crucial item: batteries.
After the sanctions by China, there is no quick fix. It can take months to make the necessary design changes and secure new suppliers. In a statement, Skydio said it would be forced to ration batteries. That means its customers, which include fire departments, can get only one battery per drone, severely limiting how long a craft can fly. The company said it planned to have new supplies by spring.
"If there was ever any doubt, this action makes clear that the Chinese government will use supply chains as a weapon to advance their interests over ours," Skydio wrote.
An editorial in Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party tabloid, celebrated the success of the sanctions on Skydio, noting in a headline, "U.S. company sanctioned by China 'cries out in pain,' revealing their American mask." The article said the reprisal was merited because Skydio was a part of U.S. government efforts to create a "non-red supply chain" outside China.
The solution for Skydio was simple, Global Times continued. Don't "serve as a tool for the United States to contain China" or "be prepared to bear the consequences of such actions."

Biden Cuts CHIPS Award For Intel by $600 Million: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Silicon Valley company will receive less money from the CHIPS Act after winning a $ 3 billion military contract and changing some of its investment commitments.
The Biden administration said Tuesday that it would award up to $ 7.86 billion in direct funding to Intel, with the U.S. chip giant set to receive at least $ 1 billion of that money before the end of the year.
The money is a reduction from Intel's preliminary award of $ 8.5 billion, which President Biden announced during a visit to the company's Arizona plant in March. The Commerce Department said it had reduced Intel's grant because the chip maker, the biggest recipient of money under the CHIPS Act, also received a $ 3 billion contract to make semiconductors domestically for the military.
But the Commerce Department also detailed in a project document that Intel, which is under financial pressure because of a sales slump, had extended timelines for some projects beyond a 2030 government deadline.
The company now plans to invest $ 90 billion in the United States by the end of the decade, after previously saying it would spend $ 100 billion over the next five years.
The Commerce Department said it would fund the first of two chip-making plants that the company was building in Ohio. In March, the department estimated that the two plants would create 10,000 jobs. It has since dropped that estimate by 3,500 jobs for a single plant being built before the end of the decade.
Commerce and Intel officials said those changes were not a factor in the final award.
The first plant in Ohio is now expected to be operational by 2030, a delay from the company's initial goal of starting production there in 2025. Intel said that it was still committed to building two plants in Ohio and that its projections for employing 10,000 or more people at the project had not changed.
Intel's shifting timeline and jobs projections speak to the challenges the Biden administration has run into as it tries to rev up domestic chip-making. The CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill passed in 2022, provided $ 39 billion to subsidize the construction of facilities to help the United States reduce its reliance on foreign production of the tiny, critical electronics that power everything from dishwashers to iPads.
Nailing down its CHIPS award has been a priority for Intel, which last month reported the biggest quarterly loss in the company's 56-year history. It has been cutting costs and fending off takeover interest from rivals, after the total value of the company fell to around $ 107 billion, from $ 500 billion in 2000. (Other chip makers have also been facing challenges, because of a cyclical slump in the industry.)
Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, called the award a "huge step forward in strengthening the U.S. semiconductor supply chain."
"After a 30-year dip, the industry is coming back, and these facilities are going to fundamentally change chip manufacturing and the strength of the chip industry in the U.S.," she said.
The Commerce Department has been rushing to firm up awards with companies and begin distributing the funds before the Trump administration takes office in January. Including Intel, it has now completed terms with six companies, to distribute more than $ 19 billion of the $ 39 billion it has to give out.
Ms. Raimondo said more awards would be on the way in coming weeks. The government will hand out the funds to the companies as they hit certain milestones, like finishing construction or producing wafers.
The Biden White House says the United States is now on track to produce 30 percent of the world's leading-edge chips by 2032.
Intel is the only U.S.-based company that manufactures leading-edge logic chips, and it has been central to the Biden administration's plans of revitalizing the industry. The company's recent financial struggles have stoked concern among some government officials and lawmakers, who want to support the company but also ensure that taxpayer money isn't wasted.
The Commerce Department said Intel was still on track to invest the full $ 100 billion it had previously committed to spend on projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. But the department was focused on funding investments that would occur before the end of the decade, which would be $ 90 billion of the total.
The department said Intel would receive nearly $ 3.94 billion for its projects in Arizona, $ 500 million for New Mexico, $ 1.5 billion for a major factory in Ohio and $ 1.86 billion for Oregon.

Full text: The Biden administration is reducing its award to the chip maker, partly to account for a multibillion-dollar military contract.
The Biden administration plans to reduce Intel's preliminary $ 8.5 billion federal CHIPS grant, a move that follows the California-based company's investment delays and broader business struggles.
Intel, the biggest recipient of money under the CHIPS Act, will see its funding drop to less than $ 8 billion from the $ 8.5 billion that was announced earlier this year, four people familiar with the grant said. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the final contract had not yet been signed. The change in terms takes into account a $ 3 billion contract that Intel has been offered to produce chips for the U.S. military, two of these people said.
The government's decision to reduce the size of the grant follows Intel's move to delay some of its planned investments in chip facilities in Ohio. The company now plans to finish that project by the end of the decade instead of 2025. The chip maker has been under pressure to reduce costs after posting its biggest quarterly loss in the company's 56-year history.
The move by the Biden administration also takes into account Intel's technology road map and customer demand. Intel has been working to improve its technological capacity to catch up to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, but it has struggled to convince customers that it can match TSMC's technology.
Intel's troubles have been a blow to the Biden administration's plans to rev up domestic chip manufacturing. In March, President Biden traveled to Arizona to announce Intel's multibillion-dollar award and said the company's manufacturing investments would transform the semiconductor industry.
Intel's investment was at the forefront of the administration's ambition to return chip manufacturing to the United States from Asia. The CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill passed in 2022, provided $ 39 billion in funding to subsidize the construction of facilities to help the United States reduce its reliance on foreign production of the tiny, critical electronics that power everything from iPads to dishwashers.
To prevent taxpayer money from being wasted, Commerce Department officials set milestones for the companies to meet in order to get funds. The benchmarks included building a plant, producing chips and signing up customers to buy domestically produced products.
Intel, which lobbied aggressively for the bill's passage, was long seen as the law's biggest beneficiary. But its business struggles complicated its negotiations over its final award. The Commerce Department had granted the initial award to support Intel's expansion of operations in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon, as well as the construction of two plants in Ohio.
Intel and the Commerce Department declined to comment about the reduction in funding.
The Commerce Department has been racing to finalize contracts and begin distributing CHIPS Act funding. Earlier this month, it said it had completed the terms of a $ 6.6 billion grant to TSMC. The Taiwanese company is investing more than $ 65 billion of its own funding for the construction of factories in Arizona.
The Biden administration says that the program has already spurred significant growth in new factory construction, and that the United States is set to be the only country with factories from all five of the world's leading chip manufacturers.
Few stood to benefit more from the program than Intel. In addition to a direct grant, the Biden administration offered up to $ 11 billion in federal loans and a 25 percent tax credit for its investments in new factories.
Intel is also slated to receive a $ 3 billion government contract to make chips for the military. The size of that contract contributed to the Commerce Department's decision to reduce its award to Intel, said two of these people. The combination of the military contract and its CHIPS Act grant pushes its total award from the bipartisan bill to more than $ 10 billion.
Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, was one of the biggest champions of the CHIPS Act. In the run-up to the passage of the CHIPS Act, he met with more than 100 lawmakers and attended a State of the Union address as a guest of Mr. Biden.
But since then, Intel's business has faltered. Its sales declined 6 percent in its most recent quarter, and it is in the process of cutting 15,000 jobs.
The company has said its revenue in the current period will surpass $ 13.3 billion, which exceeded analysts expectations and lifted its share price by 12 percent. But its market value has fallen to $ 106 billion from a high of about $ 500 billion in 2000.
Intel's troubles have made it a takeover target. In recent months, Qualcomm executives have proposed acquiring it.
The Biden administration has been concerned about Intel's ability to fulfill its investment commitment. As the company struggled to find customers for its new plants, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo tried to help by encouraging executives at Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple to have Intel make chips for their products in the United States.
"Of course, I'd be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful," Ms. Raimondo said in an interview with The New York Times last month. "But really, my message to any of these companies -- whether it's Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them -- is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips."

Frenemies Take to the Biggest Stage: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The campy supernatural movie comes to Broadway as a big, bawdy musical starring Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard.
To be a marquee name after the ingénue years and to feel validated in a cutthroat business: For many actresses on Broadway or anywhere, those can be constant cravings. For Megan Hilty, one of the stars of the new Broadway musical "Death Becomes Her," they're urgent themes.
"I have this number in the show that's quite funny," Hilty said during a recent interview. "But also it taps into something unbearably honest about the lengths to which women, mostly, can torture themselves thinking: How far am I willing to go to be what this world and industry wants and needs me to be in order to feel relevant?"
But this isn't the earnest-minded "Suffs," not by a long shot.
"Death Becomes Her" is a big, bawdy musical of to-the-rafters power ballads, va-va-voom costumes, zippy one-liners and vogueing chorus boys. It's based on Robert Zemeckis's supernatural horror comedy, from 1992, about two women -- Madeline Ashton, a pompous actress played by Meryl Streep, and Helen Sharp, an unhinged novelist played by Goldie Hawn -- who become frenemy immortals after they drink a potion that a mysterious glamourpuss named Lisle Von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini) assures them will impart eternal youth.
No spoiler alert: It does, but it's not pretty. Rotting flesh never is.
The show comes to Broadway after a Chicago run last spring that received mostly good reviews, with much of the praise saved for Hilty and her co-star, Jennifer Simard, who plays Helen to Hilty's Madeline. As with any Broadway transfer, the show's creative team, led by its director-choreographer Christopher Gattelli, has spent months futzing -- finessing new illusions, adding a new second-act song, redesigning costumes.
What hasn't changed is that Madeline seduces and marries Helen's fiancé, Ernest, played by Christopher Sieber (Bruce Willis in the film). And the show still has, as Simard put it, its "nougaty center": A story about two women who make a ghastly but farcical Faustian bargain that's rooted in private shame and universal heartache over youth, beauty and self-worth.
"The audience knows what pain and insecurity feel like," Simard said, sitting next to Hilty during a recent interview at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, where the show is in previews before a Nov. 21 opening. "There's comedy to come out of those things."
As for playing Madeline, Hilty's bright countenance betrayed a frank assessment of her character's dark truths.
"A lot of what some would think is bad behavior, to me is just a product of her deepest, darkest insecurities about growing old in an industry that is relentlessly unforgiving," she said, "like it's offensive to be an aging woman."
Joining Simard and Hilty for the interview were Sieber and Michelle Williams, the singer and former Destiny's Child member who stars as Viola van Horn, as Rossellini's character is now called. Williams said in finding her way into the character, she reined in her performance, not to avoid overacting -- how else would an elixir-hawking ancient goddess-demoness come across? -- but out of fear that she might sound like she's on the wrong stage.
"As a musician who likes to sing all kinds of notes and chords, I'm restraining myself," said Williams, who was last seen on Broadway in 2018 in "Once on This Island." "This is Broadway. This ain't church, nor is this the R&B pop stage. I don't want nobody to be like, Honey, she thought this was a Michelle Williams, Destiny's Child concert, and it's not."
"We kind of want it to be," Hilty whispered with a smile, extending her hand out to Williams.
"I understand," Williams replied, reaching back.
"Death Becomes Her" is a show business cautionary tale as old as "All About Eve," but also as recent as the radical Broadway revival of "Sunset Boulevard" and the gonzo body-horror film "The Substance" -- new dramas that employ nightmarish scenarios and grotesquely bloody finales to explore what it means for actresses, and women generally, to age.
As a musical, "Death Becomes Her" does this too -- not with gruesomeness but with a punchy book by Marco Pennette, a television veteran who was a co-creator of the series "Caroline in the City" and a writer for "Ugly Betty" and other sitcoms. Pennette said he had a simple goal: to get people "to jump and to laugh."
Horror movies have a name for that.
"A jump scare lives in the same place as a laugh," explained Julia Mattison who, with Noel Carey, wrote the show's score, their first for Broadway. "It's a breath, it's a quick" -- here she inhaled sharply -- "and you get an adrenaline shot."
Mattison and Carey are young and untested names on Broadway, but they may be familiar to followers of New York's downtown actor-writer-composer circles. Although their music is new, they understand, as does Pennette, that fans are going to make comparisons to the source material, an inevitability when any film is adapted for the stage.
Eyeballs will be especially trained on how Universal Theatrical Group, the live theater division of Universal, the studio behind the film, handled the making of the musical.
Lowe Cunningham, the division's vice president of creative development and production, said Pennette had a long-running relationship with Universal Pictures and was already on board when she started hearing from some of Broadway's heavy-hitter composers who wanted to work on "Death Becomes Her." Cunningham said that even though Carey and Mattison were rookie Broadway composers "nobody had heard of," they were selected in part because having a woman's voice on the writing team would be helpful in shaping how the characters "look at female friendship."
And, she added, because Universal Theatrical Group, which musicalized "Shrek" and "Bring It On" for Broadway, felt "there is room for discovery of new talent."
"I said we have to give them a shot," Cunningham explained. "If we got it wrong, and they can't write, then we've lost a year. But there was something special there."
"Death Becomes Her" has built a devoted fan base in the decades since the film opened at No. 1 to mixed reviews and modest box office sales. (It was a dud compared with Zemeckis's previous hits "Back to the Future" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit.") With catty leading lady characters and camp in its blood, the film is a queer movie touchstone, even inspiring a runway challenge on "RuPaul's Drag Race."
Simard said what fans of the film should not expect to see are impressions of Streep or Hawn. "It's not 'Forbidden Broadway,"' Simard said of the long-running satirical franchise.
It wouldn't be "Death Becomes Her" without one of the film's most memorable scenes, a literal twist that would seem to defy stagecraft. (The film's CGI, groundbreaking at the time, won an Academy Award for best visual effects.) It happens when Madeline is pushed down a grand flight of stairs, a seemingly fatal nudge when she lands with a thud. But having already swallowed the magic potion, she gets up -- though her head is on backward, making her look as if she's both coming and going.
Gattelli said he and his creative team worked at a breakneck pace to come up with a theatrical solution that looked convincing and was "graphic but at the same time witty."
"After literally throwing dummies down the stairs, at the end of the day I was like, this is live theater and it's a person," he said.
At a recent rehearsal, Gattelli watched as Warren Yang, the show's acrobatics captain and a former member of the Canadian national gymnastics team, slipped on heels and used his considerable flexibility, upper-body strength and lithe extension to demonstrate in slow-motion how Madeline plummets down the staircase.
A strategically placed wig, loud cracking sound effects and a hidden switcheroo complete the trick. (More intel would spoil the spell work.) By the end, Yang looked pooped.
Gattelli didn't reveal the sausage-making behind recreating the film's other big visual gag, in which Madeline shoots Helen with such force that Helen is hurled into a pool, emerging with a giant hole in her midsection. But at a recent preview, that scene and another, in which Helen knocks Madeline's head offstage with a shovel, got the performance's most rousing cheers.
The producers found a kindred macabre spirit in Gattelli, a horror fan and a Tony Award-winning choreographer (for "Newsies the Musical") who cut his teeth working on darkly comic Off Broadway musicals including "Altar Boyz," "Bat Boy," "Silence! The Musical" -- shows that "find the funny in the darkness," as he put it.
But as any horror movie geek knows, darkness eventually gives way to light. (Usually.) Sieber said he hoped "Death Becomes Her" would appeal to theatergoers who like comedy that goes for broke and prefer horror to be of the pretend variety.
"Last season on Broadway there were a lot of lessons to be learned, a lot of, hey that's not right, let's fix this, and that's fine," he said. "But I think we're ready to laugh now for two and a half hours. If you're coming to 'Death Becomes Her' for a lesson, you're missing the point completely."

Biden Races To Wrap Up Chip Grants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The White House is racing to finish grant agreements for chip manufacturers, but some of its biggest successes might be credited to the Trump administration.
The Biden administration said on Friday that it had completed an agreement to award Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company up to $ 6.6 billion in grants, as federal officials race to put in place their plans to boost U.S. chip manufacturing before the end of President Biden's term.
The administration struck a preliminary agreement in the spring to provide TSMC with the funding, which will support three new factories in Phoenix. The government will give TSMC the money in tranches as the company meets milestones.
In a statement, Mr. Biden said that the foreign direct investment in the facilities was the largest for a new factory project in U.S. history, and that the announcement on Friday was "among the most critical milestones yet" in the rollout of his chips program.
The agreement "demonstrates how we are ensuring that the progress made to date will continue to unfold in the coming years, benefiting communities all across the country," Mr. Biden said.
The administration is expected to finish more grant awards in the coming weeks. But the projects might come too late for Mr. Biden to receive much credit. Chip factories take years to build, and many of these projects will not break ground -- or produce chips -- until well into President-elect Donald J. Trump's term.
Mr. Biden's administration is working to cement its legacy with the grants as part of a $ 39 billion program to revitalize U.S. technology manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign nations for critical semiconductors. The program is a pillar of the president's economic policy, which has largely focused on bolstering American manufacturing.
While the administration has struck several deals to award billions in funding, none of the money has yet gone out the door. That offers Mr. Trump another opportunity to claim credit as the dollars begin to flow and help create thousands of jobs across the country.
TSMC is only the second company, after Polar Semiconductor, to complete its agreement, even though most of the funding has been allocated. Some chip executives have expressed dismay at the slow pace.
The Biden administration argues that it has already had plenty of successes. It points to a sharp uptick in spending on U.S. factory construction, and says the United States will be the only major country to have all five leading chip manufacturers within its borders.
And while other chipmakers like Intel have struggled, Biden administration officials have pointed to TSMC as a success story. TSMC is expected to receive at least $ 1 billion before the end of the year, Commerce Department officials said.
The program is funded by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan effort to reverse decades of offshoring in the technology industry.
Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are produced in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990. And nearly all of the advanced chips used in the United States are made in Taiwan, an island that could be under threat of Chinese invasion.
TSMC will invest more than $ 65 billion of its own funding in the Arizona factories, which will make the type of advanced chips needed to create artificial intelligence and power sophisticated military equipment. The production quality at TSMC's Arizona plants is on a par with similar factories in Taiwan, and TSMC has brought its most advanced chip technology to the United States, administration officials said.
In a call with reporters on Thursday, Gina M. Raimondo, the commerce secretary, called this "the most sought-after technology on the planet."
"When we started implementing the CHIPS program, many, many people said it wasn't possible," she said. "'TSMC wouldn't expand at this scale in the United States.' 'If they did, they wouldn't be able to match their quality and efficiency in the U.S. that they had in Taiwan.' So to all of those naysayers, I say it's happening."
Mr. Trump has criticized the program. In October, he said the bipartisan law provided "billions of dollars for rich companies," arguing that a stiff tariff on foreign chips would do the trick instead.
"You didn't have to put up 10 cents," Mr. Trump said on an episode of "The Joe Rogan Experience." "You tariff it so high that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing."
Mr. Trump's opposition is a sharp turn from his first stint as president, when his administration worked to lure TSMC to the United States. Like the Biden administration, Trump officials were concerned about the country's reliance on Taiwan for advanced chips and wanted to bring more production onto America's shores. Trump officials negotiated with TSMC to build a plant in Arizona, and their effort to secure subsidies for the factories helped feed into a broader push for funding.
Paul S. Triolo, a partner for China at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said that since some of the planning for chips grants had started late in the Trump administration, Trump officials might "figure out a way to take more credit for it."
"Maybe they will just say, 'Let's try to take some credit for this and keep it going and make it our own by doing some improvements,"' he said.
In an emailed statement, Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, said that "who gets credit isn't important."
"What's important is what it means for Arizona and our national security," he said. "Bringing microchip manufacturing back to America has always been and will continue to be a bipartisan effort."

Divided Over a Data Center: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: They had already planted yard signs, volunteered at the farmers' market booth and signed each and every one of the petitions, so now the residents of Peculiar, Mo., took to the field outside their homes to pray.
For years, that golden wheat had been the backdrop of this 6,000-person hamlet, best known as a pit stop on trips from Kansas City to the Ozarks. Now, it was a battleground between a tech giant's proposed data center and the rural community around it.
"Father God, we are Davids against Goliath," said Susan Wells, the group's prayer leader, that October night. "We pray for the Davids among us."
The situation in Peculiar had not always been so precarious. When executives from Diode Ventures, the company developing the data center for its secret tech company client, last met with those residents, it was on a peaceful July night over wine slushies at the town's beloved winery.
The 500-acre data center campus, the executives said, would be a boon to the town, bringing in new jobs and over a billion dollars in tax revenue, most of which would go to the school district. All they needed was the land rezoned for industrial use.
But that request jeopardized the project and pitted the people of Peculiar not just against Big Tech but also against their own local officials. Residents described a web of distrust filled with nondisclosure agreements, hurt feelings and a mysterious entity vying to become the town's new neighbor.
After the data center plan was announced in January, Diode executives kept in touch with residents close to the project, even meeting in some of their living rooms to discuss concerns. But within weeks, they required a nondisclosure agreement to keep those talks going, said Becky Wiseman, whose property is abutted by the proposed site.
Diode declined to comment on the specifics of its Peculiar project, including its nondisclosure agreements and client.
Growing concerned, Ms. Wiseman and her neighbors decided to visit data center campuses for Meta and Google in Nebraska and Iowa, which were also "hyperscale" like the one proposed in Peculiar. When they arrived, they were terrified at what they saw and heard -- the constant hum of generators behind guard towers with 24-hour security.
"Like living next to a maximum-security prison," Ms. Wiseman said.
This, they were sure, could not happen in Peculiar.
'Don't Dump Data on Peculiar'
The saga in Peculiar is playing out in small towns across the country as tech giants look to build hundreds of new data centers -- often lured by tax abatements -- to house the thousands of computers that would power the booming and energy-intensive artificial intelligence industry.
"It's important to note that data centers are increasingly becoming critical, necessary infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our connected, digital world," Diode said in a statement. "Data centers also bring a multitude of benefits to communities, big and small."
The insatiable demand for computing power has created a land grab in states like Missouri between companies like Google and Meta, which often work in anonymity through brokers like Diode to procure real estate.
Developers are drawn to places like Peculiar because of the cheap energy and abundant acreage, but residents and state officials say the financial benefits of these projects -- the Peculiar data center would be built just feet from the town's electrical substation -- come at a cost.
"These corporate giants, they're taking advantage of these small towns that are dying for a big fish," said State Senator Rick Brattin, whose district includes Peculiar.
If the town needed a David to battle the giant, Chad Buck, 50, was happy to take on the challenge. He took a leave of absence from his job as a real estate developer and, along with his neighbor Vicki Howe, created a Facebook page called "Don't Dump Data on Peculiar" to share intel. Without many local reporters in the county, the page, which quickly gained 1,000 members, became the movement's town square.
Signs that read "No Data Centers" sprouted up in yards and windows across town. So many people started showing up at planning and zoning meetings that Peculiar officials had to move them from City Hall to the Lions Club, a larger venue a mile down the road.
Behind the scenes, Diode had been working with Peculiar's mayor, Doug Stark, and city administrator, Mickey Ary, since September of last year, according to emails obtained through a public records request. But the resistance appeared to catch the company off guard.
Over virtual meetings and lunches at City Hall with Mr. Stark and Mr. Ary, Diode executives laid out a plan to win over Peculiar's hearts and minds, from traffic studies to handwritten letters to new STEM scholarships at the local high school.
"We're counting on you," the executives wrote.
Looming over the project was the mystery of which tech company would become Peculiar's new neighbor.
In a March presentation to residents at the Lions Club titled "Myth Busters," Diode executives said their client had yet to be determined. The company also emphasized that it was not owned by the Chinese and, contrary to some fears, that data centers do not cause cancer.
But in private emails, the client appeared to be well established, referred to by Diode project managers using a code name: Satin.
At least four Peculiar residents recall face-to-face conversations in which Diode project managers said the site was likely to be a Google data center, though a Google spokeswoman denied that the company was involved. Other residents suspected Meta as the client on account of the shell company it used for a Kansas City data center last year, according to local news reports: Velvet. But a Meta spokesperson, too, denied that there were ties.
The remaining clues pointed in a different direction. In April, at an after-hours meeting at the town's winery, Diode introduced the mystery client to Mr. Stark and Mr. Ary for the first time, emails show. In preparation for the meeting, Mr. Ary and Mr. Stark signed a nondisclosure agreement with a data center company called IPI.
IPI is owned by Iron Point Partners, a private equity firm, and Iconiq Capital, a Silicon Valley investor whose clients include Meta's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. A spokesperson for IPI declined to comment.
In public, Mr. Stark and Mr. Ary, who had been in office since 2022 and 2021, lobbied hard for the project's approval, framing it as a rare chance for economic development in a town that badly needed it.
The farms that had long fueled Peculiar's economy were dwindling, and the two men had watched for years as neighboring towns like Raymore and Belton became booming exurbs of Kansas City, filled with high-rise apartments and shiny new retail centers.
But that vision for the town clashed with the wishes of longtime residents who cherished Peculiar's unremarkable downtown for the remarkable peace it brought them. Other than the data center, there had been just two recent moments of controversy in Peculiar, recalled Chris Tittle, a local real estate agent: a dispute over the town's chicken coop ordinance in 2012 and, this year, another dust-up over the chicken coop ordinance.
Mr. Tittle said he had no issues with A.I. -- he regularly uses ChatGPT for work by asking it to write marketing materials that emphasize small-town values -- but saw the data center as a referendum on failed local leadership.
"We want to keep being a sleeper city," Mr. Tittle said. "We love Peculiar, and we will fight for it."
The decision about the data center ultimately fell to the town's elected aldermen, a group of six men, two in each ward, who are paid $ 200 a month for their duties. While the mayor and city administrator are on the city's full-time staff, the aldermen, and their majority vote, hold the power in Peculiar.
Robert Wells was elected as an alderman for the first time in April, excited to don the signature blue polo that comes with the job. At first, he approached the data center with an open mind -- he "had a love of data" as an information technology worker -- but soon grew skeptical of Diode, the mayor and the city administrator.
According to internal Diode documents, Diode was pursuing 25-year tax abatements, and the data center would create just 100 jobs, most of which would be high-level technician roles, not blue-collar careers.
And Mr. Wells and some of the other aldermen found it off-putting that Diode executives preferred to meet with no more than three of them at a time -- any more, and a public notice about the meetings would have to be posted online.
"I had a sour taste in my mouth the first time it actually happened," Mr. Wells said of the meetings, adding that he stopped attending out of ethical concerns. "I told the mayor, 'Do you know how this makes us look?"'
Suspicions about the project deepened when it was revealed, through a secretly recorded conversation between Mr. Ary and Ms. Howe later posted to Facebook, that the mayor and city administrator had signed nondisclosure agreements with Diode.
"I would probably rethink it next time around," Mr. Ary said of the nondisclosure agreement in an interview. Mr. Stark did not respond to emails, phone calls and written questions handed to his clerk at City Hall.
Nick Jacobs, who worked in Peculiar government from 2005 to 2022, said the town was in need of an industrial project to fund new roads and infrastructure. But he described Peculiar as full of BANANAs: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything.
Before Diode, Peculiar nearly landed a billion-dollar Slim Jim factory that would have created 1,300 jobs, but Conagra, the maker of Slim Jims, ended up choosing a different town.
"You're not going to stop progress," said Glenn Yoakum, who runs a farm feed store in downtown Peculiar with his son Frank and would rather see the land repurposed to farm cattle. "But they should make sure it's at least a good deal for the town."
As the conflict drummed on, the tensions mounted on Facebook, where residents used A.I. to generate country songs about Mr. Stark -- "He was pullin' all the strings, makin' deals on the sly," according to the lyrics -- and images of mobsters puppeteering the town with power lines.
Others saw the high-tech companies behind the data center as a threat to their decidedly low-tech ways of life.
"We have here in Peculiar what no one else has got," said Larry Boucher, who repairs vintage clocks downtown and prefers the simplicity of a landline phone. "Peace, serenity."
Mr. Boucher's feelings toward the town's politics can best be described by a sign that hangs in his store: "Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies."
'Show your character!'
It all came to a head at a September meeting when Mr. Wells, the alderman, raised yet another concern about the data center and Mayor Stark interrupted.
"I hope everyone understands that while shooting from the hip like this, you're destroying any future development that might want to come to Peculiar," Mr. Stark said, according to a video recording of the meeting.
The audience erupted, and Mr. Buck, the leading opponent of the data center, stood up from his chair. "Show your character!" he yelled to Mr. Stark.
"You've shown yours!" Mr. Stark yelled back, as others in the room sprang up, ready to step in between the two men.
"What, you're going to fight me as the mayor?" Mr. Buck said.
Days later, plans for a petition to recall the mayor spread online.
"This project might have had the ability to help this community in areas of great need," Mr. Stark wrote in a Facebook post addressing the recall proposal, which was never formally submitted. "Unfortunately, we'll just never know."
The town reconvened one last time before the aldermen's vote, and residents took turns at the lectern to speak in front of Mr. Stark and the aldermen.
Among them was Patti DiPardo Livergood, who lived next to the proposed site and told of how she had tried to sell her home after her husband died of cancer, but pulled the listing after the data center scared off potential buyers.
Holding back tears, she said Mr. Ary had called her employer, a congressional office, to complain about her speaking out against the project in public meetings.
"This billion-, trillion-, zillion-dollar industry just loves to swallow up towns across America, take over their government, destroy their land and kill the spirit of their people," Ms. Livergood said. "You not only want to hurt my well-being, but now you want to take my job away from me?"
Then came the aldermen's vote -- by unanimous decision, the data center zoning was rejected. It is unclear where Diode will take its project. The group's Facebook page has since been repurposed to plan the town's Halloween festivities.
The Prayer Circle
Back at the prayer circle, held before the victory, Mr. Buck and his neighbors prayed for the health of the town. With watering eyes, they prayed for forgiveness for Mr. Stark and Mr. Ary.
Looking to the substation at the foot of the field, Mr. Buck thought about what, and who, might come next. The group shifted its prayer to a parable from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus tells of the shepherd who leaves the 99 sheep to save the one that is missing: "Go out to search for the one that is lost."
The group looked to Mr. Buck for the final word.
"Keep your eyes on the north," he said. "Keep your eyes on the power lines."

PECULIAR, Mo. — They had already planted yard signs, volunteered at the farmers market booth and signed each and every one of the petitions, so now the residents of Peculiar, Missouri, took to the field outside their homes to pray.
For years, that golden wheat had been the backdrop of this 6,000-person hamlet, best known as a pit stop on trips from Kansas City to the Ozarks. Now, it was a battleground between a tech giant’s proposed data center and the rural community around it.
“Father God, we are Davids against Goliath,” said Susan Wells, the group’s prayer leader, that October night. “We pray for the Davids among us.”
The situation in Peculiar had not always been so precarious. When executives from Diode Ventures, the company developing the data center for its secret tech company client, last met with those residents, it was on a peaceful July night over wine slushies at the town’s beloved winery.
The 500-acre data center campus, the executives said, would be a boon to the town, bringing in new jobs and more than $1 billion in tax revenue, most of which would go to the school district. All they needed was the land rezoned for industrial use.
But that request jeopardized the project and pitted the people of Peculiar not just against Big Tech but also against their own local officials. Residents described a web of distrust filled with nondisclosure agreements, hurt feelings and a mysterious entity vying to become the town’s new neighbor.
After the data center plan was announced in January, Diode executives kept in touch with residents close to the project, even meeting in some of their living rooms to discuss concerns. But within weeks, they required a nondisclosure agreement to keep those talks going, said Becky Wiseman, whose property is abutted by the proposed site.
Diode declined to comment on the specifics of its Peculiar project, including its nondisclosure agreements and client.
Growing concerned, Wiseman and her neighbors decided to visit data center campuses for Meta and Google in Nebraska and Iowa, which were also “hyperscale” like the one proposed in Peculiar. When they arrived, they were terrified at what they saw and heard — the constant hum of generators behind guard towers with 24-hour security.
“Like living next to a maximum-security prison,” Wiseman said.
This, they were sure, could not happen in Peculiar.
‘Don’t Dump Data on Peculiar’
The saga in Peculiar is playing out in small towns across the country as tech giants look to build hundreds of new data centers — often lured by tax abatements — to house the thousands of computers that would power the booming and energy-intensive artificial intelligence industry.
“It’s important to note that data centers are increasingly becoming critical, necessary infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our connected, digital world,” Diode said in a statement. “Data centers also bring a multitude of benefits to communities, big and small.”
The insatiable demand for computing power has created a land grab in states like Missouri between companies like Google and Meta, which often work in anonymity through brokers like Diode to procure real estate.
Developers are drawn to places like Peculiar because of the cheap energy and abundant acreage, but residents and state officials say the financial benefits of these projects — the Peculiar data center would be built just feet from the town’s electrical substation — come at a cost.
“These corporate giants, they’re taking advantage of these small towns that are dying for a big fish,” said state Sen. Rick Brattin, whose district includes Peculiar.
If the town needed a David to battle the giant, Chad Buck, 50, was happy to take on the challenge. He took a leave of absence from his job as a real estate developer and, along with his neighbor Vicki Howe, created a Facebook page called “Don’t Dump Data on Peculiar” to share intel. Without many local reporters in the county, the page, which quickly gained 1,000 members, became the movement’s town square.
Signs that read “No Data Centers” sprouted up in yards and windows across town. So many people started showing up at planning and zoning meetings that Peculiar officials had to move them from City Hall to the Lions Club, a larger venue a mile down the road.
Behind the scenes, Diode had been working with Peculiar’s mayor, Doug Stark, and city administrator, Mickey Ary, since September 2023, according to emails obtained through a public records request. But the resistance appeared to catch the company off guard.
Over virtual meetings and lunches at City Hall with Stark and Ary, Diode executives laid out a plan to win over Peculiar’s hearts and minds, from traffic studies to handwritten letters to new STEM scholarships at the local high school.
“We’re counting on you,” the executives wrote.
Looming over the project was the mystery of which tech company would become Peculiar’s new neighbor.
In a March presentation to residents at the Lions Club titled “Myth Busters,” Diode executives said their client had yet to be determined. The company also emphasized that it was not owned by the Chinese and, contrary to some fears, that data centers do not cause cancer.
But in private emails, the client appeared to be well established, referred to by Diode project managers using a code name: Satin.
At least four Peculiar residents recall face-to-face conversations in which Diode project managers said the site was likely to be a Google data center, though a Google spokesperson denied that the company was involved. Other residents suspected Meta as the client on account of the shell company it used for a Kansas City data center last year, according to local news reports: Velvet. But a Meta spokesperson, too, denied that there were ties.
The remaining clues pointed in a different direction. In April, at an after-hours meeting at the town’s winery, Diode introduced the mystery client to Stark and Ary for the first time, emails show. In preparation for the meeting, Ary and Stark signed a nondisclosure agreement with a data center company called IPI.
IPI is owned by Iron Point Partners, a private equity firm, and Iconiq Capital, a Silicon Valley investor whose clients include Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. A spokesperson for IPI declined to comment.
In public, Stark and Ary, who had been in office since 2022 and 2021, lobbied hard for the project’s approval, framing it as a rare chance for economic development in a town that badly needed it.
The farms that had long fueled Peculiar’s economy were dwindling, and the two men had watched for years as neighboring towns like Raymore and Belton became booming exurbs of Kansas City, filled with high-rise apartments and shiny new retail centers.
But that vision for the town clashed with the wishes of longtime residents who cherished Peculiar’s unremarkable downtown for the remarkable peace it brought them. Other than the data center, there had been just two recent moments of controversy in Peculiar, recalled Chris Tittle, a local real estate agent: a dispute over the town’s chicken coop ordinance in 2012 and, this year, another dust-up over the chicken coop ordinance.
Tittle said he had no issues with AI — he regularly uses ChatGPT for work by asking it to write marketing materials that emphasize small-town values — but saw the data center as a referendum on failed local leadership.
“We want to keep being a sleeper city,” Tittle said. “We love Peculiar, and we will fight for it.”

While the mayor and city administrator are on the city’s full-time staff, the aldermen, and their majority vote, hold the power in Peculiar.

Coalition Split In Germany; Finance Chief Is Dismissed: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After months of disputes, Chancellor Olaf Scholz ousted one of his governing partners, adding to the challenges for Europe since Donald Trump's election.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister on Wednesday, effectively ending his three-party ruling coalition and destabilizing his center-left government just as the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States presented Europe with new economic and security challenges.
"I would have liked to have spared you this difficult decision," said Mr. Scholz during an impromptu news conference in the chancellery on Wednesday evening after several days of talks aimed at salvaging the coalition. "Especially in times like these, when uncertainty is growing," he added.
Mr. Scholz vowed to keep governing until the end of the year and then to demand a confidence vote in Parliament in January, a test he may fail. That would open the way for early elections, a rarity in Germany since World War II, possibly in March.
The extraordinary trouble in Berlin leaves the European Union evermore rudderless at a particularly difficult time. France's government is in a crisis after elections there this year yielded a deadlocked Parliament, and Russia has made important advances on the battlefield in Ukraine and continues to threaten Europe broadly.
Now Europe faces the possibility of a trade war with the United States and a weakening of the NATO alliance -- both of which Mr. Trump has threatened -- as Germany, its most populous country, becomes mired in political instability as well.
The collapse of the coalition in Germany came after the leaders of the three parties -- Mr. Scholz's Social Democrats, the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats -- had mostly stopped talking to each other in recent weeks over widening disputes in negotiations for a new federal budget.
On Wednesday night the resentment between Mr. Scholz and Christian Lindner, the leader of the Free Democrats and his finance minister, who spoke with reporters 30 minutes after the chancellor, was on clear display.
"Olaf Scholz has sadly shown that he does not have the strength to give our country a new start," said Mr. Lindner, who called Mr. Scholz's suggestions to promote economic growth "dull and unambitious."
Mr. Scholz told reporters that Mr. Lindner had acted irresponsibly for not being willing to compromise.
The coalition, which has governed Germany since the former chancellor, Angela Merkel, left office in 2021, was an uneasy set of political bedfellows from the start. It was the first three-party coalition since the early 1960s, one of the reasons, many in the government say, for its instability, frequent leaks and paralysis.
The coalition's collapse is stunning for a country long known for plodding and predictable consensus that avoided the political gyrations of some of its more volatile European partners. It may signal a new era of political instability for Germany, as populist parties on the far right and far left gain more popularity on a fracturing political landscape.
Speculation about a collapse of the coalition had grown since last week after Mr. Lindner wrote a position paper, leaked to the news media, that challenged the progressive fiscal policies of his two left-of-center coalition partners.
Many of his proposals, like the end to national climate policies or cuts to social services, appeared designed to antagonize them. Experts saw the paper as Mr. Lindner's attempt to get himself pushed out of the coalition without having to leave it himself. The opposition, which has been calling for an end to the coalition, called it the "divorce document."
Mr. Scholz and Robert Habeck, Germany's economy minister and member of the Greens party, had initially tried to hold the coalition together. Calling for "pragmatism" in a post on social media on Monday, Mr. Scholz continued: "Coalition governments can sometimes be challenging. But the government is elected, and there are issues that need to be resolved."
At the heart of the dispute was a roughly 10 billion euro, or $ 10.7 billion, hole in the 2025 budget.
On Monday Mr. Habeck sought to keep Mr. Lindner in the government by offering him several billion euros earmarked as a subsidy for a planned Intel factory to help balance the budget. "This is the worst time for the government to fail," he told reporters then.
On Wednesday, Mr. Habeck called the firing "as logical as it is unnecessary," saying that many offers were on the table to meet Mr. Lindner's economic demands.
On Wednesday, Mr. Scholz announced that his Social Democrats would govern with the Green Party as a minority government until at least the end of the year. They will need to secure parliamentary majorities on a case-by-case to pass any laws.
On some issues -- notably aid to Ukraine, rebuilding the military and cracking down on immigration -- they might be able to count on the support of the opposition Christian Democrats, who have similar views on them.
"Germany is Europe's biggest economy and the biggest contributor to the E.U. budget; they need to have certainty," said Sudha David-Wilp, the Berlin-based regional director of the German Marshall Fund, a think tank. "And a minority government means instability for the country and its partners in Europe," she added.
Ultimately such an arrangement can only work with the tacit support of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, or C.D.U., the biggest opposition party that is leading opinion polls to win the next election.
"We cannot afford this unstable government a single day longer," Carsten Linnemann, the party's secretary general, told the German tabloid Bild earlier this week.
The Scholz coalition had billed itself as a restart from the sleepy Merkel years. The partners successfully managed pressing problems early in its term after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Germany stopped importing Russian gas.
But a ruling by the country's highest court in 2023 forced the government to make drastic cuts in the budget, leading to strife among the partners over the limit on borrowing that is anchored into the constitution.
The final break comes against the backdrop of a stagnant German economy, which is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in 2024, the second year in a row that Germany has stagnated. The country is the weakest member of the Group of 7 and among nations using the euro currency.
In a sign of deepening woes, Volkswagen, Germany's largest industrial employer, is threatening major job cuts and factory closures as it struggles to return its flagship brand to profitability.
With Mr. Lindner's insistence on economic reforms and his exit from the government, he appears to have picked the timing of his election campaign.
His Free Democratic Party has been struggling to break 5 percent support in the polls, the threshold for entering Parliament. Leaving the government on a principled stance could allow Mr. Lindner to pick up voter support for the next election whenever it is held.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks drifted lower Monday ahead of a momentous week full of potential flash points in Washington and around the world.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent, though it remains near its record set last month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3 percent.
Intel fell 2.9 percent, and the chemical producer Dow sank 2.1 percent in their first trading since getting notified they'll no longer be included in the Dow Jones industrial average. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway dropped 2.2 percent and was one of the heaviest weights on the market after reporting a drop in operating profit for the latest quarter.
But the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose, including a 2.8 percent gain for Fox after it reported a stronger profit than expected. That was despite increases in some costs, including for news gathering at Fox News to cover this election cycle.
Though Election Day results may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes, that's raised fears about the possibility of sharp swings around the world because markets infamously hate uncertainty.
History may be less foreboding. The broad U.S. stock market has historically gone on to rise regardless of which party wins the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald J. Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, creating uncertainty. A large part of that rally was because of excitement about the potential for a vaccine for Covid-19, which had just shut down the global economy.
"Bottom line -- the U.S. election is incredibly important, but the process is likely to be incredibly noisy," according to Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.
For markets, Mr. Zezas also points to how prices may have already moved ahead of expected outcomes from the election. A win for Mr. Trump this election could mean U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports, for example, which could hurt the value of the Mexican peso. But the peso has already fallen against the U.S. dollar in recent months, which could limit further moves if a Trump win were actually to happen.
A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation's debt or fuel a stronger U.S. economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part because of rising expectations in some market corners for a Trump win, along with a spate of data showing the U.S. economy has remained stronger than feared.
On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30 percent from 4.38 percent late Friday.
Another investment that's become a barometer for Trump's perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains, Trump Media & Technology Group ended up rising 12.4 percent.
The stock of the company behind Trump's Truth Social platform had been rising from a bottom in September, until it hit a wall last week and dropped at least 11 percent in three straight days.
In the oil market, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude rose 2.8 percent to $ 71.47 after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans to increase the amount of crude they produced. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 2.7 percent to $ 75.08 for a barrel.
The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges.
The Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress is meeting this week, and analysts say the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth.

Amazon Leads Wall Street Higher Despite Weak Jobs Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher on Friday, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to recover some of its loss from the day before, which was its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average added 288 points, or 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8 percent.
Amazon climbed 6.2 percent after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher.
Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8 percent despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts' estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market's bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts' forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter.
They helped offset a 1.2 percent slide for Apple, which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts' forecasts.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.35 points to 5,728.80. The Dow gained 288.73 to 42,052.19, and the Nasdaq composite added 144.77 to 18,239.92.
In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher following some swings after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only a net 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month. That was far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September.
The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. But the weaker-than-expected jobs report wiped out the slim chance traders had been seeing of the Fed holding rates steady, according to data from CME Group.
The Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, as it turns more attention to keeping the job market solid instead of focusing on just driving inflation lower.
The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed's actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20 percent from 4.18 percent late Thursday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.28 percent.
Economists said Friday's jobs report contained a lot of noise and perhaps not much signal. Besides two hurricanes that left destructive paths across the United States during the month, a strike by workers at Boeing also helped depress the numbers.
All those distortions make the numbers difficult to parse, "but it doesn't change our view that the labor market should further decelerate in coming months," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with that expected slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared.
A separate report on Friday said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It's been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Fed's keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September.
The price of oil, meanwhile, rose again to further trim its loss for the week. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.4 percent. Brent crude, the international standard, also climbed 0.4 percent.

Intel Has a $16.6 Billion Loss, Its Worst Result for a Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Silicon Valley chip maker has struggled to turn around its fortunes after missing opportunities and poor execution.
Intel on Thursday posted the biggest quarterly loss in its 56-year history, as the onetime highflying chip maker struggles to turn itself around.
The Silicon Valley company said its loss for the third quarter totaled $ 16.6 billion, a result of $ 15.9 billion in charges to reflect lowered valuations of company assets and a $ 2.8 billion restructuring charge associated with cutting more than 15,000 workers.
Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, had ordered the restructuring in August in response to shrinking profit margins caused by the costs of catching rivals in manufacturing technology and little success in the booming market for artificial intelligence chips, among other factors.
Intel's share price has plunged 60 percent since Mr. Gelsinger became chief executive in February 2021. At a current market value of less than $ 100 billion, the longtime semiconductor industry leader has recently been discussed as a candidate for a takeover or a breakup.
"We are acting with urgency to deliver on our priorities," Mr. Gelsinger said on Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before."
Intel's total revenue in the period that ended Sept. 30 dropped 6 percent from a year earlier to $ 13.3 billion, a bigger percentage decline than in the second quarter but above the midpoint of its guidance. Intel projected revenue for the current quarter of $ 13.3 billion to $ 14.3 billion, well below the $ 15.4 billion reported in the year-earlier period.
But the results and quarterly guidance were better than some analysts expected, pushing Intel's stock up more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.
The company, which makes microprocessor chips that act as electronic brains for most computers, has lately benefited from greater demand for personal computers. But that business declined 7 percent in the third quarter.
Conditions have lately been tougher in data centers, where Intel built a dominant franchise in chips for larger computers called servers. Rivals such as Nvidia and more recently Advanced Micro Devices have seen sharp growth by selling additional chips that are specially designed for A.I. applications, a field where Intel has fallen far behind. Still, in the latest quarter, Intel said, revenue in its data center business rose 9 percent.
Another big drag on Intel's profit margins is its nascent effort to manufacture chips for other companies, a shift from making only its own chips in its factories. Building that foundry business, as it is called in industry parlance, aided Intel's efforts to court subsidies from the Biden administration.
Intel has won orders from companies including Amazon, and Mr. Gelsinger said two unnamed "compute-centric" companies had recently agreed to use the foundry's most advanced production process. Still, the foundry business posted an 8 percent revenue drop in the third quarter, with an operating loss of $ 5.8 billion.
Four former Intel directors recently urged the company to be split into two parts -- one for manufacturing chips, the other for designing them. In an opinion piece in Fortune, the directors argued that customers such as competing chip designers would be reluctant to use Intel's foundry business unless it was completely independent.
But Craig Barrett, a former Intel chief executive, promptly rejected the idea of splitting the businesses in a separate article. Among other things, he wrote, that separation process would distract management while not greatly changing the appeal of Intel's foundry service.
Mr. Gelsinger has already announced plans to make Intel's foundry business an independent subsidiary. He has argued that the time is not right for a complete spinoff, since the foundry needs guaranteed business from Intel's own chip design operations to fill its factories. Intel already uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to make some chips it designs and might make more such decisions if it were entirely independent, some analysts said.
Another issue is that the foundry needs to keep investing in costly machines and research and development, money that might be hard to find.
"I don't think the foundry can stand on its own right now, unless someone is willing to inject a bunch of capital into it to keep it afloat," said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
In the third quarter, one portion of Intel's $ 15.9 billion in charges came from write-downs and an accelerating depreciation of assets related to a manufacturing process called Intel 7, reflecting the company's current view of demand for that technology. Intel's foundry has focused on marketing more advanced production processes lately. Another major portion of those charges relate to establishing a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, the company said.

Skewering Men Sparks Backlash in China: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Comedy has become a way for women to skewer China's gender inequality. Some men aren't happy about it.
On the list of topics best avoided by China's comedians, some are obvious. Politics. The Chinese military.
Now add: Men's fragile egos.
That, at least, was the message sent this month, when a major e-commerce platform abruptly ended a partnership with China's most prominent female stand-up comic. The company was caving to pressure from men on social media who described the comedian, Yang Li, as a man-hating witch.
Speaking up for women's rights is increasingly sensitive in China, and the stand-up stage is the latest battleground. Growing numbers of women like Ms. Yang are speaking out about -- and laughing at -- the injustices they face. On two hugely popular stand-up shows this fall, women were among the breakout stars, thanks to punchlines about the difficulty of finding a good partner, or men's fear of talking about menstruation.
But a backlash has emerged, as men balk at being the butt of the joke. They have attacked the comics on social media; Ms. Yang has described receiving threats of violence. The women's new visibility can also be easily erased. Not long after the e-commerce company, JD.com, dropped Ms. Yang, it deleted posts on its official social media account featuring two other female comedians.
The battle over women's jokes reflects the broader paradox of feminism in China. On the one hand, feminist rhetoric is more widespread than ever before, with once-niche discussions of gender inequality now aired openly. But the forces trying to suppress that rhetoric are also growing, encouraged by a government that has led its own crusade against feminist activism and pushed women toward traditional roles.
On guancha.cn, a nationalistic commentary site, an editorial declared: "The fewer divisive symbols like Yang Li, the better."
Even before the JD.com controversy erupted, Ms. Yang, 32, had addressed the perils of poking fun at men. On one of the recent shows, she said young female comics had asked her whether they should make certain jokes.
"I didn't have an answer," Ms. Yang said. "If I told them to do it, I'd worry what would happen to them afterward. If I told them not to, I'd worry about how good their performances would be."
Ms. Yang, who declined an interview through a representative, was one of the first Chinese comedians to demonstrate the possibilities for women in stand-up.
The daughter of pig farmers in Hebei Province, Ms. Yang was a former graphic designer and aspiring comedian when she shot to fame in 2020, with a routine about her dating woes. "How can men look so average, and yet be so confident?" she said, a one-liner that went viral.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
To many women, she became an icon. But many men viciously denounced her, accusing her of inciting "gender antagonism" -- a term state media often uses to denounce feminism -- and even reporting her to the government. When Intel and Mercedes-Benz featured her in ad campaigns in 2021, online fury prompted Intel to drop her and Mercedes-Benz to limit the ad's visibility.
Ms. Yang was unapologetic. And gradually, more women joined her. A female contestant on one of this year's shows thanked Ms. Yang, who was the show's chief screenwriter, for acting as an "older sister" in a male-dominated field.
Those women have been blazing their own trails, with jokes that sometimes go further than Ms. Yang's or broach new aspects of women's daily indignities. Several performers talked about men commenting on their weight, or their parents' preferences for sons. Another contestant, named Cai Cai, told a story about ordering menstrual pads and her male delivery driver's refusal to even say the word.
"What is there to hide? Will you get thrown in jail for buying pads?" she said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jenny Zhang, a 30-year-old I.T. worker and stand-up fan in Shanghai, said watching the female comedians had helped her recognize injustices in her own life.
"After you hear it, you feel yourself becoming more aware of your own emotions," she said. "Some things that you just thought were a little uncomfortable, you realize there's a problem behind it."
Still, even as the performers have broached once-taboo topics, they have not explicitly called themselves feminists. And they have left potentially more sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or sexual harassment, largely untouched.
But even if the jokes stay within the realm of the mundane, what matters is their appearance on mainstream platforms, said Xiaowen Liang, a feminist activist in New York who has participated in a popular Chinese-language feminist stand-up show there.
"Young women have already been talking about this a lot," she said of topics such as period shame. But "to let your male partners, elders, bosses, those kinds of people understand your experience -- that's extremely precious."
The emphasis on personal stories has also helped to keep references to gender inequality alive in pop culture, even as more overt activism has been crushed, said Dan Chen, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond who studies Chinese stand-up. Government censors are less likely to see such stories as political statements, she said.
"But if others resonate with you, then the message is sent," Professor Chen said, adding that stand-up, with its humor, allows women to deflect accusations of lecturing.
Still, even the relatively cautious approach has not been enough to stave off controversy, as shown when Ms. Yang appeared in an ad for JD.com's online pharmacy services this month.
Infuriated commenters called her an "extreme feminist," citing her 2020 joke about average-looking men. They promised to boycott the platform and filed customer service complaints claiming that the company didn't respect men.
Some pointed to JD.com's chief executive, a woman, as proof that toxic feminists had infiltrated the company. (The company's chairman, Richard Liu, was accused of rape in a U.S. court; the case was settled out of court in 2022.)
Four days after posting the ad with Ms. Yang, JD.com deleted it. "Recently, the participation of some stand-up comics in JD's promotional events attracted online attention. If this has brought you a bad experience, we deeply apologize!" it said in a statement. "Going forward, we have no plans to collaborate with the relevant performers."
JD.com also deleted posts featuring two other female comedians who have made jokes about men. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
To Ms. Yang's defenders, the controversy was not really about her, but about men's insecurity about women's rising status.
"Women's buying power and self-awareness are getting stronger and stronger. Appealing to this group is a very simple business decision," said Cheen Qin, a 40-year-old manager at an internet company in Shenzhen. But "men can't handle it," she said.
After she posted in support of Ms. Yang online, Ms. Qin said, a male former classmate called her stupid.
Still, many women said they hoped that female performers and audiences alike would continue to find an outlet in stand-up. (The genre can be fraught, no matter the performer's gender. Last year, stand-up shows across China were canceled after a male comedian made a joke that some nationalists online considered an insult to Chinese soldiers.)
Ms. Yang herself had already said, before the ad controversy, that she planned to focus more on smaller-scale shows, rather than television appearances. But she encouraged other women to ignore exhortations to talk about something other than gender.
"I just want to say, on behalf of people after me who may encounter the same problems: Going forward, this is all we're going to talk about!" she said. "If you're really offended, go watch something else."

Will the White House's Big Bet on Intel Backfire?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At an annual gathering of tech executives and billionaires in Sun Valley, Idaho, this past July, Gina Raimondo commandeered a table near a duck pond and tried to exert her influence as the U.S. secretary of commerce to help rescue an ailing national champion.
As media moguls and business luminaries cut deals nearby, Ms. Raimondo met with chief executives from Microsoft, Google and other firms and encouraged them to order their semiconductors from the United States, including from Intel. It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the American chip giant, was critical to that effort.
Ms. Raimondo, who is overseeing the Biden administration's investments in the chip industry, has made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel's U.S. manufacturing plants, according to eight people familiar with those requests, most of whom asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations.
A majority of the firms have rejected her overtures because Intel's chip-making techniques are not as sophisticated as those of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's leading chip maker and their primary supplier, these people said.
The doubts expressed by top tech executives show how far Intel has fallen at a moment when Ms. Raimondo is trying to rebuild American chip manufacturing. Her unofficial role as a chip salesperson underscores how much is riding on the success of Intel, a 56-year-old firm that is at the center of President Biden's efforts to rev up domestic semiconductor production.
While the Biden administration's endeavor involves many companies, a crucial part of its ambition is pegged to Intel, which lobbied -- and helped secure votes -- for the 2022 CHIPS Act.
Intel, which is the only American-owned maker of advanced logic chips, is the single biggest recipient of federal money from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for the tiny electronics that power everything from cars to iPads. Intel is also the sole recipient of a new $ 3 billion government contract to make advanced chips for the U.S. military.
Backed by promises of more than $ 20 billion in government support, Intel's chief executive, Patrick Gelsinger, has committed to invest more than $ 100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. But Intel's business has recently worsened, causing concern on Capitol Hill and stoking the fears of some administration officials who have worried for years about the company's ability to deliver on its promises.
Intel's investments alone account for more than a quarter of the total chip investments that the Biden administration has publicized. Mr. Gelsinger said investments in the United States would proceed, but Intel announced 15,000 layoffs and delayed the opening of a large factory in Ohio, a project that Mr. Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in 2022 and 2023.
The company's experience hints at the perils the government faces in designing industrial policy and picking winners and losers in a fast-moving industry. The question now is whether the administration can help Intel turn around its performance or if it will sink billions of dollars into a company that may continue to struggle.
Intel built its empire making chips for personal computers, but it missed out on the industry's last two major products: smartphones and artificial intelligence chips. Its sales and stock price have plummeted, and potential buyers have been circling the company.
"The nightmare scenario is you have a huge bet that just fails," said Peter E. Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who previously worked on the chips program at the White House. "It's natural folks looking at this would be worried."
The Biden administration has hedged its bets by offering money to 20 other foreign and domestic chipmakers to invest in the United States. Officials say their plan to persuade five of the world's leading chipmakers, including Intel, to build plants in the United States is still on track.
In the two years since the CHIPS Act was passed, the U.S. semiconductor industry has created 115,000 jobs and had more investments in factory construction than it did in the previous 24 years combined, Natalie Quillian, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in a statement. "We're confident in the success of the CHIPS and Science Act," she said.
But those efforts have been slowed by a broader downturn in the chip industry. Samsung and Micron Technology have also posted disappointing results over the past year and delayed factories planned in Texas and New York.
Micron said it was preparing for construction and expecting strong financial results next year. Samsung said its facility would start production in 2026.
In an interview, Ms. Raimondo said her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all U.S. manufacturers.
"Of course, I'd be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful," she said. "But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it's Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips."
"We're going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company," she added.
AMD, Nvidia and Marvell declined to comment. Amazon confirmed those conversations, while Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.
To prevent taxpayer money from being wasted, the administration created certain milestones for the companies it would subsidize. Companies must hit benchmarks -- like building a plant, producing chips or signing up customers -- before they can receive portions of their funds.
Like most companies, Intel has not yet received its first financial infusion under the program. And in recent months, it has been sparring with the government over the milestones it must hit before it gets funding, five people familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Gelsinger, who has spent the past three months restructuring the company and reassuring investors, said in an interview that he was frustrated with the process.
"There's been renegotiations on both sides," Mr. Gelsinger said. "My simple message is, 'Let's get it finished."'
America's Champion
Ms. Raimondo first met Mr. Gelsinger on a Zoom call in early 2021, where they joked about both being new to their positions. The two had just stepped into roles on opposite coasts of the country, where their interests would quickly become entangled.
Ms. Raimondo -- the former governor of Rhode Island and a venture capitalist -- had to immediately contend with a global chip shortage, which was shuttering American car factories and slowing the economy.
The Biden administration was also shaken by the country's dependence on Taiwan, home to TSMC, for advanced chips. Chasing bigger profits, most American chip companies had relocated their manufacturing to Asia, where workers were skilled and cheap. But relying on Taiwan seemed increasingly risky as China sought to bring the island under its control.
In 2021, Ms. Raimondo's deputies calculated that an interruption in Taiwan's chip supply could be as harmful to the U.S. economy as the Great Depression had been, two government officials said.
Mr. Gelsinger took over Intel with a plan to catch up to TSMC's technology and build an expansive new factory business. He wanted the government to help bankroll that effort and joined Ms. Raimondo and other executives in pushing Congress for broader funding. Mr. Gelsinger met with more than 100 lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 to argue that American-owned chip factories were vital to the country's future.
In March 2022, Mr. Gelsinger was Mr. Biden's guest at the State of the Union address. In his speech, Mr. Biden described a $ 20 billion project that Intel had planned for Ohio as a "field of dreams" and said that the company would invest $ 100 billion across the United States.
"That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they're waiting for is for you to pass this bill," Mr. Biden said to a standing ovation.
In late July, Congress voted to approve the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most ambitious attempts ever to reshape industry. It gave the Commerce Department $ 50 billion of funding and a $ 75 billion loan facility, and created a generous tax credit equal to a quarter of a company's investments.
In their Washington office, Intel's lobbyists watched the livestream of the House vote, sharing bottles of beer and congratulations.
Fears of Phantom Plants
As they designed the chips program, Ms. Raimondo and Biden officials weighed how to support Intel while safeguarding taxpayer money. They were already questioning whether Intel could follow through on its promises, several officials said.
David Yoffie, a longtime Intel board member, said he had told officials that Intel had a history of struggling to make chips for others. "Intel was going down a path that I wasn't confident would succeed," Mr. Yoffie said.
Caitlin Legacki, a former Commerce Department official, said there also was a fear that "Intel is going to take chips money, build an empty shell of a factory and then never actually open it, because they don't have customers." This is why the program was designed to withhold payments until companies hit certain milestones, she said.
Intel's plant in Arizona was a cautionary tale. In 2012, Intel hosted President Barack Obama at the site and trumpeted a $ 5 billion investment. It constructed the building, but waited several years to fill the factory with machinery because it didn't have enough customers, said two former Intel employees.
As Ms. Raimondo negotiated with other chipmakers, like TSMC and Samsung, she also became concerned about appearing too cozy with Mr. Gelsinger, and began trying to minimize their public appearances together, two people familiar with the situation said.
When the White House wanted to once again spotlight Intel's Ohio investment in the 2023 State of the Union, Ms. Raimondo expressed concerns, cautious about hitching the administration's reputation to a promise that could be unfulfilled, an official who was involved in the process said.
Ms. Raimondo declined to confirm the account, saying she did not remember it that way.
Too Big to Fail?
In March 2024, the Biden administration announced that it planned to award Intel $ 8.5 billion in grants to build factories, as well as up to $ 11 billion in loans. Intel might also be eligible for nearly $ 25 billion of tax credits.
The same month, Intel filed paperwork in Ohio saying it would delay its plant there by two to three years. It had signed a contract to produce chips for Microsoft but needed more customers to justify its plans.
As 2024 went on, Ms. Raimondo made more forceful requests to companies to consider Intel's services, chip executives said. Those included conversations with Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon.
The administration also selected Intel as the sole partner for a $ 3 billion program to make chips for the military. Some chip executives have criticized the program, called Secure Enclave, as a giveaway, but a White House official said Intel was uniquely qualified for the program.
On Aug. 1, Intel announced the results from a disastrous quarter, as its profits fell and it halted a decades-old shareholder dividend. Its stock plummeted 26 percent, its worst trading day in 50 years.
Its shares partially rebounded in mid-September, as it unveiled the Secure Enclave deal and a contract to make chips for Amazon in Ohio.
In a statement, Intel said that more than 2,000 construction workers were on site in Ohio building one of the world's largest chip factories and that it was "going to finish the job."
Mr. Gelsinger said Intel had been spending on that project, though it hadn't received any government funding.
"Obviously, with elections, you know, nigh in front of us, hey, we want this done," he said.
Ms. Raimondo said that she expected to close more deals before the end of the year, but that she was focused on protecting taxpayers.
"I'm sure all these companies would prefer that we just back up the Brink's truck of taxpayer money into their parking lot and deposit it into their treasury," she said. "But I can't do that."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2005, there was no inkling of the artificial intelligence boom that would come years later. But directors at Intel, whose chips served as electronic brains in most computers, faced a decision that might have altered how that transformative technology evolved.
Paul Otellini, Intel's chief executive at the time, presented the board with a startling idea: Buy Nvidia, a Silicon Valley upstart known for chips used for computer graphics. The price tag: as much as $ 20 billion.
Some Intel executives believed that the underlying design of graphics chips could eventually take on important new jobs in data centers, an approach that would eventually dominate A.I. systems.
But the board resisted, according to two people familiar with the boardroom discussion who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential. Intel had a poor record of absorbing companies. And the deal would have been by far Intel's most expensive acquisition.
Confronting skepticism from the board, Mr. Otellini, who died in 2017, backed away, and his proposal went no further. In hindsight, one person who attended the meeting said, it was "a fateful moment."
Today Nvidia is the unrivaled A.I. chip king and one of the most valuable corporations in the world, while Intel, once the semiconductor superpower, is reeling and getting no lift from the A.I. gold rush. Nvidia's stock market value, for years a fraction of Intel's, is now more than $ 3 trillion, roughly 30 times that of the struggling Silicon Valley icon, which has fallen below $ 100 billion.
As the company's valuation has sunk, some big tech companies and investment bankers have been considering what was once unthinkable: that Intel could be a potential acquisition target.
Such scenarios add to the pressures facing Patrick Gelsinger, appointed in 2021 as Intel's chief executive. He has focused on restoring the company's onetime lead in chip manufacturing technology, but longtime company watchers say Intel badly needs popular products -- such as A.I. chips -- to bolster revenue that declined more than 30 percent from 2021 through 2023.
"Pat Gelsinger is very much focused on the manufacturing side," said Robert Burgelman, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. "But they missed A.I., and that has been catching up to them now."
The story of how Intel, which recently cut 15,000 jobs, got left behind in A.I. is representative of the broader challenges the company now faces. There were opportunities missed, wayward decisions and poor execution, according to interviews with more than two dozen former Intel managers, board directors and industry analysts.
The trail of missteps was a byproduct of a corporate culture born of decades of success and high profits, going back to the 1980s, when Intel's chips and Microsoft's software became the twin engines of the fast-growing personal computer industry.
That culture was hard-charging and focused on its franchise in personal computers and later in data centers. Intel executives, only half-jokingly, described the company as "the largest single-cell organism on the planet," an insular self-contained world.
It was a corporate ethos that worked against the company as Intel tried and failed, repeatedly, to become a leader in chips for artificial intelligence. Projects were created, pursued for years and then abruptly shut down, either because Intel leadership lost patience or the technology fell short. Investments in newer chip designs invariably took a back seat to protecting and expanding the company's money-spinning mainstay -- generations of chips based on Intel's PC-era blueprint, called the x86 architecture.
"That technology was Intel's crown jewel -- proprietary and very profitable -- and they would do anything in their power to maintain that," said James D. Plummer, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University and a former Intel director.
Intel's leaders, at times, acknowledged the issue. Craig Barrett, a former Intel chief executive, once compared the x86 chip business to a creosote bush -- a plant that poisons competing plants around it. Still, the profits were high for so long, Intel did not really shift course.
At the time Intel considered a bid for Nvidia, the smaller company was widely viewed as a niche player. Its specialized chips were mostly used in machines for computer gamers, but Nvidia had started adapting its chips for other kinds of number-crunching fields such as oil and gas discovery.
Where Intel's microprocessor chips excelled in rapidly executing calculations one after another, Nvidia's chips delivered superior performance in graphics by breaking tasks up and spreading them across hundreds or thousands of processors working in parallel -- an approach that would pay off years later in artificial intelligence.
After the Nvidia idea was rejected, Intel, with the board's backing, focused on an in-house project, code-named Larrabee, to jump ahead of competitors in graphics. The project was led by Mr. Gelsinger, who had joined Intel in 1979 and rose steadily to become a senior executive.
The Larrabee effort consumed four years and hundreds of millions of dollars. Intel was confident, perhaps arrogant, that it could transform the field. In 2008, speaking at a conference in Shanghai, Mr. Gelsinger predicted, "Today's graphics architectures are coming to an end." Larrabee would be the new thing.
Larrabee was a hybrid, combining graphics with Intel's PC-style chip design. It was a bold plan to meld the two, with Intel's linchpin technology at the core. And it didn't work. Larrabee fell behind schedule, and its graphics performance lagged.
In 2009, Intel pulled the plug on the project, a few months after Mr. Gelsinger announced he was departing to become president and chief operating officer of EMC, a maker of data storage gear.
A decade after leaving Intel, Mr. Gelsinger still believed Larrabee was on the right track. In a 2019 oral history interview with the Computer History Museum, he recalled that people were beginning to use Nvidia chips and software for things beyond graphics. That was before the A.I. boom, but the direction was clear, Mr. Gelsinger said.
Larrabee's progress was halting, but, he insisted, it could have proved a winner with more corporate patience and investment. "Nvidia would be a fourth the size they are today as a company because I think Intel really had a shot right in that space," he said.
Now, three years after he was wooed back to take over Intel, Mr. Gelsinger still holds that view. But in a brief interview with The New York Times recently, he also emphasized the long-term commitment that would have been needed.
"I believed in it," he said. Had Intel kept at it, "I think the world would be very different today," Mr. Gelsinger said. "But you can't replay history on these things."
Some of the Larrabee technology was used in specialized chips for scientific supercomputing. But Intel's graphics push was curtailed. Nvidia continued investing for years not only in its chip designs but also in the crucial software to enable programmers to write a wider range of software applications on its hardware.
In later years, Intel continued to stumble in the A.I. market. In 2016, the company paid $ 400 million for Nervana Systems, one of a new crop of A.I. chip companies. Its chief executive, Naveen Rao, was named head of Intel's fledgling A.I. products unit.
Mr. Rao recounted a litany of problems he encountered at Intel, including corporate curbs on hiring engineers, manufacturing troubles and fierce competition from Nvidia, which was steadily improving its offerings. Still, his team managed to introduce two new chips, one of which was used by Facebook, he said.
But in December 2019, Mr. Rao said, he was stunned when, over his objections, Intel bought another A.I. chip start-up, Habana Labs, for $ 2 billion. That deal came just as Mr. Rao's team was close to completing a new chip. Mr. Rao's feelings are still raw about that move.
"You had a product that was ready to go, and you shot it -- and you bought this company for $ 2 billion that set you back two years," said Mr. Rao, who resigned shortly afterward and is now vice president of A.I. at Databricks, a software company.
Robert Swan, who was Intel's chief executive at the time, declined to comment.
Intel spread its efforts thin in A.I. by also developing multiple graphics-style chips -- products now discontinued -- as well as taking years to offer credible chips from the Habana Labs lineage. The latest version, Gaudi 3, has attracted interest from some companies like Inflection AI, a high-profile start-up, as a lower-cost alternative to Nvidia.
Under Mr. Gelsinger, Intel has made some progress catching up to Asian rivals in chip manufacturing technology. Intel has persuaded Washington to pledge billions of dollars in federal funding -- under the CHIPS and Science Act -- to help revive its fortunes. Still, it will be a steep climb.
Intel has lately designed new chips that have impressed industry analysts, including an A.I. chip for laptop PCs. Yet it is a measure of Intel's troubles that these new chips are being produced not in Intel factories but by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company -- a decision, made to exploit that company's more advanced production technology, that tends to reduce Intel's profit on the chips.
Today, Intel sees its A.I. opportunity emerging as the technology is increasingly used by mainstream businesses. Most corporate data resides in data centers still populated mainly by Intel servers. As more A.I. software is created for businesses, the more conventional computer processing will be needed to run those new applications.
But Intel is not at the forefront of building big A.I. systems. That is Nvidia's stronghold.
"In that race, they are so far ahead," Mr. Gelsinger said at a recent Deutsche Bank conference. "Given the other challenges that we have, we're just not going to be competing anytime soon."

Full text: Let's review the latest headlines: The United States is sending an advanced antimissile system to Israel, along with U.S. troops to operate it. Iran's foreign minister says there will be "no red lines" governing Iran's retaliation for any Israeli retaliation for Iran's latest missile retaliation. And reports from the Persian Gulf say Iran has quietly told Arab gulf states that if Iran is hit by Israel, Tehran may respond by striking Arab oil fields. If all of this does not terrify you, you are not paying attention.
May I make a suggestion?
How about sending our savvy C.I.A. director, Bill Burns, to meet his Iranian counterpart on neutral turf in Muscat, Oman, with a real strategy for coercive diplomacy vis-à-vis Iran that might actually work to change the Tehran regime's behavior? Burns could say to the Iranian intelligence chief something like the following:
"Let me tell you how your country looks from C.I.A. headquarters: You are infiltrated, exposed and isolated.
"Infiltrated? We heard that the latest joke going around Tehran is that your supreme leader is in hiding and the only ones who know where he is are the Israelis. Israel's intelligence is very good, but the only reason it could have penetrated your leadership and Hezbollah's so deeply is that so many Iranian and Lebanese Shiites hate both regimes and are ready to spy for Israel. So, you have no idea today when you talk to one another or to Hezbollah whether the person you're talking to is working for Israel or you.
"Exposed? You, Iran, have fired nearly 500 rockets at Israel since April and did not destroy a single military target or kill a single Israeli soldier. I don't have to tell you that on April 19, an Israeli airstrike on Iran damaged an S-300 air defense system at the Eighth Shekari Air Base in Isfahan. It was reported that Israel had deployed aerial drones and fired at least one missile from a warplane with stealth technology -- and you never saw them coming. You are N-A-K-E-D.
"And finally, you are isolated. Israel has badly damaged your Hezbollah militia, in which you have invested billions of dollars, so it is no longer your protection against an Israeli strike on your nuclear facilities. We have inflicted heavy damage on your Houthi militia in Yemen. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is fed up with you and wants you out of his country, and the Arab gulf states are now doing all they can to woo Assad away from Iran. The mainstream Iraqi Shiite party led by Muqtada al-Sadr hates you for the way your regime and militias have stolen so much oil revenue from Iraq and dragged your Iraqi proxies into your fight with Israel. Polls show how unpopular your regime is across the Arab world. Even Vladimir Putin does not want to see you get a nuclear bomb. A nuclear-armed Iran to his south? He's not that crazy.
"So this is a moment of truth for Iran. You have two paths: Either change your behavior or risk collapsing under the weight of your own recklessness. But when I say change your behavior, this time I mean something different from when we negotiated the nuclear agreement with you during the Obama administration.
"We made a mistake back then. We were obsessed with curbing the weapon you were never likely to use -- a nuclear bomb, if you could even make one -- while ignoring the weapon you were using every day to undermine our interests, the interests of our Arab allies, indeed the interests of most citizens in the region craving stability, not to mention Israel. And that was your implantation of militias armed with increasingly more precise and longer-and-longer-range rockets in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Your proxies crippled those states from the inside and threatened Israel and our Arab allies on the outside.
"We are not playing that game anymore. If you continue using your regional militias to attack Israel and you get into a no-holds-barred missile shootout with Tel Aviv, we are going to protect the Israelis, and you are going to get absolutely hammered. And if you carry out your threat to attack Saudi or U.A.E. oil fields to deter us, or close the Strait of Hormuz, your oil industry will be crushed. And your people will not forgive you. No wonder our intel tells us that you are panicked about an Israeli strike.
"So, here is what we propose: an end to Iranian imperialism in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Gaza in return for our commitment not to bring down your regime, but instead engage with you on building a regionwide collective security arrangement. You pull back, we pull back and Israel pulls back. But this nonsense of you nurturing failed states in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq so that their people can all fight and die while you cheer safely from Tehran -- that stops now.
"We are not out to humiliate you. You can call it a win for your regime that the Great Satan has recognized Iran as a necessary part of any regional collective security system. But the arming of Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Shiite militias in Iraq is over. You stop that, and we will get the Israelis to withdraw from southern Lebanon and Gaza. The Lebanese Army and a credible, lethal, international force will replace Hezbollah, and an Arab peacekeeping force will replace Hamas. We will also encourage Israel to limit any retaliatory strike against you.
"Otherwise, you are on your own."
My point is that if we want a peaceful and better Middle East, we need to sharpen the choices for Iran's clerical leadership: restart nuclear talks, end the supplying of thousands of rockets to its proxies and be able to stay in power -- or we will give Israel every weapon in our conventional arsenal, including the 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs designed to destroy their deeply buried nuclear facilities and the B-2 bombers to deliver them.
As Karim Sadjadpour, Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it to me: The supreme leader Ali Khamenei "has long believed that continued enmity with America and Israel is more vital to the survival of his regime than rapprochement or reform. For that dynamic to possibly shift, Khamenei must face a profound sense of existential angst, one that convinces him that the current trajectory risks the very collapse of his regime."
Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the former U.S. Central Command chief, who oversaw the 2020 killing of Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the elite Quds Force within the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, agrees: "Iran may seem unpredictable at times," he said in The Atlantic, "but it respects American strength and responds to deterrence. When we withdraw, Iran advances. When we assert ourselves -- having weighed the risks and prepared for all possibilities -- Iran retreats."
That is why we need to confront Iran with an overwhelming, credible threat of force, coupled with a diplomatic survival pathway out, but one that this time addresses both Iran's nuclear threat and regional behavior. Our job is to change Iran's behavior; regime change is the job of the Iranian people. I believe the best way for that regime to lose its grip is to deprive it of the oxygen of permanent conflict with Israel and America -- and all the excuses that Iran's clerical tyrants give for why their people are so isolated and impoverished.
But I don't stop there. We also need to sharpen the choices for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: We must not be in the business of making Israel safe so that a radical messianic government can annex the West Bank. If we are going to keep resupplying Israel with missiles and even dispatch U.S.-run missile systems, Bibi needs to purge the settler lunatics from his cabinet, forge a national unity coalition and agree to open talks with a reformed Palestinian Authority -- with a new technocratic cabinet led by credible leaders like former Prime Minister Salam Fayyad -- on a two-state solution.
That would pave the way for the U.A.E. and other moderate Arab states to deploy troops to Gaza and for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel and forge a security agreement with Washington.
Let me put this as clearly as I can: This crisis in the Middle East will not end until Israel clearly defines its eastern border and declares that everything beyond it is reserved for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, once Palestinians meet the legitimate security requirements Israel needs to accept a two-state solution. Israel needs to be out of the Jewish settlements business -- now. Israel's creeping West Bank annexation is destroying its legitimacy as a democracy, when its self-defense requires all the friends it can get in the region and beyond.
Even more important, though, this crisis in the Middle East will not end until Iran, in effect, defines its western border and declares that everything beyond that is for the Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis, Iraqis, Israelis and Palestinians to decide -- so long as they respect Iran's legitimate security needs. Iran needs to be out of the Islamic imperialism business.
In short, we really need some creative, coercive U.S. diplomacy right now to finally put an end to both Israel's and Iran's colonial projects, which feed each other. That is the necessary but not sufficient condition for defusing the madness in this region. Israel cannot afford to be in a long-term, large-scale missile war with Iran. It is too small. Iran is too big and the United States is running low on interceptors to protect Israel -- should Iran and all its proxies fire on Israel at once. And Iran cannot afford to be in a large-scale missile war with Israel because the United States and its allies have run out of patience with its reckless adventurism that is destabilizing the whole region.

1,200 Walgreens to Close
In Turnaround Effort
Walgreens plans to close about 1,200 stores over the next three years, its parent company said on Tuesday, in an effort by the struggling pharmacy giant to cut costs and change focus.
The chain, which is owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance, announced the closures in its latest quarterly earnings report, released on Tuesday.
The closures will allow Walgreens to "respond more dynamically to shifts in consumer behavior and buying preferences," Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, told investors during an earnings call on Tuesday.
There are more than 8,000 Walgreens stores in the United States, Mr. Wentworth said, and about 6,000 of them are profitable.
"While the decision to close the store is never an easy one, we feel confident in our ability to continue to serve our customers," Mr. Wentworth said, "and we intend to follow our historic practice to redeploy the majority of the work force in those stores that we closed."
About 500 of the closures will take place in the current fiscal year, which runs through September 2025, but the company did not say where they would occur.
The company reported an operating loss of nearly $ 1 billion in the three months through August, about twice the loss in the same period last year. Its stock price jumped more than 14 percent on Tuesday afternoon.
Walgreens has said that spending by lower-income consumers in particular was lagging, driven by high inflation and depleted savings. AMANDA HOLPUCH

ASML Sees Weakness
In Semiconductor Market
The computer chip equipment maker ASML forecast on Tuesday lower than expected 2025 sales and bookings on sustained weakness in parts of the semiconductor market, pushing its shares to their biggest one-day drop since 1998.
The company said that despite a boom in A.I.-related chips, other parts of the semiconductor market have been weaker for longer than expected, leading companies that make logic chips to delay orders and customers that make memory chips to only plan "limited" new capacity additions.
ASML, Europe's biggest tech firm, is the leading supplier of equipment used to make chips.
"We expect our 2025 total net sales to grow to a range between 30-35 billion euros, which is the lower half of the range" previously forecast, said the chief executive, Christophe Fouquet.
Chip market weakness "is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness," he said.
Trading in the shares was halted several times in Amsterdam before they closed down 16 percent at 668.10 euros.
The company's earnings showed net profit of 2.1 billion euros on sales of 7.5 billion euros, or $ 8.2 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' estimates.
However, the company's bookings were 2.6 billion euros, well below forecasts of between 4 billion euros and 6 billion euros.
ASML's share price slumped over the summer months after news that Intel would cut its capital spending, and weakness in memory chip prices.
But ASML's change in outlook still surprised analysts. REUTERS

What the World Must Know About Iran: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Oct. 7, 2023, marked the worst tragedy for the state of Israel and the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Some 1,200 people were murdered in Israel, and approximately 250 people were taken hostage on a single day; 101 of those souls are still held captive in Gaza. Hezbollah in Lebanon began its attack on the north of Israel the very next day, forcing nearly 70,000 Israelis from their homes. Iran, launching attacks first on April 13 and again on Oct. 1, has sent millions of Israelis into the safety of their shelters.
A year later, one must ask: What were Hamas's leaders hoping for, and what are Iran's leaders seeking to achieve?
What the Israeli military and political establishment failed to understand, in part, was the extent to which Hamas was driven by the goal of waging religious war. "The intel was there, but I underestimated the jihadi component of Hamas's and Sinwar's calculus," a senior Israel Defense Forces intelligence commander told me early in the war, referring to Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader.
We also failed to act on the warning on the extent to which Hamas interpreted Israel's domestic instability as a weakness that would impede Israel's resolve and ability to respond to an attack. Intelligence has since shown how the heads of Hamas believed that at our weakest, we would not be capable of uniting.
According to Hamas's plan, after its attack on Israel, the remaining components of Iran's axis of evil -- Hamas in the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and the Shiite militias in Syria, Iraq and Iran -- would join in a regional war with the ultimate goal of destroying the one and only Jewish state. A secret Hamas document reportedly uncovered in Gaza testified to such assertion: Written by the Hamas leader on Jan. 8, 2023, in it he claimed to have received a commitment from Iran that the axis would join the attack against Israel once Hamas's Al-Aqsa Flood plan to invade Israel was activated.
So three rationales stood behind Hamas's attack: jihadi fanaticism, an assessment that Israel was at a point of weakness and loyalty to Iran and its axis of evil. It is for these reasons that Oct. 7 and Iran's subsequent attacks on Israel must serve as a stark warning to the region and the world regarding the Islamic republic's uncompromising intentions and its outlook on the West.
Iran's religious leadership is devoted to exporting its fundamentalist ideology, driven by the pursuit of hegemony and captivated by the thought of its opponents' violent subjugation. I ask that other nations not make the same mistake we made and underestimate this component of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's calculus.
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has established around Israel, neighboring states and international forces in the region a "ring of fire" of terrorist armies with capabilities comparable with those of nations. They have tens of thousands of rockets, drones and commando forces ready for attack. The same capabilities with which Iran targets Israel were previously used by Tehran and its proxies against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. Furthermore, while it consistently displays acts of regional aggression, it continues to rush to acquire nuclear capabilities, covertly and overtly.
Hamas's leader and Ayatollah Khamenei share the same ambition: to annihilate Israel. But Ayatollah Khamenei only had greater strategic patience, leading him to a different conclusion on the right time to launch a full-scale attack on my nation. Make no mistake: Iran is preparing, building and waiting for the right moment of weakness to pounce. It did so in Lebanon, using Hezbollah to exploit the state's economic hardships to strengthen the organization's national foothold. It did the same in Syria, amid the havoc of Syria's civil war. It did so in Yemen as well, exploiting the political vacuum and dire humanitarian conditions, and is currently expanding its reach, exploiting the instability of Africa's Sahel region.
In a post-Oct. 7 reality, it is clear that Israel must -- and the world should -- be proactive and determined in the face of the threat the Iranian regime poses to Israel's existence and the region's future. The world cannot overlook Iran's role in the strangling of freedom of navigation and the harming of global commerce in the Red Sea or its technological and military support for Russia in Ukraine. The regime and its axis must face a strong and united Middle East, led and supported by the United States, that is ready to take the initiative to prevent the realization of the Iranian vision of a regional Oct. 7. Now is the time to bolster regional cooperation and make a broad effort to confront Iran.
On the military front: Governments must engage forcefully and proactively with Iranian aggression and systematically degrade its proxy capabilities. This is the responsibility Israel has undertaken this week in its military action against Hezbollah and the Houthis and as it weighs how to respond to Iran's latest missile attack. We must also prepare for the right moment to remove the threat of Iran developing a nuclear weapon, should that clear red line be crossed.
On the regional front: We must strengthen the regional architecture founded on the Middle Eastern Air Defense (MEAD) mechanism and the Abraham Accords. We should continue developing Middle Eastern aerial coordination while exploring the prospects of offensive coordination to be deployed if and when needed.
On the economic front: Nations must cut off the financial pipeline that funds terrorism by strengthening sanctions, targeting key Iranian industries and pursuing its assets abroad.
On the legal front: Governments that have not done so already should place the Islamic republic and its branches, including the Revolutionary Guards, on their terrorist lists. They should also stamp out Iranian cells operating globally.
On the political front: They should empower the Iranian opposition and isolate the Iranian regime in major international forums.
Such a concerted campaign will require time and resources and a solemn, enduring, united commitment. Israel, along with Ukraine and Taiwan, is a democratic outpost threatened by an axis of subversion. If one falls, a domino effect will ensue, and nations caught in between will need to choose a side.
Israel experienced its most painful tragedy on Oct. 7 but also underwent a ringing awakening: A fundamentalist terrorist state cannot acquire lethal capabilities and be expected to act rationally, as we once expected of Hamas. As someone who has served as Israel's minister of defense and the 20th chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, I believe Israel is the strongest nation in the Middle East, fighting a just war for the nation's future and its citizens, and that's why it will emerge victorious.
Israel learned the lesson of Oct. 7; we now bear the responsibility of sharing the lesson with the world. The time to act against Iran is now. It's not only a matter of necessity for Israel but also one of strategic imperative for the region and moral clarity for the world for the sake of peace and prosperity in the Middle East.

Biden to Let Chip Projects Skip Environmental Review: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Ngo, Madeleine

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The legislation, which would weaken federal environmental reviews for certain semiconductor manufacturing projects, has divided Democrats.
More than two years ago, President Biden signed a law that aimed to ramp up the nation's production of semiconductors by offering generous subsidies and tax credits to companies. Since then, chip manufacturers have invested billions of dollars into new plants across the country.
But industry groups, along with federal officials, have long warned that lengthy federal environmental reviews could delay manufacturing projects for months or years, which could slow the country's ability to scale up its chip manufacturing capacity.
In the coming days, Mr. Biden is set to sign a bill that would weaken federal environmental reviews for certain semiconductor manufacturing projects that receive subsidies through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The bill, which has divided Democrats, underscores the challenges facing Mr. Biden as he tries to advance his economic agenda alongside his ambitious climate goals.
The legislation would exempt qualifying chip projects from reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies to assess the potential environmental effects of proposed major federal actions before they can proceed. The House passed the bill last week, and the Senate unanimously passed it in December.
Proponents say the legislation would help to expedite the construction of chip manufacturing facilities, which would strengthen the U.S. economy and help to reduce the nation's dependence on other countries for critical chips that can power items as varied as smartphones, cars and weapons systems. They say that projects will still have to comply with various federal, state and local environmental regulations and permitting requirements.
Democrats who oppose the bill, however, say it would allow companies to skirt an important step aimed at reducing potential harms to the environment and workers. They argue that taxpayer-funded projects should be subject to a more holistic federal environmental review process, which would allow for more transparency and community input.
Some Democrats and environmental groups are urging Mr. Biden to reject the bill. Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House science committee, said she hoped Mr. Biden would veto it.
"I think it was a mistake," she said.
Ms. Lofgren, along with the top Democrats on the energy and natural resources committees, said in a letter late last month that they were concerned about the semiconductor industry's "legacy of leaving superfund sites" and history of using chemicals that have been linked to a higher risk of miscarriages among chip workers. "History does not indicate that semiconductor manufacturing should be completely absolved from any NEPA reviews," they wrote.
Ms. Lofgren said the chip industry has since made "great strides," and she supported its further development in the United States. But she said she worried that the bill would result in less transparency about companies' use of chemicals during the manufacturing process, including PFAS, the so-called forever chemicals.
"Hopefully, there won't be a time when we look back sorry for this effort," Ms. Lofgren said.
In a statement, Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, said, "A piece of legislation that allows these facilities to completely bypass NEPA's critical environmental review and public input processes, while also stripping communities' right to legally challenge these projects under NEPA, is unconscionable and never, under any circumstances, should have been pushed through the House."
White House officials say that Mr. Biden, whose administration has already announced more than $ 30 billion in grant awards for chip companies, will sign the bill.
"President Biden plans to sign this bipartisan legislation, which will allow us to continue our efforts to ensure Americans across the country can benefit from the promise of the Investing in America agenda while protecting communities and the environment," a White House official said in a statement.
Increasing domestic chip production is a key aspect of Mr. Biden's economic policy agenda, which largely focuses on bolstering American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are currently produced in America, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in a CNBC interview last week that it was an "important bill" that would allow companies to more quickly build semiconductor manufacturing facilities and ramp up production of chips on American soil.
"Of course, we care deeply about clean air, clean water and the environment," Ms. Raimondo added. "That being said, this is a national security imperative. We have to act with urgency and go as fast as possible."
A Commerce Department spokesperson said Ms. Raimondo would also work to ensure that projects "preserve their safety and environmental commitments."
Other Democratic lawmakers defended the bill and underscored that projects would still have to comply with various federal environmental laws.
Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona and co-author of the bill, said it would help to prevent "unnecessary delays" in building out the country's chip manufacturing capacity. Arizona has received some of the largest new semiconductor investments, with Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company breaking ground on new facilities there in recent years.
Mr. Kelly also said the bill had been narrowly tailored. It would exempt projects from NEPA review if they had started construction by the end of the year or if federal financial assistance did not make up more than 10 percent of their total cost. Projects that receive only federal loans, rather than grants, would also be exempt.
Mr. Kelly added that the bill was "not a rollback of any environmental laws," and projects would still have to comply with bedrock environmental protection laws, such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
"The whole plan behind this legislation was to make sure that the CHIPS and Science Act had the maximum impact on our economy and our national security," Mr. Kelly said.
David Isaacs, the vice president of government affairs at the Semiconductor Industry Association, which lobbied for the bill, said in a statement that the industry "is a global leader in promoting environmental sustainability and is one of America's safest manufacturing sectors for workers, thanks to advanced fabrication techniques and stringent safety standards and emissions controls."
Some Democratic proponents of the bill said it would strengthen national security by helping the United States build a reliable supply of semiconductors. The most advanced ones are critical for artificial intelligence, smartphones and sensitive military hardware. But the bulk of those chips are currently produced in Taiwan. American officials have long had concerns about the economic and national security consequences if China were to invade Taiwan.
Representative Scott Peters, Democrat of California and co-author of the bill, said he worried that the nation's dependence on Taiwan's semiconductors could become a critical issue. He added that some of the concerns about the environmental effects of semiconductor projects were "not sufficient."
"I was pretty unimpressed with those arguments," Mr. Peters said. "I guess at the end of the day, so was President Biden."

WASHINGTON — More than two years ago, President Joe Biden signed a law that aimed to ramp up the nation’s production of semiconductors by offering generous subsidies and tax credits to companies. Since then, chip manufacturers have invested billions of dollars into new plants across the country.
But industry groups, along with federal officials, have long warned that lengthy federal environmental reviews could delay manufacturing projects for months or years, which could slow the country’s ability to scale up its chip manufacturing capacity.
In the coming days, Biden is set to sign a bill that would weaken federal environmental reviews for certain semiconductor manufacturing projects that receive subsidies through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The bill, which has divided Democrats, underscores the challenges facing Biden as he tries to advance his economic agenda alongside his ambitious climate goals.
The legislation would exempt qualifying chip projects from reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires federal agencies to assess the potential environmental effects of proposed major federal actions before they can proceed. The House passed the bill last week, and the Senate unanimously passed it in December.
Proponents say the legislation would help to expedite the construction of chip manufacturing facilities, which would strengthen the U.S. economy and help to reduce the nation’s dependence on other countries for critical chips that can power items as varied as smartphones, cars and weapons systems. They say that projects will still have to comply with various federal, state and local environmental regulations and permitting requirements.
Democrats who oppose the bill, however, say it would allow companies to skirt an important step aimed at reducing potential harms to the environment and workers. They argue that taxpayer-funded projects should be subject to a more holistic federal environmental review process, which would allow for more transparency and community input.
Some Democrats and environmental groups are urging Biden to reject the bill. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House science committee, said she hoped Biden would veto it.
“I think it was a mistake,” she said.
Lofgren, along with the top Democrats on the energy and natural resources committees, said in a letter late last month that they were concerned about the semiconductor industry’s “legacy of leaving superfund sites” and history of using chemicals that have been linked to a higher risk of miscarriages among chip workers. “History does not indicate that semiconductor manufacturing should be completely absolved from any NEPA reviews,” they wrote.
Lofgren said the chip industry has since made “great strides,” and she supported its further development in the United States. But she said she worried that the bill would result in less transparency about companies’ use of chemicals during the manufacturing process, including PFAS, the so-called forever chemicals.
“Hopefully, there won’t be a time when we look back sorry for this effort,” Lofgren said.
In a statement, Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, said, “A piece of legislation that allows these facilities to completely bypass NEPA’s critical environmental review and public input processes, while also stripping communities’ right to legally challenge these projects under NEPA, is unconscionable and never, under any circumstances, should have been pushed through the House.”
White House officials say that Biden, whose administration has already announced more than $30 billion in grant awards for chip companies, will sign the bill.
“President Biden plans to sign this bipartisan legislation, which will allow us to continue our efforts to ensure Americans across the country can benefit from the promise of the Investing in America agenda while protecting communities and the environment,” a White House official said in a statement.
Increasing domestic chip production is a key aspect of Biden’s economic policy agenda, which largely focuses on bolstering American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas. Only about 10% of the world’s semiconductors are currently produced in America, down from about 37% in 1990.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in a CNBC interview last week that it was an “important bill” that would allow companies to more quickly build semiconductor manufacturing facilities and ramp up production of chips on U.S. soil.
“Of course, we care deeply about clean air, clean water and the environment,” Raimondo added. “That being said, this is a national security imperative. We have to act with urgency and go as fast as possible.”
A Commerce Department spokesperson said Raimondo would also work to ensure that projects “preserve their safety and environmental commitments.”
Other Democratic lawmakers defended the bill and underscored that projects would still have to comply with various federal environmental laws.
Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a co-author of the bill, said it would help to prevent “unnecessary delays” in building out the country’s chip manufacturing capacity. Arizona has received some of the largest new semiconductor investments, with Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. breaking ground on new facilities there in recent years.
Kelly also said the bill had been narrowly tailored. It would exempt projects from NEPA review if they had started construction by the end of the year or if federal financial assistance did not comprise more than 10% of their total cost. Projects that receive only federal loans, rather than grants, would also be exempt.
Kelly added that the bill was “not a rollback of any environmental laws,” and projects would still have to comply with bedrock environmental protection laws, such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
“The whole plan behind this legislation was to make sure that the CHIPS and Science Act had the maximum impact on our economy and our national security,” Kelly said.
David Isaacs, the vice president of government affairs at the Semiconductor Industry Association, which lobbied for the bill, said in a statement that the industry “is a global leader in promoting environmental sustainability and is one of America’s safest manufacturing sectors for workers, thanks to advanced fabrication techniques and stringent safety standards and emissions controls.”
Some Democratic proponents of the bill said it would strengthen national security by helping the United States build a reliable supply of semiconductors. The most advanced ones are critical for artificial intelligence, smartphones and sensitive military hardware. But the bulk of those chips are currently produced in Taiwan. U.S. officials have long had concerns about the economic and national security consequences if China were to invade Taiwan.
Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., a co-author of the bill, said he worried that the nation’s dependence on Taiwan’s semiconductors could become a critical issue. He added that some of the concerns about the environmental effects of semiconductor projects were “not sufficient.”
“I was pretty unimpressed with those arguments,” Peters said. “I guess at the end of the day, so was President Biden.”

Intel Is Said To Be in Sights Of Qualcomm: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While Intel has struggled in recent years, other chipmakers are thriving because of a boom in demand.
The chipmaker Qualcomm has approached its rival Intel in recent days about the possibility of acquiring the slumping Silicon Valley giant, two people familiar with the matter said Friday, requesting anonymity because the talks were confidential.
Qualcomm has not yet made an official offer for Intel, one of the people said, and the obstacles to a deal remain steep. Any deal would likely draw significant regulatory scrutiny, given the mammoth size and national security importance of both chip companies. It is unclear whether regulators would allow Qualcomm to buy Intel without taking on its struggling foundry business, and it remains equally unclear whether Qualcomm would want to take on that complex endeavor.
A deal would also be costly. Intel, which has seen its shares fall nearly 40 percent over the last year, has a market capitalization of $ 93 billion. Qualcomm, which has seen its shares rise 55 percent, has a market value of $ 169 billion.
Qualcomm and Intel, through spokeswomen, both declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Qualcomm's approach.
That any chip-making rival would consider trying to buy Intel would have been inconceivable a decade ago. But years of management issues and whiffs on technology transitions have weakened what was once one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies.
Intel missed out on selling chips for mobile phones and has failed to capitalize on the boom in artificial intelligence, a field rival Nvidia now dominates with specialized chips used in data centers. Intel's chip manufacturing operations, once the most advanced, also lost a technology lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Intel's problems were underscored in early August, when it announced a $ 1.6 billion quarterly loss and plans to cut 15,000 jobs. The company, the largest planned recipient of federal financing under legislation called the CHIPS Act, on Monday announced other moves that include plans to pause the setting up of new plants in Germany and Poland.
Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is a leader in cellular technology and provides chips used in flagship smartphones from companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics.
Unlike Intel, Qualcomm has never operated factories, a costly business that most chip designers avoid. So it would seem more likely to be interested in the Intel operations that design chips, as well as its broad expertise in PC software and channels for selling those systems, said Patrick Little, a former Qualcomm executive who now is chief executive of SiFive, a Silicon Valley start-up that sells rival microprocessor designs.
"Those are things Qualcomm would have to mature on their own over time," Mr. Little said. "If they worked with or somehow had a piece of Intel that could accelerate that part of their strategy."
Any effort to buy Intel would likely face a tough antitrust review and would be scrutinized closely on national security grounds, since its design and manufacturing operations are important for defense applications and overall U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors.
Lauren Hirsch reported from New York and Don Clark from San Francisco.

Chipmaker at the Heart of the U.S.-China Tech War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Efforts by the Beijing-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, to break through innovation barriers have landed it in a geopolitical tech battle.
In a sprawling factory in eastern Shanghai, where marshy plains have long since been converted into industrial parks, China's most advanced chipmaker has been hard at work testing the limits of U.S. authority.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, is manufacturing chips with features less than one-15,000th of the thickness of a sheet of paper. The chips pack together enough computing power to create advancements like artificial intelligence and 5G networks.
It's a feat that has been achieved by just a few companies globally -- and one that has landed SMIC in the middle of a crucial geopolitical rivalry. U.S. officials say such advanced chip technology is central not just to commercial businesses but also to military superiority. They have been fighting to keep it out of Chinese hands, by barring China from buying both the world's most cutting-edge chips and the machinery to make them.
Whether China can advance and outrace the United States technologically now hinges on SMIC, a partly state-backed company that is the sole maker of advanced chips in the country and has become its de facto national semiconductor champion. SMIC pumps out millions of chips a month for other companies that design them, such as Huawei, the Chinese technology firm under U.S. sanctions, as well as American firms like Qualcomm.
So far, SMIC hasn't been able to produce chips as advanced as those of rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Taiwan, or others in South Korea and the United States. But it is racing forward with a new A.I. chip for Huawei called the Ascend 910C, which is expected to be released this year.
Huawei's chip is not as fast or sophisticated as the coveted processors from Nvidia, the U.S. chip giant, which the White House has banned for sale in China. SMIC can also most likely make only a small fraction of what Chinese firms want to buy, experts said.
But the chip would still be a boon for China's A.I. ambitions. Nvidia's components are the secret sauce in A.I. computing clusters that can train chatbots, unlock new medicines and help design hypersonic missiles. If Huawei, with SMIC's help, can make more A.I. chips in the coming years, that could blunt the impact of American technology restrictions -- and perhaps one day cut into Nvidia's lead.
SMIC did not respond to requests for comment. Huawei and the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees technology controls, declined to comment.
In an interview in June, Gina M. Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that the United States led the world in A.I., and that tech restrictions were helping to maintain that lead. "We have protected, to a large extent, our most sophisticated technology from getting to China," she said.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said China opposed "politicizing and weaponizing trade, scientific and technological issues." He added, "Sanctions and repression will not deter the development of China and Chinese enterprises."
Beijing has invested more than $ 150 billion in the chip industry, including a $ 47 billion investment fund announced in May, helping to fuel a stunning factory expansion. SMIC alone operates more than a dozen chip manufacturing facilities, called fabs, around China, and is planning or constructing at least 10 more, according to Paul Triolo, a tech expert at Albright Stonebridge who tracks the industry.
SMIC, which has nearly 19,000 employees, spent $ 4.5 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of this year, more than it earned in revenue, according to its financial filings. Among contract chipmakers, it lags only TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in South Korea in sales. It shipped nearly four million wafers in the first half of the year, each of which can be split into hundreds or thousands of chips.
U.S. export controls have "forced China and Chinese companies to get better across the board," Mr. Triolo said. While these companies face major hurdles, "they have already made significant progress to get where they are now, and you can't really underestimate their ability to doggedly pursue overcoming the other obstacles."
A national chip champion
SMIC was founded in eastern Shanghai in 2000 by Richard Chang, a Taiwanese American who worked for decades at the U.S. chipmaker Texas Instruments and became known as the father of Chinese semiconductors. SMIC was immediately viewed as China's answer to TSMC, which is the world's biggest maker of cutting-edge chips.
To court overseas engineers, SMIC created a housing development with an international school and opened churches near its factories. The company hired from TSMC's research and development team, including Liang Mong-song, SMIC's current co-chief executive.
SMIC built new fabs at a breakneck pace, becoming the world's third-biggest chip foundry -- the term for a business that makes chips on behalf of other companies -- within four years of its founding. It offered cheap prices to firms like Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments. In 2004, it listed on stock exchanges in New York and Hong Kong.
SMIC's ties with the Chinese government have grown closer over time. Its biggest shareholders -- China Information and Communication Technology Group, Datang Holdings and China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund -- are all state-owned. By 2015, around half of SMIC's board seats were controlled by people with close ties to the state.
Government support did not guarantee success. After a spate of overbuilding, SMIC was forced to sell off several facilities. In 2019, it delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, listing in Shanghai the next year.
By then, China's chip industry had attracted U.S. attention as a national security issue. In 2019, the Trump administration persuaded the Netherlands to block a sale by the Dutch firm ASML to SMIC of its most advanced chipmaking machine over concerns that it would aid China militarily.
In 2020, the White House slapped trade restrictions on SMIC after the publication of a report detailing its links to a major Chinese defense conglomerate and military-affiliated universities. SMIC denied connections to the military. The Biden administration later tightened the restrictions.
But the rules have allowed for workarounds. Companies have continued selling less advanced equipment to SMIC's new factories by obtaining special licenses and routing sales through non-U.S. subsidiaries and employees.
Given these loopholes, some said it was no mystery that SMIC had progressed.
"The fence has gotten higher, but we've decided to leave open the front, side and back gate," said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation.
Today, North American customers account for about a sixth of SMIC's revenue. The company's boxy silver factory in eastern Shanghai where it makes advanced chips for Huawei sits in a compound connected to other factories that sell chips that go into products sold around the United States, and buy machinery from American companies.
According to Chinese customs data, China's imports of chipmaking equipment in the first seven months of this year surged 53 percent from the same period in 2023.
Officials seeking tougher limits on SMIC have faced pushback from those who say that could damage the United States economically, since SMIC also works with American companies.
When Congress tried in 2022 to pass a law barring the Pentagon from buying products containing SMIC chips, automakers, weapons companies and others complained, saying the components were woven through their supply chains, people familiar with the discussions said.
The law, which eventually passed, was changed to give defense suppliers five more years to cut their ties with Chinese chipmakers that had military connections.
"U.S. companies would say, accurately, if you tried to put SMIC out of business tomorrow, there would be collateral damage for U.S. companies," said Chris Miller, the author of "Chip War," a history of the industry.
Necessity breeds innovation
In August 2023, as Ms. Raimondo visited China on a diplomatic trip, Huawei released a phone with a SMIC chip that exceeded the technology limits previously set by U.S. restrictions. The timing was viewed as a slap in the face to the United States.
Analysts and U.S. chip executives concluded that SMIC had repurposed less advanced equipment to make a more advanced chip.
Both TSMC and Intel, the U.S. chip giant, tried the same method in the past. But the strategy can result in many faulty chips, and Intel found it wasn't commercially viable, semiconductor experts said.
In response, U.S. officials have been drafting even tighter rules that would target some SMIC factories. They have also pushed Dutch and Japanese officials to stop supplying SMIC's most advanced fabs. This month, the Netherlands issued new rules that brought its export controls in line with U.S. regulations.
The limited access to advanced equipment has undoubtedly held SMIC back, and some experts argue that, as competitors like TSMC and Intel innovate, and as the United States and its allies ramp up their technology controls, China will be left further behind. The constraints already appear to have slowed the rollout of some of Huawei's new products.
Galen Zeng, a senior research manager at IDC, a market intelligence firm, estimated that SMIC would most likely lag other international chip giants by three to five years even if China developed substitutes soon for critical chipmaking equipment.
Still, Dylan Patel, the chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, a research firm, estimated that SMIC could make 1.2 million A.I. chips for Huawei next year, double this year -- far fewer than what China needs or what American chip designers make, but indicating an upward trajectory.
In an electronics market in Shenzhen in April, John Wu, a Huawei vendor, said Huawei's A.I. chips had limited availability. But he expressed confidence that Chinese firms would continue to develop, and that competition would ultimately hurt the United States.
He described the U.S. restrictions using a Chinese expression -- like "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet," he said.

You Cannot Put a Price On Fare That Is Free: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Free hot dogs. Free fried olives. Free truffle popcorn. Did we mention it was free?
Need I say more? I suppose I will, mainly for the sake of hitting my required word count. In, sorry, this economy, free stuff is the ultimate treat. Especially at a bar or restaurant, as the prices of food and drinks continue to rise and rise, seemingly with no ceiling. Even something small, like a bowl of cheese balls at a dive bar (ahem, the Levee) is a touch that makes you feel like a V.I.P., no matter where (or who) you are.
Free hot dogs with cheap beer
I do wonder how long Rudy's Bar & Grill in Hell's Kitchen can keep getting away with their prices. Should we be worried about them, financially, when they're serving $ 5 beer-and-shot combos and $ 12 pitchers? They don't seem worried, at least Baron Von Swine doesn't -- he's a human-height pig statue, pantsless in a red tuxedo jacket, that cheerfully waves you in beneath the neon sign on Ninth Avenue.
The lore runs deep at Rudy's, which is otherwise a classically sticky-floored dive -- they claim to have been one of the first bars in New York to get a liquor license when prohibition ended. There's cold, hard video evidence, though, that Anthony Bourdain enjoyed Rudy's signature: a free hot dog with any purchase. Is it the most basic possible hot dog inelegantly smeared with ketchup and mustard? Sure. But remember, it's free. (And, to Baron Von Swine's relief, they're beef.)
627 Ninth Avenue (West 44th Street)
The most luxurious possible gratis spread
It's not always cheap beer and free dogs. Sometimes you have to shell out a bit more for your drink before you're awarded the free food. Case in point: The Polo Bar in Midtown serves an immaculate spread of fried green olives, housemade potato chips and herby, warm nuts with the price of a drink (expect $ 16 beers) at the glowy, leather-boothed bar upstairs and, of course, the emotional warfare of trying to get a notoriously elusive reservation. (They're technically on Resy, but calling or stopping by in person is the way to make it happen). Another no-cost luxury that makes you feel like a billionaire: When you move from the bar to the buzzy dining room downstairs (bedecked with horse photos and riding paraphernalia), a server follows, carrying your drinks on a tray. Baller!
1 East 55th Street (Madison Avenue)
Sometimes, you just want a bowl of popcorn
A bowl of popcorn might pale in comparison to a free hot dog or fried olives. But the truffle popcorn at Bar Belly in Chinatown, is better than it needs to be, given the price (free 99), and given the otherwise unremarkable nature of the bar (low lit, well-executed classic cocktails, good for most occasions but standout for none). It's not a tiny portion of popcorn, but I still usually finish it before I've even sipped my martini (dirty, vodka), and they've been known to refill it on some occasions. My colleague Lee Manansala was also impressed -- when he went to Bar Belly, he told me, "I made such a big deal about that popcorn, they gave me a free hat." Double free!

Bonus round!
One of my New York nightlife white whales is the free chicken soup at the West Village cocktail bar Employee's Only, served to whoever's left at the bar at closing time. Is it worth staying up until 3 a.m. to try for myself? Can someone reading this vouch? All intel is welcome.

Markets Pedal in Place Ahead of Anticipated Fed Decision: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/markets-pedal-place-ahead-anticipated-fed/docview/3106251186/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stock indexes remained stuck in place on Tuesday as Wall Street made few big moves ahead of what's expected to be the first cut to interest rates in more than four years.
The S&P 500 edged up by 1.49, or less than 0.1 percent, to 5,634.58. It remains 0.6 percent below its closing high set in July, and it briefly rose above that mark during the morning.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 15.90 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 41,606.18 from its own record set the day before, while the Nasdaq composite edged up by 35.93, or 0.2 percent, to 17,628.06.
Intel helped drive the market with a gain of 2.7 percent after a series of announcements, including an expansion of its partnership with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips. Intel also detailed plans to build its foundry business.
That helped offset a 2.2 percent drop for Philip Morris International, which said it expects to record a loss of $ 220 million against its third-quarter results because of the sale of its Vectura Group inhaled-therapeutics subsidiary.
The calm movements for the U.S. stock market overall were a sharp departure from previous weeks, during which the S&P 500 briefly fell nearly 10 percent below its high. At the time, global markets were reeling on worries that a slowing U.S. economy could fall into a recession, along with some technical factors that forced hedge funds around the world to back out of a popular trade all at once.
Since then, excitement has built over an announcement scheduled for Wednesday afternoon from the Federal Reserve. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will cut the federal funds rate, which has been sitting in a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent for more than a year.
Lower rates would make things easier for the economy, which has already begun to slow because it's become so expensive to borrow money for everything from houses to cars to corporate debt. The Fed has been keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of stifling high inflation.
Now that inflation is down substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed believes it can shift its focus more toward protecting the job market and economy. The only question is how much the Fed will cut rates by, and that is a delicate balancing act.
While lowering rates gives a boost to the overall economy and to financial markets, it can also give inflation more fuel. Some critics say the Fed is already moving too late to help the economy, while others warn of inflation staying stubbornly higher than it has in the past.
The general expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to deliver a larger-than-usual cut of half of a percentage point on Wednesday, according to data from CME Group. But it's not a certainty. Traders are still betting on a 35 percent probability for a traditional move of a quarter of a percentage point.
Economic reports released Tuesday did little to change those expectations. One said U.S. shoppers spent more at retailers last month than expected. That's an encouraging signal indicating strength for the heart of the U.S. economy, but details under the surface may have been more discouraging. After ignoring automobiles and fuel, sales at U.S. retailers last month were a touch weaker than economists expected.
"This data isn't going to decide the issue for the Fed, one way or the other," Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley, said about the size of Wednesday's rate cut.
A separate report that came later in the morning said U.S. industrial production returned to growth in August and was stronger than economists expected.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.64 percent from 3.62 percent late Monday. The two-year yield rose to 3.59 percent from 3.56 percent.

Intel Awarded $3 Billion to Expand Manufacturing of Advanced Semiconductors for U.S. Military: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chipmaker, which has been struggling, said on Monday that it obtained a new government grant, signed a contract with Amazon and would pause some initiatives.
Intel, a Silicon Valley giant that has struggled after a series of stumbles, said on Monday that it had signed new contracts and made further belt-tightening plans as it tries to cope with a deep slump in its business.
The company, which had embarked on a plan to expand its production capacity in the United States and abroad, said that Amazon would use its nascent chip production service, or foundry, to build at least two chips for its Amazon Web Services unit. It also said that it had secured an investment of up to $ 3 billion from the Biden administration to expand its manufacturing of advanced semiconductors for the U.S. military.
In a separate announcement, Intel said it would pause construction of new plants in Germany and Poland by about two years to wait for improved chip demand. But the company reaffirmed plans for investments in the United States, including a closely watched expansion in Ohio, its first major new production site in four decades.
Intel has faced calls from some investors to spin off its manufacturing business. While stopping short of that, Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, said the company planned to establish the foundry business as an independent subsidiary inside of Intel.
Intel's shares jumped 6 percent on news of the government award and more than 8 percent following the Amazon news.
The changes, which follow a board meeting last week, are "critical steps forward" to make Intel leaner and more efficient, Mr. Gelsinger said. He emphasized that it would be the "most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades."
"All eyes will remain on us," he said in a memo to employees. "We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that's the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we're capable of achieving."
Daniel Newman, an analyst at the Futurum Group, said the move to establish a foundry subsidiary could help reassure other chipmakers that Intel wouldn't unduly favor its own chip design unit, while also smoothing the way for a complete spinoff of that business should it become necessary. And the Amazon business could be significant.
"It's a real nongovernment customer," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. "It's strategic."
Concerns about Intel have ramped up in recent weeks. In August, the chipmaker announced that it would slash more than 15,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force, among other restructuring moves and a reduction in capital spending.
Intel has been engaged in a multiyear effort to reorient its business model and catch up with foreign chipmakers who have surged ahead in their technological capacity. The company is widely considered the U.S. standard-bearer for production of advanced semiconductors, but sales and profit margins have fallen recently with stiff competition, technical stumbles and weak demand for some kinds of computers.
Until recently, Intel typically manufactured just chips that it designs and sells. But it has been working to transition to becoming a foundry business that would make chips for other customers. The "multibillion-dollar" collaboration with Amazon, as Intel described it, is the most significant to date in Intel's effort to produce chips designed for other companies.
Mr. Gelsinger said in the memo that the company expected to have "deep engagement" with the Amazon unit on producing additional chip designs.
Intel's announcement of a $ 3 billion grant to create a trusted source of computer chips for the U.S. government was also welcome news. The program, Secure Enclave, will be funded from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign sources of semiconductors.
Much of the world's semiconductors are currently made in Asia, particularly Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory, a position that Taiwan rejects, and American officials have long had concerns about the consequences for the U.S. economy and military if China were to invade Taiwan.
Intel officials said on Monday that the company would help "secure the domestic chip supply chain" and work with federal officials to "enhance the resilience of U.S. technological systems."
The grant announcement comes about six months after the Biden administration awarded Intel up to $ 8.5 billion to help the company fund major construction projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. That money, along with the award announced Monday, stems from a $ 39 billion pot of CHIPS Act funding intended to encourage companies to build and expand semiconductor plants across the United States.
Federal officials also awarded Intel up to $ 11 billion in loans, and the company is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of its U.S. expansion projects, which are projected to cost more than $ 100 billion over five years.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose department is overseeing the distribution of the grants, said the $ 8.5 billion award would help bolster America's production of the most advanced semiconductors. She also said Intel's award would be the single largest grant made to a manufacturer under the new program. Commerce Department officials have announced more than $ 30 billion in subsidies so far.
The Secure Enclave program has been the subject of some controversy as it relies on a pool of funding in the CHIPS Act that was originally earmarked for other research and development programs. Some lawmakers and other companies in the semiconductor industry have questioned the decision to divert that money from other projects to Intel.
The $ 3 billion award will be executed by the Defense Department, though the money will come from the Commerce Department's funding.
Intel has partnered with the Defense Department on several other programs, including providing custom circuits for military systems, and working with military contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman.

Nvidia Is the Key to the Market. Is It Worth This Much?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Sommer, Jeff

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the hazards of buying individual stocks is that their current price may have little to do with their fundamental value, our columnist says.
Nvidia designs most of the advanced chips that power artificial intelligence, and that has made it an earnings machine, producing astonishing profits that have buoyed the entire stock market.
In the last year, Nvidia shares have returned nearly 150 percent, helping to fuel the nearly 25 percent gain in the S&P 500 stock index. Yet, starting in late August, as the bedazzling aura surrounding Nvidia ebbed, the market stumbled.
"The magic spell has broken," Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, said in an interview. For a year or so, he said, Nvidia could have reported virtually anything at all "and investors and traders would have found a way to convert that into good news."
What changed? Nvidia hasn't faltered. Its latest earnings report was awesome. Of all the companies associated with A.I., Nvidia has reaped the most benefits. Giants like Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle are voracious buyers of Nvidia's technology.
The problem seems to be that, like a child who has eaten too many extravagant sundaes, the stock market didn't find Nvidia's latest rich offering of profits to be quite as phenomenal as it had come to expect.
For investors, the crucial questions concern the future: How big will A.I., the generational tech wonder, ultimately become and what will Nvidia's stake in it be? Most crucially, how much is Nvidia, perhaps the core A.I. stock, really worth? The answers are significant for the entire market, where A.I. and Nvidia rival the presidential election and the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting plans in importance.
As a long-term, buy-and-hold index fund investor, I don't own Nvidia, or any individual stocks. But to understand where the stock market and the trajectory of technology may be going, you have to understand Nvidia, and so I called Professor Damodaran for help.
Second to None
I've been underwhelmed by the A.I. chatbots. They don't summarize text or cite sources accurately and are only starting to reliably do math. But commercially available A.I. is improving -- and I have no reservations about the prowess of Nvidia.
How high will Nvidia go? The sky's the limit, you might have said with some justification just a few months ago. Nvidia shares were rising in a sustained trajectory that few American stocks have experienced. That may seem an immoderate claim. I don't make it lightly.
No publicly traded U.S. company with a life span of at least 20 years has ever surpassed Nvidia's stock performance through 2023, according to a July study by Hendrik Bessembinder, a scholar of stock valuations based at Arizona State University. From its initial public offering in 1999 through the end of 2023, Nvidia's stock rose an annualized 33.4 percent.
Contemplate how staggering annual returns like that are: "This equates to a cumulative compound return of 131,500 percent," Professor Bessembinder wrote. That means that for every dollar invested when Nvidia went public, you would now have $ 1,316.
No wonder Jensen Huang, Nvidia's founder, has become one of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of more than $ 90 billion, according to FactSet. The problem for the stock market is that Mr. Huang was worth considerably more before Nvidia shares started sliding.
From June 20 through Sept. 6, the company's stock fell more than 21 percent, though it has since risen. The summer decline was a mere hiccup compared with the roughly 2,500 percent that Nvidia gained over the last five years. But if you're a short-term trader, you could have been hurt.
As a long-term investment, however, Nvidia has been a gem. The company has outpaced its peers, with chips and software that have become essential in exponentially growing industries: video games, bitcoin mining and now "artificial information factories." That's what Mr. Huang calls the server farms built on Nvidia technology -- the physical underpinning of the A.I. bots summoned up by millions of people on smartphones and computers.
No One Rules Forever
Nvidia's deep-pocketed corporate customers can't buy its products fast enough. (Because the Biden administration has deemed its most advanced chips and software to be strategically important, Chinese customers can't easily buy them but have managed workarounds.)
Nvidia's latest earnings report was extraordinary. Its sales and revenue more than doubled in its most recent quarter, and its gross profit margin amounted to 75 percent. On more than $ 30 billion in revenue, it earned more than $ 22 billion.
Coveted as Nvidia's tech may be, it's hard to imagine that it will be this profitable forever. Basic economics tells us that the company's exorbitant dominance of the growing A.I. infrastructure sector -- now at roughly 80 percent of the market -- contains the seeds of its own demise. The financial incentives for Nvidia's competitors to develop equivalent technology, and for its customers and suppliers to shed costs, both seem too high for Nvidia to command its lucrative perch indefinitely.
Few companies can grow this rapidly and profitably for very long, as Professor Damodaran points out in his new book, "The Corporate Life Cycle: Business, Investment and Management Implications." It elaborates on a concept that he has expounded for years: Like human beings, companies have a cycle of growth, decline and, sometimes, rejuvenation.
In a blog post this past week, he assessed an Nvidia predecessor: Intel, the great chip designer of the last generation. He described it as an aging superstar that needs to accept a lesser role in the corporate universe. Intel, which was founded in 1968, was as dominant in its early years as Nvidia is now. At the moment, it is trying to compete not only with Nvidia as a designer but with Taiwan Semiconductor as a manufacturer. Intel's share price has fallen nearly 50 percent over the last year, to a level that Professor Damodaran finds attractive. He says it can prosper as a sensibly conservative enterprise with pared-down ambitions.
But Nvidia seems to still be in its growth phase. Larry Ellison, founder and chairman of Oracle, told analysts on Monday that just one of Oracle's new A.I. data centers will contain "acres" of Nvidia chip clusters. Monumental purchases of Nvidia equipment are "required to stay competitive in the race to build one, just one, of the most powerful artificial neural networks in the world," Mr. Ellison said. OpenAI, whose ChatGPT bot set off the A.I. frenzy, is raising billions to buy more computing power -- much of it coming from Nvidia equipment.
The total market for the kind of A.I. technology supplied by Nvidia is $ 60 billion a year, Professor Damodaran estimates, but it can grow to $ 500 billion in a decade. Nvidia's share of this A.I. infrastructure revenue is now 80 percent. If the company stays on top of its game, that share may drop only to 60 percent, which would keep the cash flowing. Similarly, while Nvidia's profit margins are likely to fall, he projected that they will be high enough for Nvidia to remain highly lucrative.
Putting all that together, Professor Damodaran's assessment of Nvidia, which he acknowledges is imperfect, changeable and, at best, one man's view, won't please die-hard Nvidia enthusiasts, but it's still relatively positive.
After its meteoric rise, he said, Nvidia was roughly 20 percent overvalued before it started rising again. "It's a solid company," he said. It's just a bit overpriced at the moment, he said, adding that another wave of mass enthusiasm could propel it even higher.
Whether the companies pouring vast sums into Nvidia technology will profit from their investments, individually or as a group, seems less clear. How powerful will A.I. become and what will its economic impact be? Though I'm not a true believer, I can't help but be intrigued. Nvidia is prospering and, like it or not, we are all being swept up in Nvidia's world.

OpenAI Fund-Raising Talks Could Value Company at $150 Billion: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The San Francisco start-up hopes to raise $ 6.5 billion as part of an aggressive push for more investment.
OpenAI is in talks to raise about $ 6.5 billion as part of a deal that would value the company in the vicinity of $ 150 billion, a nearly $ 70 billion increase from its valuation nine months ago, according to five people with knowledge of the conversations.
The deal would make the company more valuable than any other private company with the exception of ByteDance, the maker the video-sharing app TikTok.
As recently as last week, OpenAI was looking to raise about $ 1 billion at a $ 100 billion valuation. But in the last few days, the company, which has extraordinarily high expenses because of the computing power needed to build big A.I. systems, has appeared to race past that goal.
The new funding round would be led by the investment firm Thrive Capital, which has previously invested in OpenAI. The tech giants Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft have also been part of the discussions, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the discussions.
Bloomberg reported earlier on the new valuation talks.
In late 2022, OpenAI started the artificial intelligence boom with the release of its online chatbot, ChatGPT, inciting a global surge in funding for start-ups that built similar technology. Interest in such companies dropped this summer as a series of prominent companies all but disappeared into wealthier and more powerful A.I. companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
But OpenAI, backed by $ 13 billion from Microsoft and with name recognition far beyond its start-up rivals, has continued to build on the frenzy of the ChatGPT release. And its new, rapidly expanding investment round is a statement on the urgency the tech industry still places on artificial intelligence.
If the new deal is completed, OpenAI will be more valuable than SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by Elon Musk (who was also one of OpenAI's co-founders). It would also be nearly twice as valuable as Intel, the venerable chip giant, whose total market value has slipped to around $ 83 billion as it has been unable to keep up with the A.I. boom.
Over the past nine months, OpenAI, which has more than 1,700 employees, has added over 1,000 new workers and released increasingly powerful versions of ChatGPT and similar technologies, including systems that generate images and videos.
Still, OpenAI has had very public growing pains. Company executives are still trying to repair OpenAI's reputation after four board members unexpectedly fired the chief executive, Sam Altman, in late 2023. Since his reinstatement just five days later, the company has lost several high-profile employees, including the chief scientist and co-founder Ilya Sutskever.
Dr. Sutskever and other experts in the field, including some former and current OpenAI employees, have become increasingly concerned that the kind of technologies developed by OpenAI could help spread disinformation, contribute to cyberattacks or even endanger humanity. OpenAI has repeatedly acknowledged those concerns, and it has worked to revamp its efforts to ensure that its technologies are safe.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
OpenAI is also working to transform its A.I. technologies into products that pull in revenue. Building this kind of technology requires billions of dollars in raw computing power, and by some estimates the company is burning through $ 7 billion every year.
Now, tech analysts say, OpenAI needs to show that it can be more than a money pit for investors and can operate more like a traditional tech company.
OpenAI is pulling in more than $ 2 billion a year through subscriptions to ChatGPT and other technologies, according to a person familiar with its finances. It has also hired seasoned Silicon Valley executives like Sarah Friar, a former chief financial officer of Square, and Kevin Weil, a former chief product officer of Twitter, to help transform itself from an A.I. research lab into a profit-producing operation.
Mr. Altman, who is admired by peers in Silicon Valley for his fund-raising ability, has strategically built investor enthusiasm for opportunities to buy stakes in OpenAI. His strategy has been to sell existing shares in a so-called tender offer once a year, which benefits the company's employees, while later complementing that with a traditional funding round to support OpenAI's business, a person familiar with Mr. Altman's approach said.
Last year, as he wrapped up a tender offer that valued the company at more than $ 80 billion, he was already telling investors that he planned to raise money to value it at $ 100 billion. That round continues to expand.

Full text: Tim Ballard's work on sex trafficking became the basis of the hit movie "Sound of Freedom." But a series of women, in lawsuits and interviews, have accused him of being a sex predator.
Tim Ballard had fashioned himself into a made-for-Hollywood hero.
For years, he led a nonprofit that proclaimed daring undercover missions to rescue children from the horrors of international sex trafficking. Politicians embraced his call for more barriers on the southern border to block smuggling. President Donald J. Trump brought him on as an adviser. Last year, the hit movie "Sound of Freedom" showcased his life and work, making more than $ 250 million and becoming one of the most successful independent films of all time.
But while the world knew him as a champion of the vulnerable, many of the women he worked with now tell a much darker story: that Mr. Ballard himself was grooming, manipulating, harassing and sexually assaulting women. In lawsuits beginning last year, the women said that Mr. Ballard preyed on their desire to help trafficking victims, coercing or forcing them into sexual encounters as part of their undercover work in brothels, strip clubs and massage parlors.
A former Homeland Security agent, Mr. Ballard had built his nonprofit, Operation Underground Railroad, at a time when the issue of child sex trafficking was already on the rise. High-profile cases -- some of them appallingly real, some of them inventions of conspiracy theorists -- drove outrage about minors being forced into sexual servitude and exploited by U.S. elites.
Mr. Ballard won credibility across the varied worlds of religion, law enforcement, media, politics and entertainment. By 2020, Operation Underground Railroad was raising nearly $ 50 million a year in donations, with a roster of supporters that included the conservative media mogul Glenn Beck, the motivational speaker Tony Robbins and the Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.
In Utah, where the organization's leadership is based, Mr. Ballard talked up his close connections to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, at times appearing alongside one of the church's 12 powerful apostles.
As concerns about his conduct began percolating last year, the empire he created appeared to be crumbling. In June 2023, he stepped down from Operation Underground Railroad. The Latter-day Saints church last September denounced Mr. Ballard's "morally unacceptable" activities in a statement to VICE News, which had published a series of stories raising questions about the nonprofit's operations.
And yet, in many conservative circles, Mr. Ballard's star keeps rising.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Mr. Ballard was onstage, arguing that failure to manage the southern U.S. border has turned federal agencies into "a child-sex-trafficking delivery service." He received a "Heroic Patriot" award at a Catholic Prayer for Trump event at Mar-a-Lago in March. And in July, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, hosted Mr. Ballard on his broadcast from the Republican National Convention, encouraging him not to be "discouraged" and assuring him that he had many allies and a promising future.
But questions about Mr. Ballard's conduct at Operation Underground Railroad have continued, and more women have come forward. The New York Times interviewed 10 who worked with Mr. Ballard at the organization and now describe their time there as a nightmare of sexual harassment, coerced sexual contact and sexual assault.
Many had long ties to the Latter-day Saints and said in lawsuits and interviews that they initially trusted Mr. Ballard because of his broad acclaim and the support he had received from the church leadership, and they believed deeply in the cause of saving children.
In interviews and legal papers, the women described similar scenarios: Mr. Ballard recruited them to act as his romantic partner in undercover operations in which they would pose as wealthy sex tourists, a tactic he referred to as a "couple's ruse." It had two purposes, he told them: It provided an easy excuse to avoid having sexual contact with the sex workers, and some people might be more open to confiding in a woman.
But many of the women say that Mr. Ballard turned the "ruse" into an opportunity to assault them.
Six women filed lawsuits accusing Mr. Ballard of sexually assaulting them, with some describing situations in which he used his strength to overpower them despite their explicit pleas to stop.
Three of the women told The Times that they witnessed Mr. Ballard engaging in erotic encounters with sex workers, ranging from lap dances to oral sex.
The women recalled being stunned and confused by Mr. Ballard's conduct, alarmed not only by how he acted on operations but how much he expected the women to "practice" their romance in private. Many described feeling isolated and fearful as Mr. Ballard warned that disclosing operational details could allow powerful traffickers to identify and kill them.
Amy Morgan Davis, a former Miss Utah who worked as Mr. Ballard's makeup artist on a variety of occasions over several years, is among the women who said that Mr. Ballard exploited her desire to participate in the cause of rescuing children. She recalled meetings with Mr. Ballard in which he repeatedly told her to prove that the two of them had a "connection" and then made escalating sexual advances that included caressing her body with his hands. "It's hard to wrap your head around that because you really, in your mind, want him to be the hero," she said, sharing her story publicly for the first time.
While the courts have dismissed some of the legal claims against Mr. Ballard, the six sexual assault claims filed by the women are being actively litigated, and the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office said it was aware of "pending criminal investigations into Tim Ballard." At least one was opened in a nearby county after one of the women filed an assault report with the police.
Mr. Ballard, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has insisted that he did not engage in any misconduct but that in the gritty world of the international sex industry, it was essential to maintain believable covers. He contended that the women accusing him had come together to "repeat each other's lies" and were now out to get millions of dollars. He or his lawyers have said some of the women were the ones acting inappropriately and that their stories have been inconsistent.
Mr. Ballard said one of his chief concerns was that the accusations had done grave harm to the mission of rescuing children. "I just find it so sad that everybody who has come out with negative smears, lies, lawfare -- they are accomplices to child trafficking," he said in an online video. "Their actions are causing children to suffer, to be raped, to be tortured."
Rescue Teams and Undercover Video
As he left the Department of Homeland Security in 2013 to build his nonprofit, the issue of child sex trafficking was drawing more attention in the conservative political community. Mr. Ballard quickly won the support of commentators like Mr. Beck, who said on one of his shows that the cause was so important that supporting it "may be one of the reasons why you were born."
Mr. Ballard had already gained a following for his writings and television shows about the Mormon faith. Ryan Fisher, who worked with him on a television series exploring Latter-day Saints history about a decade ago, said he attended a meeting in 2016 with Tim Ballard and the church elder, Apostle M. Russell Ballard, who are not related. The apostle, Mr. Fisher said, talked about using television to make Mr. Ballard into "an American hero" who could help the church achieve its goal of appealing to mainstream evangelicals. Church officials declined to discuss Mr. Ballard's relationship with Apostle Ballard in detail but said in a statement last year that he had "betrayed their friendship."
With video cameras documenting their operations, Mr. Ballard's nonprofit ranged widely in its search for trafficking victims, going into countries like Haiti, Colombia and Mexico with rescue teams that included former Navy SEALs. Mr. Ballard and his partners would fly in and offer cash to people who could bring young girls to a party. The idea was to identify both traffickers and victims, collecting information for law enforcement agencies to pursue; some of the operations led to major armed raids, captured on camera and later broadcast to the world. "Sound of Freedom" featured one such mission in Colombia.
As Operation Underground Railroad's prominence grew, its overall strategy became a point of debate among anti-trafficking experts. Some grew concerned about the organization's emphasis on the idea that children were being snatched into trafficking and that the solution was to snatch them back.
It was a simple narrative that donors liked, said Bridgette Carr, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, but neglected the deeper reality that most victims of trafficking are brought into that world by people they know, and that combating the problem requires long-term investments, often in reducing poverty.
"I don't think any legitimate evidence-based organization would support the tactics of Operation Underground Railroad," Ms. Carr said.
Jordana Bree Righter, who had a career in the Marine Corps and law enforcement before a decade of social work caring for survivors of sex trafficking, worked for a time with Operation Underground Railroad as an independent contractor.
In an interview, she said she was invited by Mr. Ballard to go out on operations and was appalled to see the organization handing out hundreds of dollars and telling potential traffickers that there was more money to be had if they could bring girls to them.
"If you're in an impoverished area and you hand a pimp a bunch of money and tell him to get you underage girls, he's going to get you underage girls," she said. "That is like textbook creating a market."
The Fake Romance Tactic
Kira Lynch was a hairdresser in the Salt Lake City area, brought in one day to a private home where Mr. Ballard was staying to cut and dye his hair.
In an interview with The Times and in a lawsuit, she described listening with interest as he talked about his relationship with Mr. Trump, his friendship with Apostle Ballard and about the children he had rescued from sex slavery. Then he had a question: Would she like to be involved?
He told her he was looking for a new female partner to help him on operations, acting as his pretend girlfriend.
God had brought him the idea for that "couple's ruse," Ms. Lynch recalled him saying. While she was initially wary of the idea, Mr. Ballard reassured her that there were strict rules -- no kissing, no touching of private parts -- and that it had all been sanctioned as a means of saving children by Apostle Ballard, considered by the church to be a living prophet whose teachings reflected the will of God.
She said he told her not to discuss full details of the new job prospect. But that night, when she went to dinner at her parents' home, she shared that Mr. Ballard had been a new client.
Ms. Lynch's mother jumped up out of her chair and ran to the bookshelf in the living room, pulling out tomes on Latter-day Saints thought and history that Mr. Ballard had written. As her mother praised his work, her father said they had watched and admired the television series about the church that Mr. Ballard had done with Mr. Fisher.
"They were thrilled," Ms. Lynch said. "They just really thought he was this spiritual giant."
Many of the women described, in lawsuits and interviews, similar initial interactions with Mr. Ballard. Then, once he won the women's initial interest, they said, he began talking graphically about sexual scenarios they might encounter, based on his past experiences. "How far would you go to save a child?" he asked many of them.
In text messages with one woman filed as part of a lawsuit, Mr. Ballard asked about increasingly personal topics -- pubic-hair waxing, what made her feel sexy, what her face looks like during an orgasm. He has said such messages were sent as part of his undercover persona.
Some of the women said they felt increasingly uneasy when he insisted it was necessary to keep up the ruse of the fake romance even when they were alone, in his office, or in hotel rooms, or vehicles. But Mr. Ballard warned them that sex traffickers had extensive networks and could be monitoring their every move, looking for any signals that their couple act might not be genuine.
In that case, he warned, they risked being killed, or their efforts to save children might be undermined. Secrecy was paramount: Many of the women recalled being told that not even their families or other co-workers at the nonprofit were to know the details of the operations.
Things quickly turned physical, several of the women said. One of them, Mary Hall, said in both an interview and court records that she met Mr. Ballard in his office early on, and he began groping her, kissing her stomach and tugging at the waistline of her pants before being interrupted by the entrance of another executive. She initially thought it was a test of her ability to endure intimate situations, but she later expressed concern about Mr. Ballard to others in the organization and was not invited to proceed on a mission.
Another woman, Sashleigha Hightower, said in an interview and in court papers that she tensed up when Mr. Ballard began rubbing her inner thigh and nuzzling her neck not long after she discussed her history as a rape survivor.
The situation felt weird, she said, but she was an actress, not an undercover operative. She assumed based on Mr. Ballard's reputation that this was part of the professional process. "He knows what he's doing," she said she told herself. "He's assured me this is all normal. He's got other people backing him up about this couple's ruse thing."
Success and Concerns
Mr. Ballard has claimed that "thousands" of trafficking victims were rescued over the years, though most of the women who spoke with The Times said they had not seen anyone rescued.
Allies of Mr. Ballard said that pretending to be a couple during the operations had proven to be effective. Alex Acosta, who began working with Mr. Ballard in 2021, focusing mostly on Latin America, said that in his experience, the team would discuss strategy beforehand. He said that relationships between Mr. Ballard and the women on the team always appeared to be kept within professional boundaries.
"Every time I saw this enacted, there was a clear line and it was never crossed," he said. He added that in his two years at the organization, he saw well over 100 sex-trafficking victims rescued.
Victor Hugo Enriquez García, a secretary of public safety for the Mexican state of Sonora, said Mr. Ballard proved adept at collecting information about trafficking venues and then shared that information with law enforcement. His tips sometimes led to arrests of pedophiles operating in Mexico and the rescue of minors, he said.
Mr. García said the allegations against Mr. Ballard rang untrue to him. He found Mr. Ballard to be professional and never witnessed any inappropriate behavior.
But records show there were internal concerns about some of the conduct on the nonprofit's operations, and not just Mr. Ballard's.
Investigators in Utah reported reviewing undercover video of an operation nearly a decade ago in Cabo San Lucas that included Paul Hutchinson, a businessman from Utah who was an important investor in "Sound of Freedom."
On that operation, a man presented Mr. Hutchinson's team with a girl who someone on the video described as 16 years old. Mr. Hutchinson approached the girl and put both his hands on her bare breasts, according to a law enforcement summary of the video.
The operation team members could later be heard discussing the girl's age, seeming to agree that she was a minor, although Mr. Hutchinson now says he believes she was an adult.
Melissa Cannon Johnson, who worked in the film industry and was later invited to follow the organization on a trip to Haiti, recalled phoning Mr. Ballard to express concern that a team member had behaved inappropriately around her and children at an orphanage. In a sworn court statement, Ms. Johnson said she was surprised when Mr. Ballard quickly guessed that Mr. Hutchinson was the person she was talking about.
"Ballard explained that Paul was sexually disturbed and that everyone at OUR knew that," she wrote in her statement. "Ballard told me he had to put up with Hutchinson because of his wealth and because Paul could use his influence."
Mr. Hutchinson has since founded the Child Liberation Foundation, a new organization to conduct rescue missions.
In a video statement responding to the incident in which he was seen touching the girl's breasts, Mr. Hutchinson said it had been a dangerous undercover situation and that he had made a split-second decision to touch the girl to make it appear real.
He strongly denied that anything improper happened at the orphanage in Haiti. "I had a team of operators around me every day of that mission and never once acted inappropriately with anybody," he said in an emailed statement.
He noted that he had "made a very clear separation" from Mr. Ballard "for reasons that are now in the public view about him."
'No clear purpose'
In interviews and statements filed in court, the women said that, once recruited, they found themselves accompanying Mr. Ballard to strip clubs, massage parlors and other sex-worker hotspots, looking for underage purveyors -- sometimes locally in Utah, other times in places like London; Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; or Guayaquil, Ecuador.
They said they went along with what they were being asked to do despite growing reservations, telling themselves that they needed to trust Mr. Ballard if they were to succeed in freeing the children who were trapped there.
Some of the women now say they became concerned that many of the meetings they were having with sex workers focused less on gathering information and building trust with the workers and more on letting sexual encounters evolve.
One of the women, Celeste Borys, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Ballard and Operation Underground Railroad accusing them of sexual assault and battery, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other claims.
She said she had been working an office job at the nonprofit when Mr. Ballard approached her to say he had experienced a vision about her, and proposed expanding her role.
On what she was told would be something like an introductory operation in Ecuador in 2022, she said, Mr. Ballard surprised her with a couple's massage with him in a hotel room. Two girls who looked to Ms. Borys to be about 15 or 16 entered the room, and Mr. Ballard got naked and lay on the bed, she said. Ms. Borys lay down with her clothes on, and he asked why she had not stripped down.
Instead of working to help the girls, Ms. Borys said, Mr. Ballard began talking about masturbation. One of the girls proposed demonstrating her methods on Ms. Borys. Mr. Ballard rolled Ms. Borys on her back and started removing her shorts. Realizing what was about to happen, she said, she closed her eyes to try to escape; she said she heard him comment that he had never watched what was transpiring in such close proximity before, and at one point penetrated her with his fingers.
Ms. Borys eventually escaped to the bathroom, taking refuge in the shower, where she sobbed. Mr. Ballard later came in, she said, claiming that he had obtained valuable information from the girls: "We are going to save so many children," he told her.
Two months later, the team was at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Mexico City, and Ms. Borys found Mr. Ballard with a professional escort in the hotel room they shared. The escort's bathing suit was on the floor, she related in her lawsuit. Ms. Borys said the woman, chatting with her via a translation app before departing, told her that she'd had sex with Mr. Ballard. Ms. Borys provided The Times with a photo of herself and the escort.
Mr. Ballard insisted that it had not gone that far but acknowledged some sexual activity, Ms. Borys said. When she objected to his actions, she said, he began screaming and cursing.
"He goes, 'This is what I get for saving effing kids? You're criticizing me on how I effing save kids?"' Ms. Borys said. She said she began wishing that she could take back her remarks, wondering why she had questioned his methods.
Ms. Borys said Mr. Ballard's intimate interactions with sex workers continued, including at a luxury hotel in Pasadena, Calif., where she recalled walking into a room to find a woman hired for the day giving Mr. Ballard oral sex.
Ms. Borys said Mr. Ballard not only placed her in inappropriate situations with sex workers but himself engaged in unwelcome sexual acts with her on at least two dozen occasions, sometimes when they were alone and not conducting any operation. On one such occasion, she said, Mr. Ballard, warning that traffickers might be watching through a hotel window, pushed her onto the bed and, despite her objections, penetrated her until she was able to use enough strength to push him away.
For months, Ms. Borys said, she was confused about how to think about Mr. Ballard's conduct, because over time it began feeling like a routine part of the job. She initially defended Mr. Ballard as concerns about his behavior began to percolate at the nonprofit and he resigned. "I have never been taken advantage of," she wrote in an email that Mr. Ballard has filed as an exhibit in court. It was sent to Mr. Ballard and an executive of the organization and addressed to "To Whom It May Concern."
In fact, she said, she was already having doubts about him, and wrote the email because Mr. Ballard had pressured her to do so. She was beginning to distance herself from him, she said, and asking herself hard questions.
"I believed it. I believed it worked. I believed Tim. I believed the mission. I believed. I literally was in a cult," she said. "I did remember thinking throughout my time with him like, 'Why am I feeling sorry for myself?' Like, I come home at night. People who are victims or trafficked, they don't get to come home at night."
Mark Eisenhut, a lawyer for Mr. Ballard, said Mr. Ballard did not harass or physically assault any of the women he worked with, nor did he have any inappropriate contact with sex workers. The women's claims against Mr. Ballard, he said, have been "ever evolving and ever-morphing," becoming more serious over time.
"He has never been charged with a crime and every court considering a complaint against the Ballards so far has ruled in their favor," Mr. Eisenhut said.
Mr. Ballard scored a legal victory in June when a judge dismissed Ms. Righter's claims of fraud and conspiracy related to the couple's ruse. The judge found that there were insufficient facts to prove that Mr. Ballard and other leaders of the organization had planned the ruse tactic as a ploy for sexual misconduct. Ms. Righter was not among those who alleged assault by Mr. Ballard.
Other women besides Ms. Borys said they also began having serious doubts.
Krista Kacey, a hair and makeup artist who initially met Mr. Ballard on a film set and later went with him on international operations, joined several other women in a lawsuit over her experience with the organization. She described in her suit and in an interview a mission in the Dominican Republic in March 2022. There, the two of them stayed at a dedicated sex house, and Mr. Ballard brought in two sex workers to the room they were sharing.
What ensued was a night that Ms. Kacey described as "horribly traumatic." For hours, she said, they were physically interacting with the sex workers -- touching and groping without technically having sex -- with no apparent progress in gaining information about child victims. Afterward, she recalled, Mr. Ballard bragged that they had managed to have what amounted to an orgy without engaging in full sex -- a claim she knew was only technically true. After that, she made a decision to avoid working with Mr. Ballard on undercover operations.
"It became very clear to me that we were not getting intel," Ms. Kacey said. "There was no clear purpose."
Ms. Lynch, the Salt Lake City hairdresser, said she grew wary about Mr. Ballard after his escalating physical touches and a night spent at a local strip club, where he asked her to give him a lap dance -- all in the name of practicing for missions.
She said she had been working for several months with Mr. Ballard -- whom she considered a close friend -- when he began displaying increasingly erratic behavior.
Then one night in January 2022, as she described it in court records, he came to her house to get his hair cut and was acting particularly disconnected. He told her that he believed the two of them had been married in another life, she said, and he started to pull her clothes off. She repeatedly told him to stop and tried to escape his grasp, she said, but he pinned her on the stairs and forced himself on her.
Mr. Ballard, through a lawyer, has said that no such assault occurred, instead contending that Ms. Lynch had made advances to him. Ms. Lynch's initial request for a protective order to keep Mr. Ballard away from her was dismissed by a judge who referred to the case as a "colossal he said, she said," and noted that Ms. Lynch had made some "inconsistent statements." She added that victims often do not immediately report everything that happened to them and that it would take an evidentiary hearing to fully determine the facts.
But Ms. Lynch said the encounter at her house had left her feeling deeply ashamed and disillusioned.
"I thought he was an amazing human," she said. "And he did this to me."
External Acclaim and Internal Concerns
The "Sound of Freedom" movie had languished as an unfinished project for years. Filming was completed in 2018, with the actor Jim Caviezel starring as Mr. Ballard. But the filmmakers, including the Mexican director Alejandro Monteverde, had struggled to find a studio or platform that would bring it to the public.
That changed when Angel Studios, a company that had found success distributing the television series "The Chosen" about the life of Jesus, acquired the rights last year. The company managed to raise $ 5 million from thousands of investors to distribute and market the film. It gained further traction with a unique pay-it-forward campaign that asked filmgoers to help fund tickets for even more viewers. At his golf club in New Jersey, Mr. Trump hosted a screening of "Sound of Freedom."
The movie depicted Mr. Ballard as a savior driven to action by moral fury, willing to risk his life to save children from sex slavery. "God's children are not for sale," his character says in what became the film's tagline.
But before the movie was released, the concerns about Mr. Ballard were intensifying inside his nonprofit. Records show that one female employee, who is not part of the current litigation, filed an internal complaint at Operation Underground Railroad describing Mr. Ballard as a "master manipulator" and detailing graphic sexual scenarios that he had her perform as part of their undercover operations.
After the organization cut ties with Mr. Ballard, Mr. Beck, who had been a longtime friend and supporter of Mr. Ballard, said on his podcast that he found reports about Mr. Ballard's behavior to be "disturbing" and described himself as feeling "completely duped."
"Sound of Freedom" nonetheless turned into one of the year's most successful films, out-earning the latest "Mission Impossible" and Taylor Swift's concert film in domestic box office sales.
One of the people who was excited to see "Sound of Freedom" was Ms. Lynch's mother, Jill Peterson, who had long followed Mr. Ballard's career. Ms. Peterson invited her daughter to see it in a theater.
Ms. Lynch declined, but it was not until two months later that she found the courage to explain why. She drove over to her mother's house.
"I've been trying to tell you something for a while," she said then, sobbing.
Ms. Peterson said that what her daughter went on to share that day took her breath away. She pulled her daughter onto her lap, holding her tight. She remembers her daughter expressing a wish to die, and herself feeling waves of regret and betrayal wash over her.
"I believed in the cause. I believed in the man," she said.

SALT LAKE CITY — Tim Ballard had fashioned himself into a made-for-Hollywood hero.
For years, he led a nonprofit that proclaimed daring undercover missions to rescue children from the horrors of international sex trafficking. Politicians embraced his call for more barriers on the Southern border to block smuggling. President Donald Trump brought him on as an adviser. Last year, the hit movie “Sound of Freedom” showcased his life and work, making more than $250 million and becoming one of the most successful independent films of all time.
But while the world knew him as a champion of the vulnerable, many of the women he worked with now tell a much darker story: that Ballard himself was grooming, manipulating, harassing and sexually assaulting women. In lawsuits beginning last year, the women said Ballard preyed on their desire to help trafficking victims, coercing or forcing them into sexual encounters as part of their undercover work in brothels, strip clubs and massage parlors.
A former Homeland Security agent, Ballard had built his nonprofit, Operation Underground Railroad, at a time when the issue of child sex trafficking was already on the rise. High-profile cases — some of them appallingly real, some of them inventions of conspiracy theorists — drove outrage about minors being forced into sexual servitude and exploited by U.S. elites.
Ballard won credibility across the varied worlds of religion, law enforcement, media, politics and entertainment. By 2020, Operation Underground Railroad was raising nearly $50 million a year in donations, with a roster of supporters that included conservative media mogul Glenn Beck, motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin.
In Utah, where the organization’s leadership is based, Ballard talked up his close connections to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, at times appearing alongside one of the church’s 12 powerful apostles.
As concerns about his conduct began percolating last year, the empire he created appeared to be crumbling. In June 2023, he stepped down from Operation Underground Railroad. The Latter-day Saints church last September denounced Ballard’s “morally unacceptable” activities in a statement to VICE News, which had published a series of stories raising questions about the nonprofit’s operations.
And yet, in many conservative circles, Ballard’s star keeps rising.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Ballard was onstage, arguing that failure to manage the Mexican border has turned federal agencies into “a child-sex-trafficking delivery service.” He received a “Heroic Patriot” award at a Catholic Prayer for Trump event at Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s Florida estate, in March. And in July, Trump’s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, hosted Ballard on his broadcast from the Republican National Convention, encouraging him not to be “discouraged” and assuring him that he had many allies and a promising future.
But questions about Ballard’s conduct at Operation Underground Railroad have continued, and more women have come forward. The New York Times interviewed 10 who worked with Ballard at the organization and now describe their time there as a nightmare of sexual harassment, coerced sexual contact and sexual assault.
Many had long ties to the Latter-day Saints and said in lawsuits and interviews that they initially trusted Ballard because of his broad acclaim and the support he had received from the church leadership, and they believed deeply in the cause of saving children.
In interviews and legal papers, the women described similar scenarios: Ballard recruited them to act as his romantic partner in undercover operations in which they would pose as wealthy sex tourists, a tactic he referred to as a “couple’s ruse.” It had two purposes, he told them: It provided an easy excuse to avoid having sexual contact with the sex workers, and some people might be more open to confiding in a woman.
But many of the women say Ballard turned the “ruse” into an opportunity to assault them.
Six women filed lawsuits accusing Ballard of sexually assaulting them, with some describing situations in which he used his strength to overpower them despite their explicit pleas to stop.
Three of the women told the Times that they witnessed Ballard engaging in erotic encounters with sex workers, ranging from lap dances to oral sex.
The women recalled being stunned and confused by Ballard’s conduct, alarmed not only by how he acted on operations but how much he expected the women to “practice” their romance in private. Many described feeling isolated and fearful as Ballard warned that disclosing operational details could allow powerful traffickers to identify and kill them.
Amy Morgan Davis, a former Miss Utah who worked as Ballard’s makeup artist on a variety of occasions over several years, is among the women who said Ballard exploited her desire to participate in the cause of rescuing children. She recalled meetings with Ballard in which he repeatedly told her to prove that the two of them had a “connection” and then made escalating sexual advances that included caressing her body with his hands.
“It’s hard to wrap your head around that because you really, in your mind, want him to be the hero,” she said, sharing her story publicly for the first time.
While the courts have dismissed some of the legal claims against Ballard, the six sexual assault claims filed by the women are being actively litigated, and the Salt Lake County district attorney’s office said it was aware of “pending criminal investigations into Tim Ballard.” At least one was opened in a nearby county after one of the women filed an assault report with police.
Ballard, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has insisted that he did not engage in any misconduct but that in the gritty world of the international sex industry, it was essential to maintain believable covers. He contended that the women accusing him had come together to “repeat each other’s lies” and were now out to get millions of dollars. He or his lawyers have said some of the women were the ones acting inappropriately and that their stories have been inconsistent.
Ballard said one of his chief concerns was that the accusations had done grave harm to the mission of rescuing children. “I just find it so sad that everybody who has come out with negative smears, lies, lawfare — they are accomplices to child trafficking,” he said in an online video. “Their actions are causing children to suffer, to be raped, to be tortured .”
Rescue Teams and Undercover Video
As he left the Department of Homeland Security in 2013 to build his nonprofit, the issue of child sex trafficking was drawing more attention in the conservative political community. Ballard quickly won the support of commentators such as Beck, who said on one of his shows that the cause was so important that supporting it “may be one of the reasons why you were born.”
Ballard had already gained a following for his writings and television shows about the Mormon faith. Ryan Fisher, who worked with him on a television series exploring Latter-day Saints history about a decade ago, said he attended a meeting in 2016 with Tim Ballard and the church elder, Apostle M. Russell Ballard, who are not related. The apostle, Fisher said, talked about using television to make Ballard into “an American hero” who could help the church achieve its goal of appealing to mainstream evangelicals. Church officials declined to discuss Ballard’s relationship with the apostle in detail but said in a statement last year that he had “betrayed their friendship.”
With video cameras documenting their operations, Ballard’s nonprofit ranged widely in its search for trafficking victims, going into countries such as Haiti, Colombia and Mexico with rescue teams that included former Navy SEALs. Ballard and his partners would fly in and offer cash to people who could bring young girls to a party. The idea was to identify both traffickers and victims, collecting information for law enforcement agencies to pursue; some of the operations led to major armed raids, captured on camera and later broadcast to the world. “Sound of Freedom” featured one such mission in Colombia.
As Operation Underground Railroad’s prominence grew, its overall strategy became a point of debate among anti-trafficking experts. Some grew concerned about the organization’s emphasis on the idea that children were being snatched into trafficking and that the solution was to snatch them back.
It was a simple narrative that donors liked, said Bridgette Carr, director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, but neglected the deeper reality that most victims of trafficking are brought into that world by people they know, and that combating the problem requires long-term investments, often in reducing poverty.
“I don’t think any legitimate evidence-based organization would support the tactics of Operation Underground Railroad,” Carr said.
Jordana Bree Righter, who had a career in the Marine Corps and law enforcement before a decade of social work caring for survivors of sex trafficking, worked for a time with Operation Underground Railroad as an independent contractor.
In an interview, she said she was invited by Ballard to go out on operations and was appalled to see the organization handing out hundreds of dollars and telling potential traffickers that there was more money to be had if they could bring girls to them.
“If you’re in an impoverished area and you hand a pimp a bunch of money and tell him to get you underage girls, he’s going to get you underage girls, " she said. “That is like textbook creating a market.”
The Fake Romance Tactic
Kira Lynch was a hairdresser in the Salt Lake City area, brought in one day to a private home where Ballard was staying to cut and dye his hair.
In an interview with the Times and in a lawsuit, she described listening with interest as he talked about his relationship with Trump, his friendship with Apostle Ballard and about the children he had rescued from sex slavery. Then he had a question: Would she like to be involved?
He told her he was looking for a new female partner to help him on operations, acting as his pretend girlfriend.
God had brought him the idea for that “couple’s ruse,” Lynch recalled him saying. Although she was initially wary of the idea, Ballard reassured her that there were strict rules — no kissing, no touching of private parts — and that it had all been sanctioned as a means of saving children by the apostle, considered by the church to be a living prophet whose teachings reflected the will of God.
She said he told her not to discuss full details of the new job prospect. But that night, when she went to dinner at her parents’ home, she shared that Ballard had been a new client.
Lynch’s mother jumped up out of her chair and ran to the bookshelf in the living room, pulling out tomes on Latter-day Saints thought and history that Ballard had written. As her mother praised his work, her father said they had watched and admired the television series about the church that Ballard had done with Fisher.
“They were thrilled,” Lynch said. “They just really thought he was this spiritual giant.”
Many of the women described, in lawsuits and interviews, similar initial interactions with Ballard. Then, once he won the women’s initial interest, they said, he began talking graphically about sexual scenarios they might encounter, based on his past experiences. “How far would you go to save a child?” he asked many of them.
In text messages with one woman filed as part of a lawsuit, Ballard asked about increasingly personal topics — pubic-hair waxing, what made her feel sexy, what her face looks like during an orgasm. He has said such messages were sent as part of his undercover persona.
Some of the women said they felt increasingly uneasy when he insisted it was necessary to keep up the ruse of the fake romance even when they were alone, in his office, or in hotel rooms, or vehicles. But Ballard warned them that sex traffickers had extensive networks and could be monitoring their every move, looking for any signals that their couple act might not be genuine.
In that case, he warned, they risked being killed, or their efforts to save children might be undermined. Secrecy was paramount: Many of the women recalled being told that not even their families or other co-workers at the nonprofit were to know the details of the operations.
Things quickly turned physical, several of the women said. One of them, Mary Hall, said in both an interview and court records that she met Ballard in his office early on, and he began groping her, kissing her stomach and tugging at the waistline of her pants before being interrupted by the entrance of another executive. She initially thought it was a test of her ability to endure intimate situations, but she later expressed concern about Ballard to others in the organization and was not invited to proceed on a mission.
Another woman, Sashleigha Hightower, said in an interview and in court papers that she tensed up when Ballard began rubbing her inner thigh and nuzzling her neck not long after she discussed her history as a rape survivor.
The situation felt weird, she said, but she was an actress, not an undercover operative. She assumed based on Ballard’s reputation that this was part of the professional process. “He knows what he’s doing,” she said she told herself. “He’s assured me this is all normal. He’s got other people backing him up about this couple’s ruse thing.”
Success and Concerns
Ballard has claimed that “thousands” of trafficking victims were rescued over the years, although most of the women who spoke with the Times said they had not seen anyone rescued.
Allies of Ballard’s said that pretending to be a couple during the operations had proved to be effective. Alex Acosta, who began working with Ballard in 2021, focusing mostly on Latin America, said that in his experience, the team would discuss strategy beforehand. He said relationships between Ballard and the women on the team always appeared to be kept within professional boundaries.
“Every time I saw this enacted, there was a clear line and it was never crossed,” he said. He added that in his two years at the organization, he saw well over 100 sex-trafficking victims rescued.
Victor Hugo Enriquez García, a secretary of public safety for the Mexican state of Sonora, said Ballard proved adept at collecting information about trafficking venues and then shared that information with law enforcement. His tips sometimes led to arrests of pedophiles operating in Mexico and the rescue of minors, he said.
García said the allegations against Ballard rang untrue to him. He found Ballard to be professional and never witnessed any inappropriate behavior.
But records show there were internal concerns about some of the conduct on the nonprofit’s operations, and not just Ballard’s.
Investigators in Utah reported reviewing undercover video of an operation nearly a decade ago in Cabo San Lucas that included Paul Hutchinson, a businessperson from Utah who was an important investor in “Sound of Freedom.”
On that operation, a man presented Hutchinson’s team with a girl who someone on the video described as 16 years old. Hutchinson approached the girl and put both his hands on her bare breasts, according to a law enforcement summary of the video.
The operation team members could later be heard discussing the girl’s age, seeming to agree that she was a minor, although Hutchinson now says he believes she was an adult.
Melissa Cannon Johnson, who worked in the film industry and was later invited to follow the organization on a trip to Haiti, recalled phoning Ballard to express concern that a team member had behaved inappropriately around her and children at an orphanage. In a sworn court statement, Johnson said she was surprised when Ballard quickly guessed that Hutchinson was the person she was talking about.
“Ballard explained that Paul was sexually disturbed and that everyone at OUR knew that,” she wrote in her statement. “Ballard told me he had to put up with Hutchinson because of his wealth and because Paul could use his influence.”
Hutchinson has since founded the Child Liberation Foundation, a new organization to conduct rescue missions.
In a video statement responding to the incident in which he was seen touching the girl’s breasts, Hutchinson said it had been a dangerous undercover situation and that he had made a split-second decision to touch the girl to make it appear real.
He strongly denied that anything improper happened at the orphanage in Haiti. “I had a team of operators around me every day of that mission and never once acted inappropriately with anybody,” he said in an emailed statement.
He noted that he had “made a very clear separation” from Ballard “for reasons that are now in the public view about him.”
‘No Clear Purpose’
In interviews and statements filed in court, the women said that, once recruited, they found themselves accompanying Ballard to strip clubs, massage parlors and other sex-worker hot spots, looking for underage purveyors — sometimes locally in Utah, other times in places such as London; Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; or Guayaquil, Ecuador.
They said they went along with what they were being asked to do despite growing reservations, telling themselves that they needed to trust Ballard if they were to succeed in freeing the children who were trapped there.
Some of the women now say they became concerned that many of the meetings they were having with sex workers focused less on gathering information and building trust with the workers and more on letting sexual encounters evolve.
One of the women, Celeste Borys, filed a lawsuit against Ballard and Operation Underground Railroad accusing them of sexual assault and battery, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other claims.
She said she had been working an office job at the nonprofit when Ballard approached her to say he had experienced a vision about her, and proposed expanding her role.
On what she was told would be something like an introductory operation in Ecuador in 2022, she said, Ballard surprised her with a couple’s massage with him in a hotel room. Two girls who looked to Borys to be about 15 or 16 entered the room, and Ballard got naked and lay on the bed, she said. Borys lay down with her clothes on, and he asked why she had not stripped down.
Instead of working to help the girls, Borys said, Ballard began talking about masturbation. One of the girls proposed demonstrating her methods on Borys. Ballard rolled Borys on her back and started removing her shorts. Realizing what was about to happen, she said, she closed her eyes to try to escape; she said she heard him comment that he had never watched what was transpiring in such close proximity before, and at one point penetrated her with his fingers.
Borys eventually escaped to the bathroom, taking refuge in the shower, where she sobbed. Ballard later came in, she said, claiming that he had obtained valuable information from the girls: “We are going to save so many children,” he told her.
Two months later, the team was at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Mexico City, and Borys found Ballard with a professional escort in the hotel room they shared. The escort’s bathing suit was on the floor, she related in her lawsuit. Borys said the woman, chatting with her via a translation app before departing, told her that she had had sex with Ballard. Borys provided the Times with a photo of herself and the escort.
Ballard insisted it had not gone that far but acknowledged some sexual activity, Borys said. When she objected to his actions, she said, he began screaming and cursing.
“He goes, ‘This is what I get for saving effing kids? You’re criticizing me on how I effing save kids?’” Borys said. She said she began wishing that she could take back her remarks, wondering why she had questioned his methods.
Borys said Ballard’s intimate interactions with sex workers continued, including at a luxury hotel in Pasadena, California, where she recalled walking into a room to find a woman hired for the day giving Ballard oral sex.
Borys said Ballard not only placed her in inappropriate situations with sex workers but himself engaged in unwelcome sexual acts with her on at least two dozen occasions, sometimes when they were alone and not conducting any operation. On one such occasion, she said, Ballard, warning that traffickers might be watching through a hotel window, pushed her onto the bed and, despite her objections, penetrated her until she was able to use enough strength to push him away.
For months, Borys said, she was confused about how to think about Ballard’s conduct, because, over time, it began feeling like a routine part of the job. She initially defended Ballard as concerns about his behavior began to percolate at the nonprofit and he resigned. “I have never been taken advantage of,” she wrote in an email that Ballard has filed as an exhibit in court. It was sent to Ballard and an executive of the organization and addressed to “To Whom It May Concern.”
In fact, she said, she was already having doubts about him, and wrote the email because Ballard had pressured her to do so. She was beginning to distance herself from him, she said, and asking herself hard questions.
“I believed it. I believed it worked. I believed Tim. I believed the mission. I believed. I literally was in a cult,” she said. “I did remember thinking throughout my time with him like, ‘Why am I feeling sorry for myself?’ Like, I come home at night. People who are victims or trafficked, they don’t get to come home at night.”
Mark Eisenhut, a lawyer for Ballard, said Ballard did not harass or physically assault any of the women he worked with, nor did he have any inappropriate contact with sex workers. The women’s claims against Ballard, he said, have been “ever evolving and ever morphing,” becoming more serious over time.
“He has never been charged with a crime, and every court considering a complaint against the Ballards so far has ruled in their favor,” Eisenhut said.
Ballard scored a legal victory in June when a judge dismissed Righter’s claims of fraud and conspiracy related to the couple’s ruse. The judge found that there were insufficient facts to prove that Ballard and other leaders of the organization had planned the ruse tactic as a ploy for sexual misconduct. Righter was not among those who alleged assault by Ballard.
Other women besides Borys said they also began having serious doubts.
Krista Kacey, a hair and makeup artist who initially met Ballard on a film set and later went with him on international operations, joined several other women in a lawsuit over her experience with the organization. She described in her suit and in an interview a mission in the Dominican Republic in March 2022. There, the two of them stayed at a dedicated sex house, and Ballard brought in two sex workers to the room they were sharing.
What ensued was a night that Kacey described as “horribly traumatic.” For hours, she said, they were physically interacting with the sex workers — touching and groping without technically having sex — with no apparent progress in gaining information about child victims. Afterward, she recalled, Ballard bragged that they had managed to have what amounted to an orgy without engaging in full sex — a claim she knew was only technically true. After that, she made a decision to avoid working with Ballard on undercover operations.
“It became very clear to me that we were not getting intel,” Kacey said. “There was no clear purpose.”
Lynch, the Salt Lake City hairdresser, said she grew wary about Ballard after his escalating physical touches and a night spent at a local strip club, where he asked her to give him a lap dance — all in the name of practicing for missions.
She said she had been working for several months with Ballard — whom she considered a close friend — when he began displaying increasingly erratic behavior.
Then one night in January 2022, as she described it in court records, he came to her house to get his hair cut and was acting particularly disconnected. He told her that he believed the two of them had been married in another life, she said, and he started to pull her clothes off. She repeatedly told him to stop and tried to escape his grasp, she said, but he pinned her on the stairs and forced himself on her.
Ballard, through a lawyer, has said that no such assault occurred, instead contending that Lynch had made advances to him. Lynch’s initial request for a protective order to keep Ballard away from her was dismissed by a judge who referred to the case as a “colossal he said, she said,” and noted that Lynch had made some “inconsistent statements.” She added that victims often do not immediately report everything that happened to them and that it would take an evidentiary hearing to fully determine the facts.
But Lynch said the encounter at her house had left her feeling deeply ashamed and disillusioned.
“I thought he was an amazing human,” she said. “And he did this to me.”
External Acclaim and Internal Concerns
“Sound of Freedom” had languished as an unfinished project for years. Filming was completed in 2018, with actor Jim Caviezel starring as Ballard. But the filmmakers, including Mexican director Alejandro Monteverde, had struggled to find a studio or platform that would bring it to the public.
That changed when Angel Studios, a company that had found success distributing “The Chosen” television series about the life of Jesus, acquired the rights last year. The company managed to raise $5 million from thousands of investors to distribute and market the film. It gained further traction with a unique pay-it-forward campaign that asked filmgoers to help fund tickets for even more viewers. At his golf club in New Jersey, Trump hosted a screening of “Sound of Freedom.”
The movie depicted Ballard as a savior driven to action by moral fury, willing to risk his life to save children from sex slavery. “God’s children are not for sale,” his character says in what became the film’s tagline.
But before the movie was released, the concerns about Ballard were intensifying inside his nonprofit. Records show that one female employee, who is not part of the current litigation, filed an internal complaint at Operation Underground Railroad describing Ballard as a “master manipulator” and detailing graphic sexual scenarios that he had her perform as part of their undercover operations.
After the organization cut ties with Ballard, Beck, who had been a longtime friend and supporter of Ballard’s, said on his podcast that he found reports about Ballard’s behavior to be “disturbing” and described himself as feeling “completely duped.”
“Sound of Freedom” nonetheless turned into one of the year’s most successful films, out-earning the latest “Mission Impossible” movie and Taylor Swift’s concert film in domestic box office sales.
One of the people who was excited to see “Sound of Freedom” was Lynch’s mother, Jill Peterson, who had long followed Ballard’s career. Peterson invited her daughter to see it in a theater.
Lynch declined, but it was not until two months later that she found the courage to explain why. She drove to her mother’s house.
“I’ve been trying to tell you something for a while,” she said then, sobbing.
Peterson said that what her daughter went on to share that day took her breath away. She pulled her daughter onto her lap, holding her tight. She remembers her daughter expressing a wish to die, and herself feeling waves of regret and betrayal wash over her.
“I believed in the cause. I believed in the man,” she said.

Nvidia Revenue Jumps 122% in Positive Sign for Tech’s AI Boom

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
This summer, Wall Street and Silicon Valley began to question whether generative artificial intelligence could produce enough benefits to justify its staggering costs.
But chipmaker Nvidia showed Wednesday that enthusiasm for AI is still running hot. The company, a bellwether for AI spending, blew past Wall Street’s expectations for another quarter, reporting that its sales and profit had more than doubled during the three months that ended in July. It also projected that sales in the current quarter would increase 80% from a year ago, exceeding earlier estimates.
Revenue was $30.04 billion in the quarter, surpassing its $28 billion estimate in May. Net income rose to $16.95 billion from $6.19 billion a year ago, eclipsing the most recent quarterly profits of Meta and Amazon.
Shares in the company, which has been one of the market’s hottest stocks, fell by as much as 7% in after-hours trading, as the company acknowledged it had some production challenges with a forthcoming AI chip. It said the chip would still be available to customers this year.
The company said it would spend an additional $50 billion on repurchasing its own shares. In the quarter ending in July, it spent $15.4 billion on share repurchases and dividends.
The results speak to how Nvidia continues to dominate the market for AI chips, even as it faces rising competition and staggering expectations. Years before other big chip companies, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, bet that semiconductors known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, would make AI systems possible. He built the company over the ensuing years to corner the market.
Nvidia now supplies more than 90% of the chips essential to building AI. It is raking in sales as bigger companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, pour more than $50 billion into building AI data centers to support endeavors as varied as chatbots including ChatGPT and pharmaceutical companies using the technology to develop new drugs.
Nvidia is at the forefront of what is expected to be $1 trillion in spending on data centers and energy costs to support AI, according to analysts.
Wall Street has rewarded Huang’s prescience. Nvidia’s value has tripled over the past year to more than $3 trillion, from $1 trillion, making it one of the three most valuable technology companies in the world along with Microsoft and Apple. But uncertainty about the sustainability of the AI expansion has made its stock price more unpredictable than that of its peers.
The company’s shares sank 10% on a single day in April, its largest decline on record at the time, amid a broader pullback on tech stocks. The stock later rebounded and jumped 4% on Aug. 19, after Goldman Sachs raised its outlook for the company in anticipation of Wednesday’s earnings report.
Customers want more of its chips than Nvidia can produce. The dynamic has raised concerns with government authorities about the company’s power to determine how its scarce but essential technology is being allocated. The Justice Department, the European Union, Britain and China have each begun looking into the company’s sales practices.
Nvidia is also contending with concerns that its chips are critical to national security. Officials in Washington fear that the chips could be used to help China take a lead in AI development.
Two years ago, the U.S. Commerce Department banned shipments of advanced chips to China, forcing Nvidia to create a less powerful chip for the Chinese market. Now, Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, is beginning to make its own AI chips that rival the performance of Nvidia’s products, analysts say.
Competition is on the rise, as well. In the United States, AMD, Intel and smaller players like Cerebras, a startup in Silicon Valley, are releasing more powerful chips. And customers such as Microsoft and Amazon are developing custom chips that could lessen their dependence on Nvidia.
“With every passing quarter, everyone clenches their fist tighter and tighter, and asks, ‘How long can this go on for?’” said Timothy Arcuri, a senior semiconductor analyst with UBS. “The debate isn’t about their sales numbers being good but the bigger picture of whether next year is the peak and the music stops. I think the music goes on for a while.”
The biggest question hanging over Nvidia has been how long its customers will want more of its chips than it can produce. In May, Huang said the company wouldn’t have enough supply to meet customer demand until “well into next year.”
This month, Nvidia’s shares fell after reports that the company would delay shipments of its newest AI chip. The company said in a statement at the time that production for the chip, called Blackwell, was on track for later this year.
But during a call with analysts Wednesday, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, acknowledged that the company had trouble with Blackwell, saying that it had made a change to the GPU production process to improve manufacturing. She said Nvidia would begin making larger volumes of the chip later this year, adding that “demand is well above supply.”
“There were no functional changes,” Huang said on the call. Customers are continuing to purchase Nvidia’s current line of GPUs, he said, because “they need accelerated computing.”
As pressure has risen on Nvidia, Huang has pushed to bolster its business and compete with its customers. Last year, the company developed its own cloud computing product, DGX Cloud, which charges customers $37,000 a month to have access to and control one of its supercomputers.

Full text: Expectations for the chipmaker have been through the roof because of its dominance in a key component for artificial intelligence systems.
This summer, Wall Street and Silicon Valley began to question whether generative artificial intelligence could produce enough benefits to justify its staggering costs.
But the chipmaker Nvidia showed on Wednesday that enthusiasm for A.I. is still running hot. The company, a bellwether for A.I. spending, blew past Wall Street's expectations for another quarter, reporting that its sales and profit had more than doubled during the three months that ended in July. It also projected that sales in the current quarter would increase 80 percent from a year ago, exceeding earlier estimates.
Revenue was $ 30.04 billion in the quarter, surpassing its $ 28 billion estimate in May. Net income rose to $ 16.95 billion from $ 6.19 billion a year ago, eclipsing the most recent quarterly profits of Meta and Amazon.
Shares in the company, which has been one of the market's hottest stocks, fell by as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading, as the company acknowledged that it had some production challenges with a forthcoming A.I. chip. It said that the chip would still be available to customers this year.
The company said it would spend an additional $ 50 billion on repurchasing its own shares. In the quarter ending in July, it spent $ 15.4 billion on share repurchases and dividends.
The results speak to how Nvidia continues to dominate the market for A.I. chips, even as it faces rising competition and staggering expectations. Years before other big chip companies, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, bet that semiconductors known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, would make A.I. systems possible. He built the company over the ensuing years to corner the market.
Nvidia now supplies more than 90 percent of the chips essential to building A.I. It is raking in sales as bigger companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, pour more than $ 50 billion into building A.I. data centers to support endeavors as varied as chatbots like ChatGPT and pharmaceutical companies using the technology to develop new drugs.
Nvidia is at the forefront of what is expected to be $ 1 trillion in spending on data centers and energy costs to support A.I., according to analysts.
Wall Street has rewarded Mr. Huang's prescience. Nvidia's value has tripled over the past year to more than $ 3 trillion, from $ 1 trillion, making it one of the three most valuable technology companies in the world along with Microsoft and Apple. But uncertainty about the sustainability of the A.I. expansion has made its stock price more unpredictable than that of its peers.
The company's shares sank 10 percent on a single day in April, its largest decline on record at the time, amid a broader pullback on tech stocks. The stock later rebounded and jumped 4 percent on Aug. 19, after Goldman Sachs raised its outlook for the company ahead of Wednesday's earnings report.
Customers want more of its chips than Nvidia can produce. The dynamic has raised concerns with government authorities about the company's power to determine how its scarce but essential technology is being allocated. The Justice Department, the European Union, Britain and China have each begun looking into the company's sales practices.
Nvidia is also contending with concerns that its chips are critical to national security. Officials in Washington fear that the chips could be used to help China take a lead in A.I. development.
Two years ago, the U.S. Commerce Department banned shipments of advanced chips to China, forcing Nvidia to create a less powerful chip for the Chinese market. Now, Huawei, one of China's biggest tech companies, is beginning to make its own A.I. chips that rival the performance of Nvidia's products, analysts say.
Competition is on the rise, as well. In the United States, AMD, Intel and smaller players like Cerebras, a start-up in Silicon Valley, are releasing more powerful chips. And customers such as Microsoft and Amazon are developing custom chips that could lessen their dependence on Nvidia.
"With every passing quarter, everyone clinches their fist tighter and tighter, and asks, 'How long can this go on for?"' said Timothy Arcuri, a senior semiconductor analyst with UBS. "The debate isn't about their sales numbers being good but the bigger picture of whether next year is the peak and the music stops. I think the music goes on for a while."
The biggest question hanging over Nvidia has been how long its customers will want more of its chips than it can produce. In May, Mr. Huang said the company wouldn't have enough supply to meet customer demand until "well into next year."
This month, Nvidia's shares fell after reports that the company would delay shipments of its newest artificial intelligence chip. The company said in a statement at the time that production for the chip, called Blackwell, was on track for later this year.
But during a call with analysts on Wednesday, Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, acknowledged that the company had trouble with Blackwell, saying that it had made a change to the GPU production process to improve manufacturing. She said that Nvidia would begin making larger volumes of the chip later this year, adding that "demand is well above supply."
"There were no functional changes," Mr. Huang said on the call. Customers are continuing to purchase Nvidia's current line of GPUs, he said, because "they need accelerated computing."
As pressure has risen on Nvidia, Mr. Huang has pushed to bolster its business and compete with its customers. Last year, the company developed its own cloud computing product, DGX Cloud, which charges customers $ 37,000 a month to have access to and control one of its supercomputers.

Arrest News At Telegram Stirs Debate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pavel Durov, the founder of the app, which has more than 900 million users, was taken into custody by the French authorities.
Telegram, founded in 2013 by the Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has grown into one of the world's largest online communication tools and is central to everyday life in countries like Russia, Ukraine and India for messaging, getting independent news and exchanging views.
The company's growth -- it now has more than 900 million users -- has been driven partly by a commitment to free speech. Telegram's light oversight of what people say or do on the platform has helped people living under authoritarian governments communicate and organize. But it has also made the app a haven for disinformation, far-right extremism and other harmful content.
Many were shocked when reports emerged on Saturday across French news media that Mr. Durov had been arrested in France on charges related to the spread of illicit material on the service. A French judicial official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, confirmed on Sunday evening that Mr. Durov was in police custody. As word spread online over the weekend, news of his detention became a flashpoint in a continuing debate about free speech on the internet.
Elon Musk, the owner of X, which has adopted a similarly hands-off approach to content moderation, posted "#FreePavel" on his X account. "It's 2030 in Europe and you're being executed for liking a meme," he also said.
Leonid Volkov, formerly a top adviser to Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who died in prison last year, wrote on Telegram that although the platform had become a useful tool for criminals, Mr. Durov should be released. "Durov is not an 'accomplice' to the crimes committed by Telegram users," he said.
The reaction over the news of the arrest showed how concerns about free expression, censorship and government oversight of online content are rising at a time when regulatory scrutiny of speech on the internet around the world has ramped up. National governments, especially those in the European Union, have intensified pressure on companies to address disinformation, online extremism, child safety and the spread of illicit material.
Telegram has long been on the radar of law enforcement agencies around the world because terrorist organizations, drug sellers, weapons dealers and far-right extremist groups have used it for communicating, recruiting and organizing.
Mr. Durov, 39, was arrested at Le Bourget Airport near Paris after landing on a private plane from Azerbaijan, according to French news reports. The French judicial official said on Sunday evening that his time in custody had been extended. Under French law, the initial 24 hours spent in custody can be extended to up to 96 hours, depending on the seriousness of the criminal accusations.
Representatives of the French police and Interior Ministry declined to comment.
In a statement on Telegram on Sunday, the company said, "Telegram abides by EU laws," adding, "Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide."
In an interview on Telegram, George Lobushkin, a former press secretary for Mr. Durov who remains close to him, wrote, "This is a monstrous attack on freedom of speech worldwide."
The arrest of Mr. Durov risked intensifying tensions with Russia. The Russian Embassy in France said in a statement on Sunday that it had asked the French authorities for clarification on news of the arrest.
Vladislav Davankov, the deputy speaker of the State Duma, a chamber of Russia's Parliament, called for Mr. Durov's release. He said the arrest could be an effort to gain access to information held by Telegram and "cannot be allowed," according to Meduza, an independent Russian news organization.
Mr. Durov, whose net worth was estimated by Bloomberg at more than $ 9 billion, has largely avoided the kind of public scrutiny faced by top executives of other large online platforms, including Elon Musk of X, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Shou Chew of TikTok and Sundar Pichai of Google.
Mr. Durov's arrest has little precedent. While the European Union and United States government have summoned and questioned leaders of other social media firms, rarely has a major tech leader been arrested over what takes place on such sites. In 2016, the Brazilian authorities arrested a senior Facebook executive after the company failed to turn over information from WhatsApp as part of a drug trafficking investigation.
Of particular interest after Mr. Durov's reported detainment in France could be what information Telegram would decide to share, or withhold. The French authorities may try to force Telegram to share information with them on criminal channels that, for instance, are used to sell firearms or coordinate terrorist attacks. Such a move could test Telegram's claim to its users that it strictly safeguards their information.
A Russian national, Mr. Durov left Russia in 2014 after he lost control of Vkontakte, the rival to Facebook in Russia. The year before, he had founded Telegram, selling it as an uncensored and secretive way to communicate. The company is now based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Mr. Durov has citizenship in France and the U.A.E., according to Telegram.
Telegram works as a standard messaging app, like iMessage or WhatsApp, but also hosts channels and groups in which large numbers of people can broadcast ideas and communicate.
Telegram's popularity is partly rooted in moves that it made to allow the hosting of huge chat groups of up to 200,000 people, at a time when other social media, like WhatsApp, were taking steps to cut back group sizes in efforts to combat disinformation. Other functions, like the sharing of large files, no limits on sharing links and bots that can interact with users within channels, have helped make it a powerful tool for social organization and coordination.
Those capabilities, combined with the app's minimal moderation, made it a haven for individuals and groups that were banned from other platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
Telegram makes money through in-app purchases, advertising, subscriptions and other promotions. In March, Mr. Durov told The Financial Times that Telegram was nearing profitability and considering an initial public offering.
Reports of Mr. Durov's arrest were immediately met with criticism by fans of the service as an example of governments trying to censor free speech on the internet. Mr. Durov has generally kept a low profile, not doing many media interviews. On his personal Telegram channel, he muses about various topics, including his ascetic lifestyle, the countries he travels to and, more recently, how as a sperm donor he now has more than 100 biological children. On Instagram, he occasionally posts photos of himself shirtless.
Although Mr. Durov portrays himself as a crusader for free speech, many security experts have said Telegram is not sufficiently encrypted. Disinformation analysts also say that, by taking a light touch with moderation, the app has become a major vector for the spread of terrorist propaganda and far-right extremism.
Mr. Durov has linked the creation of Telegram to a run-in he had with Russia's security services, who he said broke into his apartment in an effort to force him to take down opposition political material on Vkontakte. More recently, he abandoned plans to issue a cryptocurrency through Telegram after scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
After he left Russia in 2014, Mr. Durov said he traveled to Berlin, San Francisco, London, Singapore and other cities before making Dubai the headquarters for Telegram. Russia at one point tried to ban Telegram, but the company's troubles appeared to ease after a top company executive appeared in 2020 on a tech panel with Russia's prime minister.
Tucker Carlson, the far-right talk show host who interviewed Mr. Durov this year, said the arrest was "a living warning to any platform owner who refuses to censor the truth at the behest of governments and intel agencies."

Enticement In the Aisles: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: When it opened in 1984, the Costco on West Dimond Boulevard in Anchorage did not seem like the future of food. A glorified shed the color of stale coffee, the warehouse offered the sort of products and deals Alaskans go crazy for: mammoth quantities of staples like peanut butter and tomato sauce, along with local favorites such as caribou sausage. The state's extreme environment and the need to travel hours or even days for groceries made it a hit right off the bat.
Today the parking lot, full of jacked-up, Thuled-out 4x4s on studded tires and mobile homes that look more like mobile fortresses, has a bit of an edge for a grocery store. There's something edgy about the inventory, too: neoprene survival suits, meat grinders, gun safes.
Inside the vast store, overloaded shopping carts seemingly pilot themselves down the aisles. One was pushed by Gabriella Pelesasa, a teenager who was buying, among other things, a pair of whole pigs, at 45 pounds each.
As her sister sat on the cart eating a Costco hot dog, Ms. Pelesasa reported simply, "They have bigger versions of what we want."
Though the Anchorage location, one of the retailer's first, once seemed like a survivalist outlier, today it shows how visionary Costco was.
"In 2020, about one-quarter of the population stockpiled nonperishable foods," said Jennifer Mapes-Christ of the market research firm Packaged Facts. Today, more than half do. Ms. Mapes-Christ said that while the pandemic was an accelerant, the trend began before that, driven by anxieties about climate change and economic instability.
In 2019, one quarter of U.S. consumers shopped at Costco. Today it is nearly one-third. Costco is the third-largest retailer in the world, behind only Amazon and Walmart.
But the success of Costco goes far beyond hoarding. The company has hacked the psyche of the American consumer, appealing to both the responsible-shopping superego ("Twelve cans of tuna for $ 18!") and the buy-it-now id ("I deserve that 98-inch flat screen.")
Ostensibly, Costco is a discount store, a place to save money and stretch your grocery dollar, but it is also an aspirational shopping experience, feeding that most American of appetites: conspicuous consumption.
Few companies have greater influence over what we eat (or wear, or fuel our cars with, or use for personal hygiene). Costco dominates multiple categories of the food supply -- beef, poultry, organic produce, even fine wine from Bordeaux, which it sells more of than any retailer in the world. It is the arbiter of survival for millions of producers, including more than a million cashew farmers in Africa alone. (Costco sells half the world's cashews.) Its private label, Kirkland, generates more revenue than towering brands like Nike and Coca-Cola.
For all its success, the company is not well understood. The top brass are insular and secretive. And beyond quarterly reports, Costco rarely discloses anything of its inner workings.
But to Charlie Munger, the billionaire investor and Warren Buffett's right hand at Berkshire Hathaway, the balance sheet speaks for itself. In one of his last interviews before he died last year, he was succinct: "It is a perfect damn company."
'Everything was about trust'
Costco has often been likened to a cult, in part because once members -- 134 million worldwide -- enter the fold, they rarely leave.
Indeed, devotion to the brand is so avid it has inspired tributes on social media, bits on late-night shows by celebrities hoping to seem relatable and even a book, "The Joy of Costco."
At a time when Americans increasingly view big brands as predatory monopolies or fumbling, broken-down legacies, Costco is revered for its high wages, attentive customer service and "deep commitment to integrity," said Jeremy Smith, the president of Launchpad, an Oregon-based food brand incubator that specializes in placing products at Costco.
Whether Costco is a cult or not, its founder was a Bronx-born lawyer with utopian ideals and strict morals.
Sol Price, born in 1916, was the son of garment workers from Minsk, and belonged to the generation of displaced Jews and other Europeans who thrived in New York's small businesses -- the delis, candy shops and pawnshops of the Depression and postwar years. In the 1920s, the family moved to San Diego, where he went to high school.
After law school at the University of Southern California, Mr. Price started his career representing grocers and other merchants. With the temperament of a shopkeeper who obsesses over his customers and fusses over the smallest of details, in the 1950s Mr. Price began converting empty San Diego warehouses into members-only bazaars where for a small fee, shoppers could get everything from hosiery to cigarettes at wholesale prices. The key to the business, called FedMart, was simple: keep members renewing year after year.
In 2003, Mr. Price described his philosophy to Fortune magazine as "How do we sell stuff at the lowest markup?" The overriding goal, he said, was "to look at everything from the standpoint of, is it really being honest with the customer?"
Mr. Price had a gift for connecting with shoppers at a time of exploding prosperity and social change, but paradoxically, one of his rules was not making too much money.
"He grew up in a family of socialists. He was a capitalist. He liked to make money, but he was pro-union, pro-labor, pro-little guy," said David Schwartz, who co-wrote "The Joy of Costco" with his wife, Susan. "Everything was about trust. He would rather lose your business than your trust."
Through a series of mergers over the years, Sol Price's FedMart became what we know as Costco in the 1990s. To an uncanny degree for a modern corporation, the company, now headquartered in Issaquah, Wash., has remained true to Mr. Price's vision. It is still relationship-minded, and members seem satisfied, renewing at a rate of 93 percent. Last quarter, the membership fees accounted for $ 1.12 billion, about two-thirds of Costco's $ 1.68 billion total net income. The dependence, in other words, remains mutual.
Wall Street also likes what Costco does, especially the dependable cash flow that comes from membership. Occasionally, shareholders feel neglected -- in 2004, an analyst with Deutsche Bank complained that Costco was "overly generous" with its employee benefits, saying, "Public companies need to care for shareholders first." But few complain about the returns.
"I did the calculation once," Mr. Schwartz said. "The stock price has grown 17 percent annually since the founding."
'A giant ecosystem'
Four thousand miles south of Anchorage, in Sugar Land, Texas, no one flies in by bush plane to shop. But in this swampy Houston suburb, life orbits around Costco just the same.
The site of a former prison farm for the sugar industry, Sugar Land has transformed in recent years into an interlocking complex of master-planned communities. In June, Costco opened Warehouse No. 882, its third in the area, on a prime piece of land.
On opening day, the al-Abadi family stood at the entrance, trailed by a long line of members waiting since dawn, despite the punishing heat.
Shariah al-Abadi, who came with a shopping list in mind ("butter, oil, the essentials") and the intention to stick to it, epitomized one type of Costco member. Her teenage daughter Fatima typified another: She was there for the possibility of surprise. For months, as the new warehouse rose from the mud, so had Fatima's anticipation. After an hour shopping in the new store, mother and daughter checked out with a cart barely containing the day's haul, including a six-foot-tall teddy bear.
"We'll be back," sighed Ms. al-Abadi, who said she goes to Costco "twice a week. Sometimes more."
Like Anchorage, Sugar Land is home to a rapidly growing Asian American population (largely Indian and Pakistani American in Sugar Land), which Costco is eager to serve, despite the challenge of operating across a nation of wildly varying local tastes and traditions.
"Costco knows what's going on in Texas because they have an office there," Mr. Smith said. "It's very astute. They're one of the few retailers that will allow a brand to go into just one building and test their product."
As a result, Costco is able to pick up on trends and send intel back to Issaquah. "It's a giant ecosystem," said Mr. Smith, if also one dependent on human capital -- the expertise of warehouse managers. Costco tends to promote from within, inculcating personnel with the company's idiosyncratic culture for decades, if not entire careers. Many of the company's top employees began as baggers or food handlers.
That limited Costco's expansion in the past. For many years the company declined to open new warehouses at the rate Wall Street wanted, because of management concerns that the facilities were too challenging to operate.
This concern seems to have waned, however. Costco now opens about 30 warehouses a year, with a growing number abroad. "Overseas expansion is where the growth is coming," Susan Schwartz said. "Right now they've got seven warehouses in China. But they could have 150."
East Asia has indeed been fertile for Costco, with openings this year in Japan (where it already has 33 warehouses), South Korea, Australia and China. That experience has yielded dividends at home. Expertise in Taiwanese and South Korean shopping preferences translated into the availability in the United States of products like braised abalone in brown sauce, giant red sea cucumber and Chinese-style bacon -- and brand loyalty from Asian Americans.
Yutack Kang, a content creator from Milpitas, Calif., with 463,000 TikTok followers, posts frequently about "sus foods at Costco you're too afraid to try." One of his latest: frozen durian pulp produced by Lucky Taro, a Los Angeles-based importer.
"The Asian food selection is superb," Mr. Kang wrote in an email.
'Costco would never'
By and large, Americans do not trust corporations. But when asked which companies they do trust, they consistently rank Costco near the top.
"They're selling the same food everyone else is selling," Mr. Smith said. "It's not like the products are magical. But they created a culture."
Sol Price wanted Costco members to feel respected and smart. The company remains known for its no-questions-asked return policy, high-quality products and cheerful customer service. Employees are paid significantly better (an average of $ 26 per hour) than their counterparts at major retailers (an average $ 17 per hour). That helps create "a stable, motivated, capable team," said Zeynep Ton, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.
Perhaps most important is Costco's abiding reputation for low prices.
For Kirkland products, for instance, Ms. Ton said "they don't mark up anything more than 14 or 15 percent." This includes Costco's flagship product, the wildly popular $ 1.50 hot-dog-and-soda combo, which has cost the same since 1985. It's not publicly known whether the company makes money on the 200 million hot dogs it sells each year, but the pricing is widely seen as brilliant marketing.
Another, less obvious way Costco keeps faith with its members is by not selling shelf space. "Many retailers ask suppliers to pay for a position in a store," said Mark Stovin, a former Costco executive who now works for OSMG, a leading food broker. "Costco would never do that."
Mr. Stovin said Costco also does something almost none of its competitors do: restrain itself in mining customer data. "They have a number for every member, which could be trackable, traceable, and they could certainly dive into that," Mr. Stovin said. "They really haven't."
It appears the company may be loosening up: Costco recently announced that it would join companies with less consumer-friendly reputations like Uber in starting a retail media network, serving ads to members based on their purchasing histories. (The company declined to say what platforms those ads might appear on. In a further shift, that effort will be led by an outsider, a veteran marketer from Walmart.)
Costco remains reluctant to embrace technology -- it was a latecomer to e-commerce, for instance -- which may be attributable to the spirit of Mr. Price, who commanded managers to step away from their computers.
"If you're a senior manager, your job is to interact with members," Mr. Schwartz said. "They expect senior people to be on the floor all the time."
That ethos goes all the way to the top.
At the Sugar Land opening, Ron Vachris, who in January became Costco's chief executive, just the third in the company's 42-year history, could be seen chatting with floor personnel and inspecting the frozen tilapia. Hundreds of Costco employees, who are known for exuberant loyalty, had driven from as far away as Baton Rouge, La., to celebrate and shake hands with their new boss.
Mr. Vachris, who started as a forklift operator in 1982, greeted employees and customers warmly, seemingly willing to hang out all morning. Approached by a reporter, however, he handed over his business card and retreated into a corporate cadence. ("Texas has been a great state to us. We're excited to have another building here.") Subsequent requests for an interview were declined.
Costco executives are known for avoiding the press, which contributes to the company mystique. "They have amazing discipline," Ms. Ton said. "If you go on LinkedIn, you won't find much information about their executives." And the company has no media relations office.
Because of Costco's secrecy, judging whether the company lives up to its own professed standards can be a challenge.
"It would be interesting to know more about how they use their data," said Raghu Iyengar, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School.
Since almost nothing is known publicly about Costco's internal workings, he said, even its sterling reputation for low prices cannot be verified. To determine whether Costco's prices are in fact "selling stuff at the lowest markup," the company would need to be less guarded.
'Treasure Hunt Atmosphere'
Situated between a defunct strip club, Brooklyn's industrial waterfront and a raucous, sludge-oozing elevated expressway, Costco Warehouse No. 318 is low on sparkle but hums with manic energy. The Sunset Park location seems to have set aside shelf space for every immigrant group in Brooklyn. Beyond that, though, this could be a Costco anywhere. That works to Costco's advantage.
One way the company strokes the value-driven superegos of its members is simply with the presentation of its warehouses. With their exposed wiring, minimal sunlight and nary a Spotify playlist, the warehouses are, well, warehouses, with fluorescent lighting and bad acoustics, designed to be built in a hurry. (The 3.5-acre Sugar Land building, for example, took only four months to assemble.)
That no-frills presentation transmits a reassuring signal of benign intent: We're not trying to seduce you. Which is its own kind of come-on.
"The customer walks in the door, and immediately there is a perception of value," said Paco Underhill, the author of "Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping." "The perception of value means that as someone walks in, discretionary purchases take on a different mantle than they might at Kroger, Target or Macy's. People go, 'I would never think about buying that. But if I did, this is the place to get it."'
For all its piety, the last thing Costco wants is for shoppers to stick to a budget. On the contrary, it wants them to return to the parking lot balancing a wobbly heap of products they had no intention of buying -- a strategy known as "the Costco effect."
"You've heard the phrase," Mr. Vachris said on an earnings call in May. "People come in to spend $ 100 and walk out with $ 300."
"We have created a treasure-hunt atmosphere," said Jim Sinegal, the previous Costco chief executive, in an address to San Diego State University business students in 2017. "We try to create a sense of urgency, that if you see the product there, you better buy it, because chances are they won't be there next time."
In recent years, the treasure-hunt offerings have included Burberry shoulder bags ( $ 1,000) and bottles of Romanée-Conti wine (a four-pack for $ 40,000). Last year the retailer even began offering one-ounce gold bars for about $ 2,000, which typically sell out within hours. (It has been estimated that Costco sells some $ 200 million in gold a month.)
And this manufactured circle of desire and regret works.
"I love Costco," said Erica Rualo, a content strategist at Chase Bank, who has shopped at the Sunset Park warehouse. "But I hate the feeling of 'I wish I had bought that,' because now it's gone. Or 'I should have bought more of that."'
Strictly speaking, Costco can still answer Sol Price's question "Is it really being honest with the customer?" with a "Yes." But at this point the spirit of his edict may have been lost to its letter.
It would be hard to argue that Costco buyers don't know what they are getting into. After all, they have to ferry the cart with the seven-foot-artificial tree, the solar panel, the steel pet coffin and the three-month supply of Belgian mini-cream puffs back to the car.
"The idea is that you don't feel that these are temptations," said Ayelet Fishbach, a behavioral psychologist at the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business "You're getting a great deal."
But, she added, "The question is, Do you actually need this? You probably don't."

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — When it opened in 1984, the Costco on West Dimond Boulevard in Anchorage, Alaska, did not seem like the future of food. A glorified shed the color of stale coffee, the warehouse offered the sort of products and deals Alaskans go crazy for: mammoth quantities of staples such as peanut butter and tomato sauce, along with local favorites such as caribou sausage. The state’s extreme environment and the need to travel hours or even days for groceries made it a hit right off the bat.
Today the parking lot, full of jacked-up 4x4s on studded tires and mobile homes that look more like mobile fortresses, has a bit of an edge for a grocery store. There’s something edgy about the inventory, too: neoprene survival suits, meat grinders, gun safes.
Though the Anchorage location, one of the retailer’s first, once seemed like a survivalist outlier, today it shows how visionary Costco was.
In 2020, about one-quarter of the population stockpiled nonperishable foods,” said Jennifer Mapes-Christ of the market research firm Packaged Facts.
Nearly one-third of U.S. customers shop at Costco. It is the third-largest retailer in the world, behind only Amazon and Walmart.
But the success of Costco goes far beyond hoarding. The company has hacked the psyche of the American consumer, appealing to both the responsible-shopping superego (“Twelve cans of tuna for $18!”) and the buy-it-now id (“I deserve that 98-inch flat screen”).
Ostensibly, Costco is a discount store, a place to save money and stretch your grocery dollar, but it is also an aspirational shopping experience, feeding that most American of appetites: conspicuous consumption.
Few companies have greater influence over what we eat (or wear, or fuel our cars with, or use for personal hygiene). Costco dominates multiple categories of the food supply — beef, poultry, organic produce, even fine wine from Bordeaux, which it sells more of than any retailer in the world. Its private label, Kirkland, generates more revenue than towering brands like Nike and Coca-Cola.
For all its success, the company is not well understood. The top brass are insular and secretive. And beyond quarterly reports, Costco rarely discloses anything of its inner workings.
But to Charlie Munger, the billionaire investor and Warren Buffett’s right hand at Berkshire Hathaway, the balance sheet speaks for itself. In one of his last interviews before he died last year, he was succinct: “It is a perfect damn company.”
‘Everything Was About Trust’
Once Costco members — 134 million worldwide — enter the fold, they rarely leave.
Indeed, devotion to the brand is so avid it has inspired tributes on social media, bits on late-night shows by celebrities hoping to seem relatable and even a book, “The Joy of Costco.”
Its founder was a Bronx-born lawyer with utopian ideals and strict morals.
Sol Price, born in 1916, was the son of garment workers from Minsk, Poland, and belonged to the generation of displaced Jews and other Europeans who thrived in New York’s small businesses. In the 1920s, the family moved to San Diego.
After law school at the University of Southern California, Price started his career representing grocers and other merchants. In the 1950s, Price began converting empty San Diego warehouses into members-only bazaars where for a small fee, shoppers could get everything from hosiery to cigarettes at wholesale prices. The key to the business, called FedMart, was simple: keep members renewing year after year.
In 2003, Price described his philosophy to Fortune magazine as “How do we sell stuff at the lowest markup?” The overriding goal, he said, was “to look at everything from the standpoint of, is it really being honest with the customer?”
Through a series of mergers over the years, Sol Price’s FedMart became what we know as Costco in the 1990s. To an uncanny degree for a modern corporation, the company, now headquartered in Issaquah, Washington, has remained true to Price’s vision. It is still relationship-minded, and members seem satisfied, renewing at a rate of 93%. Last quarter, the membership fees accounted for $1.12 billion, about two-thirds of Costco’s $1.68 billion total net income. The dependence, in other words, remains mutual.
‘A Giant Ecosystem’
Four thousand miles south of Anchorage, in Sugar Land, Texas, no one flies in by bush plane to shop. But in this swampy Houston suburb, life orbits around Costco just the same.
The site of a former prison farm for the sugar industry, Sugar Land has transformed in recent years into an interlocking complex of master-planned communities. In June, Costco opened Warehouse No. 882, its third in the area, on a prime piece of land.
Like Anchorage, Sugar Land is home to a rapidly growing Asian American population (largely Indian and Pakistani American in Sugar Land), which Costco is eager to serve, despite the challenge of operating across a nation of wildly varying local tastes and traditions.
“Costco knows what’s going on in Texas because they have an office there,” Smith said. “It’s very astute. They’re one of the few retailers that will allow a brand to go into just one building and test their product.”
As a result, Costco is able to pick up on trends and send intel back to Issaquah. “It’s a giant ecosystem,” said Smith, if also one dependent on human capital — the expertise of warehouse managers. Costco tends to promote from within, inculcating personnel with the company’s idiosyncratic culture for decades, if not entire careers. Many of the company’s top employees began as baggers or food handlers.

U.S. to Award $1.6 Billion to Texas Instruments for Semiconductor Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The funding stems from the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which aims to bolster the production of critical semiconductors in the United States.
The Biden administration will award up to $ 1.6 billion in grants to Texas Instruments to help the company build three new manufacturing plants, the latest in a slew of awards intended to ramp up the nation's production of semiconductors.
The funds will help the Dallas-based company construct two plants in Sherman, Texas, and a facility in Lehi, Utah, Commerce Department officials announced on Friday. The grant is meant to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors, the tiny chips that are key components of electronic devices.
The investment will "advance U.S. economic security and mitigate those same supply chain vulnerabilities that were brought to light during the pandemic," said Laurie E. Locascio, the under secretary of commerce for standards and technology, during a call with reporters on Thursday night.
In addition to the grant, the department will award up to $ 3 billion in loans to Texas Instruments, officials said. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. The funds will support the company's investment of more than $ 18 billion to construct the new facilities, officials said.
The funding comes from the CHIPS Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support in 2022. The legislation was intended to bolster the domestic production of semiconductors and reduce the nation's dependence on Asian countries for them. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are manufactured in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Ramping up domestic chip manufacturing has been a major goal for President Biden, whose economic policy agenda focuses in part on boosting American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades.
The legislation also came in response to the expensive and economically damaging chip shortages that occurred during the pandemic. Officials said the Texas Instruments award would support the company's production of current-generation and mature, or less advanced, semiconductors that were in short supply during the pandemic.
The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to dole out as grants to encourage chipmakers to build and expand new facilities in the United States. So far, the Biden administration has announced more than $ 30 billion in grants through the program. Several companies that manufacture more advanced semiconductors have received multibillion dollar awards in recent months, including Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung.
Texas Instruments broke ground on its new plants in Sherman in May 2022, and on its Lehi plant in November 2023.
Together, the new plants are expected to create more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs, federal officials said. The first facility in Sherman is expected to begin production as early as 2025, and the plant in Lehi is expected to start production as early as 2026.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, has estimated that the new investments will help the United States triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, increasing the nation's share of global chip manufacturing to 14 percent.
The federal effort has helped catalyze nearly $ 400 billion in private investments from semiconductor and electronics companies, administration officials said.
Still, longer-term questions about the viability of some companies remain. Intel said this month that it would cut more than 15,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force. Company officials have said they remained committed to expanding its semiconductor facilities in America.

Can This Country Show Europe How to Compete Again?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Sweden outperforms in tech, has a roster of $ 1 billion-plus start-ups and could be a model as the European Union refigures its growth policies.
Sweden's economy has, in many ways, suffered from the same tribulations as the rest of Europe: recent bouts of crushing inflation and recession, and now the prospect of meager growth in a world split by geopolitical and economic conflict.
Nevertheless, the Nordic country has a roster of high-tech entrepreneurs that is the envy of its neighbors. Spotify and Skype are globally recognized brand names. Klarna, a financial tech firm, and King Digital Entertainment, the maker of the video game juggernaut Candy Crush, are other examples of homegrown tech powerhouses.
"They have something -- particularly in the tech sector -- which other European countries do not really have to the same extent," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.
That entrepreneurial track record has been attracting renewed attention at a time when anxieties are mounting about Europe's ability to compete with American and Chinese advancements in high technology.
The United States has turned out a generation of companies like Google, Meta and Amazon, while China's tech scene flourished with firms like Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.
Europe, of course, has its own star tech giants like the Netherlands' ASML, a global leader in the semiconductor sector. But as a whole, the continent is seen more as a bystander than an innovator, known more for its aggressive regulation of foreign tech firms than building businesses of its own.
The economic impact of falling behind is substantial, but it also has important social implications. European policymakers worry about the long-term effect of relying on foreign corporations for communication, social media, shopping and entertainment rather than on companies with what is widely referred to as "European values."
Those values include a stronger appreciation for protecting privacy, preventing the dissemination of hateful speech and maintaining strong labor protections and a better work-life balance.
Critics of European tech policies complain about less access to venture capital and a cultural aversion to risk-taking. Europe's tech workers have often moved to the United States rather than build companies at home.
But Sweden has had a different experience. It has produced more tech unicorns -- start-ups valued at more than $ 1 billion -- per capita than any other country in Europe after tiny Estonia, according to a report on European tech by Atomico, an investment firm. And it ranked fourth in the number of unicorns, after Britain, Germany and France, countries whose populations are six to nine times as large.
Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank who is analyzing the "competitiveness crisis" for the European Union, recently pointed to Sweden as an example to be followed. Its tech sector is twice as productive as the European Union's average and it provides strong social programs, he noted.
In interviews, a dozen entrepreneurs, investors and economists agreed that an ingredient of Sweden's success were initiatives in the 1990s that gave a wide swath of the public access to personal computers and broadband. At the time, most people were just getting used to the screeching woof of dial-up modems.
Fredrick Cassel, a partner at Creandum, a venture capital firm that invested in Spotify and Klarna, said his ability to use the internet at home set him on the path to being a tech investor.
The push to get a PC in every home and build connectivity gave Sweden an edge in producing an "engineering generation," Mr. Cassel, 50, said. "I have a hard time seeing that happen without those two pieces of infrastructure in place."
The Swedish tech entrepreneur Hjalmar Nilsonne had a similar experience. He remembers getting his own Pentium II HP computer in 1998 when he was 10 years old: It "changed my life, by introducing me to programming and the internet."
Mr. Nilsonne, who founded and later sold Watty, recently co-founded a start-up called Neko Health with Daniel Ek, the founder and chief executive of Spotify.
"He had the exact same story as I did," Mr. Nilsonne said of his Neko partner. "We started playing around with computers. We learned how to build websites. We started selling websites to friends and family when we were teenagers. And that was all possible because we had very early access to the internet."
Analysts also point to a tradition in Sweden of public and private investment in research and development, which currently amounts to 3.4 percent of total output, one of the highest percentages in Europe. There was also a deep pool of assets from family foundations like Wallenberg and Ikea as well as a government-controlled pension system that served as local sources of early venture capital in the small nation.
Swedish businesses have always been pushed to search for customers outside the country, which has a population of only 10 million, said Asa Zetterberg, the managing director of TechSverige, a trade organization.
That has forced start-ups and industry, she said, to "be competitive in the global economy."
Half of the country's gross domestic product comes from exports, and the tech sector accounted for 11 percent of total exports in 2022.
Niklas Zennstrom, a founder of Skype who is now chief executive of Atomico, said that start-ups could get early funding but had a much harder time getting financing for expansion in Europe compared with their counterparts in the United States.
Pressure for more financing comes amid a push by governments around the world to more forcefully direct economic development. The United States has kicked up spending on semiconductors, alternative energy and electric vehicles by hundreds of billions of dollar to compete more aggressively with China.
President Biden's signature pieces of legislation emphasized subsidies, loan guarantees and tax incentives for companies investing in the green transition and advanced technology.
The Biden policies also nodded to social support like requiring chip makers that receive subsidies to supply affordable child care. But the focus is on industrial and technological nuts and bolts.
Founders and investors in Sweden repeatedly pointed to the crucial role that the country's expansive social safety net plays in encouraging entrepreneurs to experiment and take risks -- despite the high taxes it takes to finance the programs.
An effective "social welfare system" is the best way the Swedish government can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, Mr. Cassel at Creandum said.
Free education, free health care, free child care. "You can afford to take risks, you will not be on the street" if you fail, he said.
Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the founder of Klarna, similarly credited Sweden's safety net.
He said his immigrant parents were often unemployed when he was a child. Still, he was able to get health care, attend the best schools and get a home computer early on "without having any money."
Sweden (along with Belgium) spends more on education as a percentage of gross domestic product than any other member of the European Union.
Mr. Siemiatkowski pointed out that Sweden is also way ahead of the United States on equal opportunity. The country ranked fourth on the World Economic Forum's social mobility index in 2020, the latest available. The United States ranked 27th.
That, he said, is an important reason that Sweden "punches above its weight."

Full text: The business executive helped turn Google into an internet juggernaut and became one of the most prominent women in Silicon Valley.
Susan Wojcicki, who helped turn Google from a start-up in her garage into an internet juggernaut, and who became one of Silicon Valley's most prominent female executives with her leadership of YouTube, died on Friday. She was 56.
Her death was confirmed by her husband, Dennis Troper, who wrote on Facebook that she had been living with lung cancer for two years. He did not say where she died.
Ms. Wojcicki's more than two decades with Google began in 1998 in her house in Menlo Park, Calif., part of which she rented to her friends Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company's founders. For $ 1,700 a month, the two used the garage as their office to build the search engine.
Ms. Wojcicki, who had been working at Intel, soon joined Google as one of its earliest employees and was its first marketing manager. Over the years, she reached its executive ranks, becoming Google's most senior woman employee. She eventually led YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, and which became one of the world's largest social media companies.
"She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it's hard to imagine the world without her," Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said in a statement.
When she became YouTube's chief executive in 2014, Ms. Wojcicki was hailed as the most powerful woman in advertising. She had made Google enormously profitable, and she was expected to repeat the trick at YouTube. She led Google's ad business and played a key role in its acquisition of DoubleClick, an advertising technology company, in 2007.
At YouTube, she introduced new forms of advertising and subscription offerings for music, original content and YouTube TV. During her tenure, YouTube became the internet's most popular video service, and her role shifted to control of hate speech, inappropriate content, extremism and misinformation.
In an interview with The New York Times in 2019, Ms. Wojcicki suggested that her legacy at YouTube would depend on whether it succeeded in content moderation, something the company has struggled with.
"I know we can do better, but we're going to get there. We'll get to a point where we have solved a lot of these issues, and I feel like we've already made significant progress," she said. "I own this problem, and I'm going to fix it."
She stepped down from her role last year, writing to YouTube employees at the time that she had decided to focus on "my family, health, and personal projects."
But she remained an adviser to Alphabet, Google's parent company. And she was active as a philanthropist, Mr. Pichai wrote in a letter to his staff, supporting, among other causes, research for the disease that took her life. She had built a personal fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions throughout her career.
Susan Diane Wojcicki was born on July 5, 1968, in Santa Clara, Calif. Her father, Stanley, who died last year, was a particle physicist at Stanford University. Her mother, Esther, worked as a journalist and later as a teacher.
Ms. Wojcicki was the eldest of three daughters. Her sister Janet is an epidemiologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. Her sister Anne was a founder of the genetics testing firm 23andMe and was once married to Mr. Brin.
As a young girl, Ms. Wojcicki said in a video in 2015, she was curious, hard-working and ready to try "all kinds of new things and new extracurriculars." At Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, she worked on the school newspaper, The Oracle, her mother said in an interview with Fortune in 2012.
Ms. Wojcicki studied history and literature at Harvard University, where she graduated in 1990. She had initially planned to get a Ph.D. in economics and become an academic, but her discovery of technology's potential changed her path, she said in an interview with Fast Company in 2014.
She received a master's degree in economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1993 and a master's degree in business from the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1998.
That year, she married Mr. Troper, who was a financial consultant at Deloitte in San Francisco while she was working in marketing at Intel in Santa Clara, according to Palo Alto Weekly. In 2003 he would join Google, where he is currently employed, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Ms. Wojcicki was four months pregnant with the couple's first child in 1999 when she joined Google; by then, the company had left her garage for more conventional office space. She campaigned for paid parental leave to become standard not only at Google but at other businesses, promoting the policy in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal in 2014. She and Mr. Troper had five children.
In February, Ms. Wojcicki's son Marco, 19, a freshman at Berkeley, died, his grandmother Esther Wojcicki announced on social media at the time. The San Francisco Chronicle, citing the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, reported that the cause was ruled a drug overdose.
In addition to her husband, she is survived by her other four children; her sisters, Anne and Janet Wojcicki; and her mother.
Hunter Walk, a former product manager at Google who worked closely with Ms. Wojcicki, said he admired her ability to be a "translator" in navigating the many "islands, personalities and different incentives" at Google as it ballooned from a small start-up to a sprawling corporation.
"You had to convince her first, but if she believed in you and your idea, she could help translate it for Larry and Sergey," Mr. Walk said in an email. "That was the most powerful advocacy a product leader could have on their side."
"She was the tip of all our spears, so to speak," he added. "A very kind, very smart and very normal spear."

For Taiwan Chipmaker, Obstacles at U.S. Site: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, one of the world's biggest makers of advanced computer chips, announced plans in May 2020 to build a facility on the outskirts of Phoenix. Four years later, the company has yet to start selling semiconductors made in Arizona.
The Taiwanese company's presence in the state was viewed as an all-around win: It would boost advanced chip making in the United States and help diversify TSMC's manufacturing away from Taiwan, an island democracy that is the focus of increasingly aggressive geopolitical claims by China. TSMC has committed $ 65 billion to the project, and in April, the Biden administration announced that the company would receive a $ 6.6 billion grant funded by the CHIPS and Science Act.
American officials have long been concerned about the country's reliance on TSMC. Gina M. Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, has said America buys 92 percent of its "leading edge" chips from Taiwan. The TSMC factory in Arizona stands as a test of American efforts to diversify its reliance on chips produced overseas.
In Taiwan, TSMC has honed a highly complex manufacturing process: A network of skilled engineers and specialized suppliers, backed by government support, etches microscopic pathways into pieces of silicon known as wafers.
But getting all this to take root in the American desert has been a bigger challenge than the company expected.
"We keep reminding ourselves that just because we are doing quite well in Taiwan doesn't mean that we can actually bring the Taiwan practice here," said Richard Liu, the director of employee communications and relations at the site.
In recent interviews, 12 TSMC employees, including executives, said culture clashes between Taiwanese managers and American workers had led to frustration on both sides. TSMC is known for its rigorous working conditions. It's not uncommon for people to be called into work for emergencies in the middle of the night. In Phoenix, some American employees quit after disagreements over expectations boiled over, according to the employees, some of whom asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The company, which has pushed back the plant's start date, now says it expects to begin chip production in Arizona in the first half of 2025.
The Arizona project could also face political threats. Former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told Bloomberg Businessweek in June that Taiwan had taken the chip industry away from the United States. Without naming TSMC, he criticized U.S. funding of Taiwanese companies to make chips in America.
On top of working to address the cultural differences in the workplace, TSMC is gearing up to recruit skilled workers to staff the Arizona plant for years to come. The company faces similar challenges in Japan and Germany, where it is also expanding.
In Taiwan, TSMC is able to draw on thousands of engineers and decades of relationships with suppliers. But in the United States, TSMC must build everything from the ground up.
"Here at this site, a lot of things we actually have to do from scratch," Mr. Liu said.
The facility, surrounded by scaffolding and construction cranes, is an unmistakable landmark in northern Phoenix. TSMC has announced plans for three factories at the site, modeled after its giant campus in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan. The first factory, a silver spaceshiplike building, is nearly complete and has begun test runs.
While it was under construction, the company sent American engineers to Tainan for training and to shadow their Taiwanese counterparts, observing TSMC's all-hands-on-deck way of working up close.
Jefferson Patz, an engineer fresh off a master's degree from the University of California, San Diego, went to Tainan in 2021 for 18 months of training shortly after he joined the company.
"Oh, my gosh, people work hard," Mr. Patz said. He recalled that this initial impression had given him a strong sense of what it took to succeed in the industry.
After returning to Arizona, Mr. Patz said, employees were expected to pitch in with work outside their job descriptions because construction of the facility was behind schedule.
This approach did not sit well with everyone. Workers were required to do whatever was needed to finish the most pressing job, he said. Some of the American workers also found it difficult to spend a long stretch of time in Taiwan.
To address the tension between American workers and Taiwanese management, the company gave managers communication training. Since workers have complained about unnecessary meetings, the company has reduced both their frequency and the number of participants.
Three Taiwanese employees in Arizona said the company had tried to lessen the tensions. They described their workloads as less intense than in Taiwan. However, they said they were unsure if lighter workloads would continue as the factory built up to full production next year.
About half of the 2,200 workers at TSMC in Phoenix were brought in from Taiwan, 7,200 miles away. The company said it would create 6,000 jobs as it built the next two factories. It plans to eventually reduce the ratio of Taiwanese transplants to local hires.
"We want to make this site a successful site and a sustainable site," Mr. Liu said. "Sustainable means that we cannot keep relying on Taiwan sending people here."
TSMC has competition for labor in Arizona. Other companies in the area are looking for skilled workers in the race to increase production. Intel, the American chip giant, is expanding its chip factory in the area.
In response, nearby colleges and universities have ramped up their instruction in fields like electrical engineering. TSMC has collaborated with community colleges and universities through apprenticeships, internships, research projects and career fairs.
At Arizona State University, which has emerged as a major source of workers at TSMC, the company funds research projects for students, making it easier to assess and recruit future workers, said Zachary Holman, vice dean of the university's Fulton School of Engineering.
Some colleges are even building their own clean rooms, the cavernous and spotless work areas at the heart of semiconductor factories. The idea is to acclimate students to operating in the highly controlled environments, where technicians wear clean suits and gloves.
One of those manufacturing spaces being built is at Western Maricopa Education Center, a public high school system that provides technical training.
"We have a generation of students whose parents have never once stepped foot into an advanced manufacturing factory," said Scott Spurgeon, the center's superintendent. "Their concept of that is still much like the old mom-and-pop manufacturing where you show up every day and come out with dirty clothes and dirty hands."
In nearby Mesa, Ariz., and other cities, nearly 1,000 participants have graduated from a two-week intensive program in semiconductor technician training.
"We're becoming the Silicon Desert," said Tom Pearson, a dean at Chandler-Gilbert Community College, one of the colleges that run the program.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The announcement of CHIPS Act funding for a plant in Indiana means the United States will have attracted investment from the world's top chipmakers.
The Biden administration said on Tuesday that it would award up to $ 450 million in grants to a South Korean chipmaker, SK Hynix, to help build its new chip facility in Indiana, in what officials described as a milestone in rebuilding the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry.
With the announcement, the United States now has commitments from all five of the world's leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers to construct chip plants in the United States with financial assistance from the administration, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo said in a call with reporters on Monday. The Biden administration previously announced that it had reached agreements with Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Micron to help fund investments in the United States.
"These are the only companies in the world capable of producing leading-edge chips at scale," she said.
SK Hynix announced in April that it had committed to investing $ 3.87 billion in a facility in West Lafayette, Ind. Ms. Raimondo called that investment a "huge deal" because it meant that the United States would "have the most secure and diverse supply chain in the world for the advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence." SK Hynix makes advanced memory chips that are an essential component for creating A.I.
Commerce Department officials said that, with the SK Hynix grant, the United States had now allocated more than $ 30 billion of a $ 39 billion pot of funding that stems from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law aimed at building up domestic chip manufacturing and reducing America's dependence on Asia for vital semiconductors.
Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are manufactured in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990. Reversing the nation's declining share of global chip manufacturing has been a major priority for President Biden and a key component of his economic policy agenda.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, has estimated that the new investments will help the United States triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, raising America's share of world chip manufacturing to 14 percent by 2032.
Other companies have won much larger, multibillion-dollar grants. Federal officials awarded Intel up to $ 8.5 billion and TSMC up to $ 6.6 billion this year.
The roughly $ 30 billion in total public investment has been accompanied by commitments from private companies to invest more than $ 300 billion in the United States, Commerce Department officials said. That is helping to create more than 100,000 jobs, officials said.
None of the $ 39 billion has been distributed to companies yet, but the funds are expected to begin going out to them before the end of the year, a senior administration official said. The Commerce Department will decide how to allocate the remaining funding it has on the same timeline, according to the official.
Longer-term questions remain about the viability of some companies. Intel said on Thursday that it would slash more than 15,000 jobs, amounting to 15 percent of its work force, as the company tries to recover from a series of stumbles. Intel said it remained committed to its plan to expand its chip factories in the United States.

Nvidia Races For Response To Scrutiny: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: With a 90 percent share of the A.I. chip market, the company is facing antitrust investigations into the possibility that it could lock in customers or hurt competitors.
Nvidia rocketed to the top of the tech industry by providing the computer chips essential to building artificial intelligence. By the end of last year, it had more than a 90 percent share of those chips sold around the world.
That success has quickly brought government scrutiny. Authorities with the European Union, Britain and China asked the company for information about its sales of those important chips, allocation of supplies and investments in other companies, according to Nvidia's financial filings.
The Justice Department has also started investigating Nvidia's sales practices and will review one of the company's most recent acquisitions, said three people familiar with the inquiries, who asked for anonymity because it is early in the process.
Nvidia wasn't ready for the attention, and is now racing to build the staffs and offices needed to respond. Just last year, Nvidia started searching for an office in Washington and hired four public policy employees. This year, it added its first in-house competition attorney to work alongside a legal team that has been addressing antitrust questions over the past decade. And it has begun developing a strategy to respond to government interest.
Nvidia's scramble speaks to the narrow window it has to head off the kind of regulatory attention that has hamstrung other tech giants. Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta had at least a decade to build up sophisticated Washington operations ahead of antitrust lawsuits, which have cast a shadow over their businesses. On Monday, a federal judge issued a landmark ruling that Google had violated antitrust law by abusing a monopoly over internet search.
For Nvidia, the business stakes are enormous. Over the past two years, its quarterly profits have risen ninefold to $ 14.88 billion. Investors have responded by making it the world's third-most-valuable technology company after Apple and Microsoft, with a value of about $ 2.5 trillion.
Nvidia's speedy ascent has given it little margin for error. Its stock fell more than 6 percent on Monday after The Information, a tech news site, reported that Nvidia would ship its newest A.I. chip three months later than planned, and there is mounting skepticism about A.I.'s potential to transform businesses.
Nvidia dominates sales of chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, which make it possible to create A.I. systems in data centers. Customers want more of those chips than Nvidia can produce. As a result, antitrust authorities are concerned about Nvidia's power to determine how a scarce but essential technology is being allocated.
"Regulators want to find out if Nvidia is putting their thumb on the scale of the deal or if the product is so good that it sells itself," said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm that pegged Nvidia's GPU market share at 92 percent. "There's no evidence they're doing anything monopolistic or anticompetitive, but the conditions are right because of their market leadership."
In the eyes of many customers, Nvidia, a 31-year-old Silicon Valley company, has earned its success. The company bet its future on using GPUs to train the neural networks that power the large language models that are behind popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now, it is expanding its business to include the sale of connected supercomputers and a cloud computing service.
Nvidia plans to counter mounting antitrust concerns by responding to government requests on a case-by-case basis. The company argues that it is conducting its business fairly and in accordance with competition law.
Tim Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, is responsible for making Nvidia's case to investigators. He joined the company in 2017 after more than two decades at the law firm Cooley, where he worked on commercial litigation, patent and technology cases. He'll work closely with Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive.
"Regulators need not be concerned," said Ken Brown, a company spokesman. "But we're happy to provide any information regulators need."
As government scrutiny of its business has increased, Nvidia has been slowly building its presence in Washington. It has seven lobbyists working on its behalf, according to Open Secrets, a government transparency group. Much of their focus has been on responding to the Biden administration's crackdown on chip sales to China, which last year accounted for 17 percent of the company's $ 60.9 billion in sales.
The other tech giants -- Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft -- have had offices in Washington for at least a decade. Each has between 55 and 125 lobbyists working on its behalf across a variety of issues, including trade, taxes, antitrust and patents.
Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, and Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, regularly visit Washington to meet with lawmakers. They also travel to Europe to meet with antitrust regulators.
Before last year, Mr. Huang seldom visited the capital. But as the Biden administration stepped up its China restrictions last year, he visited Washington twice.
Last summer, Mr. Huang joined the chief executives of Intel and Qualcomm for meetings with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo.
Mr. Huang also hosted a dinner with representatives from several Washington think tanks at the Jefferson, a hotel where basic rooms start at $ 425 a night. He told attendees that he wanted to build relationships in the capital, introduce them to the company's story and explain what it sees as the positive economic benefits of A.I.
This year, in the wake of complaints about Nvidia's chokehold on the A.I. market, Washington's concerns have shifted from China to competition, with everyone from start-up founders to Elon Musk grumbling about the company's influence.
Those complaints have spiked as Nvidia has increased its ownership of critical pieces of the A.I. supply chain. It offers cables and switches that control high-performance computers, software that manages data center performance and a computer language, CUDA, that developers use to control Nvidia's chips.
In 2020, it spent $ 7 billion to buy Mellanox, the maker of high-speed cables and switches that transmit the data between servers to create A.I. systems. Two years later, it introduced its own central processing unit, or CPU, to deliver better GPU performance.
By bundling its products for customers like cloud computing providers and server manufacturers, Nvidia enjoys more pricing flexibility and power than rivals, four people familiar with its business said.
Nvidia's dominance in A.I. has complicated its plans to acquire other companies that could complement its business. When it offered to buy Arm Holdings, which licenses the designs used to create chips, for $ 40 billion in 2020, competitors and customers complained that the move would give Nvidia too much power over the industry. Nvidia abandoned the deal in 2022 after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block it. That was more than a year before Nvidia began building out its Washington presence.
At the semiconductor industry's annual gala in the fall of 2021, Mr. Huang joked that he had been outmaneuvered on the acquisition by Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, a chipmaker with a more established legal and public affairs team.
"I connected some dots tonight," Mr. Huang said. "I was trying to figure out how is it possible that Cristiano knew every single regulator on the planet, that by the time I got there to tell them about my story on Arm, he was already there advocating against it?"
Today, Nvidia is facing another challenge to its acquisition plans. It has offered $ 700 million for Run.ai, a start-up that controls the scheduling of A.I. systems. But the Justice Department plans to review the deal alongside its inquiry into Nvidia's business practices, a person with knowledge of the plans said. The review and details of the broader Justice Department investigation were reported earlier by the tech news site The Information and Politico.
"Nvidia has been welcomed with open arms to the regulatory party," Mr. Newman of the Futurum Group said. "The scrutiny will be substantial, frequent and endless."

Full text: The U.S. is trying to stop China from getting Nvidia microchips to advance its military. The private sector is fighting back.
In the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, a mazelike market stretches for a half-mile, packed with stalls selling every type of electronic imaginable.
It's an open secret that vendors here are offering one of the world's most sought-after technologies: the microchips that create artificial intelligence, which the United States is battling to keep out of Chinese hands.
One vendor said he could order the chips for delivery in two weeks. Another said companies came to the market ordering 200 or 300 chips from him at a time. A third business owner said he recently shipped a big batch of servers with more than 2,000 of the most advanced chips made by Nvidia, the U.S. tech company, from Hong Kong to mainland China. As evidence, he showed photos and a message with his supplier arranging the April delivery for $ 103 million.
The United States, with some success, has tried to control the export of these chips. Still, The New York Times has found an active trade in restricted A.I. technology -- part of a global effort to help China circumvent U.S. restrictions amid the countries' growing military rivalry.
The chips are an American innovation powering self-driving cars, chatbots and medical research. They have also led to rapid advances in defense technology, spurring U.S. fears that they could help China develop superior weaponry, launch cyberattacks and make faster decisions on the battlefield. Nvidia chips and other U.S. technology have aided Chinese research into nuclear weapons, torpedoes and other military applications, according to a review of previously unreported university studies.
Beginning in October 2022, the United States set up one of the most extensive technological blockades ever attempted: banning the export to China of A.I. chips and the machinery to make them. The Biden administration also added hundreds of Chinese companies to a list of organizations considered a national security threat, and it could soon expand the rules.
These bans have made it harder and more costly for China to develop A.I. But given the vast profits at stake, businesses around the world have found ways to skirt the restrictions, according to interviews with more than 85 current and former U.S. officials, executives and industry analysts, as well as reviews of corporate records and visits to companies in Beijing, Kunshan and Shenzhen.
In one case, Chinese executives bypassed U.S. restrictions when they created a new company that is now one of China's largest makers of A.I. servers and a partner of Nvidia, Intel and Microsoft. American companies have found workarounds to keep selling some products there. And an underground marketplace of smugglers, backroom deals and fraudulent shipping labels is funneling A.I. chips into China, which does not consider such sales illegal.
While the scale of the trade is unclear, the sales described to Times reporters, including the $ 103 million transaction, would be far larger than any previously reported in China. More than a dozen state-affiliated entities have purchased restricted chips, according to procurement documents uncovered by the reporters and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, or C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit. The United States has flagged some of those organizations as helping the Chinese military.
Nvidia and other U.S. companies say they are abiding by the restrictions but cannot control everything in their distribution chain. There was no evidence that any of Nvidia's banned chips in the markets came directly from the company.
"We comply with all U.S. export controls and expect our customers to do the same," said John Rizzo, a spokesman for Nvidia. "Although we cannot track products after they are sold, if we determine that any customer is violating U.S. export controls, we will take appropriate action," he added.
The A.I. bans have cost American companies billions of dollars in sales, and some executives argue that the restrictions will backfire by giving Chinese competitors an edge. American officials defend the bans as necessary but also say they are testing the limits of their enforcement powers.
"This is an enormously difficult job, and I'm under no illusions that we are doing it perfectly," Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in a recent interview.
She said that it wasn't surprising that China, with its vast network around the world, was gaining access to some chips. Still, her agency was working daily with law enforcement, the intelligence community and allies "to identify the holes and how China gets around them, and filling those holes," she said.
'New, but Not New'
Near the White House, in an office with worn carpet and antiquated computer systems, the little-known Bureau of Industry and Security oversees the government's growing trade restrictions intended to limit the flow of U.S. technology.
One of the bureau's chief tools is the so-called entity list, created under the Clinton administration to prevent adversaries from developing weapons of mass destruction. Companies cannot export products from the United States to a business on the list unless they obtain a license.
In the last few years, the United States has wielded the power more aggressively. To limit trade in countries that do not recognize American law, President Donald J. Trump expanded the list's authority, blocking shipments to the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from businesses around the world. If they do not comply, the United States can fine them or bar them from obtaining American technology that they need to make their products.
The Biden administration used the list to further target China's defense sector, and also banned the sale of technology goods to Russia because of its war in Ukraine.
But the entity listing applies only to a specific company name or address, so businesses sometimes set up a new company or simply move down the road. Some front companies have gone without detection for years, according to former officials.
"They go the next block over, open the same company under a different name, under a different address -- they're just doing the same thing," said Craig Phildius, a former official with the bureau.
U.S. officials say American companies generally try to comply with the rules. But some have found loopholes, like rerouting business through new partnerships or overseas subsidiaries.
The bureau has tried to adapt, toughening its penalties and creating a so-called Disruptive Technology Strike Force with law enforcement and the intelligence community to pursue technology theft and illegal procurement networks.
Ms. Raimondo, the commerce secretary, who oversees the bureau, said that she was proud of her team's work, but that they were impeded by limited resources. The bureau has a budget of $ 191 million, less than the cost of two fighter jets.
Nettrix, one of China's largest manufacturers of A.I. servers, is one example of how business can thrive despite American restrictions.
At its first product launch in April 2020, a Nettrix executive described one of the startup's advantages. "In this company we talk about 'new, but not new,"' he said, clarifying that its employees were industry veterans.
In fact, Nettrix was an offshoot of Sugon, a firm that provided advanced computing to the Chinese military and built a system the government used to surveil persecuted minorities. In December 2019, six months after the United States put Sugon on the entity list, a group of former executives formed Nettrix.
Nvidia, Intel and Microsoft -- which had been partners with Sugon for years, back when the United States was encouraging business relations with China -- quickly formed ties with the new firm. Ashok Pandey, the general manager of Nvidia's China business, said at the product launch that Nettrix had already become an important partner, adding that Nettrix's key personnel were "not strangers to anyone."
Records accessed through WireScreen, a business intelligence platform, show that Sugon and Nettrix have links to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a vast research institution that develops chip technology. Nettrix's owners share a complex with Sugon and other companies owned by the academy in Kunshan, a Times reporter found on a visit, despite having a different registered address.
Kevin Wolf, a former official with the Bureau of Industry and Security, said that having executives in common with a firm on the entity list was a "bright, bright red flag."
Procurement documents indicate that Nettrix has sold servers, some of which contained Nvidia and Intel chips, to several of the same organizations as Sugon, including one later put on the entity list. Nettrix's customers also include universities that host defense laboratories and cybersecurity firms that work with the military and on China's Great Firewall.
In a statement, Nettrix said that it strictly abided by relevant laws. Neither company holds shares in the other, Nettrix said, and it is not part of a network connected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "There is no situation in which Nettrix helped Sugon avoid the impact of the U.S. entity list," the company said.
Sugon said that after it was added to the entity list, it laid off hundreds of employees and some started their own businesses.
Mr. Rizzo said Nvidia conducted extensive due diligence to confirm that its clients were not restricted by the entity list. Sarah Keller, a spokeswoman for Intel, said that it complied with all export regulations and required its customers to do the same. Microsoft declined to comment.
A Wake-Up Call
Six months into the Biden administration, China tested a weapon that shook U.S. officials: a hypersonic missile that circled the earth.
The weapon, which surpassed American technology, could theoretically dodge missile defense systems to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States, according to a half-dozen current and former national security officials. Much is still unclear about the technology, but several officials said that U.S. chips helped accelerate China's missile program.
White House officials had already been developing broader restrictions on selling chip-making equipment to China. They later learned more about the role of U.S. chip technology in Chinese cyberoperations, cryptography, disinformation and research valuable to the military.
In southern China, for example, Nvidia's restricted A100 chips began powering a high-performance computing cluster at Sun Yat-sen University in November 2022. Researchers there used advanced computing to model missiles and torpedoes, according to papers and university press releases.
In China's northeast, a supercomputing center set up one of the world's fastest A.I. and computing platforms in 2019. The center uses chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, according to its website, and can analyze satellite imagery of China's island-building program in the South China Sea and the radar signature of stealth fighters.
And in central China, a university affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences was using Nvidia, A.M.D. and Intel chips to study nuclear weapons, according to university materials. This May, the United States added the university to the entity list.
Mr. Rizzo said that Nvidia's products were "designed, marketed and sold for beneficial, nonmilitary uses. We do not permit our products to be used for prohibited military purposes." Intel said it complied with trade law. A.M.D. declined to comment.
Finding the Chokepoint
Chip experts estimate that only a small portion of the hundreds of thousands of advanced A.I. chips Nvidia sold to China before the ban went to help its military. Most were used to power social media platforms, video game graphics and weather forecasts.
But Nvidia, now one of the world's most valuable companies, attracted White House attention because it dominated the market. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, and his deputies saw advanced chips as the most viable chokepoint to control A.I., since they were made by just a handful of businesses.
U.S. officials met with Nvidia executives in 2021 and 2022 to discuss how their chips were used in China. In August 2022, the government ordered the company to stop shipping China the A100, its most advanced chip at the time.
Nvidia adapted quickly. It zapped the A100 with electricity to disable some connections, creating a slightly downgraded chip it called the A800. By November, Nvidia was selling the chips in China, and Chinese companies hurried to stockpile them.
U.S. officials believed the A800s would allow China to achieve practically the same results and were irritated, several former officials recalled, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Tim Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, said in an interview last year that the downgraded chip was within the government's parameters. If the speed limit is 65 miles per hour and I'm driving 63, he asked, "am I violating the spirit of the rule? Of course not."
Tech companies ramped up their lobbying. In July 2023, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, visited the White House along with the leaders of Intel and Qualcomm. They argued that excessive export controls would hurt American companies.
U.S. officials proceeded anyway, forbidding the sale of A800s to China last October.
Like A.M.D. and Intel, Nvidia continues to legally sell less powerful chips to Chinese firms, some with military links. Of the 136 Chinese companies Nvidia listed as partners on its website in July, at least 24 have had procurement contracts with the Chinese military or are partly owned by defense contractors or organizations on the entity list, according to records from Wirescreen and Datenna, a China intelligence platform. One of Nvidia's listed partners had been added to the entity list in May for supporting the high-altitude balloon that traversed the United States last year.
Nvidia's chips are in such demand it quickly made up lost sales elsewhere. But American companies are concerned that the rules have created a vacuum for Chinese businesses like Huawei, which has been rolling out more powerful A.I. chips. The United States leads China in A.I. for now, but China is making rapid progress as both countries race to create A.I. that would rival human intelligence.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy, said that China firmly opposed the rules and that they would "only make China even more determined and capable in boosting our own strength in technology and innovation."
China's leader, Xi Jinping, delivered a similar warning on a call with Mr. Biden in April, saying his country would not "sit back and watch."
A Vibrant Trade
In the Shenzhen electronics market, vendors who traditionally sold Nvidia chips to gamers and Bitcoin miners are trying to meet the growing demand for A.I.
Previous reports from Reuters, Nikkei Asia and The Wall Street Journal have uncovered sales of dozens of banned chips. But The Times talked with several vendors in Shenzhen who mentioned deals involving hundreds or thousands. Reporters spoke with representatives of 11 companies that said they sold or transported banned Nvidia chips -- including A100s and H100s, the company's most advanced -- and found dozens more businesses offering them online. A local procurement website listed nearly 100 stores that also said they sold the chips.
Leslie Zhou, the market vendor who shared a detailed message arranging the $ 103 million shipment to a local warehouse, said the chips weren't hard to obtain. While the transaction could not be independently verified, he said he regularly brought in banned chips from three or four suppliers and sold to repeat customers. "The Shenzhen market cannot be restricted," he said.
Industry experts said the price was high but within international rates -- roughly $ 380,000 for a server with eight H100s. (Counterfeiting of electronics is widespread in China, but four industry experts said that would be highly unlikely for Nvidia chips on a commercial scale, given their complexity.)
Nvidia's chips are made in Taiwan, then sent to other manufacturers and distributors. Industry experts said that businesses in Singapore, Vietnam and other countries where it is not considered illegal to export them were probably diverting some into China.
Just how many chips get into China is an important question, because the number required for A.I. is high and increasing fast. By some estimates, the A.I. language model GPT-4 was trained on 25,000 Nvidia A100s. U.S. officials say they don't expect to capture everything, but the goal is to hold China back during a critical window in which the United States can pull ahead.
Tim Fist, a senior adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that with a moderate level of smuggling, the bans would slow commercial developments in China but probably not impede more targeted military research.
Chinese procurement records examined by C4ADS showed that at least 550 restricted Nvidia chips had been sold to state-linked research institutions, including two on the entity list. (That figure is almost certainly an underestimate, because few contracts specified the types of chips being purchased.)
Trade records obtained by C4ADS showed a shipment from Vietnam to Beijing of servers that were marked as containing banned chips. In other cases, companies mislabeled shipments to hide them.
Wang Qiang, an employee of a logistics company in southern China that has sent A100s from Hong Kong to the mainland, said the shipments would not be tracked because Hong Kong was still a free-trade harbor. He advised clients, he said, to label banned chips as tea or toys.

SHENZHEN, China — In the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, a mazelike market stretches for a half-mile, packed with stalls selling every type of electronic imaginable.
It’s an open secret that vendors are offering one of the world’s most sought-after technologies: the microchips that create artificial intelligence, which the United States is battling to keep out of Chinese hands.
One vendor said he could order the chips for delivery in two weeks. Another said companies came to the market ordering 200 or 300 chips from him at a time. A third business owner said he recently shipped a big batch of servers with more than 2,000 of the most advanced chips made by Nvidia, the U.S. tech company, from Hong Kong to mainland China. As evidence, he showed photos and a message with his supplier arranging the April delivery for $103 million.
The United States, with some success, has tried to control the export of these chips. Still, The New York Times has found an active trade in restricted AI technology — part of a global effort to help China circumvent U.S. restrictions amid the countries’ growing military rivalry.
The chips are an American innovation powering self-driving cars, chatbots and medical research. They have also led to rapid advances in defense technology, spurring U.S. fears that they could help China develop superior weaponry, launch cyberattacks and make faster decisions on the battlefield. Nvidia chips and other U.S. technology have aided Chinese research into nuclear weapons, torpedoes and other military applications, according to a review of previously unreported university studies.
Beginning in October 2022, the United States set up one of the most extensive technological blockades ever attempted: banning the export to China of AI chips and the machinery to make them. The Biden administration also added hundreds of Chinese companies to a list of organizations considered a national security threat, and it could soon expand the rules.
These bans have made it harder and more costly for China to develop AI. But given the vast profits at stake, businesses around the world have found ways to skirt the restrictions, according to interviews with more than 85 current and former U.S. officials, executives and industry analysts, as well as reviews of corporate records and visits to companies in Beijing, Kunshan and Shenzhen.
In one case, Chinese executives bypassed U.S. restrictions when they created a new company that is now one of China’s largest makers of AI servers and a partner of Nvidia, Intel and Microsoft. American companies have found workarounds to keep selling some products there. And an underground marketplace of smugglers, backroom deals and fraudulent shipping labels is funneling AI chips into China, which does not consider such sales illegal.
While the scale of the trade is unclear, the sales described to Times reporters would be far larger than any previously reported in China. More than a dozen state-affiliated entities have purchased restricted chips, according to procurement documents uncovered by the reporters and the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, or C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit. The United States has flagged some of those organizations as helping the Chinese military.
Nvidia and other U.S. companies say they are abiding by the restrictions but cannot control everything in their distribution chain. There was no evidence that any of Nvidia’s banned chips in the markets came directly from the company.
“We comply with all U.S. export controls and expect our customers to do the same,” said John Rizzo, a spokesperson for Nvidia. “Although we cannot track products after they are sold, if we determine that any customer is violating U.S. export controls, we will take appropriate action,” he added.
The AI bans have cost American companies billions of dollars in sales, and some executives argue that the restrictions will backfire by giving Chinese competitors an edge. U.S. officials defend the bans as necessary but also say they are testing the limits of their enforcement powers.
“This is an enormously difficult job, and I’m under no illusions that we are doing it perfectly,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in a recent interview.
Near the White House, in an office with worn carpet and antiquated computer systems, the little-known Bureau of Industry and Security oversees the government’s growing trade restrictions intended to limit the flow of U.S. technology.
One of the bureau’s chief tools is the so-called entity list, created under the Clinton administration to prevent adversaries from developing weapons of mass destruction. Companies cannot export products from the United States to a business on the list unless they obtain a license.
U.S. officials say American companies generally try to comply with the rules. But some have found loopholes, like rerouting business through new partnerships or overseas subsidiaries.
The bureau has tried to adapt, toughening its penalties and creating a so-called Disruptive Technology Strike Force with law enforcement and the intelligence community to pursue technology theft and illegal procurement networks.
Nettrix, one of China’s largest manufacturers of AI servers, is one example of how business can thrive despite U.S. restrictions.
At its first product launch in April 2020, a Nettrix executive described one of the startup’s advantages. “In this company we talk about ‘new, but not new,’” he said, clarifying that its employees were industry veterans.
In fact, Nettrix was an offshoot of Sugon, a firm that provided advanced computing to the Chinese military and built a system the government used to surveil persecuted minorities. In December 2019, six months after the United States put Sugon on the entity list, a group of former executives formed Nettrix.
Nvidia, Intel and Microsoft — which had been partners with Sugon for years, back when the United States was encouraging business relations with China — quickly formed ties with the new firm. Ashok Pandey, the general manager of Nvidia’s China business, said at the product launch that Nettrix had already become an important partner, adding that Nettrix’s key personnel were “not strangers to anyone.”
Rizzo said Nvidia conducted extensive due diligence to confirm that its clients were not restricted by the entity list. Sarah Keller, a spokesperson for Intel, said that it complied with all export regulations and required its customers to do the same. Microsoft declined to comment.
Chip experts estimate that only a small portion of the hundreds of thousands of advanced AI chips Nvidia sold to China before the ban went to help its military.
But Nvidia, now one of the world’s most valuable companies, attracted White House attention because it dominated the market. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, and his deputies saw advanced chips as the most viable chokepoint to control AI, since they were made by just a handful of businesses.
U.S. officials met with Nvidia executives in 2021 and 2022 to discuss how their chips were used in China. In August 2022, the government ordered the company to stop shipping China the A100, its most advanced chip at the time.
Nvidia adapted quickly. It zapped the A100 with electricity to disable some connections, creating a slightly downgraded chip it called the A800. By November, Nvidia was selling the chips in China, and Chinese companies hurried to stockpile them.
U.S. officials believed the A800s would allow China to achieve practically the same results and were irritated, several former officials recalled, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Tim Teter, Nvidia’s general counsel, said in an interview last year that the downgraded chip was within the government’s parameters.
Tech companies ramped up their lobbying. In July 2023, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, visited the White House along with the leaders of Intel and Qualcomm. They argued that excessive export controls would hurt American companies.
U.S. officials proceeded anyway, forbidding the sale of A800s to China in October.
Nvidia, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices continue to legally sell less powerful chips to Chinese firms, some with military links. Of the 136 Chinese companies Nvidia listed as partners on its website in July, at least 24 have had procurement contracts with the Chinese military or are partly owned by defense contractors or organizations on the entity list, according to records from Wirescreen and Datenna, a China intelligence platform.
The United States leads China in AI for now, but China is making rapid progress as both countries race to create AI that would rival human intelligence.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said that China firmly opposed the rules and that they would “only make China even more determined and capable in boosting our own strength in technology and innovation.”

Jolted by Soft Jobs Report, Markets Fall to End Rocky Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The report on hiring in July added to worries about the economy. Stocks fell sharply, and Treasury yields declined in expectation of a Federal Reserve rate cut.
Wall Street was jolted by rising economic uncertainty on Friday, and stocks skidded, capping off a turbulent week with a sharp decline.
Friday's drop followed a report on U.S. hiring in July that was far weaker than expected, startling investors into worrying that the Federal Reserve has been too slow to cut interest rates. Traders were already growing uneasy about the state of the economy, as well as the prospects for the big technology stocks that had underpinned a market rally for much of the year, but the jobs report intensified the focus on the risks.
The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.4 percent. Small stocks, yields on government bonds, and oil prices, all of which are sensitive to expectations for the economy, dropped too.
Employers in the U.S. added 114,000 jobs in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis, much fewer than economists had expected and a significant drop from the average of 215,000 jobs added over the previous 12 months, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
"That all-important macro data we have been hammering for months is finally starting to turn in an ominous direction," said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth.
Investors are reassessing how aggressive the Fed may have to be as it starts to cut interest rates -- if weakening economic conditions justify a bigger rate cut than the central bank has indicated so far. The central bank raised rates to a two-decade high as it tried to wrestle inflation under control, but policymakers now have to decide when to cut, and by how much, in order to forestall a recession.
Markets are now predicting a half a percent cut when the Fed meets next in September, up from the more usual quarter-point cut investors had been anticipating as of Thursday, according to CME FedWatch.
The two-year Treasury yield, which is also reflective of short-term interest rate expectations, fell 26 basis points, to 3.9 percent, on Friday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield -- which underpins many other borrowing costs -- fell to 3.8 percent, after dropping below 4 percent on Thursday.
"That's the bond market screaming in your face that they're fearful of a recession," said Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.
This week had already been a rocky one for Wall Street. The Fed's indication on Wednesday that it was moving closer to cutting interest rates in September prompted a rally that day. But stocks sold off on Thursday, led lower by chip companies and after other economic data suggested the economy was cooling. That included the results of a factory activity survey that showed U.S. manufacturing activity dropped to an eight-month low in July.
Friday's decline meant the S&P 500 was down 2.1 percent for the week, its worst weekly showing since April.

The focus on economic weakness hit global markets, too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell 5.8 percent on Friday, and in Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 index fell 2.7 percent. Crude oil prices dropped more than 3 percent.
This week's volatility reflects a "sea change in psychology" among investors who have been hoping for conditions that would allow the Fed to cut interest rates, Mr. Sosnick said. Lower interest rates are a boon for the economy but if they come because the Fed is worried about growth, that could hurt sentiment.
"This is very much a real case of be careful what you wish for," Mr. Sosnick said. "All the sudden, everybody decided, 'Uh oh, they're late."'
Sentiment could change again, of course. Before the Fed meets in September, it will get another update on the health of the job market and fresh inflation data to consider. With the economy still growing, and the labor market still relatively healthy, past bouts of turbulence in the market have ended just as quickly as they began.
But there are other factors weighing on stocks.
Investors started reconsidering their appetite for big technology stocks last month and bought up shares of smaller companies, which are particularly sensitive to borrowing costs and stand to benefit from interest rate cuts. Also driving this shift is a rethink about the potential for artificial intelligence to continue to drive gains at big companies like Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet, after shares of those businesses surged in the past year.
Underwhelming earnings reports from major tech companies were another blow to tech stocks on Friday. Amazon's shares fell about 9 percent, while Intel's declined 26 percent.

Japanese Stocks Tumble as Yen Strengthens, Ending Long Surge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A rapidly strengthening yen and a sell-off in stocks in the United States pushed Japan's markets to a second consecutive day of big losses on Friday.
A more-than-yearlong rally in Japanese stocks, driven by the country's depreciated currency, hit a wall at the end of the week.
Japan's Topix index, which includes companies that represent a broad swath of the Japanese economy, fell 6.1 percent on Friday, extending losses from the previous day. It was the index's worst two-day performance since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The Nikkei 225 index fell 5.8 percent on Friday.
Analysts noted a "state of panic" in Japanese markets after the Bank of Japan's decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates for only the second time since 2007. Sentiment worsened on Friday over concerns about the health of the economy and the tech industry in the United States.
The central bank had raised its key rate to a quarter point, up from a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The move bolstered Japan's currency, the yen, which was trading at approximately 149 to the dollar on Friday, a significant recovery from 154 at the start of the week.
A weaker yen had been good for Japan's major exporters, inflating their earnings and making Japanese products more competitive globally. Policies including rock-bottom interest rates that kept the yen weak were long a cornerstone of Japanese economic policy.
This dynamic of a weaker yen and rising corporate profits reached a peak in recent years as the yen fell to near four-decade lows against the dollar. Companies like Toyota reported some of the largest profits in Japanese history, attracting investors and sending Japanese indexes to a series of record highs.
Now some economists suggest the trend is reversing.
"It can be understood that the bubble of a weak yen and high stock prices created by the Bank of Japan has entered the process of collapsing," Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note on Friday.
Japanese markets are also grappling with concerns over a potential slowdown in growth in the United States. The S&P 500 index fell 1.4 percent on Thursday. Tech shares also plunged after an announcement from Intel that it would cut 15 percent of its work force.
The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates, which are at a more-than-two-decade high, unchanged at a meeting on Wednesday, but analysts expect it to begin lowering rates later this year.
The double punch of a more expensive yen and tech-sector concerns slammed Japanese exporters involved in the semiconductor supply chain. Shares of Tokyo Electron, Japan's biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, fell 12 percent on Friday.
For Japan, a long-term appreciation of the yen is expected to be largely positive, helping to cool the import-driven inflation squeezing consumers. But analysts view the sudden strengthening of the currency as a blow because of its potential effect on corporate profits.
Japan's finance ministry said it was closely monitoring the yen's developments.
"Sudden fluctuations could increase uncertainty in business activities and have a negative impact on people's lives," Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a news conference on Friday.

Intel to Cut Over 15,000 Jobs As It Battles in the A.I. Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Silicon Valley chip maker also reported a net loss and declining revenue in the latest quarter.
Intel, the Silicon Valley chip maker, said on Thursday that it would slash more than 15,000 jobs to aid a turnaround plan, as the company tries to recover after a series of stumbles.
The job cuts amount to 15 percent of Intel's work force. The company also announced other restructuring moves and a reduction in capital spending, which are expected to cut costs by $ 10 billion in 2025. To conserve cash, Intel said, it will suspend its quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter.
"This is painful news for me to share," Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, said in a letter to employees. "I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company's history."
The company's stock fell more than 20 percent in after-hours trading.
Intel, which produces microprocessor chips that serve as electronic brains in most computers, has battled a slump amid stiff competition in chips used for artificial intelligence. Its last major restructuring was in 2016, when the company said it would cut up to 12,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force.
Mr. Gelsinger has worked to reinvigorate the company after being named its top leader in early 2021. Among other actions, he quickly moved to become a top industry lobbyist for federal subsidies to encourage more U.S. production of the foundational components.
He has also tried to fix Intel's manufacturing issues. Unlike most of its peers, Intel makes chips as well as designs them. Others rely on outside production services called foundries, with most turning to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Before Mr. Gelsinger became Intel's chief executive, TSMC had surpassed it in delivering regular advances in production technology that gives chips more computing power. He embarked on a costly effort to deliver five new technology generations -- which historically arrived every two years or so -- in four years. That effort is producing results, but with heavy costs.
Mr. Gelsinger also launched a parallel plan to build more factories and turn Intel into a major foundry making chips for others. That strategy helped Intel become the largest beneficiary in March of U.S. legislation known as the CHIPS Act, tentatively winning federal grants totaling $ 8.5 billion.
Besides manufacturing issues, Intel ran into product problems. Demand for personal computers that use its chips slumped last year. At the same time, customers have turned to rival Nvidia for A.I. chips for data centers, even as Intel has responded to the A.I. boom by adding features to its standard chips and offering a special-purpose chip line called Gaudi. Advanced Micro Devices, another rival, has also grabbed market share in standard data center chips and new products tailored for A.I.
Intel said on Thursday that revenue in its data center business fell 3 percent in the second quarter. In contrast, AMD on Tuesday reported a 115 percent jump for its data center business.
Overall, Intel swung to a loss of $ 1.6 billion in the second quarter, while revenue fell 1 percent to $ 12.8 billion. Its gross profit margin, a closely watched metric that once averaged around 65 percent, was 35.4 percent in the quarter.
In his letter to employees, Mr. Gelsinger said that revenue had not grown as expected, and that the company had yet to fully benefit from major trends like A.I. Intel posted about $ 24 billion less revenue last year than it did in 2020, yet its work force is 10 percent larger, he wrote.
"There are a lot of reasons for this, but it's not a sustainable path forward," he wrote.
Beyond the costs, Mr. Gelsinger said Intel was still too bureaucratic and inefficient, despite past attempts to streamline operations. As part of the restructuring, he said, the company will trim the number of products it sells, stop nonessential work and reduce capital spending more than 24 percent. Many of the job cuts will be accomplished through early retirement and voluntary departure programs, he added.
The job cuts "have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career," Mr. Gelsinger wrote. He pledged that Intel would "prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come."
For the current quarter, Intel projected a gross profit margin of 34.5 percent and revenue of $ 12.5 billion to $ 13.5 billion, below analyst estimates of $ 14.3 billion.
Mr. Gelsinger and David Zinsner, Intel's chief financial officer, said on a conference call that one reason for the disappointing projection was the PC market. Computer makers have built up excess chip inventories as demand for such systems has slowed, particularly in China.
At the same time, Intel has bet that a new generation of A.I. PCs will drive more demand. The microprocessors it developed for such machines are composed of multiple chips, a large portion of which are manufactured by external foundries and cost Intel more than those produced in its own factories, Mr. Zinsner said. As Intel starts making such components internally, profit margins will improve, he added.
Mr. Gelsinger predicted that the investments in such components would pay off as A.I. PCs grew to more than half the PC market by 2026.

Full text: With Patriot Party News, Michael Chesebro found a sense of community, and a place where conspiracy theories could become real in the form of the "medbed."
Michael Chesebro awoke to the same reality as he did each morning, with pain radiating up his spine and into his shoulders before he opened his eyes. He remained still for a moment, summoning the courage to reach from his bed to his night stand. He rolled onto his back, which was fused together with metal after almost 20 years as a paratrooper in the military. He extended his arm, which he had broken several times while wrangling bulls and horses on his ranch outside Cheyenne, Wyo. Finally, his hand found his cellphone, and he logged on to the online universe where he spent most of his days.
"How're we all doing this morning?" asked Michael, 63. "I'm hurting again -- too much time spent jumping out of perfectly good airplanes."
"You served our country well," a retired teacher from Kansas responded.
"Hang in there, patriot," a truck driver in Texas said. "Remember, the pain's only real if you believe in it."
"Distract me," Michael said. "What part of our country is falling apart today?"
On the other end of his phone were hundreds of people in a live voice chat for Patriot Party News, one of about a dozen far-right media platforms that has grown in both size and influence over the past few years, not only by creating an ecosystem of disinformation but also by providing an authentic sense of community. The company was co-founded in 2020 by Warren Armour, a conservative with no media experience who runs a flooring company in Tennessee, but Michael admired the Patriot Party News slogan when he first saw it shared on Facebook last year: "If you hate mainstream media, you are going to love us!"
Michael started watching the site's daily videos about election fraud and vaccine pseudoscience, some of which have now been viewed more than a million times. He signed up for the company's social media platform and paid $ 8.99 a month to join the audio channel, which functions like an old ham radio and promised him the chance to "meet comrades in our battle for the soul of America."
On some days, Michael listened to the channel for as many as 12 hours, with the audio feed piped directly into his hearing aids to drown out the tedium of his pain. He narrated his daily ranching tasks for the group and sent photos of his crops. Other members responded with recipes, virtual prayers for rain and a steady drumbeat of extremist political ideology that increasingly mirrored his own. In a fracturing country, here was an echo chamber with the power to turn fringe conspiracy theories into widely accepted political dogmas -- that the Covid vaccine was poison, the mainstream media was deceitful and the federal government was controlled by a "deep state cabal" that had stolen the 2020 election from former President Donald J. Trump and was now trying to orchestrate his assassination.
"I saw somewhere this morning that the vaccine's killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined," said a woman who went by the name Truth and Freedom Fighter.
"It's genocide, 100 percent," Michael said, as he pulled himself out of bed.
"I want handcuffs and perp walks for all those criminals," someone else said. "Who goes first? Fauci, Obama or Biden?"
"Let me think on it," Michael said. "That'll keep me entertained while I feed the horses. The wife says I need to quit running my mouth and get going on my honey-do list."
Cheryl Chesebro, 61, had known her husband to be a realist for most of his life. Michael had enlisted in the Army at 17 because he couldn't afford to pay for college and then agreed to jump out of planes for a $ 2,500 sign-up bonus. But after a total of 42 surgeries on his back, shoulders, ankles and knees, he'd come to distrust the government he'd served. He invested in wind and solar power so his family didn't have to rely on the U.S. power grid. He bought gold in case the U.S. financial system collapsed and then started collecting shoe boxes full of foreign currency from the Middle East and Africa, believing that it could eventually be as valuable as the U.S. dollar.
For the first time in his life, he became consumed by politics and then enamored with Trump, another government skeptic who sometimes spoke in the language of conspiracy theories. The former president had helped popularize lies about Barack Obama's birthplace, widespread election fraud and the "hoax" of climate change -- all of which had become part of the founding DNA of Patriot Party News.
"Whatever they're telling you on that website, it's all basically hogwash," Cheryl told him.
"A lot of it's wacky, but 10 percent is the real deal," he said. "That's better than anyplace else."
"What kind of hocus-pocus are they going to come up with next?" Cheryl asked.
Michael walked outside to check on the horses while he listened to people on the audio feed talk about how Trump was anointed president by God, and how George Soros was building mansions in Hollywood to house undocumented immigrants. He turned up the volume and spoke back to the group over the wind as the unrealities in his ears continued to become the reality of his life.
"Thanks for helping me get up and going this morning," he said. "I never thought I would be on a platform with people I'd never met and hear this many I love yous."
"I'm so glad we're in this war together," said an aircraft mechanic who went by the name Oath Keeper Bill. "We need you healthy and strong. Have you been following the latest news on medbeds?"
"Oh yeah. They're here, and they can heal anything," someone else responded. "Cancer. Dementia. Broken bones. Arthritis. Forty-five minutes in one of those beds, and you'll never be in pain again."
"Come on," Michael said. "Really?"
Of all the wild conspiracies he'd discovered on Patriot Party News, the concept of medbeds had initially struck Michael as the most far-fetched, even if it was also among the most popular. Every few days, someone else on the platform shared an illustration of a futuristic-looking chamber, sometimes with a doctored image of Trump superimposed in the foreground. The founder of the site, Armour, sometimes mentioned videos or podcasts about medbeds that had become popular on the far-right corners of Telegram, Discord and Rumble, and Michael clicked on the links, as did millions of others.
The videos claimed with no evidence that the U.S. military was already in possession of advanced, or possibly even alien, technology that could cure all disease and extend human life. There were said to be at least three types of medbeds already in existence in secret military tunnels. One, a "holographic medbed," scanned the body to instantly diagnose and then heal any sickness, no matter how severe. Another bed was able to regenerate personal DNA so people could regrow missing limbs in a few minutes. A third was designed for reverse aging and could rewind people's bodies to the age and condition of their choosing.
The only holdup, according to the videos, was that a collection of liberal billionaires kept hoarding the technology for themselves. On the Patriot Party News audio feed, people speculated that medbeds wouldn't be available to the public until Trump was back in control of the White House, at which point everyone would be invited to make appointments for free at a secret underground military base.
"We are about to cross that start line into our medbed future," said an Australian woman who called herself Skye Prince and claimed to be a military expert, in a video shared on Patriot Party News that has been viewed several million times. "We are leaving a life of poverty, ill health, uncertainty, and moving into wealth, abundance, perfect health. You could almost say we are about to be born again."
"Thank God the wait is almost over!" Michael heard someone say on the audio channel in the last days of spring. "Medbeds are finally coming. I hope I can get my mom to the front of the line since she's Stage 4."
"Amen. I need an appointment for my husband after his latest stroke," someone else responded.
"I hate to rain on the parade, but are we sure this isn't too good to be true?" Michael said. "Sounds like it could be a scam. Why haven't we heard about this anywhere more mainstream?"
"Right," someone responded. "Because the mainstream media is always trustworthy."
"OK, true," Michael said. "But nothing from doctors, hospitals -- "
"You expect to hear the truth from corporate medicine?"
"Look, it sounds great," Michael said. "If I can lay in a bed and choose my age, my wife will be changing my diapers at the beginning of my life and not at the end, but I'd like more evidence."
Instead, there was only repetition -- the same medbed fantasies repeated over and over each day on the audio feed until the initial shock wore off within a few weeks and Michael's skepticism wore down into curiosity and then into the beginnings of hope. He knew from experience that the military was capable of harboring secret, advanced technology. He remembered talking to members of his unit on a satellite phone years before one was made available to the public. "The military always gets the fancy toys way ahead of anyone else, so I suppose it's plausible," he said on the audio channel.
He'd already tried and failed to treat his pain by scheduling dozens of appointments each year through his health care with Veterans Affairs. He'd tried fentanyl, Percocet, Vicodin, acupuncture, water therapy, nerve blockers, deep-tissue massage and light therapy. Following his doctors' advice had resulted in only temporary reprieves, along with dozens of opioid prescriptions and an elective surgery that led to a life-threatening staph infection. "The conventional route hasn't done me any good," he said on the channel. "When you're desperate, you'll try anything. This whole medbed thing has become personal for me."
It was part of Armour's strategy when he first started Patriot Party News from his home after the 2020 presidential election: to build an audience by focusing on personal issues such as religion and health. He'd watched other far-right media sites like Victory Channel, The Elijah List and Right Side Broadcasting Network amass millions of subscribers in what Armour called the "Christian, MAGA universe" by mimicking Trump's tendency to favor emotional appeals over facts.
"It's almost like selling something," Armour said, outlining the strategy behind Patriot Party News. "How do I wake more people up? Before we launched, I tried to share some of these out-there political ideas with my parents, and they were like, 'Oh Lord! Let's put him in an insane asylum.' You need to get people just tasting a little bit first. I don't start out by saying we have five different Bidens wearing masks. I go there on different things that people have strong feelings about, like the Covid jab, the stolen election or your personal health."
The Patriot Party News feed included regular segments on essential oils, unproven supplements and ivermectin, and one morning Armour came onto the platform and introduced another "truth-seeking health expert." His name was John Baxter, and he had spent his career in the Florida mattress industry before founding a company called Anti-Aging Beds, which had received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration in 2020 for selling unproven medication. Baxter introduced himself as an inventor and the author of a self-published book: "The Med Bed Story -- Restoring the Health of Humanity."
"We are the only ones in the medbed movement that actually have a bed," Baxter said, as Michael listened with hundreds of others. "It's available, and it's ready for you to try."
Michael booked a medbed appointment for late June and loaded his camping trailer for the long drive. One of his friends on Patriot Party News, Andrea Stimson, had bought several pieces of Baxter's equipment and opened a wellness spa in Sheridan, Wyo., 300 miles north. Michael had already visited once to tour and try some of the equipment, and now he was returning for treatments with Cheryl, their daughter and a granddaughter.
"I've been busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest trying to get on the road," Michael said on the audio channel as he pulled onto the highway.
"I'm jealous," someone responded. "You'll be walking out a brand-new man."
Michael talked into his speakerphone as he drove and described the cattle herds of central Wyoming, the rising gas prices and the farms with billboards for Trump 2024. He posted a photo of the sun setting over the highway and played the group one of his favorite songs by the country singer Chris LeDoux.
"Quit being a jackwagon and pay attention to the road," Cheryl told him.
She'd agreed to come along because even if she had begun referring to Michael as the "crazy old man on the mountain," she'd also learned over the past 30 years that some of his wild plans had a way of working out. Michael had taught their two children to hunt and shoot from long distances, and their son had ended up getting a marksmanship scholarship to the University of Alaska. Michael had convinced Cheryl to move out of urban Michigan to an off-the-grid mountaintop, where they dug their own well and farmed much of their own food, and now she couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
Her husband was happiest when he was self-reliant and purposeful -- working as a rodeo clown, coaching wrestling, training horses or traveling to military contracting jobs across the world. But lately his back had made it difficult to work long hours, and Cheryl sometimes teased him for being her "house husband." He rested for stretches of the day in an easy chair in their living room and spent hours on the phone.
"Hello, hello?" he said on the audio channel as they passed by the Laramie Mountains. "Somebody say something. I think I'm going deaf."
"Maybe it's quiet because for once you're not doing all the talking," Cheryl said loudly enough that her voice carried into his microphone.
"Hey, I like her," someone on the platform teased. "She's a smart woman."
"Yeah, the wife gets tired of me," Michael said. "When she needs space, she tells me to go out for breakfast. She says somewhere about 300 miles away is about right."
He liked his persona on Patriot Party News: a jokester known for his dry humor and relied upon for his military knowledge. Armour, the site's founder, had made him an unpaid moderator and sometimes called him directly to ask about military tactics. Michael talked often on the platform about his "high-level intel," which sometimes came in the form of Facebook posts from friends he had served with in the 82nd Airborne Division or later in the Marines. Online, he wasn't a house husband on disability but a survivalist cowboy with clout, expertise and dozens of like-minded friends.
There was Bill, a farmer in central Wisconsin whose frequent raves about Trump were sometimes difficult to hear over the roar of his tractor; and Val, a retired art teacher who sometimes read aloud from the Bible; and Keith, who had recently been paralyzed from the knee down by an infection and was relearning to walk; and Meagan, a single mother of five who requested prayers for her child's flag football games; and Janel, who was facing foreclosure on her house in Illinois and trying to rehome all 30 of her cats; and Jay, a real estate agent who spent his free time bass fishing; and Beverly, who was taking care of her husband, who had advanced dementia, because she couldn't afford to pay for help. "I'm hanging on by a thread," she said one night. "He's very difficult to handle, and now he hallucinates. Most days I'm ready to give up, but going to bed listening to the chat on this platform is what saves my sanity."
And then there was Andrea, the new owner of a medbed spa. She was a nail technician and certified wellness coach who had specialized in diet programs until she decided in January to buy Baxter's products and rent a building across the street from a hospital in Sheridan.
"We're still hoping to get F.D.A. approved, but that whole process is so corrupt anyway," she said on the audio channel. "You can't totally grasp the magic of it until you try it. Honestly, it's a God thing."
"I'm becoming more open to this kind of stuff, but I don't totally grasp all the technology or understand how it works," Michael said.
"Me neither," Andrea said. "It's a lot, and I'm still learning. But I believe in the results."
Michael and his family were the first customers to arrive the next morning, and Andrea greeted them at the door with cups of Baxter's "anti-aging water." She led them into the back of the spa and showed them the equipment while she ran through a rote disclaimer. "It's not meant to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease," she said. "It hasn't been clinically proven yet, so we have to avoid saying all of that."
But what she could say was what Michael had heard hundreds of times already on Patriot Party News: that medbeds represented "the most advanced technology in the world." That Baxter's model was a "first-generation, civilian medbed," and that even if it couldn't cure all disease and regrow limbs in 45 minutes like the military version, it was still "capable of miracles that you won't even believe." That she had gone to try the equipment for herself at Baxter's warehouse in Florida and walked out a few days later feeling "so euphoric and transformed" that she had decided on the spot to open a wellness center. One of her best friends had shingles in her brain and another had cancer; they didn't have time to wait. Andrea sold her favorite horse, refinanced her car and spent much of her savings to purchase five pieces of equipment for $ 140,000.
Several other companies had started producing their own versions of medbeds in the last few years. One company, Tesla BioHealing, had purchased a half-dozen old motels in places like Tampa, Fla., Dubuque, Iowa, and Butler, Pa., and then turned them into "medbed centers," where each room came equipped with proprietary canisters under the bed that provided what the company called "life force energy." Other groups were running scams on Facebook and charging $ 800 for "redemption cards" with a photograph of Trump's face and a code that they said would provide secret passage into the underground military bases where medbeds were said to be ready for use.
Baxter's company was still in its infancy, and he had sold some of his products to churches, private clubs or millionaires who he said were "invested in longevity." The medbeds at Andrea's spa were the first to be available by appointment to the public, and he planned to expand into spas across the United States and Mexico. Andrea had decided to charge $ 85 an hour for use of the beds, but insurance didn't cover the experimental treatment, and she didn't believe in turning anyone away. In the past few months, people had arrived from across the West hoping for answers for their late-stage cancer, A.L.S., chronic depression and dementia, and Andrea let some of them use a medbed for free. She cooked for them, found them places to stay and often held their hands to pray before they lay down in the medbed.
"I don't care if it means I'm losing some money," Andrea told Michael. "I feel like I landed smack dab in the middle of my purpose on this planet."
Michael's daughter climbed into the Tesla medbed, a cylindrical hyperbaric chamber that sold for $ 90,000, and that Baxter said combined light frequency, sound frequency and intermittent electrical stimulation into "the future of health." Michael went into the room next door and lay down in a frequency medbed, where he could punch in different codes to receive vibrations and stimulation allegedly tailored to specific medical issues.
He picked up the menu of options and looked at the alphabetized first page, which had more than 50 choices beginning with the letter A: "Acid Reflux," "Acne," "Alzheimer's," "Alcoholism," "Aneurysm," "Anthrax," "Anxiety Relief," "Arthritis," "Asperger's," "Autism."
"Wow, it can really correct all this?" Michael asked.
"Over time, it's possible," Andrea said. "As long as you believe, and your mind and body are in alignment with the right frequencies."
He flipped through the book and landed on a page for the letter H. "Heel Spurs," "Herniated Disc," "Hepatitis," "High Blood Pressure," "Hissing in Ear," "H.I.V."
"I've got so many issues I barely know where to start," he said. "I guess let's do it for back pain and inflammation."
Andrea punched in a few codes and the bed began to recline and then vibrate. Michael pulled a blanket over his chest and took out his phone to type a quick note into the chat forum on Patriot Party News. "FOMO!" he wrote. "Haven't been on for a bit because I've got the whole family getting Baxter treatments." He checked back a few moments later to track the flow of replies.
"Thank God! Medbed miracle!"
"Can't wait until Trump makes these available for all true Patriots."
Andrea came back into the room and stood by the doorway, holding up her own phone. "People on the platform are so excited," she said. "Is your back starting to feel better at all?"
He shifted in the bed and stared up at the ceiling, trying to believe, working to align his mind with the right frequencies.
"You know what?" he said, after a moment. "I think it does."

Lobbyists Greet Harris Campaign: [National Desk]

Full text: Lobbyists and lawyers are raising money for Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and assessing what her term might look like.
Vice President Kamala Harris has forsworn direct donations from lobbyists, but they are welcoming her candidacy and finding other ways to support it.
In the days since President Biden dropped his re-election campaign and Ms. Harris moved swiftly to lock up the Democratic Party's nomination, Washington's influence industry has quietly jockeyed to position itself with her team.
Officials at some of the biggest law and lobbying firms have endorsed her presidential campaign and are raising money for it, using loopholes to get around the campaign's policy of not accepting donations from lobbyists. They have briefed clients about her policy positions, the composition of her inner circle and the pool of possible running mates. Some lobbying firms have highlighted their connections to Ms. Harris, drawing the ire of allies seeking to avoid the perception that she is beholden to special interests.
"Human nature is such that anybody that ever walked past somebody on the street would try to capitalize," said former Senator Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat who is close to Ms. Harris. "Especially in a campaign for president, there is always going to be those folks."
"That's Washington, isn't it?" he added.
Mr. Jones -- a government relations adviser, but not a registered lobbyist, at the law and lobbying firm ArentFox Schiff -- said he was planning a Washington fund-raising event for Ms. Harris's campaign featuring lawyers from a host of firms.
The dramatic reset of the presidential race has intensified a Washington tradition, as lobbyists and other government affairs professionals rush to signal connections to the candidates. Executed deftly, this can create demand among prospective clients looking for access to the would-be president and their team. If it is done clumsily, it can backfire, creating the specter of a craven effort to cash in and burning bridges with the campaign.
There was less open positioning just a week ago, when the race appeared to be headed toward a rematch between Mr. Biden and former President Donald J. Trump. Both men were known commodities in Washington, with their own complicated relationships with the city's influence industry.
The industry includes law and lobbying firms, as well as consultancies that advise clients how to navigate the federal government, but that do not technically lobby. Taken together, the sprawling constellation of shops is known as K Street, for the District of Columbia boulevard where many traditionally had offices.
When Mr. Trump first ran for president in 2016, he campaigned on a promise to "drain the swamp" of Washington special interests and bureaucracy. He had few ties to traditional Republican power brokers. From the ranks of his supporters emerged a new set of lobbyists who profited handsomely during his presidency and remained influential during his subsequent campaigns.
Over his half-century in Washington, Mr. Biden surrounded himself with confidants who cycled back and forth between government and the private sector. That continued during his presidential campaign and administration, even as he enacted policies to slow the revolving door.
Ms. Harris, by contrast, arrived in Washington as a senator only in 2017 and has a smaller alumni network on K Street.
A letter endorsing her signed by more than 300 former employees from her various government offices and campaigns -- including in her runs for San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. Senate and vice president -- includes some names from the government affairs industry.
"We have worked alongside her as she has tackled the toughest challenges and the most intractable issues," the letter reads.
It was spearheaded by Rachel E. Palermo, a lawyer who left Ms. Harris's vice-presidential press shop last year and joined a team at the law firm Jenner & Block that helps clients navigate government regulations and congressional investigations.
Another lawyer on that team, Josh Hsu, had worked as Ms. Harris's chief legal adviser in the White House.
Neither Mr. Hsu nor Ms. Palermo are among their firm's registered lobbyists. Mr. Hsu did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Palermo declined to comment.
Michael Fuchs, who served as deputy chief of staff for Ms. Harris, is an adviser to the consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which helps companies navigate Washington and has deep ties to the Biden administration. Separately, Mr. Fuchs works for the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropy started by the billionaire George Soros, a Democratic megadonor.
Other former Harris staff members in the influence industry include Clint Odom, who was the legislative director in Ms. Harris's Senate office and is now an executive in charge of public policy at T-Mobile; Deanne Millison, who worked for Ms. Harris in the Senate and the White House and is now a lobbyist for Ford Motor Company; and Christopher M. Keosian, who worked on Ms. Harris's 2020 campaign and is now a lobbyist representing municipal governments and utilities.
Other lawyers and lobbyists who did not work for Ms. Harris have developed ties to her or her team over the years.
Ms. Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff, formerly a partner at the law and lobbying firm DLA Piper, has connections in the legal community in Washington and Los Angeles.
Yasmin R. Nelson, a lobbyist with the firm Holland & Knight who signed the alumni endorsement letter, said Ms. Harris and her team had "a pretty open door" to lobbyists, depending on the topic.
"On the issues that are important to her, she is definitely going to want to hear from people, and if they happen to be downtown, on K Street, and you're best positioned to help her through that, then I think she will," said Ms. Nelson, who had worked as a policy adviser for Ms. Harris's Senate office.
Ms. Nelson's clients have included the tech company Intel, a Canadian real estate company and nonprofit groups. She said her team arranged a meeting last month with Ms. Harris for two nonprofit clients dedicated to helping mothers.
Ms. Nelson said she was raising money for the Harris Victory Fund, a joint committee comprising Ms. Harris's campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee and various state party committees.
During her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Ms. Harris had pledged not to accept donations from corporate PACs or lobbyists. Mr. Biden issued a similar pledge. The policy had continued during his re-election campaign, which Ms. Harris has inherited.
But the policy did not extend to the D.N.C., creating a back door for lobbyist funds to help the party's presidential ticket.
Asked if the policies on lobbyist donations had changed, a spokesman for Ms. Harris's campaign declined to comment. The D.N.C. did not respond to questions about its policy on donations raised or given by lobbyists.
David H. Reid, of the lobbying giant Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, sent a fund-raising email to his network in the hours after Mr. Biden stepped aside.
"As a reminder, the D.N.C. accepts contributions from lobbyists," wrote Mr. Reid, who was a top fund-raiser for Democrats, including Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. He added, "All dollars go toward electing the Democratic nominee for president."

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris has forsworn direct donations from lobbyists, but they are welcoming her candidacy and finding other ways to support it.
In the days since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection campaign and Harris moved swiftly to lock up the Democratic Party’s nomination, Washington’s influence industry has quietly jockeyed to position itself with her team.
Officials at some of the biggest law and lobbying firms have endorsed her presidential campaign and are raising money for it, using loopholes to get around the campaign’s policy of not accepting donations from lobbyists. They have briefed clients about her policy positions, the composition of her inner circle and the pool of possible running mates. Some lobbying firms have highlighted their connections to Harris, drawing the ire of allies seeking to avoid the perception that she is beholden to special interests.
“Human nature is such that anybody that ever walked past somebody on the street would try to capitalize,” said former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., who is close to Harris. “Especially in a campaign for president, there is always going to be those folks.”
“That’s Washington, isn’t it?” he added.
Jones — a government relations adviser, but not a registered lobbyist, at the law and lobbying firm ArentFox Schiff — said he was planning a Washington fundraising event for Harris’ campaign featuring lawyers from a host of firms.
The dramatic reset of the presidential race has intensified a Washington tradition, as lobbyists and other government affairs professionals rush to signal connections to the candidates. Executed deftly, this can create demand among prospective clients looking for access to the would-be president and their team. If it is done clumsily, it can backfire, creating the specter of a craven effort to cash in and burning bridges with the campaign.
There was less open positioning just a week ago, when the race appeared to be headed toward a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump. Both men were known commodities in Washington, with their own complicated relationships with the city’s influence industry.
The industry includes law and lobbying firms, as well as consultancies that advise clients how to navigate the federal government, but that do not technically lobby. Taken together, the sprawling constellation of shops is known as K Street, for the District of Columbia boulevard where many traditionally had offices.
When Trump first ran for president in 2016, he campaigned on a promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington special interests and bureaucracy. He had few ties to traditional Republican power brokers. From the ranks of his supporters emerged a new set of lobbyists who profited handsomely during his presidency and remained influential during his subsequent campaigns.
Over his half-century in Washington, Biden surrounded himself with confidants who cycled back and forth between government and the private sector. That continued during his presidential campaign and administration, even as he enacted policies to slow the revolving door.
Harris, by contrast, arrived in Washington as a senator only in 2017 and has a smaller alumni network on K Street.
A letter endorsing her signed by more than 300 former employees from her various government offices and campaigns — including in her runs for San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. Senate and vice president — includes some names from the government affairs industry.
“We have worked alongside her as she has tackled the toughest challenges and the most intractable issues,” the letter reads.
It was spearheaded by Rachel E. Palermo, a lawyer who left Harris’ vice-presidential press shop last year and joined a team at the law firm Jenner & Block that helps clients navigate government regulations and congressional investigations.
Another lawyer on that team, Josh Hsu, had worked as Harris’ chief legal adviser in the White House.
Neither Hsu nor Palermo are among their firm’s registered lobbyists. Hsu did not respond to a request for comment. Palermo declined to comment.
Michael Fuchs, who served as deputy chief of staff for Harris, is an adviser to the consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which helps companies navigate Washington and has deep ties to the Biden administration. Separately, Fuchs works for the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropy started by billionaire George Soros, a Democratic megadonor.
Other former Harris staff members in the influence industry include Clint Odom, who was the legislative director in Harris’ Senate office and is now an executive in charge of public policy at T-Mobile; Deanne Millison, who worked for Harris in the Senate and the White House and is now a lobbyist for Ford Motor Co.; and Christopher M. Keosian, who worked on Harris’ 2020 campaign and is now a lobbyist representing municipal governments and utilities.
Other lawyers and lobbyists who did not work for Harris have developed ties to her or her team over the years.
Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, formerly a partner at the law and lobbying firm DLA Piper, has connections in the legal community in Washington and Los Angeles.
Yasmin R. Nelson, a lobbyist with the firm Holland & Knight who signed the alumni endorsement letter, said Harris and her team had “a pretty open door” to lobbyists, depending on the topic.
“On the issues that are important to her, she is definitely going to want to hear from people, and if they happen to be downtown, on K Street, and you’re best positioned to help her through that, then I think she will,” said Nelson, who had worked as a policy adviser for Harris’ Senate office.
Nelson’s clients have included the tech company Intel, a Canadian real estate company and nonprofit groups. She said her team arranged a meeting last month with Harris for two nonprofit clients dedicated to helping mothers.
Nelson said she was raising money for the Harris Victory Fund, a joint committee comprising Harris’ campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee and various state party committees.
During her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Harris had pledged not to accept donations from corporate political action committees or lobbyists. Biden issued a similar pledge. The policy had continued during his reelection campaign, which Harris has inherited.
But the policy did not extend to the DNC, creating a back door for lobbyist funds to help the party’s presidential ticket.
Asked if the policies on lobbyist donations had changed, a spokesperson for Harris’ campaign declined to comment. The DNC did not respond to questions about its policy on donations raised or given by lobbyists.
David H. Reid, of the lobbying giant Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, sent a fundraising email to his network in the hours after Biden stepped aside.
“As a reminder, the DNC accepts contributions from lobbyists,” wrote Reid, who was a top fundraiser for Democrats, including Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. He added, “All dollars go toward electing the Democratic nominee for president.”
Reid — whose clients include defense contractors, drugmakers, casino companies and the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba — did not respond to a request for comment.
Brownstein Hyatt, Holland & Knight, Arent Fox and other firms with large lobbying operations maintain bipartisan rosters of lobbyists that allow them to maintain access regardless of which party controls the White House and Congress.
Rich Gold, the leader of Holland & Knight’s public policy and regulation group, said the firm had relationships that would leave it well-positioned regardless of who won the presidency.
But he said the firm was fielding “a lot of questions from corporate clients and our nonprofit clients and cities about ‘OK, tell me what this looks like in a Harris administration.’”

How $4 Billion In Western Tech Flowed To Russia: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Defying sanctions, Russia has obtained nearly $ 4 billion in restricted chips since the war began in Ukraine. Many were shipped through a cluster of shell companies in Hong Kong.
From a nondescript seventh-floor office at 135 Bonham Strand near Hong Kong's financial district, at least four companies are operating with a shadowy mission: facilitating the illicit trade of Western technology to Russia.
Shell companies at that address have acquired millions of restricted chips and sensors for military technology companies in Russia, many of which have been placed under sanctions by the U.S. government, according to an examination by The New York Times.
The companies have names like Olax Finance and Rikkon Holding. Their office, with a faded 704 number on the door, appears unoccupied. No one answered during a visit last month. An ad for air-conditioning hung in the crack of the door.
Yet the companies are a crucial link in a chain connecting U.S. research laboratories to Chinese factories, Russian arms makers and the battlefields of Ukraine -- and a sign that the U.S. government and tech giants cannot control where their technology goes.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, nearly $ 4 billion of restricted chips have poured into Russia from more than 6,000 companies, including those at Hong Kong's 135 Bonham Strand, according to a Times analysis of Russian customs data, corporate records, domain registrations and sanctions data. The analysis examined nearly 800,000 shipments of restricted electronic goods into Russia since mid-2021.
Even as the West sought to cut off access to semiconductors through trade restrictions, Russia established such a robust parallel supply chain that it imported almost the same number of critical chips in the last three months of 2023 that it did in the same period in 2021, according to the analysis of Russian customs data. The reliance on China for many of these chips also deepened, with transactions that were historically settled in U.S. dollars now increasingly executed in Renminbi, according to the analysis.
The ability of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to flout Western trade restrictions has been one of the failings of the U.S.-led response to the war in Ukraine. Rather than become economically isolated, Russia has emerged from more than two years of conflict emboldened in its attacks against Ukraine.
Russia's technology imports begin with U.S. chipmakers selling their products to international distributors. The chip companies are not legally required to track where their goods go from there. Russia has then turned to the international distributors -- which are in Hong Kong, China, Turkey, India, Serbia and Singapore, according to The Times's analysis -- to maintain a steady supply of tech.
Some of the middlemen companies are part of longtime networks of offshore firms owned by Russian businessmen. At 135 Bonham Strand, four shell companies are owned by oligarchs linked to Russia's military industrial base, according to The Times's analysis.
The speed with which the shell companies have sprung into action has overwhelmed Western regulators. As soon as one supplier is ferreted out, new ones sprout in its place, sometimes with the same owner. Some of the companies operate in the United States' backyard, including one Russia-linked firm fronted -- apparently unwittingly -- by a Latvian-Canadian retiree in a two-story house in a Toronto suburb.
A Commerce Department spokeswoman did not directly address how Russia had flouted trade restrictions and said U.S. export controls meant that "Russia is increasingly unable to meet its heightened wartime demand in the face of shrinking supply and is paying more for what it does get." She said the agency had aggressively enforced the restrictions and worked with industry, increasing the cost of chips by 135 percent and reducing the flow of the items to Russia. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said the agency had expanded its efforts to penalize those trading with Russia and supporting its war efforts.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to requests for comment.
China plays an essential role. As the world's leading assembler of electronics, it imports huge numbers of Western components and turns them into consumer electronics. Chinese firms can easily channel those supplies to Russia, industry experts said.
In a statement, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it didn't provide weapons or equipment to any party in the war in Ukraine. "What the United States should do is reflect on its responsibility for the Ukraine crisis rather than shirking responsibility to China," the ministry said.
With limited domestic manufacturing capacity, the United States has little option but to continue sending chips into China for manufacturing, packaging and assembly.
"The tide has shifted," said Elina Ribakova, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. "We have lost control of chip production."
Western Chips in Russian Missiles
On July 8, a Russian missile tore into a children's hospital in Kyiv, killing two and injuring 10, including seven children.
The Kh-101 long-range cruise missile fired into Kyiv was laden with electronics from American chipmakers that had been restricted by trade controls, according to Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention.
One important chip in the Russian missiles was the Field Programmable Gate Array, or F.P.G.A., made by U.S. companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The chip is used in fire alarms, internet modems, missiles and drones to process data at lightning speed and is banned for sale to Russia.
Since the war began, Russia has imported more than $ 390 million in F.P.G.A.s, according to Russian customs data. The shipments are just one sliver of the Kremlin's efforts to sidestep sanctions and maintain supplies of critical technology.
The Kremlin has long understood its reliance on Western technology to be a vulnerability. In 2020, Russia tried to kick-start domestic chip production with a plan to bolster electronics manufacturing over the next decade. Those efforts largely failed.
Instead, Russia cultivated relationships with large U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, importing chips from companies such as Intel and electronics distributors like DigiKey. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, those ties were upended. The U.S. government swiftly announced sweeping restrictions to hamper Russia's ability to acquire crucial technologies.
"Russia's access to cutting-edge U.S. and partner country technology will halt," Thea D. Rozman Kendler, an assistant secretary of commerce, said at the time.
Western companies soon exited Russia. Their products did not.
Russia speedily reoriented supply chains, seeking out friendly countries and ports willing to service its ships. Transshipment hubs popped up in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on companies and individuals in those countries.
China emerged as the dominant chip supplier to Russia. According to the Semiconductor Industry Alliance, 29 percent of all semiconductors pass through China.
Texas Instruments, which makes chips found in the Shahed and Lancet drones -- two of Russia's deadliest military-grade drones -- has a chip assembly and testing factory in the central Chinese city of Chengdu. Micron Technology, another U.S. chipmaker, assembles chips in Xi'an. F.P.G.A.s flow in huge numbers to Chinese manufacturers, which put them in products that are sold globally.
In emailed responses, AMD, Texas Instruments, Micron and Intel said they opposed the use of their technology by Russia and that they complied with U.S. export controls.
"In the first few weeks of the war, there really was something of an expectation that these were going to be crushing measures," Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said of the sanctions. But "we underestimated the difficulty of the U.S. to actually enforce in a market like that."
The Russians of 135 Bonham Strand
In 2008, Alexey Chichenev, a Russian businessman, took control of a company called Saril Overseas based in Hong Kong.
It was one entity in a growing portfolio of shell companies at 135 Bonham Strand, led by Mr. Chichenev, a Russian expatriate in Hong Kong, and his partner, Mikhail Vinogradov.
Over the next decade, the pair began managing nearly a dozen shell companies with names like Syssoft and Toren Limited, which worked in international property development and trade, according to news releases and the companies' websites. One Bonham Strand firm, Olax Finance, said it had helped finance a water purification project with Costner Industries Venezuela, a company owned by the actor Kevin Costner. Mr. Costner's publicist did not respond to requests for comment.
The firms at 135 Bonham Strand used byzantine offshore ownership structures that intersected with holding companies in the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus, according to corporate registration documents. Shares of the companies were transferred like baseball cards between Russian businessmen with addresses in places like Vienna, Tel Aviv and Paris, according to Hong Kong corporate registration records.
Two companies at 135 Bonham Strand, Rikkon and Midicon, were owned separately by Andrey Kozitsyn and Igor Kudryashkin, the former directors of the Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, an industrial conglomerate in Russia, according to public records. The Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company has ties to Mr. Putin, weapons manufacturing and Russian organized crime, according to the Treasury Department and publicly available documents.
The Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company did not respond to a request for comment. It's unclear whether Mr. Kozitsyn and Mr. Kudryashkin are still affiliated with the company, and they could not be reached.
In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea, Mr. Kozitsyn and Mr. Kudryashkin transferred ownership of Rikkon and Midicon to Mr. Chichenev and Mr. Vinogradov. By 2022, Mr. Chichenev and Mr. Vinogradov controlled at least 11 companies at 135 Bonham Strand, according to Hong Kong's corporate registry.
Only two of those companies, Kvantek and Superchip, sold chips to Russia before the war in Ukraine. But as restrictions and sanctions set in, more jumped into action, according to The Times's analysis of Russian customs data.
Saril Overseas, for one, had no record of exports to Russia until six months after the war began. Its first shipment, in July 2022, was a batch of F.P.G.A.s valued at $ 95,000 and made by AMD.
Saril Overseas later expanded its trade to several Russian companies. By this year, it had sold nearly $ 9 million of restricted semiconductors, according to the analysis of Russian customs data.
At least one of the shell companies, Kvantek, has since shut down its website and appears to have ceased operations, according to The Times's analysis.
In an interview at the door of his Hong Kong apartment, Mr. Chichenev said he did not know who was behind the companies and had forgotten how they were transferred to his name. "You see, it is a friend of my friend in Moscow, so they asked me to help them," he said.
Mr. Chichenev said he was contacted because he lived in Hong Kong, working as the director of a separate company. He said he was not a tech expert and simply helped get chips from the United States and Taiwan to China.
"It was out of my control," he said. "I just made payments to the U.S. or Taiwan."
His 135 Bonham Strand companies were being shut down, he added. "At the moment, I just enjoy life," he said. "But before, yes, we had several companies, but now everything is closed."
Mr. Vinogradov did not respond to emailed questions. Colin Cohen, a lawyer based in Hong Kong whose firm, Boase Cohen & Collins, is listed as the secretary on many 135 Bonham Strand companies, declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.
One beneficiary of the continued tech flows was Staut, a Russian military electronics supplier. In July 2023, the Treasury Department imposed restrictions on Staut to cut it off from U.S. technology.
That posed a problem for the 135 Bonham Strand companies, which had sold over $ 21 million in restricted chips to Staut. Yet within months, several Bonham Strand firms had shifted their shipments from Staut to two new companies, Chipdevice and Leningrad Microwaves.
While appearing independent on paper, Chipdevice and Leningrad Microwaves shared ownership with Staut and another Russian military electronics supplier, Fregat, according to Russian corporate records and domain registrations. Chipdevice and Leningrad Microwaves have received over $ 17 million in restricted chips since the war began.
By late last year, the United States had placed Chipdevice and Fregat under sanctions. Leningrad Microwaves remains unaffected. Last month, the Treasury Department also designated Mr. Chichenev and several of the 135 Bonham Strand firms for economic sanctions. It has not taken action against Mr. Vinogradov.
Still, the U.S. government remains at least a step behind. Since the war started, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, an agency in the Treasury Department that administers the U.S. sanctions program, has designated at least 4,234 Russian individuals and companies for economic restrictions, according to OpenSanctions, a sanctions data provider.
A Retiree's Suburban Home
On the porch of his house in a leafy Toronto suburb, Edward Poberezkin, a 67-year-old Latvian-Canadian retiree, recently recounted his connection to a company that had shipped restricted technology to Russia.
A decade ago, Mr. Poberezkin said, a businessman from Russia paid him a nominal fee to register as an "agent for service" for Alburton Enterprises, a company based in the British Virgin Islands. The registration made Mr. Poberezkin and his home the designated addressee and address for official documents for Alburton's Canadian headquarters.
When a Times reporter visited with questions about Alburton this month, Mr. Poberezkin said he was "very surprised." The company has shipped more than $ 9 million in restricted technology to Russia since early 2022, according to The Times's analysis of Russian customs data.
Mr. Poberezkin, who is Alburton's only publicly listed director, said he had not heard from the company or received any mail related to it in nine years.
"I do not have any contact with the Russian government," he said, adding that he did not know how his name or address were being used and did not know Alburton's work. He said he intended to remove himself as the company's Canadian representative.
While Mr. Poberezkin's story couldn't be independently verified, it was characteristic of Russian efforts to pull in businesspeople -- some of whom may be unwitting and who often have a background linked to Russia -- to sidestep sanctions, experts said. That Russia-related businesses dared to do it in a major city of a U.S. ally illustrated how unabashed their evasions could be.
A Canada Border Services Agency spokesman said it could not provide details about Alburton's operations.
Alburton has other international links. In 2019, it shipped thousands of pounds of electrical cables to Russia through Levitus Trading, a company in the British Virgin Islands, according to the analysis of Russian customs data. Levitus was once the sole owner of Olax, a company now owned by Mr. Chichenev at a familiar address: 135 Bonham Strand in Hong Kong.

Methodology
To calculate Russia's imports of restricted chips, The New York Times analyzed Russian customs data from a company that gathers global trade information from governments worldwide. The company asked not to be named in order to preserve its access to sensitive trade data from Russia and other countries.
The Times verified the customs data through interviews with experts, crosschecks against other data providers and interviews with companies included in the data.
The Times specifically looked at data on electronic goods that fell within an international trade classification denoted by the numbers 8542.3. That category includes chips that the U.S. Commerce Department has designated as sensitive goods. The United States restricted those products from Russia in 2022 after the war in Ukraine began.
The Times analyzed all Russian imports of such goods between July 1, 2021, and Jan. 4, 2024. Each trade record included the name of the importer, the exporter, the brand of chip, its value and its number of units. That information was used to calculate aggregates. Shipment values were calculated based on the exchange rate at the date of trade.
To discern whether any of the exporters had been placed under sanctions by the United States, The Times compared the Russian customs data with U.S. Treasury sanctions designations using information from Open Sanctions, a sanctions data provider.
The Times reviewed hundreds of corporate filings from Hong Kong and Ontario, as well as public records compiled by commercial services, to determine the owners of the shell companies. The Times also reviewed documents from the Panama Papers, a collection of leaked financial documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A branding expert, he deployed the "I'm lovin' it" campaign globally in 2003 to bring customers and sales back to the fast-food giant when it was in a slump.
Larry Light, a McDonald's executive who oversaw a worldwide marketing campaign in the early 2000s that was built around the slogan "I'm lovin' it," which revived that fast-food chain when it was in the doldrums, died on June 24 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 83.
His daughter Laura Light said the cause was aspiration pneumonia, adding that Parkinson's disease was listed as a secondary cause.
When he was hired in 2002 as the global chief marketing officer of McDonald's, Mr. Light was a consultant who had built his expertise in branding over more than 20 years as an advertising executive.
At McDonald's, he found a corporate colossus that had lost its way with some consumers, especially young ones. Earnings were falling. The stock price was down. Its advertising was uninspired.
"We recognized that mass marketing of mass messages to masses of people via mass media was a mass mistake," Mr. Light wrote in 2020 in the online publication Branding Strategy Insider. "McDonald's had been managed as a mass-market, mass-media, mass-message brand. Our challenge was to lead a big brand, but not as a mass brand."
Mr. Light said he had wanted a marketing message that did not tell McDonald's customers what to think.
"Don't tell me I 'deserve a break today.' I know I do," he wrote, referring to an earlier successful ad campaign. Instead, he sought one that spoke in the voice of a consumer.
He invited 14 ad agencies in 10 major countries to compete to create a campaign that would travel across borders. After a four-month beauty contest, a German agency, Heye & Partner, part of DDB Worldwide, won the pageant with "I'm lovin' it," or "Ich liebe es."
The slogan became part of a global marketing plan targeted to remind customers why they loved McDonald's and how its food fit into their lives. Agencies around the world created commercials that appeared in more than 100 countries, all conforming to the "I'm lovin' it" theme.
"We didn't need the same advertising everywhere as long as they were conveying the same purpose," said Joan Kiddon, who began working with Mr. Light in 1976 and is the president of Arcature, the consulting firm he opened in 1989 and stepped down from to work at McDonald's.
At internal meetings before the campaign was unveiled in September 2003, Mr. Light said, "everyone applauds." But, he told the Knight-Ridder News Service, some of the same people told him over cocktails, "Larry, this better work." Some franchisees reminded him that his time could be short if the campaign failed.
In the United States, Justin Timberlake starred in a commercial with teenagers surfing and skateboarding to a hip-hop beat and recorded a separate song, "I'm Lovin' It," with an accompanying video. Stars in other countries played similar roles in ads. The company also hired the skateboarder Tony Hawk to reach young people. The now familiar earworm, the five-tone jingle "ba-da-ba-ba-ba," was introduced in the ads.
Sales rebounded. In the first three months of 2004, McDonald's outlets around the world attracted 2.3 million more customers daily than in the same period the year before.
The Wall Street Journal called "I'm lovin' it" one of the top ad campaigns of 2003.
"Its most recent work, using the 'Smile' slogan, made consumers grimace," The Journal wrote. "But the new one has the makings of a hit."
In a speech to Advertising Age in June 2004, Mr. Light said, "'I'm lovin' it' is not a mere advertising slogan; it's an expression of our new brand attitude. In less than one year, people's attitudes changed from giving us the cold shoulder to becoming suddenly cool."
The turnaround at McDonald's included menu changes, like adding salads and removing "supersize" portions, and the founding of World Children's Day, which raises money for children's charities.
Marvin Lawrence Light was born on June 12, 1941, in Montreal. His father, Louis, was a confectionary manufacturer and a builder of residential homes; his mother, Celia (Sheinman) Light, oversaw the household.
After earning a bachelor's degree from McGill University in 1962, Mr. Light received a Ph.D. in psychology three years later from Ohio State University.
He was hired by BBDO Advertising, where, over 15 years, he rose to executive vice president. He became known for his knowledge and innovative use of market research, including studies that used focus groups and surveys to help companies understand the problems consumers had with their products and to find solutions.
H&R Block, for example, improved on its services by addressing 17 problems identified by consumers about tax preparation in general and the company's methods in particular, Ms. Kiddon said.
In 1981, Mr. Light moved to another agency, Ted Bates Worldwide, as an executive vice president and oversaw the advertising for the M&M/Mars candy account. Five years later, he became chairman and chief executive of Bates's overseas division.
In 1989, two years after Bates's merger with Backer & Spielvogel -- both were subsidiaries of Saatchi & Saatchi -- Mr. Light started Arcature with Don Zuckert, a former Bates executive. Mr. Zuckert left in 1995.
Mr. Light spent the next 35 years at Arcature, advising companies like IBM, Intel, Quaker Oats, Chipotle, Nissan and Visa. McDonald's was his client when he joined the company.
Jim Kirk, a marketing columnist, wrote in 2002 in The Chicago Tribune that McDonald's was taking a risk by not hiring a "corporate heavyweight with practical hands-on experience."
But Jack M. Greenberg, McDonald's chairman and chief executive at the time, said in a statement that in Mr. Light "we have selected one of the world's best thought leaders in brand strategy."
Mr. Light left McDonald's in 2005 and returned to Arcature. He left the firm again in 2012 to take another corporate job, as the chief brands officer of IHG Hotels & Resorts, a post he held until 2014. He had previously consulted for the company.
In addition to his daughter Laura, Mr. Light is survived by his wife, Joyce (Wax) Light; another daughter, Michelle Light; his brothers Irwin and Bruce; and two grandchildren.
He and Ms. Kiddon collaborated on four books, three of them on branding, including "Six Rules of Brand Revitalization" (2009). And Mr. Light spoke widely about branding and various companies' strategies, including that of McDonald's, which has introduced other ad campaigns but still uses "I'm lovin' it."

An Instant Outpouring of Reaction on Social Media: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The shooting targeting Donald J. Trump was the first of its kind in the era of social media, and was followed by a flood of striking images, rich eyewitness accounts and furious, fearful reaction.
Follow the latest news on the Trump assassination attempt.
It was the first attempted assassination of a current or former American president in the era of social media, and the conspiracy theories, finger-pointing and campaign gamesmanship moved at the speed of the internet, far faster than the actual facts of what transpired at former President Donald J. Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pa.
The assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 left the nation in bewildered grief. Conspiracy theories would proliferate, of course, and Abraham Zapruder's film of Kennedy's last moments would be studied for decades. But first, there was mourning. The assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 would rock the public consciousness again, leaving Americans wondering what would become of their country.
But in the era of memes, X posts, Truths, Threads and TikTok, introspection was never going to be the dominant mood. Rage, blame, even comedy were the watchwords of 2024. A picture of Mr. Trump, fist aloft, American flag fluttering overhead, became iconic in an instant.
Within minutes of the first televised images of Mr. Trump grabbing his wounded ear on Saturday, voices on the left were calling it staged, though they were hardly household names.
Not long after, far bigger names on the right, including Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a finalist to be Mr. Trump's running mate, had settled on the argument that Democrats had set the stage for an attempted assassination by framing the 2024 election as a battle between the forces of democracy and the soldiers of fascism. Of course someone was going to take a shot, these conservatives said.
Before anyone knew a thing about the man who had pulled the trigger, Mr. Trump's most senior surrogates, including Mr. Vance and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, were blaming President Biden and Democrats.
"Today is not just some isolated incident," Mr. Vance wrote on the social media site X, owned by the right's favorite billionaire, Elon Musk. "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination."
Mr. Scott picked up the cue: "For years, Democrats and their allies in the media have recklessly stoked fears, calling President Trump and other conservatives threats to democracy," he wrote. "Their inflammatory rhetoric puts lives at risk."
The information that ricocheted around the internet in those first hours after the shooting was at once richly detailed and strangely lacking in substance. The BBC's interview of a man who was on hand for the rally was stunning: He recounted how he had seen a man with a rifle crawling on a nearby rooftop and, for several minutes, tried to warn the police. Still photographs appeared to show the body of the gunman on the roof after he was killed.
Another rallygoer recounted taking lifesaving efforts on the person who died at the scene.
Yet the motives of the gunman, much less his identity, remained unconfirmed by the authorities for hours. In addition to the rally attendee who was killed, two others were critically injured. But the world did not know who they were.
(Early Sunday, the F.B.I. said the gunman was a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, Pa.)
Democratic leaders, including Mr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama, broadly condemned political violence. An AR-15-type rifle was found near the man believed to be the shooter, which could have fueled more Democratic calls for an assault weapons ban, but the party's leaders held their tongues.
But in the internet era there is always someone who doesn't.
Republicans dug deep to find more obscure voices on the left, such as London Lamar, a Democratic state senator in Tennessee, who framed a different message. Ms. Lamar wrote, then deleted, "the extremism from the MAGA regime has brought us to this moment," but not before conservatives had grabbed screen shots and sent them flying around the internet.
An obscure aide to Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, became a casus belli for some on the right for suggesting, "please get you some shooting lessons," even as actual members of Congress were lobbing their own fire bombs from the right.
"The Republican District Attorney in Butler County, PA, should immediately file charges against Joseph R. Biden for inciting an assassination," wrote Representative Mike Collins, Republican of Georgia.
A fellow Georgian, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, suggested, "Democrats wanted this to happen."
Arch conspiracy theories came from heroes of the far right, like the activist James O'Keefe, who suggested that the Secret Service was somehow in on it through the "Deep State Intel Community." X posters and internet sleuths even named the shooter -- incorrectly. The man was in fact a soccer journalist in Italy.
Among younger social media users, an image of Mr. Trump's face photoshopped into a famous portrait of Vincent van Gogh with a bandaged, partly amputated ear was widely shared, often with an ironic "too soon?" attached.
In some quadrants of the political right, the mood was almost celebratory, as supporters shared images of a bleeding Mr. Trump, fist aloft.
Within minutes after the news of the shooting broke, Mr. Musk took the moment to officially endorse Mr. Trump to his 189 million followers on X, something he had only flirted with previously. He then spent the evening amplifying pro-Trump sentiments and castigating a liberal tech billionaire, Reid Hoffman, for once saying he wished he had made Mr. Trump "an actual martyr."
Another billionaire, the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, followed suit in endorsing Mr. Trump. Even Jeff Bezos, who has shied from politics, weighed in, declaring on social media that "our former President showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire."
In the Trump camp, the triumphalism was palpable less than four months from Election Day.
Above the instantly famous photo of Mr. Trump raising his fist with an American flag flying overhead, his campaign chief, Chris LaCivita, likened the moment to Old Glory raised over Iwo Jima, summing up his apparent glee with an obscenity.
The same photo was the backdrop for Donald Trump Jr.'s conclusion about his father: "He'll never stop fighting to Save America."
Photograph "Today is not just some isolated incident," Senator J.D. Vance, a vice-presidential hopeful, wrote in a post on X. (PHOTOGRAPH BY HAIYUN JIANG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page A17.

Mixed Close on Wall St. After Fed Chair's Guarded Remarks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stock indexes on Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday after remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell in front of Congress did little to change the market's expectations for the timing of a Fed interest rate cut.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each rose 0.1 percent, enough to bump up the indexes to highs for the second time this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent after spending much of the day drifting between small gains and losses.
In his testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Powell reiterated that inflation has eased notably in the past two years, though it remains above the central bank's 2 percent target. He also noted that there's a risk in the Fed moving to cut interest rates too late or too little, warning that either scenario could end up weakening the economy and job market.
Mr. Powell's testimony offered little new guidance on the Fed's plans for when it might lower interest rates. Traders are still betting that there's a 70 percent chance that the central bank will cut its main interest rate as soon as September, according to data from CME Group.
"The market is really seeing no surprises today and so that's allowing it to modestly drift higher," said Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Treasury yields rose slightly in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 4.29 percent from 4.28 percent late Monday.
The Fed has remained cautious about making a move on interest rates, holding its benchmark interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades as it waits cautiously for more signals that inflation is still cooling.
Most measures of inflation show that it is easing, though at a much slower pace throughout 2024. The rate is hovering around 3 percent and continues exerting pressure on consumers, especially those with lower incomes.
In his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Powell noted that "elevated inflation is not the only risk we face." Cutting rates "too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment," he said.
A strong jobs market and consumer spending have been supporting economic growth, though the pace has slowed. Consumer spending has also been weakening as inflation prompts shifts in priorities for many to necessities over discretionary items. Borrowing costs are also higher because of elevated interest rates, adding more pressure on consumers.
Wall Street is hoping for rate cuts this year that could alleviate some pressure on both consumers and investors. Most experts are expecting one rate cut from the Fed this year, but not until September. The Fed holds its next policy meeting this month.
"If the Fed can't start cutting rates in the next couple months, the economy would be at risk of weakening even further in the short term and that would also push back when we'd expect the economy to re-accelerate," said Dave Sekera, chief U.S. market strategist at Morningstar.
Gains in banks helped outweigh a pullback in industrials, energy and other sectors in the S&P 500 index Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2 percent and Bank of America added 2 percent.
Chipmaker Intel rose another 1.8 percent after Monday's 6.2 percent gain as bullish analysts suggest the company's next processors will be in high demand.
Consumer goods company Helen of Troy, which makes Osprey and OXO products, sank 27.7 percent after posting first-quarter results that fell far short of forecasts.
Stocks have been gaining ground steadily over the last several months and that has helped push the S&P 500 to 36 records so far this year. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.13 points to 5,576.98. The Nasdaq added 25.55 points to close at 18,429.29. The Dow fell 52.82 points to 39,291.97.

U.S. to Plow $1.6 Billion Into Process Of Packaging: [Correction]

Author: Clark, Don

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The proposed funding, part of the CHIPS Act, is intended to stoke chip packaging, a process that helps drive progress in semiconductors but that takes place mostly in Asia.
The Biden administration said on Tuesday that it would direct up to $ 1.6 billion in funding toward developing new technology for packaging computer chips, a major thrust in U.S. efforts to stay ahead of China in creating components needed for applications like artificial intelligence.
The proposed funding, part of the money authorized under the 2022 legislation called the CHIPS Act, will help companies innovate in areas such as creating faster ways to transfer data between chips in a package and managing the heat they generate, said Laurie Locascio, an under secretary in the Commerce Department who is also the director of its National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Her announcement, at an annual industry conference in San Francisco, serves as a starting gun for companies to start applying for grants to fund research and development projects, with awards expected to total up to $ 150 million each.
"Our research and development efforts in advanced packaging will heavily focus on high-demand applications like high-performance computing and low-power electronics, both needed to enable leadership in A.I.," Ms. Locascio said.
The CHIPS Act received bipartisan approval to invest $ 52 billion to stoke domestic chip production, with most of the money directed toward the factories that turn silicon wafers into chips. The U.S. share of that activity has dwindled to around 10 percent, much of it lost to companies in Asia. U.S. reliance on factories run by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or T.S.M.C., in particular, have worried policymakers because of China's territorial claims on Taiwan.
The dependence on foreign companies is even more stark in chip packaging. That process attaches finished chips -- useless without ways to communicate with other pieces of hardware -- onto a flat component called a substrate, which has electrical connectors. The combination is typically wrapped in plastic.
Packaging mainly takes place in Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and China. A global industry group called IPC, citing Defense Department data, has estimated that the U.S. only accounts for about 3 percent of advanced chip packaging.
With most federal funding so far directed toward the early stage of manufacturing, chips produced in new U.S. factories might then be flown to Asia for packaging, which would do little to reduce dependence on foreign companies.
"You can make all the silicon you want here, but if you don't take it to the next step, it doesn't do any good," said Jan Vardaman, president of TechSearch International, a consultancy focusing on chip packaging.
The situation is being compounded by companies increasingly striving for greater computing performance by packaging multiple chips side by side or on top of each other. Nvidia, which dominates sales of chips for A.I., recently announced a product called Blackwell that has two big processor chips surrounded by stacks of memory chips.
T.S.M.C., which fabricates the latest chips for Nvidia, also packages them with advanced technology. T.S.M.C. is slated to receive federal grants for chip production in Arizona, but it hasn't said it will shift any packaging services from Taiwan.
Intel, a Silicon Valley chip maker, is considered a leader in packaging research and has invested heavily to upgrade factories in New Mexico and Arizona as part of broader efforts to compete with T.S.M.C. in manufacturing services. But U.S. companies could use federal money to help stay on the cutting edge, Ms. Vardaman said.
The new grants are part of a plan called the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, which Commerce Department officials said would receive about $ 3 billion in total funding.
"Today's announcement is another important step in the right direction," said Chris Mitchell, IPC vice president of global government relations.
Some industry players aren't waiting for government help. Resonac, a company based in Tokyo, announced on Monday a new consortium with nine other Japanese and U.S. companies to focus on packaging research and development in a new facility that will be built in Union City, Calif.
In an interview, Ms. Locascio of the Commerce Department said the administration this week would also announce its conceptual model for the National Semiconductor Technology Center, a proposed public-private partnership for chip research and development that is expected to include new facilities, which officials in multiple states hope to attract.
"We get a lot of calls daily about that," Ms. Locascio said, adding that the announcement should clarify what kinds of facilities are envisioned and "the process by which people can compete for those."

Chip Plans Transcend U.S. Borders: [Correction]

Full text: The Biden administration is trying to get foreign companies to invest in chip-making in the United States and more countries to set up factories to do final assembly and packaging.
If the Biden administration had its way, far more electronic chips would be made in factories in, say, Texas or Arizona.
They would then be shipped to partner countries, like Costa Rica or Vietnam or Kenya, for final assembly and sent out into the world to run everything from refrigerators to supercomputers.
Those places may not be the first that come to mind when people think of semiconductors. But administration officials are trying to transform the world's chip supply chain and are negotiating intensely to do so.
The core elements of the plan include getting foreign companies to invest in chip-making in the United States and finding other countries to set up factories to finish the work. Officials and researchers in Washington call it part of the new "chip diplomacy."
The Biden administration argues that producing more of the tiny brains of electronic devices in the United States will help make the country more prosperous and secure. President Biden boasted about his efforts in his interview on Friday with ABC News, during which he said he had gotten South Korea to invest billions of dollars in chip-making in the United States.
But a key part of the strategy is unfolding outside America's borders, where the administration is trying to work with partners to ensure that investments in the United States are more durable.
If the nascent effort progresses, it may help the administration meet some of its broad strategic goals. It wants to blunt security concerns involving China, which is growing its chip manufacturing while making threats against Taiwan, a global center of chip technology. And it wants to lower the risks of disruptions to the chip supply chain -- risks that became evident during the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which threw global shipping and manufacturing into turmoil.
"The focus has been to do our best to expand the capacity in a diverse set of countries to make those global supply chains more resilient," said Ramin Toloui, a Stanford professor who recently served as assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, which is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to set up new supply chains.
The administration aims to do that not just for chips, but also for green energy technology such as electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. China is by far the biggest player in those industries.
Mr. Biden and his aides say that dominance by Chinese companies is a national security issue as well as a human rights problem, given that some of the manufacturing takes place in Xinjiang, a region of China where officials force members of some Muslim ethnic groups to work in factories.
Over three years of the Biden administration, the United States has attracted $ 395 billion of investment in semiconductor manufacturing and $ 405 billion for making green technology and generating clean power, Mr. Toloui said.
Many of the companies investing in that kind of manufacturing in the United States are based in Asian countries known for their tech industries -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for instance -- and in Europe. One is SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker that is building a $ 3.8 billion factory in Indiana. The State Department says that the project is the largest-ever investment in that state and that it has the potential to bring more than 1,000 jobs to the region.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken mentioned that project in a speech last month at a conference in Maryland aimed at encouraging foreign investment in the United States. And he underscored how he hoped legislation enacted by Mr. Biden would draw foreign investment to U.S. high-tech manufacturing by "modernizing our roads, our rail, our broadband, our electric grid."
The policy efforts, he added, are aimed at "strengthening and diversifying supply chains, turbocharging domestic manufacturing, spurring key industries of the future, from semiconductors to clean energy."
The Commerce Department has also played a major role in the effort to shore up the chip supply chain and is disbursing $ 50 billion to companies and organizations to research, develop and manufacture chips.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, led an in-depth study of global chip supply chains to identify vulnerabilities and has worked with foreign governments to discuss opportunities for additional investments overseas.
The topic was a focus of Ms. Raimondo's trip to Costa Rica this past spring as she met with local officials and executives from Intel, which runs a factory there. (Mr. Toloui spoke at a semiconductor manufacturing conference in Costa Rica in January.) She also discussed diversifying the semiconductor supply chain on trips to Panama and Thailand.
But reworking global supply chains so that they are less dependent on East Asia will be a challenge. East Asian chip factories offer more cutting-edge technology, a larger pool of talented engineers and lower costs than American factories are projected to.
Taiwan manufactures nearly all of the world's most advanced chips, which are used in computers, AI servers, smartphones and other devices.
By comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of up to 90,000 workers over the next few years, according to several estimates.
Governments in China, Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are also aggressively subsidizing their own chips industries.
Still, billions of dollars of new U.S. investment are expected to somewhat shift global supply chains. The U.S. share of global chip manufacturing is projected to rise to 14 percent by 2032, from 10 percent today, according to a May report from the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.
Some administration officials have engaged in a more coercive form of chip diplomacy to prevent China from developing versions of American technology. That approach has focused on persuading a handful of countries -- Japan and the Netherlands, in particular -- to stop companies from selling some chip-making tools to China.
Alan Estevez, who leads the bureau within the Commerce Department in charge of export controls, visited Japan and the Netherlands last month to try to persuade the countries to block companies there from selling certain advanced technology to China.
By contrast, Mr. Toloui and his aides have flown around the world to scout out countries and companies that might want to invest in the American industry and set up factories that would form the endpoint of the supply chain. Mr. Toloui said his bureau's work was an element of Mr. Biden's recent enactment of legislation to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, including the infrastructure act and the CHIPS and Science Act.
The CHIPS act includes $ 500 million of funding annually for the administration to create secure supply chains and to protect semiconductor technology. The State Department draws on that money to find countries for supply chain development. Officials are organizing studies on a range of countries to see how infrastructure and work forces can be brought up to certain standards to ensure smooth chip assembly, packaging and shipping.
The countries now in the program are Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The U.S. government is bringing in Kenya.
Job training is a priority in this supply chain creation, Mr. Toloui said. He has talked to Arizona State University about being a partner with overseas institutions to develop training programs. One such institution is Vietnam National University in Ho Chi Minh City, which he visited in May.
Martijn Rasser, the managing director of Datenna Inc., a research firm that focuses on China, said this network of alliances was a strategic advantage that the United States has over China.
For the United States to try to do everything itself would be too expensive, he said. And going it alone would not recognize the reality that technology today is much more diffused globally than it was a few decades ago, with various countries playing important roles in the chip supply chain.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I felt as if I were talking with Leon Trotsky in the years before the Russian Revolution.
I was sitting in Steve Bannon's Washington living room in 2019. His stint in Donald Trump's White House had ended ingloriously, but he had resumed his self-appointed role as populism's grand strategist, its propagandist, its bad-boy visionary. He sat there that day sketching out his plans for how MAGA-type movements could take over the world.
By then populists had already racked up some big wins -- Brexit in Britain, Trump's victory in 2016. Right-wing populists were in power in Hungary and Poland, Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party was surging and populists were rising across Latin America. Bannon knew I opposed him in every particular and abhorred much of what he said, but he laid out his grand vision cheerfully, confidently. He didn't seem concerned about old-fashioned conservatives, moderates and classical liberals like me; we were destined for the ash heap of history.
I decided to check in with Bannon again about a week ago. This year, populists have scored yet another string of triumphs, and a second Trump victory is possible or even probable this November. I found Bannon, currently the host of the podcast "War Room," to be embroiled and embattled as usual. He's going to prison on Monday to begin serving a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. If anything, he is more confident than ever.
What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for clarity and length -- and to remove the F-bombs that Bannon dropped with machine gun regularity. I should emphasize that I wasn't trying to debate Bannon or rebut his beliefs; I wanted to understand how he sees the current moment. I wanted to understand the global populist surge from the inside. What he told me now seems doubly terrifying, given Joe Biden's performance at the first presidential debate.
DAVID BROOKS: Since we last spoke, in fact in just the past few months, there have been populist victories in the Netherlands, with Geert Wilders. We have the Chega movement doing well in Portugal, with the young especially. In Germany, the ultraright-wing Alternative for Germany surged in last month's European parliamentary elections. In France, Marine Le Pen's populist party also triumphed in the European election, a result that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call new national elections and throw the entire French political system into meltdown. In the U.K.'s forthcoming national elections, Nigel Farage's Reform Party is on pace to win seats for the first time. So if you're a historian telling the big story of what's happening, what would it be? What's the core narrative here?
STEVE BANNON: Well, I think it's very simple: that the ruling elites of the West lost confidence in themselves. The elites have lost their faith in their countries. They've lost faith in the Westphalian system, the nation-state. They are more and more detached from the lived experience of their people.
On our show "War Room," I probably spend at least 20 percent of our time talking about international elements in our movement. So we've made Nigel a rock star, Giorgia Meloni a rock star. Marine Le Pen is a rock star. Geert is a rock star. We talk about these people all the time.
Do you see yourself in the same business that Fox News's Roger Ailes was in, sort of right-wing journalism?
I'm not a journalist. I'm not in the media. This is a military headquarters for a populist revolt. This is how we motivate people. This show is an activist show. If you watch this show, you're a foot soldier. We call it the Army of the Awakened.
I mean, Murdoch is a bigger enemy of ours than MSNBC. Because he's the epitome of neoliberal neocon. And they're the opiate of the masses. They're the controlled opposition, right? They're never going to want fundamental change. They'll throw some shiny toys -- Obama's a Muslim, the kind of issues which we mock all the time.
Let's get back to the big narrative. Do you think immigration is the core issue here? That seems to be one issue that drives populist support everywhere.
Immigration, spending -- it's the lack of confidence and self-loathing of their own civilization and their own culture. That's the spiritual part that's at the base. Immigration is just the manifestation of a loss of self-confidence. And it's shocking.
I came up in the golden age of Pax Americana, a working-class dad who had a housewife and five kids. All went to Catholic schools. I mean, a guy who was a foreman and then lower-level white-collar management. That's the kind of thing we aspire to have in this country. If you look at it country by country, it's all the same. The lack of jobs, the lack of opportunities, the lack of self-confidence.
What we should be doing is cutting the number of foreign students in American universities by 50 percent immediately, because we're never going to get a Hispanic and Black population in Silicon Valley unless you get them into the engineering schools. No. 2, we should staple an exit visa to their diploma. The foreign students can hang around for a week and party, but then they got to go home and make their own country great.
Our movement is metastasizing to something that's different than America First; it's American Citizens First.
What does that mean?
It means Americans have to get a better deal. Right now, the American citizen has all the obligations of serving in the military, of paying taxes, of going through this grind that is American late-stage technofeudal capitalism. But tell me what the bonus is.
Like everybody, I've been trying to figure out why populism is having this broad resurgence. My story may be a little different from yours. My quick story is that 20 percent of Americans go to nice colleges and get professional-type jobs. They marry each other. They move into cities like Washington, Denver, Austin, San Francisco. They invest in their kids, who get into the same colleges, who then get good jobs. The people who are not in this hereditary educated elite conclude that it has too much cultural power, media power and now financial power, so much of the rest of the country says: Enough is enough.
Well, they have power. But we're going to win. We're ascendant in Europe. We're ascendant here. We've had no money. We're not organized. It's self-organizing. But our enemies -- and they are enemies -- continue to overplay their hand, and so we continue to rise.
After the financial crisis I thought it would be a great time to be a leftist. You've got a financial crisis caused by irresponsible capitalism, wages are stagnant, inequality is rising. Heck, even I almost turned into a Marxist. But somehow this has been a better era for the populist right than the populist left.
You're seeing America First Democrats. Look at John Fetterman. Fetterman and Steve Bannon are closer in their economics than Steve Bannon and the Republican establishment. The left didn't have what it took because of the cultural issues and the issues of race, all that madness that they're embedded in. They had to have open borders. They had to have D.E.I.
The historical left is in full meltdown. They always focus on noise, never on signal. They don't understand that the MAGA movement, as it gets momentum and builds, is moving much farther to the right than President Trump. They will look back fondly at Donald Trump. They'll ask: Where's Trump when we need him?
You said something I've got to ask you about, that Trump's a moderate. In what areas is the MAGA movement farther right than Trump?
I think farther right on radical cuts of spending, No. 1. I think we're much more hard-core on things like Ukraine. President Trump is a peacemaker. He wants to go in and negotiate and figure something out as a dealmaker. I think 75 percent of our movement would want an immediate, total shutdown -- not one more penny in Ukraine, and massive investigations about where the money went. On the southern border and mass deportations, I don't think President Trump's close to where we are. They all got to go home.
Also, on artificial intelligence, we're virulently anti-A.I. I think big regulations have to come.
President Trump is a kindhearted person. He's a people person, right? On China, I think he admires Xi Jinping. But we're super-hawks. We want to see an elimination of the Chinese Communist Party.
What do you think a second Trump administration would look like in the first few weeks? Months?
Project 2025 and others are working on it -- to immediately focus on immigration, the forever wars and on the fiscal and the financial. And simultaneously the deconstruction of the administrative state, and going after the complete, total destruction of the deep state.
In the first 100 days -- this is going to be different than '16 -- we will have 3,000 political appointees ready to go.
Have those people been selected and trained? When Trump came in, in '17, you guys had a lot of the Republican holdovers --
We had nothing. You have five or six groups that are building up subject matter expertise, laying out position papers. They're vetting people right now.
So you're going to go to war with the existing administrative state and the Praetorian Guard deep state. My point is, let's, in the transition, get all the federal contracts. Close them all down. Let's get MAGA in there. Right. Let's get our guys in on the contracts. It'll be a hostile takeover of the apparatus.
Who's the inner circle? Who is the chief of staff?
I think you're going to have somebody that knows what's going on. Guys like Dr. Kevin Roberts and others. Also, I strongly believe that right after The Associated Press calls the election that Jerome Powell will tender his resignation. And so you'll pick a new Federal Reserve chief. And you'll pick a Treasury secretary and attorney general.
Would you like to have some role?
No, no, no, no. We run this like a military command post. So I would only be giving up power. I went there before. I wanted out. I'm not a staff guy. I can't do it. And also that's not where the center of power is. It's not how President Trump thinks. A big center of power is just media.
I call Trump a Marshall McLuhanesque figure. McLuhan called it, right? He says this mass thing called media, or what Pierre Teilhard de Chardin said of the noosphere, is going to so overwhelm evolutionary biology that it will be everything. And Trump understands that. That's why he watches TV.
He understands that to get anything done, you have to make the people understand. And so therefore, constantly, we're in a battle of narrative. Unrestricted narrative warfare. Everything is narrative. And in that regard, you have to make sure you forget about the noise and focus on the signal.
And remember, our audience is virtually all activists. So even though it may not be the biggest, it doesn't have to be. It's the people that are out there in the hinterland that are on the school boards. They now control so many state parties. Our mantra is you must use your agency. It's a spiritual war. The divine providence works through your agency.
I remember a precinct captain strategy: You called on people to get active on that level to monitor elections and gain control of the G.O.P. from the ground up.
The Republican Party is structured as basically a grass-roots party. But they've never filled the precincts. And that's where we fill them, just with our guys. That's how we control all these political parties, from Utah to Arizona to Georgia. Governor Brian Kemp doesn't control that. It's all controlled by the grass roots.
The Republican establishment never was interested?
No, hated it. Not just not interested. The Republican establishment is all guys in blue blazers and khakis going to the club. These are the unclubbable people.
And think about what this movement did. It did three things that have never been done before, with no money. It removed a sitting speaker of the House for the first time in history. It removed the minority leader, who I would argue is the most powerful Republican you've had in 50 years, Mitch McConnell. And then we removed the entire R.N.C. Think about it. Ronna McDaniel and all her people.
These guys are never going home unless you beat them.
Victory begets victory.
Do you know the demographics of these activists? Education? Race? Income?
First off, I would say 60 percent female. Female and over 40 years old. A lot of that, a third of them brought in by the pandemic, and the Moms for America. A ton of moms, women who didn't read a lot of books in college. They're not politically active. They had no interest. It was only later in life, as they became the C.O.O. of the American family, they realized how tough it was to make ends meet.
And then they saw the lack of education, and it was really the pandemic when they walked by the computer and saw what the kids are doing. They're now at the tip of the spear.
Do you worry that your broader movement will be fatally poisoned by antisemitic elements, the conspiracy crazies?
We're the most pro-Israel and pro-Jewish group out there. What I say is that not just the future of Israel but the future of American Jews, not just safety but their ability to thrive and prosper as they have in this country, is conditional upon one thing, and that's a hard weld with Christian nationalism.
If I can make one comparison: Early in my career, I worked for Bill Buckley. His manner at National Review reminds me a little of some of the things you do. He created an intense sense of belonging: We're the conservative movement. We're all in this together. Every day we're marching forward. But he also had a strong sense of who was a wack job, a conspiracist. And he was going to draw a line. Pat Buchanan was on the other side of the line.
So what I admire about Buckley is obviously the intense thing of belonging. What I don't admire is the no-fight. It's very much an intellectual debating society, right?
I use you and George Will as examples of this all the time. Brilliant guys, but this is a street fight. We need to be street fighters. This is going to be determined on social media and getting people out to vote. It's not going to be debated on the Upper East Side or Upper West Side.
I've found that most people are pretty reasonable. You can have a conversation, and you'll at least see where they're coming from.
I think you're dead [expletive] wrong.
That's where we disagree.
No, it's 100 percent disagree. What are you talking about? They think you're an exotic animal. You're a conservative, but you're not dangerous. You're reasonable. We're not reasonable. We're unreasonable because we're fighting for a republic. And we're never going to be reasonable until we get what we achieve. We're not looking to compromise. We're looking to win.
Now, the biggest element that Buckley had that the book "Bowling Alone" had, and you talk about, is the atomization of our society. There's no civic bonding. There's no national cohesion. There's not even the Lions Club things that you used to have before. People tell me all the time: "You changed my life. I ran for the board of supervisors, and now I'm on the board of supervisors." They have friends that they never had met before, and they're in a common cause, and it's changed their life. They're on social media. Every day, they have action they have to do.
This was Hannah Arendt's point that loneliness is a seedbed for authoritarianism. But you're not about conversing with the other side, you're just fighting with the other side.
What do you mean, not conversing with? There's nothing to talk about.
Well, how about you have a conversation with the Biden administration. The Biden administration has spent a lot of money. And now, when I go to central Ohio, they've got an Intel plant coming in. You go to upstate New York, they've got a Micron plant. These are benefits for the working class.
Some of that stuff's OK. But on the fundamental direction of the country, we are separate. We are two different worldviews. And those worldviews can't be bridged.
That's not the way George Washington communicated. It's certainly not the way Abraham Lincoln communicated. I mean, I know that's cliché, but go to the second inaugural. Slavery is not a North or South problem; it's an American problem. He was emphasizing national unity.
Hang on, hang on, hang on. After he had burnt -- good god, man, I can't believe you used that example. After he burned the South to the ground --
They declared war.
In fact, let's go back to the speech. He actually leads, what led up to it, and then that powerful phrase, "the war came." Basically, we tried to compromise. "The war came." Columbia, Atlanta. I burned it to the ground. The inherent powers of the Constitution. He was a military dictator because he had to be, right?
Don't sit there and say, oh, that's all happy-talk language at the end. Remember, in war, take the moral high ground, totally and completely destroy your opponent.
What does that mean, though? If they have 50 percent of the country, then they have 50 percent of the Congress.
Well, let's say this. We win, we pick up five or six seats -- we have 55 seats in the Senate. We pick up five or six seats in the House, and we have the executive branch. And this time, we have much more savvy and understanding.
What does the Justice Department look like? What kinds of changes would Trump make?
I think they'll hit it with a blowtorch.
When did you come to see the world this way? I mean, obviously, you were at Harvard Business School and Goldman Sachs. Did you have a front-row seat and think, "Oh, this sucks"?
I took Michael Porter's classes at Harvard back in the '80s, and globalization was -- Harvard, at that time, treated this as the second law of thermodynamics. It was a natural property that could not be questioned. And then I went to the M&A department at Goldman Sachs and I worked with Hank Paulson. I was put on a lot of things to sell companies. You could just see America was being gutted. You had Mike Milken and the junk bond guys, and they were after these companies. And you go out there, and the companies were not particularly well run.
The guys were always going to the country club, and the management was very detached from labor -- you see this evisceration, you saw these jobs going, and they were never coming back.
And then I read Christopher Lasch. I was just doing my thing, had my own finance firm. And then 9/11 happens. And everybody's down singing "God Bless America." And I said, "I wonder how long this 'God Bless America' phase is going to go." I was adamantly opposed to Iraq and Afghanistan. And one of the things that got me the most was I couldn't believe that George W. Bush didn't have his daughters go into the military. How do you do this? I remember reading guys saying we could have much better recruiting if we had those two as symbols.
We're so removed from that kind of Middle America. And my daughter then went to West Point. And when I went up to West Point when she was there, I was blown away by how working-class West Point was -- the students. This is the heart of the country. And these kids are going right into this war.
But then, it was 2008 when the collapse hit. I mean, for my dad, AT&T stock was right next to the Catholic Church. In fact, it would be like having shares in the Catholic Church. And when Jim Cramer came on that day and said, If you need cash in the next five years, you got to dump. This thing's over. And when my dad notified me a couple of days later he had dumped his AT&T stock, I go, wow.
I said, this is a guy. He has been a systems player the entire time, right? Telephone company, 50 years, the little guy. You can work your whole life and get [expletive] by this. And who's responsible?
We have a capitalist economy that has no capitalists, right? It has hypercapitalists or state capitalism. You've got to not just reallocate income, you have to reallocate assets. People have to have a stake in this. That's all they're asking for.
The MAGA movement controls the Republican Party and backs President Trump. So yes, Trump is a revolution -- remember, General Washington, the revolution and the foundation, and then Lincoln, the birth of the new America. And he's the most nationalist guy we've ever had. Remember, fighting the Civil War as a warlord, to make sure that we were a nation. Remember, he's a nationalist.
I hate to say this, but Trump's the third. Trump is taking America back to its more constitutional Republic for the third time, and that drives the credentialed left nuts because he's not just a class traitor, he's a low-end guy from Queens. He's not up to their social -- it's too tacky. It's the gold. It's the Trump stuff. They hate him. They hate him to a passionate level. They look at the noise around Trump and miss the signal of what's really happening, and they can't get past that, and they're blinded by it.
Finally, I've got to ask you about what's about to happen to you -- going to prison.
I spent my 20s on a Navy ship. If I have to spend my 70s in a prison, I'm still fighting. This show will be bigger. My message will be stronger.
You're not concerned?
No. I'll get the message out and fight for this. History is a process. I'm kind of honored, in one way, that they hate me so much they feel they have to put Bannon away. Their thing is that if we put Bannon in prison or get him away from his microphone, that'll help us win. It will be the exact opposite.
Every day is a fight. People in this movement, when they talk to me, they say they have a purpose. Once they have a purpose, you can't stop this movement. We're not going to win everything. Just like in Europe, you're going to have defeats. Some days are going to be cloudy. But the sunlit uplands are in front of you. Just keep your head down and keep grinding.

Full text: Old Bay waffle fries, loaded nachos or a Nathan's hot dog on the Coney Island boardwalk will go nicely.
Merry heat wave! I'm back filling in and I'll be writing more of this newsletter, alternating with our beloved Nikita through the summer.
On that subject, New York summers ... can feel like a drag. Maybe I'm actually the drag -- or I just need to move to Los Angeles (kidding!) -- but when it's above 85 degrees, the normal schlepping and commuting can feel torturous. The salve: drinking a beverage that feels like vacation. You know exactly where I'm going with this: boozy, brain-freezy drinks.
Here are a few of my favorites, and, because this is a food newsletter, what you should eat alongside them.
Once you're done here, take a look at the New York Times Food staff's picks for 22 of the best pizza spots across the country, showcasing pizza's many exciting new forms. Let us know what your favorite pizza place is, and after that, you can read Brett Anderson on America's storied pizza history.
Bright and boozy, plus a burger
If you're not interested in this intel because your experience with frozen drinks is getting hungover from cloying, one-note cocktails, please know that I despise frozen drinks that are even slightly syrupy-sweet. I would never direct you to one of those.
I've spent the better part of a decade yapping about the frozen drinks at Mother's Ruin, my local all-occasions bar in NoLIta (it exists in that liminal space between a dive and a cocktail bar). The contents of their slushy cocktails, which spin in a refrigerator-size frozen drink machine named Kathleen Turner, change pretty often. Currently called the Squalor Squad, the drink is a pinkish, miraculously balanced combination of rum, Campari, coconut, blueberry and citrus. And after a couple of those, you'll be primed for a great, secret-sauced and pickle-heavy bar burger and waffle fries dusted in Old Bay.

Did I think I'd enjoy a frozen margarita from a Coney Island counter called Margarita Island? No, I really didn't. But consider this is my formal apology to Margarita Island, a delightfully shabby, distinctly Coney Island-y bar right next to Luna Park, where the view is directly of the Wonder Wheel. The classic frozen margarita is tart, creamy and stronger than it tastes, all hallmarks of a delightful frozen drink.
I'm not sure if this is legal, but because Coney feels like a lawless place: Take your margarita to the boardwalk a block away and drink it with a Nathan's hot dog, or fried fish from Tom's, to reach the Summer Behavior Zenith.

'That green drink'
Florida-core bar the Commodore in Williamsburg, where striped lawn chairs litter the sidewalk and they put cocktail umbrellas on the burgers, is far from a hidden gem. Their frozen mojito, though, remains criminally underrated. Everyone goes for their namesake drink, basically a frozen piña colada, but they sleep on what I call "that green drink."
They're made to order in a blender behind the bar with so much fresh mint that the result is basically a mint-and-lime slushie with some rum sneaked in there. It's served in a hurricane glass with, yes, a cocktail umbrella, as is the will of the summer gods. To order the hot chicken sandwich is human, but to order the Cadillac nachos is divine. The nachos are at their best when they come heavy on the cilantro, scallions and sliced radishes, and Southerners in New York will understand how valuable it is to find white queso in this town.

Straight-up fruit slush from the deli
Maybe you don't want a cocktail. I don't know your life! One of the greatest treats downtown has to offer is at a bodega: the fruit slush at A&N Fruit Store, in the Lower East Side. You pick a type of frozen fruit, they blend it up with water and ice, and serve it in a deli quart container with an extra wide straw. The strawberry and lime slush is best enjoyed sitting outside on the wood palettes seemingly designed for loitering, or on a walk to Regina's Grocery for a sunny sandwich.

Nvidia Zips To Top Spot On Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chip maker's stock price has jumped over the last year thanks to its stranglehold on the market for the chips needed to build A.I. systems.
Move over, Microsoft and Apple. The stock market has a new king.
On Tuesday, Nvidia leapfrogged two of tech's most storied names to become the world's most valuable public company, according to data from S&P Global. Its ascent has been powered by the boom in generative artificial intelligence and surging demand for the company's chips -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- which have made it possible to create A.I. systems.
Nvidia's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was a little over $ 400 billion. Now, in the span of a year, it has gone from $ 1 trillion to more than $ 3 trillion.
On Tuesday, Nvidia's share price rose 3.6 percent, lifting its value to $ 3.34 trillion. Microsoft and Apple both fell, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chip maker.
Nvidia's ascent is a testament to how much artificial intelligence has upended the world's biggest companies. The rise of the powerful technology first elevated Microsoft to the biggest market capitalization in January, dethroning Apple, before pushing Nvidia to take the crown. Last week, Apple said it, too, was getting into the A.I. game and will add the technology to its products, including the iPhone, this fall.
Years before other big chip companies, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, bet that GPUs would be essential to building artificial intelligence, and he tailored his company to accommodate what he believed would be tech's next big boom.
His big bet is paying off. By some measurements, Nvidia controls more than 80 percent of the market for the chips used in A.I. systems. Nvidia's biggest customers regularly jockey for orders for chips to run computers in their giant data centers, and are building their own A.I. chips so they are not so dependent on one supplier.
"No one else fully saw or appreciated this," said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. "They saw the trend, built for the trend and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want."
Nvidia's ascent has made Mr. Huang, 61, a celebrity in the tech world. After a computer conference in Taiwan early this month, he was surrounded by attendees who wanted his autograph, including a woman who asked him to sign her chest.
The company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the equipment that ran communications networks for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousandfold between its initial public offering in 1990 and 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.
The speed at which Nvidia's value has grown has been startling. Apple crossed $ 1 trillion in August 2018 and became the first $ 3 trillion company last June. Microsoft also took nearly five years to climb from $ 1 trillion to $ 3 trillion.
Nvidia's investors are betting more on its potential than on its current profits. Microsoft and Apple each generated more than $ 21 billion in profit during the three months that ended in March. Nvidia generated $ 14.88 billion in profit in its most recent quarter, which ended in April, but that was up more than 600 percent from a year earlier.
"The numbers have gotten so big so quickly that people worry: Is this sustainable?" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. "If the return on A.I. turns out to not be there, then the whole thing comes crumbling down."
Just 12 companies have led the S&P 500 by market valuation since the index was created in 1926: AT&T, Apple, Cisco, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Walmart and now Nvidia, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Nvidia's rise has been fueled by its ability to consistently exceed Wall Street expectations. Sales in its last quarter tripled from a year earlier to $ 26 billion. It also projected that it would double sales in the current quarter.
Nvidia sells everything from chips, and the software needed to build A.I. systems with those chips, to supercomputers. The machines, which have 35,000 parts and are packed with the company's GPUs, sell for $ 250,000 or more. A new supercomputer that Nvidia is bringing to the market could sell for more than $ 1 million, Mr. Rasgon said.
"Even though the cost of the system is going up, the performance per dollar is getting better with every generation, and that's how they're able to keep customers buying," Mr. Rasgon said.
Wall Street has been watching for signs of a slowdown. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon have all developed their own chips that can be used for A.I., and traditional chip rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have tried to cut into Nvidia's business with their own A.I. processors.
But Mr. Huang believes that it will take time for anyone to catch up to Nvidia. The company has a decade head start and has cultivated a large community of A.I. programmers who prefer its technology.
"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do," Mr. Huang said in a conference call with analysts in May. "The next industrial revolution has begun."

As Samsung Struggles on Chips, Its Workers Stage a Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The South Korean tech giant is at odds with some of its employees as it is trying to reassure investors that its memory chip business can meet demand.
For the first time, workers at Samsung, the conglomerate that dominates the South Korean economy, went on strike on Friday.
The action comes as Samsung Electronics fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in the advanced artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping longstanding rivalries among global technology companies.
Workers in Samsung's chip division were expected to make up the majority of those who will not report to work on Friday for a planned one-day strike. Union representatives said that multiple rounds of negotiations over wage increases and bonuses had broken down.
"The company doesn't value the union as a negotiating partner," said Lee Hyun Kuk, the vice president of the Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union, the largest among five labor groups at the company. It says that it represents 28,000 members, about one-fifth of Samsung's global work force, and that nearly 75 percent voted in favor of a strike in April.
Mr. Lee said that union workers received no bonuses last year, while some had gotten bonuses of as much as 30 percent of their salaries in the past. "It feels like we've taken a 30 percent pay cut," he said. The average union worker earned about 80 million won last year, or around $ 60,000, before incentives, he said.
A Samsung Electronics representative said the company was trying to reach an agreement with the union but declined to comment further on the details of the negotiations.
The work stoppage had not affected Samsung's production or business activities, the company representative said. It was timed to fall between a national holiday and the weekend, on a day that many people in South Korea planned to take as vacation. It was not clear how many workers participated in the action. A small group of workers gathered in front of Samsung's headquarters in Seoul on Friday morning while organizers played protest songs over loudspeakers.
Still, it was awkward timing for the company, which has been trying to reassure clients and investors that its chip business can meet the demands of the artificial intelligence boom.
"Samsung has been a highly respected company in the memory semiconductor sector, they've been the leader for decades. But they lost the technology leadership to competitors," said Nam Hyung Kim, an analyst at the equity research firm Arete Research. "The union strike is nothing compared to a lot of the issues they are facing at this point," Mr. Kim said.
While so-called logic chips make computers run, memory chips let them store information. They are in everything from smartphones to refrigerators. Advanced computers use many of both types of chips, and generative artificial intelligence systems rely on extra-strength, high-bandwidth memory chips to create text, images and other kinds of content on demand.
Samsung has been the world's largest maker of memory chips for years, and reported about $ 1.4 billion in profit from its chip division in the first quarter of this year.
But that followed four straight quarters of losses. Samsung ended last year with its weakest earnings in more than a decade.
Despite the losses, Samsung remained the world's biggest memory chip maker by revenue and market share last year, according to TrendForce, a market research firm. But heading into the year, its local rival, SK Hynix, claimed the top spot in the market for the next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips just as demand for them took off. Companies developing artificial intelligence systems like Nvidia scrambled to buy them. Analysts say that SK Hynix anticipated this demand earlier than Samsung did. Samsung's foundry business, which makes chips designed by other companies, also lags behind rivals.
The result was the largest shortfall in the company's history, according to remarks Jun Young-hyun made to his colleagues when he took over the leadership of Samsung's chip division last month after an executive shake-up.
Mr. Jun previously led Samsung's chip business when it overtook Intel as the world's largest chip maker by revenue. And he ran its battery arm after the company discontinued a line of smartphones after several had spontaneously exploded.
A representative from Samsung said the company expected to increase its output of high-bandwidth memory products threefold over last year, and to double that again in 2025. The company said that it planned to invest about $ 200 billion by 2042 in a new semiconductor industrial complex south of Seoul that was being developed by the government, and that it planned to spend $ 40 billion on facilities in Texas.
This time, Mr. Jun's quest for a comeback comes as Samsung tries to move on from years of uncertainty while its top executive, Lee Jae-yong, was ensnared in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye.
Mr. Lee, South Korea's wealthiest person, according to Bloomberg News, is a scion of the family that founded Samsung, the largest of the family-run conglomerates known as chaebol that have transformed South Korea into an export superpower and influence nearly every facet of society.
In February, he was acquitted of additional charges related to a merger that helped him secure control over the company. Mr. Lee's legal trouble has kept Samsung's influence over South Korea's economy and politics in the spotlight.
Samsung was founded in 1938 by Mr. Lee's grandfather Lee Byung-chul as a shop selling vegetables and dried fish. It quickly expanded and set up Samsung Electronics in 1969 to manufacture televisions and refrigerators and, soon after, semiconductors.
Labor strikes in South Korea are not uncommon. Since February, over 10,000 young doctors walked off the job in protest of government plans to increase the number of admitted medical students. Last spring thousands of construction workers rallied over discontent with the president's labor policies.
For decades, Samsung was known for its aversion to organized labor, and unions have organized workers at the company only in the last several years.
Mr. Lee, the union representative, said that some employees had expressed fear about joining the union.
"Our goal on Friday isn't to affect the production line, but rather to send a message to the management that we have reached a certain level of maturation," Mr. Lee said.
After the vote in April, the union held multiple rallies. In a bid to appeal to the public for support, it planned the events to feel like a street festival and arranged for K-pop singers to entertain the crowd.
Since last week, when the union announced the strike day, a bus draped with a banner bearing the union's protest slogan -- "Labor oppression, union oppression, we won't take it anymore!" -- has been parked in front of Samsung's offices near Seoul's fashionable Gangnam district.
Workers agreed to collectively take the day off and then return to work but are prepared to take additional days in the future if they cannot come to an agreement with the company, Mr. Lee said.

Johnson Names 2 Trump Allies to Intelligence Panel, Raising Concerns: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Both Representatives Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Ronny Jackson of Texas are close allies of the former president who have faced legal and ethical issues.
Speaker Mike Johnson has appointed two outspoken hard-right allies of former President Donald J. Trump with major ethical and legal issues to the House Intelligence Committee, prompting criticism from members of both parties.
Mr. Johnson on Wednesday installed Representatives Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the former chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, and Ronny Jackson of Texas, Mr. Trump's former White House doctor, on the panel. Mr. Perry played a major role in Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and has faced legal issues over his actions. Mr. Jackson was demoted by the Pentagon amid allegations that he mistreated subordinates, sexually harassed a woman and drank and took sleeping pills while serving as the White House physician.
The decision came as a surprise to Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio and the committee's chairman, and Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the panel, who found out about it from news reports, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke without authorization to comment publicly.
The panel has historically operated in a bipartisan manner, and is largely composed of serious-minded lawmakers rather than strident partisans. The break with tradition prompted fears that the intelligence community might pull back on the sensitive national security information it shares with Congress.
The appointments also sparked outrage from Democrats and mainstream Republicans, given the ethical and legal issues in which both men have been embroiled. Punchbowl News reported on Thursday that Mr. Johnson had made the appointments at the behest of Mr. Trump.
A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said the speaker had the "utmost confidence in Congressmen Perry and Jackson to capably serve the American people on the Intelligence Committee."
Former Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois and a former Air Force pilot, called the move "insane."
Representative Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey and a former Navy helicopter pilot, wrote on social media that Mr. Johnson was "putting his MAGA agenda ahead of our national security -- at Donald Trump's direction."
She added: "I have serious concerns about Reps. Perry & Jackson serving on the Intel Committee, considering their efforts to overturn free & fair elections, incite an insurrection, and their reckless actions on the job. They'll weaponize the Intel Committee to support Trump's agenda."
Mr. Perry was among those who led the effort in Congress to overturn the results of the 2020 election on Mr. Trump's behalf. In the weeks after Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory, Mr. Perry was among at least 11 Republican members of Congress involved in discussions with Trump administration officials about reversing the results. Those included plans to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to throw out electoral votes from states won by Mr. Biden.
Mr. Perry also endorsed the idea of encouraging supporters to march to the Capitol, according to the House committee that investigated the attack of Jan. 6, 2021. And he played an active role in the attempt to replace Jeffrey A. Rosen as acting attorney general with a more compliant official, Jeffrey Clark, willing to back Mr. Trump's bid to stay in power.
The F.B.I. seized Mr. Perry's personal cellphone in the summer of 2022 and created a forensic copy of its contents, but told Mr. Perry he was not the target of the investigation, his lawyer said at the time.
In a statement, Mr. Perry thanked Mr. Johnson for selecting him for the panel, and promised he would serve as a check on the intelligence community.
"I look forward to providing not only a fresh perspective, but conducting actual oversight -- not blind obedience to some facets of our intel community that all too often abuse their powers, resources, and authority to spy on the American people," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Jackson has stayed in close contact with Mr. Trump after serving as his White House physician, when he famously praised the then-president's "excellent health" and "incredible genes." Mr. Trump nominated him in 2018 to be secretary of veterans affairs, but Mr. Jackson was forced to step aside amid the allegations of professional misconduct that ultimately led to his military demotion.
Mr. Trump then backed Mr. Jackson in a successful run for Congress. A little over one year after he took office, congressional ethics investigators accused Mr. Jackson of improperly using campaign donations to pay for unlimited access for himself and his wife to a private dining club in Amarillo, Texas. (The Ethics Committee has taken no public action on that complaint in more than two years.)
Mr. Jackson has quietly lobbied for the position on the intelligence committee for years. He voted in favor of reauthorizing key provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a stance favored by members of the panel but fiercely opposed by many on the far right, including Mr. Perry.
"Far too many bad actors around the world want to see America's national security and status on the world stage destroyed, and it is critical that our intelligence community counters these efforts and keeps our country safe," Mr. Jackson said in a statement. "Working alongside Chairman Turner, I believe we will be able to restore the American people's complete faith in our intelligence community."
Mr. Perry and Mr. Jackson will replace former Representatives Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Chris Stewart of Utah, both mainstream Republican lawmakers who joined a wave of resignations from Congress during a uniquely chaotic and unproductive session.
Mr. Turner and Mr. Himes have worked to bring a bipartisan, serious reputation back to the panel, which Republicans contended had become politicized in previous years by its pursuit of the first impeachment of Mr. Trump. The two men have often made joint news appearances.
Given the new appointment, some on the panel expressed concern privately on Thursday that officials in the intelligence community would narrow the scope of sensitive information they share with Congress in the future.

Why India Is the New Darling of Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stock markets in Mumbai have surged as big global investors hope India can become a source of growth. It won't be so easy.
Mumbai, India's financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff.
A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India's stock market to about $ 5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong's. India's economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can't ignore India anymore.
The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways.
Mumbai has been India's commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years.
Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India's growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India's rise is inevitable.
Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies' current profits, their stock prices are high.
Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai's markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious.
Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India's potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations -- the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom.
The simple reason for investors' enthusiasm is India's economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, "gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it's showing fiscal discipline." He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government.
If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China's miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies.
That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India.
The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India's weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China's representation. It's not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets.
Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China's. India's markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said.
"You can't think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities," Mr. Agarwal said. "India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S."
The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India's internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year.
India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more.
With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world's most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India's economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent.
On Friday, on the eve of the election's last day, India's central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent.
Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China's rate of economic growth.
Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China's per-capita income quadrupled while India's grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world.
The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can.
Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi's policies in 10 years in office.
In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 -- it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city's center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland's insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity group, for a reported $ 300 million in 2019.
Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India's own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives -- investment securities tied to other securities -- that the regulators want to rein them back in.
A stiffer test for India's economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment -- the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies.
Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America.
"I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational," she said, "and I'm based in India. All this sends a message."
More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise.
"We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology," she said.
Ms. Rai has a lofty target -- $ 100 billion in foreign direct investment. That's higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $ 28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence.
Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India's economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of "these investors that we're trying to draw in."

Wall Street Lands on India, Looking for Profits It Can’t Find in China

MUMBAI, India — Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff.
A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India’s stock market to about $5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong’s. India’s economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can’t ignore India anymore.
The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its art deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways.
Mumbai has been India’s commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years.
Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India’s growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India’s rise is inevitable.
Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies’ current profits, their stock prices are high.
Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai’s markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for reelection. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious.
Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India’s potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations — the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom.
The simple reason for investors’ enthusiasm is India’s economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, “gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it’s showing fiscal discipline.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government.
If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China’s miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies.
That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India.
The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India’s weighting to more than 18%, from 8% in 2020, while reducing China’s representation. It’s not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets.
Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China’s. India’s markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said.
“You can’t think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities,” Agarwal said. “India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S.”
The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, California. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets.

Ties Binding the U.S. and China Are Strong, but Fraying: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The prospects for future commerce, and peace, are intertwined, our columnist writes.
If you follow the news, you know that tensions between the United States and China are high and that the commercial relationship between the two biggest trading nations on the planet has been fraying.
Yet, amid the ominous headlines about a possible "decoupling" of the United States and China, you may be surprised by how strong and binding their financial ties remain.
Many big U.S. companies depend on China for a substantial part of their income and rely on Chinese suppliers and factories for their products. The two economies are closely linked, and, as an old China hand, I think that's a good thing. It implies that even if relations deteriorate further, the countries have many incentives for pulling back from the brink of serious conflict.
Consider that while the publicly traded U.S. companies in the S&P 500 obtain almost 60 percent of their revenue domestically, the biggest source of their foreign sales is China. That's according to estimates from the financial data company FactSet, which said sales from China amounted to 7.1 percent of S&P 500 revenues for the 12 months through December. The second-largest foreign source was Japan, with 2.6 percent; followed by Germany and Britain, with 2.2 percent each; and then Taiwan, with 1.8 percent.
Numbers like these are critical in assessing U.S.-China relations, Dale Copeland, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said in an interview. "Expectations of future profits are a key and often neglected factor in international relations," he said. Mr. Copeland is the author of "A World Safe for Commerce: American Foreign Policy From the Revolution to the Rise of China."
"History shows that when a major power cuts off business and resources abruptly -- so that prospects for future commerce look dim -- the possibility of war becomes much greater," he added. "Fortunately, that hasn't happened so far with the United States and China. Greater conflict, even war -- aren't inevitable. There are still plenty of opportunities for future business and, I think, that is, and should be, a deliberate part of current U.S. policy."
The Case Against China
Corporate earnings provide only one perspective on a complex issue. But they are eye-opening because they seem to fly in the face of the drumroll of conflicts and restrictions between the United States and China.
From tariffs to technology bans to concerns about TikTok, the Biden administration has been cracking down on China, which, it says, is abusing longstanding commercial relationships, subsidizing local industries directly and indirectly, obtaining U.S. intellectual property illicitly and fundamentally threatening U.S. national security. U.S. intelligence estimated that China had "the capability to directly compete with the United States and U.S. allies" and, if unopposed, could "alter the rules-based global order" in its favor.
It's an election year in the United States and the country's new China policies build on a shift that began during the Trump administration. Donald J. Trump's advisers now say that if he is re-elected, he will aim for a full "decoupling" from China, though he has been inconsistent: He recently questioned the need to require the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell the app or shut it down in the United States, but as president, he tried to force a sale.
China's reaction to recent U.S. measures has been muted. But some further response is more likely if the United States keeps pushing for an allied commercial front that aims to prevent Chinese factories from exporting torrents of low-cost goods like electric vehicles, solar panels and steel that could hurt local industries and cause domestic dislocations in many countries.
Porous Barriers
The steepest targeted tariffs -- like the new 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles -- are on goods that aren't being imported in large volumes into the United States. That means that President Biden's new tariffs wouldn't change the overall picture much, an analysis by Oxford Economics, an independent research firm, suggested.
The trade-weighted average U.S. tariff on goods from all nations was just "1.6 percent before the Trump trade wars and it rose to as much as 3.1 percent," Ryan Sweet, the chief U.S. economist at the firm, said in an email. Before Mr. Biden's latest tariffs, the average U.S. tariff was 2.7 percent, he said, and the new tariffs would "permanently add 0.14 percent to the effective tariff rate."
But the effective tariff will drop below 2.3 percent over the next decade, he projected, as businesses figure out ways of avoiding "the Trump/Biden tariff hikes." That assumes the tariff wars don't worsen.
To put that into perspective, the World Bank calculated that the worldwide average tariff was 2.6 percent in 2017, before the U.S.-China conflict began. So the United States is still not a global outlier, even if it is no longer reducing trade barriers and lowering costs for consumers. At this point, as U.S. corporate earnings reports show, there are still vast opportunities for profitable commerce between the two countries.
The Chip Wars
What I find striking is that even companies that design, manufacture and create tools for advanced silicon chips continue to receive substantial revenues from China.
Recall that in 2022, the United States began to impose export controls on such companies from countries that used U.S. technology, restricting their sales to China. At the same time, with the Chips Act, the United States began subsidizing construction of domestic semiconductor foundries, effectively replicating parallel efforts that China had begun earlier.
I spoke with Chris Miller, a historian at the Fletcher School at Tufts University who wrote "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
U.S. restrictions are calibrated so that even some advanced chips are being shipped to China, he said. "It's the chips that are critical for A.I. that the U.S. is really targeting. Others are getting through."
Nvidia, the foremost designer of the chips that make artificial intelligence possible, is prohibited from shipping its most advanced products to China. That has dented its business there. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, said in an earnings call this past week that Nvidia's business in China had declined "because of the limitations on our technology." For 2023, FactSet estimated that China was Nvidia's third-biggest market, with 16.6 percent of its total sales, behind only the United States, with 44.3 percent, and Taiwan, with 22 percent.
In fact, all of the semiconductor companies I looked at -- Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Lam Research, KLA and Tokyo Electronics -- received substantial revenue from China in 2023. China was among the companies' top three markets, and, in most cases, ranked No. 1. Intel, for example, received 26.8 percent of its revenue from China.
The case of ASML, a Dutch company, is instructive. The company makes lithography machines that are needed to etch circuits for the smallest and most cutting-edge chips. Roger Dassen, the company's chief financial officer, said in an earnings call in April that the U.S. ban could eliminate 10 to 15 percent of its China sales.
Nonetheless, he said, "We're still looking at a strong sales level for China for this year." FactSet estimated that ASML received 25.8 percent of its revenues from China in 2023. Revenue from the United States was only 11.4 percent.
Consider Apple. It's not just that China accounted for 17.8 percent of the company's revenue in 2023, second only to the United States. It's that Apple routinely ships large quantities of tiny, advanced, state-of-the-art semiconductors in and out of China. "The regulations were written to allow this to happen," Mr. Miller said.
The iPhone 15 in my pocket contains a four-nanometer chip designed by Apple in California, made in Taiwan, shipped to China for assembly and then shipped back to consumers like me in New York. The iPhone 15 Pro already uses three-nanometer chips, and Apple is preparing to incorporate even more advanced two-nanometer chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. All this technology is beyond China's commercial capability. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
This past week, China conducted military exercises in the waters around Taiwan, issuing a "stern warning" against moves toward the island's independence. China was also demonstrating that it could cut off access to the advanced silicon chips that have become the jet fuel for the world's stock markets.
The peak of globalization may have passed, but peaks come and go. Long-term trends are what matter.
It's in everyone's interest that the United States and China coexist peacefully. In their search for profit, the world's businesses are still finding ways to make that happen.

Full text: How the United States backed kidnapping, torture and murder in Afghanistan.
The convoy rumbled into the Taliban heartland, a white desert littered with stones. Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here.
Dozens assembled in the mud square to listen as Abdul Raziq, one of America's most important partners in the war against the Taliban, stood before the crowd, gesturing at two prisoners he had brought along to make his point.
The prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said.
"You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban," Raziq said after the killings, which took place in the winter of 2010, according to the witnesses and relatives of both men. "Because I will come back and do this again and again, and no one is going to stop me."
For years, American military leaders lionized Raziq as a model partner in Afghanistan, their "if only" ally in the battle against the Taliban: If only everyone fought like Raziq, we might actually win this war, American commanders often said.
He ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar during a period when the United States had more troops on the ground than in any other chapter of the war, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to the backing of the United States. American generals cycling through Afghanistan made regular pilgrimages to visit him, praising his courage, his ferocious war fighting and the loyalty he commanded from his men, who were trained, armed and paid by the United States and its allies.
The Americans were by his side until the very end. When he was gunned down by an undercover Taliban assassin in 2018, he was walking next to the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, who celebrated him as a "great friend" and "patriot."
But to countless Afghan civilians under his reign, Raziq was something else entirely: America's monster.
His battlefield prowess was built on years of torture, extrajudicial killings and the largest-known campaign of forced disappearances during America's 20-year war in Afghanistan, a New York Times investigation into thousands of cases during his rule found.
The Times obtained hundreds of pages of documents written by the former American-backed government, more than a decade's worth of hidden ledgers bearing clues to his campaign of abuse. He transformed the police into a fearsome combat force without constraints, and his officers abducted hundreds, if not thousands, of people to be killed or tortured in secret jails, The Times found. Most were never seen again.
The culture of lawlessness and impunity he created flew in the face of endless promises by American presidents, generals and ambassadors to uphold human rights and build a better Afghanistan.
And it helps explain why the United States lost the war.
For nearly two decades, the American public saw only part of the war in Afghanistan. Large parts of the country and its people were off limits to outsiders, impossible to chronicle fully during the fighting. Now that it's over, the Taliban are no longer planting roadside bombs, and many have swapped their AK-47s for three-ring binders and a stifling bureaucracy.
The Times spent more than a year visiting parts of Afghanistan that were once active battlefields, trying to figure out what really happened during America's longest war.
We interviewed many hundreds of people who said their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers had disappeared under Raziq, the police chief responsible for security across Kandahar Province, the birthplace of the Taliban. They saw his rule as little more than a brutal campaign against civilians, underwritten by the United States.
His acts not only discredited the American war effort -- breeding profound resentment that pushed people to support the Taliban -- but embodied it in many ways as well. Across Afghanistan, the United States elevated and empowered warlords, corrupt politicians and outright criminals to prosecute a war of military expediency in which the ends often justified the means.
The Taliban committed countless atrocities of their own against civilians, including suicide attacks, assassinations and kidnappings for ransom.
But it was a mistake to "keep a really bad criminal because he was helpful in fighting worse criminals," said Gen. John R. Allen, who said he tried to limit cooperation with Raziq when he was overseeing coalition forces in the Afghan war from 2011 to 2013.
While Raziq's tactics worked in some respects, beating back the Taliban in Kandahar and earning him the admiration of many who opposed them, the strategy came at a clear cost. It stirred such enmity in parts of the population that the Taliban turned his cruelty into a recruiting tool, broadcasting it to attract new fighters. Many Afghans came to revile the American-backed government and everything it represented.
"None of us supported the Taliban, at least not at first," said Fazul Rahman, whose brother was abducted in front of witnesses during Raziq's reign. "But when the government collapsed, I ran through the streets, rejoicing."
Even some who cheered the ruthlessness Raziq wielded against his enemies lamented the broader corruption and criminality he helped enshrine, a key part of why the Afghan government collapsed in 2021. After his death, his commanders expanded their predation further, extorting ordinary people and stealing from their own men's wages and supplies.
"What they brought under the name of democracy was a system in the hands of a few mafia groups," said Qari Mohammad Mubarak, who ran a girls' school in Kandahar and initially supported the government. "The people came to hate democracy."
Many American commanders, diplomats and their allies in Afghanistan knew at the time they were bankrolling a war that strayed far outside international law.
"Sometimes we asked Raziq about incidents of alleged human rights abuses, and when we got answers we would be like, 'Whoa, I hope we didn't implicate ourselves in a war crime just by hearing about it,"' said Henry Ensher, a State Department official who held multiple posts on Afghanistan, including as the top civilian representative in Kandahar in 2010 and 2011, when he worked with Raziq.
"We knew what we were doing, but we didn't think we had a choice," Ensher said.
Most American leaders -- including more than a dozen interviewed by The Times -- said that Raziq had been seen as the only partner capable of beating back the Taliban in the heartland of the insurgency, where a pitched battle for dominance was underway.
"In the moment, we might have succeeded, but so what?" Ensher said. "The entire enterprise was flawed."
Many Afghans say Raziq used the Americans and their military might to pursue a personal vendetta, taking vengeance against the rivals his tribe had been fighting for decades.
In interviews, many former senior American officials acknowledged that they never grasped that dynamic. It was a defining characteristic over a generation of combat -- how little the United States understood about the war it was waging.
The United Nations, human rights groups and news outlets raised serious concerns about Raziq and his forces, but independent investigations were limited, especially with the region so impenetrable during the war.
To determine the extent of the abuses, The Times combed through more than 50,000 handwritten complaints that had been scrawled into the Kandahar governor's ledgers from 2011 through the end of the war in 2021. In them, we found the rudimentary details of almost 2,200 cases of suspected disappearances.
From there, we went to hundreds of homes across Kandahar and tracked down nearly 1,000 people who said their loved ones had disappeared, been killed or been taken by government security forces.
All together, The Times collected detailed evidence of 368 cases of forced disappearances and dozens of extrajudicial killings attributed to American-backed forces in Kandahar. We counted only cases that were corroborated by at least two people, many of them eyewitnesses to the abductions, and they were often documented with police reports, affidavits and other government records as well.
In all of the cases of forced disappearances, the person is still missing.
These figures are almost certainly a gross undercount of the atrocities during Raziq's reign. We could not canvas all of Kandahar, home to more than a million people. And the more than 2,000 suspected cases we found in the government's ledgers were most likely just an inkling of what really happened. Most of the families we interviewed had never formally reported their loved ones missing, out of fear of retribution or the danger of traveling during the war.
Beyond that, the police destroyed many of their records as the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kandahar City in 2021, former senior officials said. The exact number who were abducted and never seen again may be impossible to know.
What is clear, however, is who was responsible: Only the American-backed government consistently engaged in forced disappearances in Kandahar, former officials, combatants and families of the victims said.
"The Taliban didn't need to disappear people -- they just killed them where they found them," said Hasti Mohammad, a former government official in charge of the Panjwai district in Kandahar. "The government disappeared people because what they were doing was illegal. They were hiding from the law."
The cases confirmed by The Times amount to the largest campaign of forced disappearances in Afghanistan since tens of thousands went missing after the Soviet-backed communist coup in 1978, an assessment of previous atrocities shows.
As the victims mourned their loved ones, they confronted their own powerlessness. Raziq was untouchable, thanks to the ironclad support of the United States and its NATO allies.
"We would ask ourselves: 'Are we creating something here that we may regret later?"' said Col. Robert Waltemeyer, a former Special Forces officer who worked with Raziq.
But there was no one better at fighting the Taliban, he said, adding that he never witnessed Raziq do anything illegal. When the United States sent tens of thousands of American soldiers to Afghanistan during the so-called surge announced in 2009, hoping to wrest control of the south, Raziq was central to the effort.
"He was probably the most important person in the entire surge," Waltemeyer said.
The United States pushed for Raziq to lead the police forces who fought alongside American troops, he said, because "he showed up, and his troops showed up, to fight, not just to watch the Americans fight."
In effect, Waltemeyer said, "We created Raziq."
"You look at every U.S. war and it's the same," he said. "We create regrets."
'Abdul Raziq's work'
Fazul Rahman raced to the grease-stained motorcycle shop the moment he got the call: His brother, a mechanic, had just been kidnapped.
In a panic, the shop workers told him that three men in civilian clothes had pulled up in an unmarked Toyota Corolla on the morning of Sept. 3, 2016, asking his brother to take a look at a generator in the trunk.
Then, in full view of a crowd of onlookers, they said, the men wrestled Fazul's brother, Ahmad, 28, into the car and sped away.
To Fazul and everyone else present, the culprits were obvious: the police. Under Raziq, Kandahar's security forces had become notorious for snatching anyone they suspected of working with Taliban insurgents. Many simply disappeared. Others turned up as mutilated corpses, discarded in the streets. A lucky few were released alive, bearing wounds and accounts of torture.
Some of the missing were, in fact, Taliban, their families said. Others, their relatives insisted, were not. Many were simply part of the working class: mechanics, tailors and taxi drivers who had nothing to do with the war, their families said.
Desperate to find his brother, Fazul gathered elders and hurried to the local police station. The officers denied arresting his brother, so he headed to the palace of the American-backed governor, joining the line to submit complaints.
The handwritten government ledgers reviewed by The Times show his plea: Volume 4 from 2016, Entry No. 591 -- Ahmad, son of Abdur Rahman.
There were thousands of families just like his, all with the same burning question. What had the government done with their loved ones?
After filing his complaint, Fazul worried. What would happen if he pushed too hard? The police were abducting and disappearing people on mere suspicions, never mind someone openly accusing them of kidnapping.
"The police were getting angry," he said. "They'd beat us and say, 'Why do you keep coming?"'
Still, another force, more potent than fear, was driving him: his mother, Malika.
Women were rarely seen or heard making public demands in conservative Afghanistan, especially in the south. But Fazul and Ahmad were all their mother had; their father had died of cancer more than 20 years earlier, leaving her to raise them on her own.
"For months, from morning to night, I went from the police to the governor's offices and waited for someone to see me," she said.
Outside the offices, scribes charged a small fee to write out complaints for people who, like Fazul and his mother, were illiterate. Many of the petitions were in Malika's name, and the family provided copies of them to The Times.
"Please help find and release my innocent son," one said. It carried the signatures of 11 local elders, all attesting that her son was not in the Taliban.
Soon, Fazul and his mother got to know other families searching for missing people. Having a relative arrested on suspicion of being an insurgent tarred them with the same brush. But the presence of women gave them some license to make demands.
Aliyah's son, Salahuddin, a rickshaw driver, had been snatched from outside his home as he walked to the mosque.
"There was nowhere that I wouldn't go to find my son," Aliyah said. "But we had no idea whether he was dead or alive."
A third man, Daud, had been taken in 2015. With no immediate family to look for him, a neighbor, Seema, became his advocate.
Frustrated by how often the families returned, an employee at the governor's palace told Fazul to put together a list of the missing. A scribe helped Fazul take down the names in his impromptu group: 17 families, at first.
The list, scribbled on a sheet of plain white paper, was soon expanded, passed around, photocopied and texted.
Like Ahmad, many of the victims had been grabbed off the streets or from workplaces by armed men in plainclothes in front of witnesses. Some had simply vanished, like Abdul Wahid, whose brother, a butcher, last saw him when he sent him home with some meat for dinner. Others, like Habib Rahman, had been arrested by uniformed officers while out with friends.
Their relatives clung to the hope that they might still be alive in one of the many unofficial detention sites, often called "private prisons," maintained by Raziq's forces.
The families went to the Red Cross to study photos of unidentified bodies that had been collected and buried, and then to the morgue to see the newly discovered corpses. Some had been suffocated, shot in the head or dumped with their hands still tied.
The group paid bribes to find answers. Most had already shelled out money to unscrupulous police officers, to no avail. Then, in late 2016, a break: One of their missing was returned, finally offering a clear account of what was happening to their loved ones.
Nisar Ahmad, 23, had been abducted a month earlier, not long after a bomb attack targeting one of Raziq's commanders left the area on edge. Two men in plainclothes took him at gunpoint.
Inside a shipping container, a group of men, some in police uniform, took turns beating him, he said. They stuffed a plastic bag into his mouth and poured water over his face, nearly suffocating him. Most shamefully, he said, they twisted his genitals, permanently damaging them.
The police told him to make a confession, and recorded it, he said: "After I confessed, they didn't torture me anymore."
That night, he was blindfolded and driven to another location. Through a barred window, he saw a spindly mountaintop and the green, red and black flag of Afghanistan, he said. (A former police detective said the site appeared to be the District 9 station in Kandahar City.)
Eventually, Nisar's father, Mohammad Fazluddin, received a phone call from a police officer, he said, demanding the equivalent of $ 900 -- a staggering amount -- to release his son. Mohammad agreed, dropping off the money at an auto repair shop as instructed, and his son was let go, he said.
"It's a miracle," he said, taking the release as a sign that the police knew his son was innocent.
In private, the families said, some of the police acknowledged they had taken their loved ones. So, Fazul and the others buttonholed every official possible.
They insisted there was nothing they could do, he said.
"They all knew exactly what was happening," Fazul said. "They said: 'We have nothing to do with this. This is Abdul Raziq's work."'
Finally, Fazul got a meeting with the governor of Kandahar. The mothers joined more than a dozen men to plead and scold for the missing on their list.
Malika, Fazul's mother, was furious, accusing the officials of corruption and cowardice, of robbing her of the most precious thing in life. At one point, they recalled, the governor's guards warned her not to speak so bluntly.
"You people have taken my son," she responded, looking at the governor, people in the room recalled. "If you want to kill me, then kill me, but I won't hold my tongue."
The hectoring paid off. Their list landed on the desk of Raziq himself.
He summoned them for a meeting.
The other war
Disappearances were hardly new in Kandahar, a place ravaged by more than four decades of war. Even Raziq had lost someone.
His father had been a driver, often going to the border with Pakistan. One day, while Raziq was still a boy, his father disappeared on a routine trip, vanishing in the vast desert.
His family, members of the Achakzai tribe, blamed their longtime rivals: the Noorzai. The two tribes had been locked in a deadly feud that stretched back decades, long before the Taliban came to power.
"He was killed because he was Achakzai," Tadin Khan, Raziq's younger brother, told The Times. "His body disappeared."
Raziq went on to author the most brutal campaign of enforced disappearances in his country in decades. And it often targeted this rival tribe, the Noorzai, many of whom supported the Taliban.
That is something the Americans generally failed to understand: A tribal and family dynamic, not just a hatred of the Taliban, animated Raziq's war. In fact, the cluster of villages where Raziq summoned the crowd, killed the two prisoners and then threatened the onlookers was mostly made up of Noorzai.
"He killed them like dogs," said Haji Dilbar, a villager who described being in the crowd that Raziq had assembled to witness the killings.
As his friends tell it, Raziq first picked up a gun as a teenager, fighting under his uncle during the civil war that came after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government. In 1994, his uncle was killed by the Taliban, who hanged his body from the barrel of a tank.
When the U.S. invasion began in 2001, Raziq started fighting on the American side, joining a militia to clear the Taliban out of Kandahar. Later, those same forces became the border police and served under Raziq, still in his 20s at the time.
Largely illiterate, he compensated with his intelligence and charisma, distinguishing himself as a fearless fighter who knew the deserts straddling the border, as his father did.
By 2010, as the Taliban gained ground across the south, Raziq had held back the insurgents in the areas around his home district, called Spin Boldak. American commanders knew he was corrupt, running a mafia-style racket on trade across the border. He was suspected of being involved in the poppy trade.
Allegations of extrajudicial killings also dogged Raziq for years, dating back to the early days of the American-backed government. Noorzai elders said they had complained of murders to American military officials, but were ignored.
Lt. Col. Andrew Green, who worked closely with Raziq in 2010 and 2011, said that confirming the allegations had been impossible because the events happened deep in Taliban territory.
Moreover, he said, law enforcement in Afghanistan was barely functional. The courts were corrupt, and most people could pay their way out of jail, leaving the police with few options.
"In Afghanistan, the police shoot people," he said. "While you can't say it's a good thing, it's sort of what is done."
The worries about Raziq spread. A State Department report documented a 2006 episode in which he executed 16 men he accused of being Taliban. In 2009, he was accused of torture and keeping private prisons by the Afghan human rights commission.
The so-called surge became a major turning point for him. In 2009, hoping to beat back a resurgent Taliban, President Barack Obama announced that he would send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan, focusing on Kandahar and Helmand Provinces, two Taliban strongholds.
The Americans wanted a partner who was unafraid to confront the Taliban head-on, like Raziq. Yet they were also debating what to do about "bad actors" who undermined the legitimacy of the Afghan government, also like Raziq.
"There were lots of conversations about whether we should mentor Raziq or imprison him," recalled Green, the American officer, who had investigated him for other issues, including graft.
The Americans chose the former. They needed him.
After the police chief of Kandahar was assassinated in 2011, Raziq was given the job. He became a general and appointed commanders from his Achakzai tribe to key positions in Kandahar.
United Nations investigators called four of them -- three of whom were his relatives -- the "four horsemen" for the many allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings against them. One of them, a Raziq family member, was responsible for organizing death squads, according to police officers who worked with him. His men roved the city in unmarked cars, wearing plainclothes.
Deeming the court system corrupt, Raziq ordered his commanders to kill suspected Taliban, former officers and officials said. Those who refused to kill captives were dismissed.
"He told me: 'Why are you bringing these Taliban to the station? Why aren't you killing them? What are you afraid of?"' said one former city district chief who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
The victims were taken for a "sand picnic" and dumped in remote areas, down wells or where the shifting desert sands would cover them, according to former police officers and internal United Nations reports.
One senior police officer said he had complained to Raziq about finding bodies dumped in his district.
"I told him, 'They're in my area; it's going to be blamed on me,"' the officer said. He recalled Raziq laughing before agreeing to tell his men to be more careful.
A 2013 United Nations report noted a surge in unidentified bodies, some still handcuffed, dumped in Kandahar City and dozens of reported disappearances, citing the "increased level of brutality" and torture under Raziq.
Within two months of his appointment as police chief, the Americans stopped transferring detainees to Afghan security forces in Kandahar because of reports of abuses and executions.
"I pulled the intel on the guy and it was pretty horrific," Allen, the American general, said.
Still, American support continued to flow to Raziq, who was popular with U.S. officers and considered vital to winning the war.
While Col. Bill Carty, the head of U.S. Special Forces in Kandahar, was visiting Raziq in 2012, a suicide bomber struck. Carty threw himself on top of Raziq to shield him, and then gave the general his own body armor to wear, according to an account Carty gave in the book, "One Hundred Victories," and confirmed to The Times.
"Why did you give me your vest?" Raziq asked.
"There are thousands of me," Carty recalled replying, emphasizing the importance of Raziq's role as police chief. "But there is only one of you."
Guests of the general
At his headquarters, Raziq greeted Fazul and the other family members in his white civilian robes. Because he couldn't read, his secretary said aloud the names on the list Fazul had provided for him.
Getting the meeting was no easy feat. By then, the Taliban had made so many attempts on the general's life that he joked to friends that he had lost count.
But in person, Raziq was polite, several of the attendees recalled, and allowed each of them to speak their minds. When everyone finished, the general spoke.
He did not trust the courts, the families recounted him saying. The judges let criminals go free, the prosecutors were ineffective, and justice could always be bought for a price. He preferred to administer his own justice.
He spoke to a few family members directly, including Shah Mohammad, whose brother, Neda, was on Fazul's list. The general told him that Neda had been involved in the murder of police officers, an accusation he struggled to believe; Neda sold vegetables from a pushcart in the market.
Before the meeting ended, the general turned to Seema, whose adoptive son Daud had disappeared months earlier. He would be returned, the general said without explanation.
Not long after, Daud was set free.
After getting out, Daud told the families how he had been kept in a dark cell for months at an unofficial detention site. He was beaten and abused regularly, until, after the general's intervention, he was transferred to a formal prison before being let go. He told the others that he had not seen any of their loved ones.
Still, a painful wave of hope washed over the families. They began to dream that, perhaps, their children might still be alive. But that is the problem with hope, and not knowing: Without the closure of death, they could never properly grieve.
For the perpetrators, disappearances carry a cruel logic. Though they can be crimes against humanity, there is little evidence without a body, especially when someone is snatched without witnesses or by officers in civilian clothes and cars.
Yet the disappearances inflicted unique wounds for many Afghans. Often, wives were told they could not remarry until their husbands were proved dead. Some with young children were left unable to support themselves.
"What General Raziq did in terms of killing and disappearing was worse than everything else that happened in the rest of Afghanistan," said Sayed Abdul Karim, the father of one of the young men on Fazul's list. "I wish that we could bury his bones somewhere. If we had a grave, we could go there and pray."
The cruelty bred other cruelties, like the cottage industry of hustlers that emerged to take advantage of parents' desperation. Fazul and his mother fell victim to a scam, traveling to Kabul to pay an intelligence official several thousand dollars for Ahmad's return, a trip that nearly ended with Fazul himself getting kidnapped. Others paid more.
Some decided their families should be joined by more than tragedy alone. Fazul's cousin married the son of the missing rickshaw driver, Salahuddin.
He had been gone so long that, by then, his son was of marrying age.
The insurgents rise
The shock came on Oct. 18, 2018: Raziq was gunned down by a Taliban assassin who had infiltrated the governor's guards.
The Taliban crowed.
They had long used Raziq's brutality to recruit fighters and whip up anger in videos and pamphlets that showcased his abuses.
But his death allowed the insurgents to broadcast their ability to kill even the most protected commanders -- one who was walking just paces away from Miller, the top American commander in Afghanistan, at the time of his death.
The Taliban said they had chosen to target Raziq over anyone else at the meeting, including the American four-star general, who escaped injury.
"He was more important to us than Scott Miller," said Maulavi Ebrar Ahmad Habib, a Taliban commander who oversaw assassinations in Kandahar during those years.
Fazul and the others hoped things would change with Raziq's death. For the most part, nothing did.
Raziq's brother, Tadin, took over as police chief of Kandahar. He told The Times that neither he nor his brother had waged campaigns of forced disappearances. Officials said he simply continued the system his brother had built.
When the war began, Fazul and the others imagined the Americans would bring investment and opportunity. They envisioned good jobs, better homes, prosperity. But their good will evaporated quickly as their loved ones disappeared.
It was not that everyone embraced the Taliban, residents said; they just came to detest the Afghan government and the Americans who propped it up.
That erosion of support -- not just among the families of the missing, but also among many Afghans disenchanted by the broader corruption and unchecked abuses of the Americans and their Afghan partners -- was part of the collapse of Kandahar, as it was elsewhere in the country.
The impunity and criminality that Raziq fostered metastasized after his death, eating away at Kandahar from within. As the Taliban grew stronger, wage and supply theft within government forces devastated morale, as did infighting among his commanders, paralyzing their ability to fight.
Fazul's group prayed for an insurgent victory, clinging to the hope that once the government was toppled, they might discover what had become of their relatives.
And once the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government in 2021, the Taliban went from prison to prison, emptying cells.
Thousands of people from across the province flooded into Kandahar City. Fazul heard that hundreds of prisoners had been extracted from the basement of the police headquarters. Huge crowds gathered outside of the governor's compound, jostling for a look at those who exited.
Fazul joined them, racing downtown to scour public facilities. Having no luck in Kandahar City, he and others descended on Spin Boldak, where Raziq got his start. Hundreds waited there, too, scanning the crowds for their missing loved ones. Fazul counted the people freed from unofficial detention sites. His brother wasn't one of them.
Rohullah Akhunzada, who was part of Fazul's group, looked for his own brother in a basement prison, its dank, low ceilings a harrowing indication of what so many Afghans had been forced to endure. He found no sign of him.
"We still don't know," he said.
Having looked everywhere, another of Fazul's compatriots, Fazl Raheem, approached the Taliban to ask for news of his brother.
The Taliban told him that all of the prisons had been emptied. Everyone still alive is already with their families, he recalled them saying.
The crowds drifted, hoping for one more place their loved ones could materialize. Many went to the crowded bus station in Kandahar City to scan the prisoners returning from Bagram Air Base, where the Americans, and later the Afghans, had kept thousands of detainees.
The urgency and desperation rose like a fever. So, too, did the familiar despondence when Fazul's brother was nowhere to be found.
A legacy ignored
Since the collapse, mass graves have turned up in Kandahar, prompting renewed searches from relatives who show up at desert sites and hospital morgues, or share photographs of skeletal remains. But there is no organized search for the missing in Kandahar.
After years of pressure from the United States, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have said they are de-prioritizing investigations into abuses committed by American-backed forces. The United Nations has focused on abuses carried out by the new Taliban government, accusing it of its own campaign of extrajudicial killings and torture.
The Times sued the American government for its files on Raziq. Nearly a year later, the military and the State Department have turned over only a handful of documents. Few military leaders from that era had any interest in revisiting his legacy, and what it reveals about the American war effort.
"The reason you have insurgencies is because of injustice, and Raziq represented the very worst," said Allen, the American general. He added: "Raziq created the very injustice that gave the Taliban its edge on us."
To commemorate Raziq, the former Afghan government had begun erecting a mausoleum for him, a giant, mosque-like structure beside the governor's palace, a memorial fit for a national hero. Many see him that way, as a champion of those who oppose the Taliban.
Rather than destroy it, the Taliban have surrounded the edifice with concrete blast walls, careful not to antagonize the large swathe of the population that still reveres the general. It is blocked but visible, its dome and minarets peeking over the barrier.
There are no monuments to the missing. Of the 17 people on his original list, Fazul knows of only three who came home alive.
"I still have hope that he will return, even though I know he is probably dead," said Malika, Fazul and Ahmad's mother. "My tears have not dried since he disappeared."

A.I. Boom Lifts Profits For Nvidia Even Higher: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Silicon Valley company was again lifted by sales of its artificial intelligence chips, but it faces growing competition and heightened expectations.
Nvidia, which makes microchips that power most artificial intelligence applications, began an extraordinary run a year ago.
Fueled by an explosion of interest in A.I., the Silicon Valley company said last May that it expected its chip sales to go through the roof. They did -- and the fervor didn't stop, with Nvidia raising its revenue projections every few months. Its stock soared, driving the company to a more than $ 2 trillion market capitalization that makes it more valuable than Alphabet, the parent of Google.
On Wednesday, Nvidia again reported soaring revenue and profits that underscored how it remains a dominant winner of the A.I. boom, even as it grapples with outsize expectations and rising competition.
Revenue was $ 26 billion for the three months that ended in April, surpassing its $ 24 billion estimate in February and tripling sales from a year earlier for the third consecutive quarter. Net income surged sevenfold to $ 5.98 billion.
Nvidia also projected revenue of $ 28 billion for the current quarter, which ends in July, more than double the amount from a year ago and higher than Wall Street estimates.
"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do," Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. "The next industrial revolution has begun."
Nvidia's shares, which are up more than 90 percent this year, rose in after-hours trading after the results were released. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split.
Nvidia, which originally sold chips for rendering images in video games, has benefited after making an early, costly bet on adapting its graphics processing units, or GPUs, to take on other computing tasks. When A.I. researchers began using those chips more than a decade ago to accelerate tasks like recognizing objects in photos, Mr. Huang jumped on the opportunity. He augmented Nvidia's chips for A.I. tasks and developed software to aid developments in the field.
The company's flagship processor, the H100, has enjoyed feverish demand to power A.I. chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. While most high-end standard processors cost a few thousand dollars, H100s have sold for anywhere from $ 15,000 to $ 40,000 each, depending on volume and other factors, analysts said.
Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that it had worked in recent months with more than 100 customers that were building new data centers -- which Mr. Huang calls A.I. factories -- ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000. Tesla, for example, is using 35,000 H100 chips to help train models for autonomous driving, she said.
Nvidia will soon begin to ship a powerful successor to the H100, code-named Blackwell, which was announced in March. Demand for the new chips already appears to be strong, raising the possibility that some customers may wait for the speedier models rather than buy the H100. But there was little sign of such a pause in Nvidia's latest results.
Ms. Kress said demand for Blackwell was well ahead of supply of the chip, and "we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year." Mr. Huang added that the new chips should be operating in data centers late this year and that "we will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year."
The comments may ease fears of a slowdown in Nvidia's momentum.
"Lingering concerns investors had in the short term regarding an 'air bubble' for GPU demand seem to have vanished," Lucas Keh, an analyst at the research firm Third Bridge, said in an email.
Wall Street analysts are also looking for signs that some richly funded rivals could grab a noticeable share of Nvidia's business. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon have all developed their own chips that can be tailored for A.I. jobs, though they have also said they are boosting purchases of Nvidia chips.
Traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have also made optimistic predictions about their A.I. chips. AMD has said it expects to sell $ 4 billion worth of a new A.I. processor, the MI300, this year.
Mr. Huang frequently points to what he has said is a sustainable advantage: Only Nvidia's GPUs are offered by all the major cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, so customers don't have to worry about getting locked into using one of the services because of its exclusive chip technology.
Nvidia also remains popular among computer makers that have long used its chips in their systems. One is Dell Technologies, which on Monday hosted a Las Vegas event that featured an appearance by Mr. Huang.
Michael Dell, Dell's chief executive and founder, said his company would offer new data center systems that packed 72 of the new Blackwell chips in a computer rack, standard structures that stand a bit taller than a refrigerator.
"Don't seduce me with talk like that," Mr. Huang joked. "That gets me superexcited."

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The convoy rumbled into the Taliban heartland, a white desert littered with stones. Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here.
Dozens assembled in the mud square to listen as Abdul Raziq, one of America’s most important partners in the war against the Taliban, stood before the crowd, gesturing at two prisoners he had brought along to make his point.
The prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said.
“You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban,” Raziq said after the killings, which took place in the winter of 2010, according to the witnesses and relatives of both men. “Because I will come back and do this again and again, and no one is going to stop me.”
For years, American military leaders lionized Raziq as a model partner in Afghanistan, their “if only” ally in the battle against the Taliban: If only everyone fought like Raziq, we might actually win this war, American commanders often said.
He ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar during a period when the United States had more troops on the ground than in any other chapter of the war, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to the backing of the United States. American generals cycling through Afghanistan made regular pilgrimages to visit him, praising his courage, his ferocious war fighting and the loyalty he commanded from his men, who were trained, armed and paid by the United States and its allies.
The Americans were by his side until the very end. When he was gunned down by an undercover Taliban assassin in 2018, he was walking next to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, who celebrated him as a “great friend” and “patriot.”
But to countless Afghan civilians under his reign, Raziq was something else entirely: America’s monster.
His battlefield prowess was built on years of torture, extrajudicial killings and the largest-known campaign of forced disappearances during America’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, a New York Times investigation into thousands of cases during his rule found.
The Times obtained hundreds of pages of documents written by the former U.S.-backed government, more than a decade’s worth of hidden ledgers bearing clues to his campaign of abuse. He transformed the police into a fearsome combat force without constraints, and his officers abducted hundreds, if not thousands, of people to be killed or tortured in secret jails, the Times found. Most were never seen again.
The culture of lawlessness and impunity he created flew in the face of endless promises by American presidents, generals and ambassadors to uphold human rights and build a better Afghanistan.
And it helps explain why the United States lost the war.
For nearly two decades, the American public saw only part of the war in Afghanistan. Large parts of the country and its people were off-limits to outsiders, impossible to chronicle fully during the fighting. Now that it’s over, the Taliban are no longer planting roadside bombs, and many have swapped their AK-47s for three-ring binders and a stifling bureaucracy.
The Times spent more than a year visiting parts of Afghanistan that were once active battlefields, trying to figure out what really happened during America’s longest war.
We interviewed many hundreds of people who said their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers had disappeared under Raziq, the police chief responsible for security across Kandahar province, the birthplace of the Taliban. They saw his rule as little more than a brutal campaign against civilians, underwritten by the United States.
His acts not only discredited the American war effort — breeding profound resentment that pushed people to support the Taliban — but embodied it in many ways as well. Across Afghanistan, the United States elevated and empowered warlords, corrupt politicians and outright criminals to prosecute a war of military expediency in which the ends often justified the means.
The Taliban committed countless atrocities of their own against civilians, including suicide attacks, assassinations and kidnappings for ransom.
But it was a mistake to “keep a really bad criminal because he was helpful in fighting worse criminals,” said Gen. John R. Allen, who said he tried to limit cooperation with Raziq when he was overseeing coalition forces in the Afghan war from 2011 to 2013.
While Raziq’s tactics worked in some respects, beating back the Taliban in Kandahar and earning him the admiration of many who opposed them, the strategy came at a clear cost. It stirred such enmity in parts of the population that the Taliban turned his cruelty into a recruiting tool, broadcasting it to attract new fighters. Many Afghans came to revile the U.S.-backed government and everything it represented.
“None of us supported the Taliban, at least not at first,” said Fazul Rahman, whose brother was abducted in front of witnesses during Raziq’s reign. “But when the government collapsed, I ran through the streets, rejoicing.”
Even some who cheered the ruthlessness Raziq wielded against his enemies lamented the broader corruption and criminality he helped enshrine, a key part of why the Afghan government collapsed in 2021. After his death, his commanders expanded their predation further, extorting ordinary people and stealing from their own men’s wages and supplies.
“What they brought under the name of democracy was a system in the hands of a few mafia groups,” said Qari Mohammad Mubarak, who ran a girls’ school in Kandahar and initially supported the government. “The people came to hate democracy.”
Many American commanders, diplomats and their allies in Afghanistan knew at the time they were bankrolling a war that strayed far outside international law.
“Sometimes we asked Raziq about incidents of alleged human rights abuses, and when we got answers we would be like, ‘Whoa, I hope we didn’t implicate ourselves in a war crime just by hearing about it,’” said Henry Ensher, a State Department official who held multiple posts on Afghanistan, including as the top civilian representative in Kandahar in 2010 and 2011, when he worked with Raziq.
“We knew what we were doing, but we didn’t think we had a choice,” Ensher said.
Most American leaders — including more than a dozen interviewed by the Times — said that Raziq had been seen as the only partner capable of beating back the Taliban in the heartland of the insurgency, where a pitched battle for dominance was underway.
“In the moment, we might have succeeded, but so what?” Ensher said. “The entire enterprise was flawed.”
Many Afghans say Raziq used the Americans and their military might to pursue a personal vendetta, taking vengeance against the rivals his tribe had been fighting for decades.
In interviews, many former senior American officials acknowledged that they never grasped that dynamic. It was a defining characteristic over a generation of combat — how little the United States understood about the war it was waging.
The United Nations, human rights groups and news outlets raised serious concerns about Raziq and his forces, but independent investigations were limited, especially with the region so impenetrable during the war.
To determine the extent of the abuses, the Times combed through more than 50,000 handwritten complaints that had been scrawled into the Kandahar governor’s ledgers from 2011 through the end of the war in 2021. In them, we found the rudimentary details of almost 2,200 cases of suspected disappearances.
From there, we went to hundreds of homes across Kandahar and tracked down nearly 1,000 people who said their loved ones had disappeared, been killed or been taken by government security forces.
All together, the Times collected detailed evidence of 368 cases of forced disappearances and dozens of extrajudicial killings attributed to U.S.-backed forces in Kandahar. We counted only cases that were corroborated by at least two people, many of them eyewitnesses to the abductions, and they were often documented with police reports, affidavits and other government records as well.
In all the cases of forced disappearances, the person is still missing.
These figures are almost certainly a gross undercount of the atrocities during Raziq’s reign. We could not canvas all of Kandahar, home to more than 1 million people. And the more than 2,000 suspected cases we found in the government’s ledgers were most likely just an inkling of what really happened. Most of the families we interviewed had never formally reported their loved ones missing, out of fear of retribution or the danger of traveling during the war.
Beyond that, the police destroyed many of their records as the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kandahar City in 2021, former senior officials said. The exact number who were abducted and never seen again may be impossible to know.
What is clear, however, is who was responsible: Only the U.S.-backed government consistently engaged in forced disappearances in Kandahar, former officials, combatants and families of the victims said.
“The Taliban didn’t need to disappear people — they just killed them where they found them,” said Hasti Mohammad, a former government official in charge of the Panjwai district in Kandahar. “The government disappeared people because what they were doing was illegal. They were hiding from the law.”
The cases confirmed by the Times amount to the largest campaign of forced disappearances in Afghanistan since tens of thousands went missing after the Soviet-backed communist coup in 1978, an assessment of previous atrocities shows.
As the victims mourned their loved ones, they confronted their own powerlessness. Raziq was untouchable, thanks to the ironclad support of the United States and its NATO allies.
“We would ask ourselves: ‘Are we creating something here that we may regret later?’” said Col. Robert Waltemeyer, a former Special Forces officer who worked with Raziq.
But there was no one better at fighting the Taliban, he said, adding that he never witnessed Raziq do anything illegal. When the United States sent tens of thousands of American soldiers to Afghanistan during the so-called surge announced in 2009, hoping to wrest control of the south, Raziq was central to the effort.
“He was probably the most important person in the entire surge,” Waltemeyer said.
The United States pushed for Raziq to lead the police forces who fought alongside American troops, he said, because “he showed up, and his troops showed up, to fight, not just to watch the Americans fight.”
In effect, Waltemeyer said, “We created Raziq.”
“You look at every U.S. war and it’s the same,” he said. “We create regrets.”
‘Abdul Raziq’s work’
Fazul Rahman raced to the grease-stained motorcycle shop the moment he got the call: His brother, a mechanic, had just been kidnapped.
In a panic, the shop workers told him that three men in civilian clothes had pulled up in an unmarked Toyota Corolla on the morning of Sept. 3, 2016, asking his brother to take a look at a generator in the trunk.
Then, in full view of a crowd of onlookers, they said, the men wrestled Fazul’s brother, Ahmad, 28, into the car and sped away.
To Fazul and everyone else present, the culprits were obvious: the police. Under Raziq, Kandahar’s security forces had become notorious for snatching anyone they suspected of working with Taliban insurgents. Many simply disappeared. Others turned up as mutilated corpses, discarded in the streets. A lucky few were released alive, bearing wounds and accounts of torture.
Some of the missing were, in fact, Taliban, their families said. Others, their relatives insisted, were not. Many were simply part of the working class: mechanics, tailors and taxi drivers who had nothing to do with the war, their families said.
Desperate to find his brother, Fazul gathered elders and hurried to the local police station. The officers denied arresting his brother, so he headed to the palace of the U.S.-backed governor, joining the line to submit complaints.
The handwritten government ledgers reviewed by the Times show his plea: Volume 4 from 2016, Entry No. 591 — Ahmad, son of Abdur Rahman.
There were thousands of families just like his, all with the same burning question. What had the government done with their loved ones?
After filing his complaint, Fazul worried. What would happen if he pushed too hard? The police were abducting and disappearing people on mere suspicions, never mind someone openly accusing them of kidnapping.
“The police were getting angry,” he said. “They’d beat us and say, ‘Why do you keep coming?’”
Still, another force, more potent than fear, was driving him: his mother, Malika.
Women were rarely seen or heard making public demands in conservative Afghanistan, especially in the south. But Fazul and Ahmad were all their mother had; their father had died of cancer more than 20 years earlier, leaving her to raise them on her own.
“For months, from morning to night, I went from the police to the governor’s offices and waited for someone to see me,” she said.
Outside the offices, scribes charged a small fee to write out complaints for people who, like Fazul and his mother, were illiterate. Many of the petitions were in Malika’s name, and the family provided copies of them to the Times.
“Please help find and release my innocent son,” one said. It carried the signatures of 11 local elders, all attesting that her son was not in the Taliban.
Soon, Fazul and his mother got to know other families searching for missing people. Having a relative arrested on suspicion of being an insurgent tarred them with the same brush. But the presence of women gave them some license to make demands.
Aliyah’s son, Salahuddin, a rickshaw driver, had been snatched from outside his home as he walked to the mosque.
“There was nowhere that I wouldn’t go to find my son,” Aliyah said. “But we had no idea whether he was dead or alive.”
A third man, Daud, had been taken in 2015. With no immediate family to look for him, a neighbor, Seema, became his advocate.
Frustrated by how often the families returned, an employee at the governor’s palace told Fazul to put together a list of the missing. A scribe helped Fazul take down the names in his impromptu group: 17 families, at first.
The list, scribbled on a sheet of plain white paper, was soon expanded, passed around, photocopied and texted.
Like Ahmad, many of the victims had been grabbed off the streets or from workplaces by armed men in plainclothes in front of witnesses. Some had simply vanished, like Abdul Wahid, whose brother, a butcher, last saw him when he sent him home with some meat for dinner. Others, like Habib Rahman, had been arrested by uniformed officers while out with friends.
Their relatives clung to the hope that they might still be alive in one of the many unofficial detention sites, often called “private prisons,” maintained by Raziq’s forces.
The families went to the Red Cross to study photos of unidentified bodies that had been collected and buried, and then to the morgue to see the newly discovered corpses. Some had been suffocated, shot in the head or dumped with their hands still tied.
The group paid bribes to find answers. Most had already shelled out money to unscrupulous police officers, to no avail. Then, in late 2016, a break: One of their missing was returned, finally offering a clear account of what was happening to their loved ones.
Nisar Ahmad, 23, had been abducted a month earlier, not long after a bomb attack targeting one of Raziq’s commanders left the area on edge. Two men in plainclothes took him at gunpoint.
Inside a shipping container, a group of men, some in police uniform, took turns beating him, he said. They stuffed a plastic bag into his mouth and poured water over his face, nearly suffocating him. Most shamefully, he said, they twisted his genitals, permanently damaging them.
The police told him to make a confession, and recorded it, he said: “After I confessed, they didn’t torture me anymore.”
That night, he was blindfolded and driven to another location. Through a barred window, he saw a spindly mountaintop and the green, red and black flag of Afghanistan, he said. (A former police detective said the site appeared to be the District 9 station in Kandahar City.)
Eventually, Nisar’s father, Mohammad Fazluddin, received a phone call from a police officer, he said, demanding the equivalent of $900 — a staggering amount — to release his son. Mohammad agreed, dropping off the money at an auto repair shop as instructed, and his son was let go, he said.
“It’s a miracle,” he said, taking the release as a sign that the police knew his son was innocent.
In private, the families said, some of the police acknowledged they had taken their loved ones. So, Fazul and the others buttonholed every official possible.
They insisted there was nothing they could do, he said.
“They all knew exactly what was happening,” Fazul said. “They said: ‘We have nothing to do with this. This is Abdul Raziq’s work.’”
Finally, Fazul got a meeting with the governor of Kandahar. The mothers joined more than a dozen men to plead and scold for the missing on their list.
Malika, Fazul’s mother, was furious, accusing the officials of corruption and cowardice, of robbing her of the most precious thing in life. At one point, they recalled, the governor’s guards warned her not to speak so bluntly.
“You people have taken my son,” she responded, looking at the governor, people in the room recalled. “If you want to kill me, then kill me, but I won’t hold my tongue.”
The hectoring paid off. Their list landed on the desk of Raziq himself.
He summoned them for a meeting.
The other war
Disappearances were hardly new in Kandahar, a place ravaged by more than four decades of war. Even Raziq had lost someone.
His father had been a driver, often going to the border with Pakistan. One day, while Raziq was still a boy, his father disappeared on a routine trip, vanishing in the vast desert.
His family, members of the Achakzai tribe, blamed their longtime rivals: the Noorzai. The two tribes had been locked in a deadly feud that stretched back decades, long before the Taliban came to power.
“He was killed because he was Achakzai,” Tadin Khan, Raziq’s younger brother, told the Times. “His body disappeared.”
Raziq went on to author the most brutal campaign of enforced disappearances in his country in decades. And it often targeted this rival tribe, the Noorzai, many of whom supported the Taliban.
That is something the Americans generally failed to understand: A tribal and family dynamic, not just a hatred of the Taliban, animated Raziq’s war. In fact, the cluster of villages where Raziq summoned the crowd, killed the two prisoners and then threatened the onlookers was mostly made up of Noorzai.
“He killed them like dogs,” said Haji Dilbar, a villager who described being in the crowd that Raziq had assembled to witness the killings.
As his friends tell it, Raziq first picked up a gun as a teenager, fighting under his uncle during the civil war that came after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government. In 1994, his uncle was killed by the Taliban, who hanged his body from the barrel of a tank.
When the U.S. invasion began in 2001, Raziq started fighting on the American side, joining a militia to clear the Taliban out of Kandahar. Later, those same forces became the border police and served under Raziq, still in his 20s at the time.
Largely illiterate, he compensated with his intelligence and charisma, distinguishing himself as a fearless fighter who knew the deserts straddling the border, as his father did.
By 2010, as the Taliban gained ground across the south, Raziq had held back the insurgents in the areas around his home district, called Spin Boldak. American commanders knew he was corrupt, running a mafia-style racket on trade across the border. He was suspected of being involved in the poppy trade.
Allegations of extrajudicial killings also dogged Raziq for years, dating back to the early days of the U.S.-backed government. Noorzai elders said they had complained of murders to American military officials, but were ignored.
Lt. Col. Andrew Green, who worked closely with Raziq in 2010 and 2011, said that confirming the allegations had been impossible because the events happened deep in Taliban territory.
Moreover, he said, law enforcement in Afghanistan was barely functional. The courts were corrupt, and most people could pay their way out of jail, leaving the police with few options.
“In Afghanistan, the police shoot people,” he said. “While you can’t say it’s a good thing, it’s sort of what is done.”
The worries about Raziq spread. A State Department report documented a 2006 episode in which he executed 16 men he accused of being Taliban. In 2009, he was accused of torture and keeping private prisons by the Afghan human rights commission.
The so-called surge became a major turning point for him. In 2009, hoping to beat back a resurgent Taliban, President Barack Obama announced that he would send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan, focusing on Kandahar and Helmand provinces, two Taliban strongholds.
The Americans wanted a partner who was unafraid to confront the Taliban head-on, like Raziq. Yet they were also debating what to do about “bad actors” who undermined the legitimacy of the Afghan government, also like Raziq.
“There were lots of conversations about whether we should mentor Raziq or imprison him,” recalled Green, who had investigated him for other issues, including graft.
The Americans chose the former. They needed him.
After the police chief of Kandahar was assassinated in 2011, Raziq was given the job. He became a general and appointed commanders from his Achakzai tribe to key positions in Kandahar.
United Nations investigators called four of them — three of whom were his relatives — the “four horsemen” for the many allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings against them. One of them, a Raziq family member, was responsible for organizing death squads, according to police officers who worked with him. His men roved the city in unmarked cars, wearing plainclothes.
Deeming the court system corrupt, Raziq ordered his commanders to kill suspected Taliban, former officers and officials said. Those who refused to kill captives were dismissed.
“He told me: ‘Why are you bringing these Taliban to the station? Why aren’t you killing them? What are you afraid of?’” said one former city district chief who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
The victims were taken for a “sand picnic” and dumped in remote areas, down wells or where the shifting desert sands would cover them, according to former police officers and internal United Nations reports.
One senior police officer said he had complained to Raziq about finding bodies dumped in his district.
“I told him, ‘They’re in my area; it’s going to be blamed on me,’” the officer said. He recalled Raziq laughing before agreeing to tell his men to be more careful.
A 2013 United Nations report noted a surge in unidentified bodies, some still handcuffed, dumped in Kandahar City and dozens of reported disappearances, citing the “increased the level of brutality” and torture under Raziq.
Within two months of his appointment as police chief, the Americans stopped transferring detainees to Afghan security forces in Kandahar because of reports of abuses and executions.
“I pulled the intel on the guy, and it was pretty horrific,” Allen said.
Still, American support continued to flow to Raziq, who was popular with U.S. officers and considered vital to winning the war.
While Col. Bill Carty, the head of U.S. Special Forces in Kandahar, was visiting Raziq in 2012, a suicide bomber struck. Carty threw himself on top of Raziq to shield him, and then gave the general his own body armor to wear, according to an account Carty gave in the book, “One Hundred Victories,” and confirmed to the Times.
“Why did you give me your vest?” Raziq asked.
“There are thousands of me,” Carty recalled replying, emphasizing the importance of Raziq’s role as police chief. “But there is only one of you.”
Guests of the general
At his headquarters, Raziq greeted Fazul and the other family members in his white civilian robes. Because he couldn’t read, his secretary said aloud the names on the list Fazul had provided for him.
Getting the meeting was no easy feat. By then, the Taliban had made so many attempts on the general’s life that he joked to friends that he had lost count.
But in person, Raziq was polite, several of the attendees recalled, and allowed each of them to speak their minds. When everyone finished, the general spoke.
He did not trust the courts, the families recounted him saying. The judges let criminals go free, the prosecutors were ineffective, and justice could always be bought for a price. He preferred to administer his own justice.
He spoke to a few family members directly, including Shah Mohammad, whose brother, Neda, was on Fazul’s list. The general told him that Neda had been involved in the murder of police officers, an accusation he struggled to believe; Neda sold vegetables from a pushcart in the market.
Before the meeting ended, the general turned to Seema, whose adoptive son Daud had disappeared months earlier. He would be returned, the general said without explanation.
Not long after, Daud was set free.
After getting out, Daud told the families how he had been kept in a dark cell for months at an unofficial detention site. He was beaten and abused regularly, until, after the general’s intervention, he was transferred to a formal prison before being let go. He told the others that he had not seen any of their loved ones.
Still, a painful wave of hope washed over the families. They began to dream that, perhaps, their children might still be alive. But that is the problem with hope, and not knowing: Without the closure of death, they could never properly grieve.
For the perpetrators, disappearances carry a cruel logic. Though they can be crimes against humanity, there is little evidence without a body, especially when someone is snatched without witnesses or by officers in civilian clothes and cars.
Yet the disappearances inflicted unique wounds for many Afghans. Often, wives were told they could not remarry until their husbands were proved dead. Some with young children were left unable to support themselves.
“What General Raziq did in terms of killing and disappearing was worse than everything else that happened in the rest of Afghanistan,” said Sayed Abdul Karim, the father of one of the young men on Fazul’s list. “I wish that we could bury his bones somewhere. If we had a grave, we could go there and pray.”
The cruelty bred other cruelties, like the cottage industry of hustlers that emerged to take advantage of parents’ desperation. Fazul and his mother fell victim to a scam, traveling to Kabul to pay an intelligence official several thousand dollars for Ahmad’s return, a trip that nearly ended with Fazul himself getting kidnapped. Others paid more.
Some decided their families should be joined by more than tragedy alone. Fazul’s cousin married the son of the missing rickshaw driver, Saluhuddin.
He had been gone so long that, by then, his son was of marrying age.
The insurgents rise
The shock came on Oct. 18, 2018: Raziq was gunned down by a Taliban assassin who had infiltrated the governor’s guards.
The Taliban crowed.
They had long used Raziq’s brutality to recruit fighters and whip up anger in videos and pamphlets that showcased his abuses.
But his death allowed the insurgents to broadcast their ability to kill even the most protected commanders — one who was walking just paces away from Miller, the top American commander in Afghanistan, at the time of his death.
The Taliban said they had chosen to target Raziq over anyone else at the meeting, including the American four-star general, who escaped injury.
“He was more important to us than Scott Miller,” said Maulavi Ebrar Ahmad Habib, a Taliban commander who oversaw assassinations in Kandahar during those years.
Fazul and the others hoped things would change with Raziq’s death. For the most part, nothing did.
Raziq’s brother, Tadin, took over as police chief of Kandahar. He told the Times that neither he nor his brother had waged campaigns of forced disappearances. Officials said he simply continued the system his brother had built.
When the war began, Fazul and the others imagined the Americans would bring investment and opportunity. They envisioned good jobs, better homes, prosperity. But their good will evaporated quickly as their loved ones disappeared.
It was not that everyone embraced the Taliban, residents said; they just came to detest the Afghan government and the Americans who propped it up.
That erosion of support — not just among the families of the missing, but also among many Afghans disenchanted by the broader corruption and unchecked abuses of the Americans and their Afghan partners — was part of the collapse of Kandahar, as it was elsewhere in the country.
The impunity and criminality that Raziq fostered metastasized after his death, eating away at Kandahar from within. As the Taliban grew stronger, wage and supply theft within government forces devastated morale, as did infighting among his commanders, paralyzing their ability to fight.
Fazul’s group prayed for an insurgent victory, clinging to the hope that once the government was toppled, they might discover what had become of their relatives.
And once the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government in 2021, the Taliban went from prison to prison, emptying cells.
Thousands of people from across the province flooded into Kandahar City. Fazul heard that hundreds of prisoners had been extracted from the basement of the police headquarters. Huge crowds gathered outside of the governor’s compound, jostling for a look at those who exited.
Fazul joined them, racing downtown to scour public facilities. Having no luck in Kandahar City, he and others descended on Spin Boldak, where Raziq got his start. Hundreds waited there, too, scanning the crowds for their missing loved ones. Fazul counted the people freed from unofficial detention sites. His brother wasn’t one of them.
Rohullah Akhunzada, who was part of Fazul’s group, looked for his own brother in a basement prison, its dank, low ceilings a harrowing indication of what so many Afghans had been forced to endure. He found no sign of him.
“We still don’t know,” he said.
Having looked everywhere, another of Fazul’s compatriots, Fazl Raheem, approached the Taliban to ask for news of his brother.
The Taliban told him that all of the prisons had been emptied. Everyone still alive is already with their families, he recalled them saying.
The crowds drifted, hoping for one more place their loved ones could materialize. Many went to the crowded bus station in Kandahar City to scan the prisoners returning from Bagram Air Base, where the Americans, and later the Afghans, had kept thousands of detainees.
The urgency and desperation rose like a fever. So, too, did the familiar despondence when Fazul’s brother was nowhere to be found.
A legacy ignored
Since the collapse, mass graves have turned up in Kandahar, prompting renewed searches from relatives who show up at desert sites and hospital morgues, or share photographs of skeletal remains. But there is no organized search for the missing in Kandahar.
After years of pressure from the United States, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have said they are de-prioritizing investigations into abuses committed by U.S.-backed forces. The United Nations has focused on abuses carried out by the new Taliban government, accusing it of its own campaign of extrajudicial killings and torture.
The Times sued the U.S. government for its files on Raziq. Nearly a year later, the military and the State Department have turned over only a handful of documents. Few military leaders from that era had any interest in revisiting his legacy, and what it reveals about the American war effort.
“The reason you have insurgencies is because of injustice, and Raziq represented the very worst,” Allen said. He added: “Raziq created the very injustice that gave the Taliban its edge on us.”
To commemorate Raziq, the former Afghan government had begun erecting a mausoleum for him, a giant, mosque-like structure beside the governor’s palace, a memorial fit for a national hero. Many see him that way, as a champion of those who oppose the Taliban.
Rather than destroy it, the Taliban have surrounded the edifice with concrete blast walls, careful not to antagonize the large swath of the population that still reveres the general. It is blocked but visible, its dome and minarets peeking over the barrier.
There are no monuments to the missing. Of the 17 people on his original list, Fazul knows of only three who came home alive.
“I still have hope that he will return, even though I know he is probably dead,” said Malika, Fazul and Ahmad’s mother. “My tears have not dried since he disappeared.”

Biden's 'Future' Problem: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Between Kentucky and Ohio, there's a bridge that will eventually be rebuilt and replaced. Early last year, Joe Biden flew there and stood next to Mitch McConnell and they celebrated the $ 1.6 billion dedicated to this bridge from the infrastructure law's $ 1.2 trillion budget. Sixteen months later, $ 15.7 million of federal funds have been spent toward the project, while the yearslong formal process for awarding the bulk of the money continues. Billions and billions of infrastructure money is similarly slowly winding its way through various processes, but, as Politico recently reported in an in-depth look at Mr. Biden's domestic agenda, only some of it has been actually spent.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, has a huge team cutting grants in the billions and has said her goal is that 20 percent of the world's most advanced logic semiconductors will be produced in the United States by the end of the decade, a transformative shift made possible through deals with Taiwanese and Korean-based firms and major government support to Intel. Currently the percentage produced is zero. Some of those factories might come online next year.
In reporting about voters' views of Mr. Biden, it's clear that at least some think he's hardly doing anything at all -- and that if re-elected, there might be no change. In the way the Biden campaign talks sometimes, they make it sound like manufacturing is already booming. He's trapped in an in-between: Bigger changes are coming, and the things people said they wanted are coming, but not for years.
Dispersing funds on this scale takes years. To rewire international chip production takes years. To rebuild a bridge often takes years. Companies announce they will build factories to build chips and solar panels, and at a certain point, but not quite now, they very likely will. Someday, years from now, a new bridge will exist. In the intervening years, people will just have to imagine the bridge. Who feels the presence of a factory that isn't yet there?
The Mr. Biden of 2020 was right; he could get Congress to pass major pieces of legislation. The CHIPS Act really might recalibrate chip manufacturing globally and -- if fully implemented -- the infrastructure and clean-energy laws will plow billions into physical and green infrastructure in the United States. This stuff is what many people said they wanted from a presidency (to make things in the U.S., to repair physical infrastructure).
But the physical results are happening on a timetable of years in the future. Even in the building trades' recent and effusively pro-Biden, anti-Trump endorsement video, the challenge in how to perceive this agenda is framed through future-present reflection: "I think we'll step back from where we're at in a few years and we'll realize how big the impact of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris has been."
Time has loomed over the Biden presidency in any number of ways. There is, of course, his age, which voters worry about, and which has probably changed him in ways good and bad, like it does for anyone. But voters have changed and aged, too: The public's memory of Donald Trump's presidency seems to have faded and also warmed, even as he goes darker and more illiberal.
The very youngest voters -- some of the ones who seem to have problems with Mr. Biden -- were 10 years old when Mr. Trump won in 2016. "I don't think Trump carries the same negative baggage with this youngest cohort as he does with older ones," John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics who studies the youth vote, told The Dispatch earlier this year. Those younger voters are some of the same who have no prior adult experience with sustained inflation or interest rate increases, and have already racked up a lot of debt.
Time hangs over this election. It is what we're talking about, daily, with abortion limits. Time, too, is money lost: This presidency is the first one in decades during which inflation has eaten away at what people can buy and think they ought to be able to buy. Mortgage rates have suspended time a bit: People who might otherwise sell now are contemplating worse rates. This presidency began during the pandemic, a kind of time warp of disrupted routines and unstable expectations; people said they wanted things to return to normal, but the world ended up remaining chaotic.
In the winter, The Wall Street Journal interviewed a wide range of Americans about their dark thoughts about the strong economy, and found the idea of global chaos and dysfunction colored people's thinking -- like even good times could not be preserved. "Even though I'm OK right now, there's a sense it could all go away in a second," said one woman, who seemed to be in a good financial position.
Mr. Biden's re-election effort is currently being talked about in terms of how much time is left to change its trajectory and ensure victory, though months do remain. There's a vaguely haunting question in the latest New York Times/Siena College poll about what level of change Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump might effect if elected. Sixty-nine percent of registered voters say they want major changes, including 14 percent who want the political and economic system to "be torn down entirely." With Mr. Trump, 70 percent of people say there will be major changes or the system will be torn down. With Mr. Biden, 71 percent say there will be minor changes or none at all. What kind of change each voter has in mind is unknown.
People wanted things to get back to normal after the pandemic, and now they want perhaps a different kind of change. People always say they want bridges and roads, but maybe the timetable for bridges and roads just isn't enough for them. Some of the same people who fear the idea of the economy breaking Mr. Biden's re-election prospects, even if the economy is working for them, also expected more from this presidency -- even people who'd never think of doing anything but vote for Mr. Biden.
More of what? The "more" people seem to want can sometimes be articulated clearly in economic or foreign policy decisions, and at other times it sounds more like a vibe that would be hard to measure. Mr. Biden talks about the Constitution, free speech, unions, racism, antisemitism, morals and civil society -- but people seem to want something more there, too, maybe something more cohesive, to connect events into a narrative that people actually hear and thread through their lives.
Can you get to a future where inflation is over, and the bridge and the factory are up and running? How fast is fast enough?

Robert Dennard, 91, an IBM Engineer Whose Discovery Changed Computing: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He invented DRAM, the technology that allowed for the faster and higher-capacity memory storage that is the basis for modern computing.
Robert H. Dennard, an engineer who invented the silicon memory technology that plays an indispensable role in every smartphone, laptop and tablet computer, died on April 23 in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He was 91.
The cause of death, at a hospital, was a bacterial infection, said his daughter, Holly Dennard.
Mr. Dennard's pioneering work began at IBM in the 1960s, when the equipment to hold and store computer data was expensive, hulking -- often room-size machines -- and slow. He was studying the emerging field of microelectronics, which used silicon-based transistors to store digital bits of information.
In 1966, Mr. Dennard invented a way to store one digital bit on one transistor -- a technology called dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, which holds the information as an electrical charge that slowly fades over time and must be refreshed periodically.
His discovery opened the door to previously unimaginable improvement in data capacity, with lower costs and higher speeds all using tiny silicon chips.
DRAM has been the basis of steady progress in the decades since. High-speed, high-capacity memory chips hold and quickly shuttle data to a computer's microprocessor, which converts it into text, sound and images. Streaming videos on YouTube, playing music on Spotify or Apple Music and using A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT depend on them.
"DRAM has made much of modern computing possible," said John Hennessy, a computer scientist and chair of Alphabet, Google's parent company.
Mr. Dennard also devised a concept that has served as a road map for future advances in microelectronics. Debuted in an initial paper in 1972, and fleshed out in another two years later, he described the physics that would allow transistors to shrink and become more powerful and less costly, even as the energy each one consumed would remain almost constant.
The principle, known as Dennard scaling, was complementary to a prediction made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, who went on to co-found Intel. Mr. Moore claimed that the number of transistors that could be crammed onto a silicon chip could be doubled about every two years -- and that computing power and speeds would accelerate on that trajectory. His prediction became known as Moore's Law.
Moore's Law concerned the density of transistors on a chip, whereas Dennard scaling mainly concerned power consumption, and by 2005, it reached its limits: Transistors had become so tiny, they began to leak electrons, causing chips to heat up and consume more energy.
But Mr. Dennard's approach to identifying challenges in the technology, researchers say, has had a lasting impact on chip development.
"Everybody in semiconductors studied his principles to get where we are today," said Lisa Su, chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a large chipmaker, and a former colleague of Mr. Dennard's at IBM.
Robert Dennard was born on Sept. 5, 1932, in Terrell, Texas, the youngest of four children. His father, Buford Dennard, was a dairy farmer, and his mother, Loma Dennard, was a homemaker who also worked in a school cafeteria.
The family moved east when Robert was a small child, and he began his education in a one-room schoolhouse near Carthage, Texas. The family later moved to Irving, then a small town, when his father got a job with a fertilizer company there.
Growing up, Robert developed an appreciation for the arts, reading the H.G. Wells stories and Ogden Nash poems that his oldest sister, Evangeline, had left behind when she departed Texas to be an Army nurse during World War II. In an oral history interview for the Computer History Museum in 2009, he recalled listening countless times to an album of Sigmund Romberg operettas. "She left me behind some really good things to start off some kind of intellectual career," he said of his sister.
In high school, he was a good student, especially in math and English, and had planned to go to a nearby junior college. But his aptitude for music offered a different path. He played the E-flat bass in his high school band, and when the director of the Southern Methodist University band visited, he offered Robert a scholarship.
"That was my opportunity," Mr. Dennard recalled.
Though music was his entry point, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees in electrical engineering at the university. He later received a Ph.D. from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University.
In 1958, Mr. Dennard was hired by IBM, where he spent his entire career until retiring in 2014.
He was married three times. He and his second wife, Mary Dolores (Macewitz) Dennard, divorced in 1984, and in 1995 he married Frances Jane Bridges.
In addition to his daughter and his wife, Mr. Dennard is survived by another daughter, Amy Dennard, and four grandchildren. His son, Robert H. Dennard Jr., died in 1998.
Over his career, Mr. Dennard produced 75 patents and received several scientific awards, including the National Medal of Technology from President Ronald Reagan in 1988 and the Kyoto Prize in advanced technology from the Inamori Foundation, in Japan, in 2019.
In the 2009 interview, when Mr. Dennard was asked what advice he would give a young person interested in science and technology, he pointed to his own "very humble upbringing" and said "anybody can participate in this."
"There is opportunity there," he said. "These things don't happen by themselves. It takes real people, making these breakthroughs."

Despite Billions in Investments, President Trails in Arizona and Georgia: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The states have been major beneficiaries of the Biden administration's key economic policies, such as spending on infrastructure, manufacturing and clean energy.
President Biden's economic policies have helped spur billions of dollars in new investments in Arizona and Georgia, two crucial battleground states in the 2024 election. Yet so far, Mr. Biden's policies appear to have done little to lift his support in either region.
Arizona and Georgia have been major beneficiaries of the Biden administration's key policy initiatives -- the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law.
Arizona has become one of the top states for new semiconductor investments, which have totaled more than $ 100 billion since the CHIPS Act was introduced, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Georgia has been a big beneficiary of Mr. Biden's clean energy and infrastructure laws. The state received $ 40 billion in private sector commitments and $ 10.8 billion in public investments in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing under Mr. Biden, according to White House data as of last month.
Still, former President Donald J. Trump has maintained a significant lead over Mr. Biden in both states, according to new polls by The New York Times and Siena College.
That dynamic illustrates one of Mr. Biden's central challenges ahead of the presidential election. While his administration is spending huge sums of money to try and bolster American manufacturing across the country, those investments have yet to measurably show up in political support.
In part, economists say, that is because the policies that Mr. Biden has championed affect a relatively small share of a state's work force.
Scott Lincicome, a trade policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was a "classic problem" of using industrial policy to win votes. The benefits tend to be concentrated in a few sectors, and the vast majority of people in a state like Georgia or Arizona will not directly feel the impacts of policies that aim to boost manufacturing, he said.
"Even if you expand it out to construction, you're just talking about a small amount of a work force," Mr. Lincicome said. "So it's a bit of a tough sell."
Still, the administration's efforts to jump-start domestic manufacturing in Arizona and Georgia have resulted in significant private sector investments, and White House officials say the country is starting to see more projects come online and jobs being created.
Arizona has received $ 120.9 billion in private sector commitments and $ 15.4 billion in public investments in clean energy, infrastructure and manufacturing during the Biden administration, according to White House data as of April. Many new semiconductor projects are benefiting from the CHIPS Act, which aims to spur American chip manufacturing through federal grants and loans.
Last month, the administration awarded up to $ 6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is investing more than $ 65 billion into a new chip manufacturing hub in Phoenix.
Georgia is among the states benefiting most from new clean energy investments since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains various tax credits and other subsidies to encourage companies to deploy more clean energy projects. The state has seen a barrage of new investments in battery plants and electric vehicle manufacturing in recent years.
Both Arizona and Georgia are also receiving billions in federal infrastructure funds meant to rebuild roads and bridges, expand access to high-speed internet and replace toxic lead pipes.
Still, the federal efforts might not be swaying voters given that manufacturing does not employ as many workers as, say, the service sector. The share of manufacturing workers compared to total nonfarm employment in the United States has been declining for decades, in part because factories are able to make more goods with fewer people. In 2023, the manufacturing employment share was about 8 percent, down from about 13 percent in 2000.
The effects of industrial policies can also take more time to materialize, Mr. Lincicome said. Many new clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing projects are still years away from completion.
In Arizona, T.S.M.C.'s project has created construction jobs. But production at its first factory is not expected to start until next year, and production at its second facility is not expected to start until 2028.
Lee McPheters, an economist at Arizona State University, said new semiconductor and infrastructure investments were contributing to strong growth in construction employment in the state, but they have not had a substantial impact on manufacturing employment.
"All that's in the future," Mr. McPheters said.
Some say the investments are having significant indirect economic impacts. Chris Camacho, the president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said new projects tied to the federal efforts have led to more housing and commercial development in surrounding areas.
Many projects funded by the 2021 infrastructure law are also still underway or have yet to start. Transportation projects often take years to complete, and the law was designed to be a five-year bill, meaning that the money was not meant to be spent immediately.
For instance, the law provided $ 5 billion for a new national network of fast electric vehicle chargers, but only a handful of states have opened stations recently. The Brent Spence Bridge Corridor Project, which was awarded over $ 1 billion in federal grants more than a year ago, has been heralded by Mr. Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader. But the project only recently cleared an environmental review, a key step before officials can begin construction.
Still, Mr. Lincicome said the Biden administration's policies were having some economic effects. There has been a notable acceleration in construction spending on manufacturing in recent months, he said. Biden administration officials have also pointed to job gains in various construction fields, including nonresidential building construction.
Jennifer Harris, a former Biden administration economic policy official, said the investments did not have "as much voter penetration as they should," but she noted that many projects were still in the early stages and would continue to progress.
Biden campaign officials said Mr. Biden has "delivered where Trump failed the American people" through strong job creation, lower costs and billions in investments in communities that have long been left behind.
"All of this is on the line this November: If Trump sets foot in the Oval Office, he'll make it his mission to undo this progress," Charles Lutvak, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.
Gaining credit for the surge of investments, though, could remain a challenge for Democrats. Charles S. Bullock III, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said voters in the state were probably aware of new clean energy projects, but they were not associating them with Mr. Biden.
Although Biden administration officials have traveled to battleground states like Georgia to champion their achievements, Mr. Bullock noted that state leaders were also promoting clean energy projects.
Mr. Bullock said voters might also care more about grocery store prices if they have not been directly affected by the new investments. "You're probably going to be concentrated much more on remembering what an item cost a year ago or four years ago," he said.
People are also more likely to associate infrastructure projects with local officials rather than federal officials who are miles away, said Adie Tomer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies infrastructure policy. Many projects, such as investments in water infrastructure, are also less visible than large-scale projects, making it harder for voters to see the full effects, he said.
Some Democrats argue that they still have time to sell the president's economic policies before the election.
"It is still very early in the election cycle," said Representative Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of Georgia's Democratic Party. "We have a lot of work to do. I acknowledge that, and we're continuing to have the conversations on the ground."

Full text: The grant is the latest federal award in a series stemming from the CHIPS and Science Act meant to ramp up domestic production of vital semiconductors.
Federal officials will provide up to $ 120 million in grants to Polar Semiconductor to help the company expand its chip manufacturing facility in Minnesota, the Biden administration announced on Monday, the latest in a string of awards meant to strengthen the U.S. supply of semiconductors.
Commerce Department officials said the grant would help Polar upgrade technology and double production capacity at its facility in Bloomington, Minn., within two years. The company produces chips that are critical for cars, defense systems and electrical grids, federal officials said.
"We are making taxpayer dollars go as far as possible while crowding in private and state investment to create jobs, secure our supply chains and bolster manufacturing in Minnesota," said Laurie Locascio, the under secretary of commerce for standards and technology.
The funding stems from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022 to ramp up the domestic production of commercial semiconductors, the tiny chips crucial for most electronics, including smartphones, computers, cars and weapons systems. The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute to companies to incentivize the construction and expansion of new plants in the United States.
Scaling up domestic chip production is a major component of President Biden's economic policy agenda, which largely focuses on bolstering American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are produced in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Biden administration officials have so far announced awards of more than $ 29 billion. Last month, the Commerce Department announced up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to Micron to help the chipmaker build plants in New York and Idaho. Other chipmakers -- including Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have received multibillion-dollar awards. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three federal awards.
The United States is trying to ramp up domestic production of semiconductors in part to prevent the kinds of expensive and economically damaging chip shortages that cropped up during the pandemic. Federal officials said Polar's award would help head off those types of disruptions.
"During the Covid-19 pandemic, shortages of these chips were among the most acute bottlenecks," Ms. Locascio said. "Because of President Biden's leadership, the future of the semiconductor industry is being built right here in the United States."
Similar to other recipients, Polar will have to meet certain milestones before getting the payments, federal officials said. The company is also planning to claim federal tax credits that help reduce the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment.
Minnesota is also providing about $ 75 million in grants to Polar's expansion project, which is expected to cost more than $ 525 million. The company's expansion will create more than 160 manufacturing and construction jobs in Minnesota, federal officials said.
The federal award will help Polar establish itself as a U.S.-owned independent foundry, which will allow the company to expand its customer base, administration officials said. So-called foundry services involve the manufacturing of chips that are designed and marketed by other companies.
Surya Iyer, the president and chief operating officer of Polar, said that the money was critical for the company's expansion and that without it, a project of this size would not be possible.
"We're talking about a small single-digit percent expansion rather than the huge effort that we're going to put in now," Mr. Iyer said.

U.S. Questions Whether It Should Trust World Anti-Doping Agency: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Concerns are growing that the body whose job is keeping sports free of illegal drugs is failing at that mission, leading Congress to question U.S. support.
Two months before the Olympics are scheduled to begin in Paris, the global agency tasked with policing doping in sports is facing a growing crisis as it fends off allegations it helped cover up the positive tests of elite Chinese swimmers who went on to compete -- and win medals -- at the last Summer Games.
The allegations are particularly vexing for the World Anti-Doping Agency, which has long billed itself as the gold standard in the worldwide movement for clean sports, because they raise the specter that the agency -- and by extension the entire system set up to try to keep the Olympics clean -- cannot be trusted.
Athletes are openly questioning whether WADA can be relied upon to do its core job of ensuring there will be a level playing field in Paris, where some of the same Chinese swimmers are favorites to win more medals.
And in recent days, pressure on WADA has increased significantly, particularly from the United States, which is one of the agency's chief funders, and as new questions have emerged about WADA's appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate the allegations, and whether WADA has provided an accurate account to the public about the appointment, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
On Wednesday, the Biden administration's top drug official -- who is also a member of WADA's executive committee -- sent a stinging letter to the antidoping agency laying out how it needs to appoint a truly independent commission to investigate how the positive tests were handled and demanding that its executive board hold an emergency meeting within the next 10 days.
"Let me underscore the extreme concern I have been hearing directly from American athletes and their representatives on this issue," the official, Dr. Rahul Gupta, wrote in the letter, which was sent on Biden administration letterhead. "As I have shared with you, the athletes have expressed they are heading into the Olympic and Paralympic Games with serious concerns about whether the playing field is level and the competition fair."
That same day, the senator in charge of the subcommittee that provides funding to WADA, Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said, "We need answers before we support future funding." (The United States contributes more to WADA's budget -- pledging more than $ 3.6 million this year -- than any nation; the International Olympic Committee matches whatever the United States gives.)
Then on Friday, a congressional aide said that a bipartisan House committee investigating the Chinese Communist Party had begun looking into the positive tests.
Lilly King, a two-time Olympic gold-medalist and a member of U.S.A. Swimming's Athletes' Advisory Council, said that she no longer trusts that WADA is doing its job to keep athletes who violate antidoping rules out of the Games.
"I am not confident when I get up on the blocks that the people to my right and my left are clean," Ms. King said in a telephone interview on Friday. "And that's really unfortunate, because that's not something I should have to focus on while racing at the Olympics."
The mounting pressure and growing concerns about the credibility of Olympic competitions have been met with silence from the two groups that account for a major portion of the International Olympic Committee's revenue: its chief broadcaster and sponsors.
NBC, whose broadcast rights payments comprise a significant portion of the I.O.C.'s total budget, did not respond to a question about whether it was confident it would be broadcasting an Olympics in which viewers could trust that the athletes they were watching would be clean.
The multimillion-dollar Olympic sponsors -- Visa, Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Intel -- did not respond to messages seeking comment on whether they were concerned about linking their brands with a Games in which athletes have expressed concerns about cheating. Allianz, a German financial services company, also declined to comment.
The Times reported last month that WADA failed to follow its own rules after 23 elite Chinese swimmers all tested positive for the same banned drug in 2021, months before the last Summer Olympics. The drug -- trimetazidine, known as TMZ -- is a prescription heart medication, but it is popular among athletes looking for an advantage because it helps them train harder, recover faster and quickly moves through the body, making it more difficult to detect.
Two days after the Times article was published, WADA's president, Witold Banka, and other top officials from the agency held a news conference during which they said they had no choice but to accept the explanation provided by China's antidoping agency for the positive tests. The Chinese agency claimed that all of the swimmers had inadvertently ingested the drug because they ate food from a kitchen contaminated by TMZ.
In the days that followed, WADA published a lengthy document that again tried to explain its decision.
But neither move satisfied athletes, sports officials and antidoping officials perplexed by WADA's apparent unwillingness to pursue its own investigation of the positive tests. Within days of the news becoming public, however, WADA appointed a special prosecutor, Eric Cottier, to review its handling of the case.
That decision, too, quickly drew criticism.
Mr. Cottier is a former attorney general of Vaud, a Swiss region that has become the center of international sports, and that is home to several sports organizations, including the I.O.C. But interviews showed that Mr. Cottier had been nominated to lead the investigation by the official who was in charge of auditing the agency's intelligence and investigations department at the time the Chinese swimmers tested positive.
The auditor, Jacques Antenen, served as Vaud's police chief under Mr. Cottier when he was Vaud's attorney general. In a telephone interview on May 3, Mr. Antenen said he had contacted Olivier Niggli, WADA's most senior administrator, in the days after the disclosure of the positive tests to suggest that Mr. Cottier might be a good choice to lead the investigation.
"I didn't recommend him; I just said if you need someone, it's a good choice," Mr. Antenen said. He said he did not know if others had been considered for the role.
Regardless of Mr. Cottier's abilities and qualifications, his physical proximity to figures close to WADA, the I.O.C. and the sports movement are problematic, governance experts said.
Mr. Cottier and Christoph de Kepper, the I.O.C.'s director general, were among the people who celebrated Mr. Antenen's retirement from the police force at a party in 2022. The I.O.C. contributes half of WADA's annual $ 40 million budget.
The celebration, which was featured in the police service's in-house magazine, was first reported by The Associated Press. A caption with a picture of two of the men in the magazine reads, "Attorney General Eric Cottier came to greet his old friend Jacques Antenen."
A WADA spokesman, James Fitzgerald, said his agency had, in fact, contacted Mr. Antenen first, to ask "if he knew of someone with the requisite credentials, independence and availability to carry out a thorough review of WADA's handling on this case."
"These attempts to slur the integrity of a highly regarded professional just as he begins his work are getting more and more ridiculous and are designed to undermine the process," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
There are also new questions about WADA's public statements related to the appointment of Mr. Cottier. In a statement to The Times, WADA said it had discussed Mr. Cottier's appointment with its board before formally appointing him to the role.
But Dr. Gupta's Office of National Drug Control Policy said in a statement that shortly before the formal announcement of Mr. Cottier's hiring in April, WADA told its board an investigator had already been chosen.
Dr. Gupta said in his letter to WADA that he was "deeply concerned" that the executive committee "was not adequately briefed with essential information throughout this process."
Current and former athletes are now asking for more testing worldwide heading into the Paris Games, but they acknowledged that their concerns about the global antidoping regulator are unlikely to be allayed in time for the opening ceremony.
Ms. King, the American swimmer, said that when she learned of the undisclosed positive tests, she felt as if this were a replay of her experience from the 2016 Rio Olympics, when she won a gold medal in the 100-meter breaststroke over a Russian swimmer, Yulia Efimova, who had failed a drug test earlier that year but was allowed to compete after the result was overturned on appeal.
Katie Meili, an athlete representative on U.S.A. Swimming's board of directors and the bronze medalist in that race behind Ms. King and Ms. Efimova, said athletes had "put a ton of faith in WADA."
"Yes, the positive tests are a concern, and that's a bad thing," she said. "But even more concerning to me is that the international regulator is not doing their job."

Billions in CHIPS Grants Are Expected to Fuel Growth: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United States will triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, the largest increase in the world, according to a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.
Billions in federal subsidies for semiconductor manufacturers are expected to help reverse a decades-long decline in America's share of global chip manufacturing.
The United States will triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, the largest increase in the world, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group. As a result, America's share of world chip manufacturing is expected to rise for the first time in decades, to 14 percent by 2032, up from about 10 percent today.
The report found that much of the industry's growth would be fueled by the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to encourage semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Absent that legislation, America's share of global chip manufacturing would have fallen to 8 percent by 2032, according to the report.
The United States is also expected to see a substantial boost in the domestic production of advanced logic chips, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones and autonomous vehicles. Bolstering the production of the most advanced semiconductors has been a central goal for the Biden administration. Federal officials contend that in order for the country to lead in major technological industries, it will need to have a more reliable supply of the most advanced semiconductors.
The 2022 CHIPS Act aimed to re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of semiconductors, the vital components that power everything from phones and computers to electric vehicles and weapons systems. In addition to providing grants to chipmakers, the law established federal tax credits that help companies defray the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment.
A key finding from the report is that the United States is expected to produce nearly 30 percent of all advanced logic chips by 2032, up from essentially zero today. Some companies that have recently received federal awards have committed to producing leading-edge semiconductors in the United States in the coming years, including Samsung, Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Biden administration officials have already announced awards totaling more than $ 29 billion in recent months. Those included up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to Micron to help the memory-chip maker build manufacturing plants in New York and Idaho. Other big chipmakers -- including Samsung, TSMC and Intel -- have also received awards. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems were the first three recipients of federal money.
Other governments, including the European Union, Japan and China, have also offered new or expanded incentives to entice chipmakers to build plants in recent years. Companies have made significant investments in response. Private-sector investment in semiconductor production is projected to grow to about $ 2.3 trillion between 2024 and 2032, according to the report. The United States is expected to capture about 30 percent of those capital expenditures, second only to Taiwan, the report found.
"Everyone else is growing pretty fast, but we're growing at a breathtaking speed," said John Neuffer, the president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which lobbied for the bill. "That's very much because of our policy responses through the CHIPS Act."
Chris Miller, author of the book "Chip War" and a professor at Tufts University, said the report showed there was "real evidence" that the incentives included in the CHIPS Act were "changing businesses' investment decisions." He added that the projected increase in America's production of advanced chips would also be a substantial change.
Still, challenges remain. A lack of construction workers, technicians and electricians could make it more difficult for companies to build and operate manufacturing plants, the report's authors wrote. They also maintain that "sustained support" may be necessary to further strengthen America's semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Federal officials could consider the need for future incentives, such as a permanent tax credit that is broadened to cover semiconductor design, the authors wrote.
"It will be critical for policymakers in the United States and elsewhere to 'stay the course' by extending current support as well as considering additional measures to strengthen resilience," the authors wrote.

Markets' Lull Stretches to a Second Day With a Mixed Finish: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's lull stretched into a second day, as U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed close in a quiet Wednesday.
The S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. It edged down by 0.03 percent to 5,187.67. It was coming off a very slight gain from Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 172.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 29.80, or 0.2 percent, to 16,302.76.
Uber Technologies slumped 5.7 percent after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.
Shopify tumbled 18.6 percent despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $ 1 in revenue.
Match Group sank 5.4 percent despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps for connecting people gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts'. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.
Intel fell 2.2 percent after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.
Those decliners helped to offset Lyft, which revved 7.1 percent higher after it topped expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.
Reddit was another winner and rose 4 percent after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.
Arista Networks climbed 6.5 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.
Most companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.
Treasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses. It rose to 4.50 percent from 4.46 percent late Tuesday.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, ticked up to 4.84 percent from 4.83 percent.
The stock market also found some support following April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research. He said the market's zigzag pattern since March "is likely to remain as we search for a catalyst."
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6 percent after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.

'A.I.' and 'Start-Up' Are a Tough Combination: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The table stakes for small companies to compete with the likes of Microsoft and Google are in the billions of dollars. And even that may not be enough.
Call it the end of the beginning of the A.I. boom.
Since mid-March, the financial pressure on several signature artificial intelligence start-ups has taken a toll. Inflection AI, which raised $ 1.5 billion but made almost no money, has folded its original business. Stability AI has laid off employees and parted ways with its chief executive. And Anthropic has raced to close the roughly $ 1.8 billion gap between its modest sales and enormous expenses.
The A.I. revolution, it is becoming clear in Silicon Valley, is going to come with a very big price tag. And the tech companies that have bet their futures on it are scrambling to figure out how to close the gap between those expenses and the profits they hope to make somewhere down the line.
This problem is particularly acute for a group of high-profile start-ups that have raised tens of billions of dollars for the development of generative A.I., the technology behind chatbots such as ChatGPT. Some of them are already figuring out that competing head-on with giants like Google, Microsoft and Meta is going to take billions of dollars -- and even that may not be enough.
"You can already see the writing on the wall," said Ali Ghodsi, chief executive of Databricks, a data warehouse and analysis company that works with A.I. start-ups. "It doesn't matter how cool it is what you do -- does it have business viability?"
While plenty of money has been burned in other tech booms, the expense of building A.I. systems has shocked tech industry veterans. Unlike the iPhone, which kicked off the last technology transition and cost a few hundred million dollars to develop because it largely relied on existing components, generative A.I. models cost billions to create and maintain. The cutting-edge chips they need are expensive and in short supply. And every query of an A.I. system costs far more than a simple Google search.
Investors have poured $ 330 billion into about 26,000 A.I. and machine-learning start-ups over the past three years, according to PitchBook, which tracks the industry. That's two-thirds more than the amount they spent funding 20,350 A.I. companies from 2018 through 2020.
The challenges hitting many newer A.I. companies stand in contrast to the early business results at OpenAI, which is backed by $ 13 billion from Microsoft. The attention it has generated with its ChatGPT system has allowed the company to build a business charging $ 20 a month for its premium chatbot and offered a way for businesses to build their A.I. services with the technology that drives its chatbot, which is called a large language model. OpenAI pulled in around $ 1.6 billion in revenue over the last year, but it is unclear how much the company is spending, two people familiar with the company's business said.
OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment.
But even OpenAI has had challenges broadening sales. Businesses are wary that the A.I. systems can generate inaccurate answers. The technology has also been troubled by questions about whether the data that supported the models infringed on copyrights.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Many investors point to Microsoft's rapid sales growth as evidence of A.I.'s business potential. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft reported an estimated $ 1 billion in sales from A.I. services in cloud computing, up from essentially nothing a year ago, said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel.
Meta, on the other hand, doesn't expect to make money for years off its A.I. products, even as it increases its infrastructure spending by up to $ 10 billion this year alone. "We're investing to stay at the leading edge of this," Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, said during a call with analysts last week. "And we're doing that at the time when we're also scaling the product before it is making money."
A.I. start-ups have been challenged by that gap between spending and sales. Anthropic, which has raised more than $ 7 billion with backing from Amazon and Google, is spending about $ 2 billion a year but pulling in only about $ 150 million to $ 200 million in revenue, said two people familiar with the company's financials, who requested anonymity because the figures are private.
Like OpenAI, Anthropic has turned to partnerships with large, established tech companies. Its chief executive, Dario Amodei, has been courting customers on Wall Street, and it recently announced that it was working with Accenture, the global consulting company, to create custom chatbots and A.I. systems for companies and government organizations.
Sally Aldous, a spokeswoman for Anthropic, said that thousands of businesses were using the company's technology and that millions of consumers were using its publicly available chatbot, Claude.
Stability AI, which does image generation, announced last month that its founding chief executive, Emad Mostaque, had resigned, just a week after the resignation of three researchers who were part of the five-person team that built the company's original technology.
It was on track to generate about $ 60 million in sales this year against about $ 96 million in costs from its image generation system, which has been available to customers since 2022, a person familiar with its business said.
Stability AI's financial position looks better than those of language-model makers like Anthropic because developing image generation systems is less expensive, A.I. investors said. But there's also less demand to pay for images, so the sales prospects are more uncertain.
Stability AI has been operating without the support of a tech giant. After raising $ 101 million from venture capitalists in 2022, it needed more funds last fall but was struggling to show investors that it could sell its technology to businesses, said two former employees, who declined to speak publicly because they were not authorized to do so. It raised $ 50 million from Intel late last year but still faced financial pressure, they said.
As the start-up grew, its sales strategy shifted, these people said. At the same time, it was spending millions a month on computing costs. Some investors pressured Mr. Mostaque to resign, according to an investor, who declined to speak publicly about a personnel issue. This month, after his resignation, Stability AI did layoffs and restructured its business to put the company on "a more sustainable path," according to a company memo reviewed by The New York Times.
Stability AI declined to comment. Mr. Mostaque declined to discuss his exit.
Inflection AI, a chatbot start-up founded by three A.I. veterans, had raised $ 1.5 billion from some of the biggest names in tech. But a year after introducing its A.I. personal assistant, it had almost no revenue, according to one investor. The Times reviewed a letter that Inflection had sent to investors saying additional fund-raising was "not the best use of our investors' money, especially in the context of the current frothy A.I. market."
In late March, it folded its original business and largely disappeared into Microsoft, the world's most valuable public company.
Microsoft also helped fund Inflection AI, whose chief executive, Mustafa Suleyman, rose to prominence as one of the founders of DeepMind, a seminal artificial intelligence lab that Google acquired in 2014. Mr. Suleyman founded Inflection AI alongside Karén Simonyan, a key DeepMind researcher, and Reid Hoffman, a leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist who helped found OpenAI and is on Microsoft's board.
Microsoft and Inflection AI declined to comment.
The company was steeped in talented A.I. researchers who had worked at places like Google and OpenAI.
But almost a year after releasing its A.I. personal assistant, Inflection AI's revenue was, in the words of one investor, "de minimis." Essentially zilch. It could not continue to improve its technologies and keep pace with chatbots from the likes of Google and OpenAI unless it continued to raise huge sums of money.
Now Microsoft is swallowing most of its staff, including Mr. Suleyman and Dr. Simonyan.
This is costing Microsoft more than $ 650 million. But unlike Inflection AI, it can afford to play the long game. It has announced plans for the staff to build an A.I. lab in London, working with the kind of systems the start-ups are hoping will break through.

Companies Spend Big To Hone Their A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The spending that the industry's giants expect artificial intelligence to require is starting to come into focus -- and it is jarringly large.
If 2023 was the tech industry's year of the A.I. chatbot, 2024 is turning out to be the year of A.I. plumbing. It may not sound as exciting, but tens of billions of dollars are quickly being spent on behind-the-scenes technology for the industry's A.I. boom.
Companies from Amazon to Meta are revamping their data centers to support artificial intelligence. They are investing in huge new facilities, while even places like Saudi Arabia are racing to build supercomputers to handle A.I. Nearly everyone with a foot in tech or giant piles of money, it seems, is jumping into a spending frenzy that some believe could last for years.
Microsoft, Meta, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, disclosed this week that they had spent more than $ 32 billion combined on data centers and other capital expenses in just the first three months of the year. The companies all said in calls with investors that they had no plans to slow down their A.I. spending.
In the clearest sign of how A.I. has become a story about building a massive technology infrastructure, Meta said on Wednesday that it needed to spend billions more on the chips and data centers for A.I. than it had previously signaled.
"I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to," Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, said in a call with investors.
The eye-popping spending reflects an old parable in Silicon Valley: The people who made the biggest fortunes in California's gold rush weren't the miners -- they were the people selling the shovels. No doubt Nvidia, whose chip sales have more than tripled over the last year, is the most obvious A.I. winner.
The money being thrown at technology to support artificial intelligence is also a reminder of spending patterns of the dot-com boom of the 1990s. For all of the excitement around web browsers and newfangled e-commerce websites, the companies making the real money were software giants like Microsoft and Oracle, the chipmaker Intel, and Cisco Systems, which made the gear that connected those new computer networks together.
But cloud computing has added a new wrinkle: Since most start-ups and even big companies from other industries contract with cloud computing providers to host their networks, the tech industry's biggest companies are spending big now in hopes of luring customers.
Google's capital expenditures -- largely the money that goes into building and outfitting data centers -- almost doubled in the first quarter, the company said. Microsoft's were up 22 percent. Amazon, which will report earnings on Tuesday, is expected to add to that growth.
Meta's investors were unhappy with Mr. Zuckerberg, sending his company's share price down more than 16 percent after the call. But Mr. Zuckerberg, who just a few years ago was pilloried by shareholders for a planned spending spree on augmented and virtual reality, was unapologetic about the money that his company is throwing at A.I. He urged patience, potentially for years.
"Our optimism and ambitions have just grown quite a bit," he said.
Investors had no problem stomaching Microsoft's spending. Microsoft is the only major tech company to report financial details of its generative A.I. business, which it said had contributed to more than a fifth of the growth of its cloud computing business. That amounted to $ 1 billion in three months, analysts estimated.
Microsoft said its generative A.I. business could have been even bigger -- if the company had enough data center supply to meet the demand, underscoring the need to keep on building.
The A.I. investments are creating a halo for Microsoft's core cloud computing offering, Azure, helping it draw new customers. "Azure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing any A.I. project," Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said on Thursday.
(The New York Times sued Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI, in December, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to their A.I. systems.)
Google said sales from its cloud division were up 28 percent, including "an increasing contribution from A.I."
In a letter to shareholders this month, Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said that much attention had been paid to A.I. applications, like ChatGPT, but that the opportunity for more technical efforts, around infrastructure and data, was "gigantic."
For the computing infrastructure, "the key is the chip inside it," he said, emphasizing that bringing down costs and wringing more performance out of the chips is key to Amazon's effort to develop its own A.I. chips.
Infrastructure demands generally fall into two buckets: First, there is building the largest, cutting-edge models, which some A.I. developers say could soon top $ 1 billion for each new round. Chief executives said that being able to work on developing cutting-edge systems, either directly or with partners, was essential for remaining at the forefront of A.I.
And then there is what's called inferencing, or querying the models to actually use them. This can involve customers tapping into the systems, like an insurer using generative A.I. to summarize a customer complaint, or the companies themselves putting A.I. directly into their own products, as Meta recently did by embedding a chatbot assistant in Facebook and Instagram. That's also expensive.
Data centers take time to build and outfit. Chips face supply shortages and costly fabrication. With such long-term bets, Susan Li, Meta's finance chief, said the company was building with "fungibility." It wants wiggle room to change how it uses the infrastructure, if the future turns out to be not exactly what it expects.

Tech Companies Help Wall Street Clinch Best Week in Months: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The best week for U.S. stocks since November closed out with more gains thanks to Alphabet and Microsoft on Friday.
The S&P 500 rallied 1 percent to finish its first winning week in the last four. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 153 points, or 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2 percent.
Alphabet leaped 10.2 percent after breezing past analysts' expectations for profit last quarter. The parent company of Google also said it will start paying a dividend to investors and authorized a program to buy back up to $ 70 billion of its stock, a signal of how much cash it's generating.
Microsoft, meanwhile, climbed 1.8 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. It cited strong growth in its cloud-computing business as it pushes artificial-intelligence technology to its customers.
They helped offset a 9.2 percent drop for Intel. It reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, but its revenue fell short of analysts' estimates. So did its forecast for profit in the current quarter.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 51.54 points to 5,099.96. The Dow added 153.86 to 38,239.66, and the Nasdaq gained 316.14 to 15,927.90.
Stocks have broadly been under pressure this month after hopes withered for multiple cuts to interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve. A series of reports this year showing inflation remaining worse than forecast has traders expecting maybe one cut this year, down from forecasts for six or more at the start of the year.
Yet another report on Friday showed inflation remaining stubbornly high. This time it was the measure of prices for March that the Federal Reserve prefers to use, but it wasn't much worse than forecasts. Financial markets took it much more in stride than a report from the day before that suggested the same measure of inflation rose quickly from January through March.
Treasury yields largely eased in the bond market following Friday morning's report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.67 percent from 4.71 percent late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, held steadier. It edged down to 4.99 percent from 5.00 percent.
While inflation has remained hotter than forecast, EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco expects it to cool in coming months as shoppers pressured in part by slowing growth in wages tamp down their purchases, which is the fuel that gives inflation energy.
"Consumers remain willing to spend, but not on anything, nor at any price," he said.
Economists also said the weaker-than-expected reading on the overall U.S. economy from Thursday, which helped send stocks sliding, may not be as bad as it seemed on the surface.
"The economy remains on solid footing," Bank of America economists said in a report, pointing to solid buying trends from U.S. customers. Such an interpretation calms worries that the U.S. economy could be heading for a toxic mix of stagnating growth and high inflation, something that the Federal Reserve doesn't have great tools to fix.
Still, the higher-than-expected inflation readings will likely keep the Fed on hold at its next policy meeting on Wednesday. Its main interest rate has been sitting at the highest level since 2001 in hopes of undercutting inflation by putting downward pressure on the economy and financial markets.
After earlier indicating that three cuts to interest rates could be on the way this year, top Fed officials have since said they could hold its main interest rate high for a while to ensure inflation heads down toward their 2 percent target.
Friday's report on sticky inflation "underscores Vanguard's belief that the Federal Reserve may find it's unable to cut interest rates this year," according to the investment giant's global head of portfolio construction, Roger Aliaga-Diaz.

Biden Announces Billions In Grants to Make Chips: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The $ 6.1 billion for Micron, to shore up the domestic supply of semiconductors, comes after a key union endorsement and passage of an aid bill central to the president's foreign policy agenda.
President Biden, building on a week of favorable political developments, celebrated a $ 6.1 billion grant to Micron Technology on Thursday, saying it would help the United States become less reliant on Asian countries by bolstering the nation's supply of semiconductors.
"New factories are going up all across the country," Mr. Biden said at the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology in Syracuse, N.Y. "Communities like Syracuse are writing the great American comeback story."
The grant for Micron, the latest multibillion-dollar award that federal officials have made to chip manufacturers in the past few weeks, will help the company construct two leading-edge chip plants in New York and another facility in Idaho, Biden administration officials said. The federal government will also provide up to $ 7.5 billion in loans to Micron.
Ramping up domestic chip production is a major goal for Mr. Biden, whose economic policy agenda largely focuses on strengthening American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are made in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Although the grant had been announced last week by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Biden's trip gave the president a chance to celebrate another victory in what is shaping up to be a successful week for him. On Wednesday, he secured the endorsement of the North America's Building Trades Unions, largely because of his bipartisan infrastructure package. He is also fresh off signing a $ 95.3 billion package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after months of congressional gridlock, reaffirming a central focus of his foreign policy agenda.
And while he promoted his efforts to bolster manufacturing in Syracuse, Mr. Biden's Republican opponent in the 2024 election, former President Donald J. Trump, was in court just 200 miles southeast, in New York City, as his state criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records continued.
"My predecessor and his MAGA Republican friends have a very different view," Mr. Biden said, adding that some Republicans, including Representatives Brandon Williams and Elise Stefanik of New York, have criticized the CHIPS Act. "I guess they're not going to be here today to celebrate."
The grant's funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of semiconductors, the tiny components that power everything from phones and computers to cars and fighter jets. The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute as grants to encourage chipmakers to construct and expand manufacturing plants across the United States.
As part of their new announcement, federal officials said that Micron now planned to spend $ 50 billion to develop the first three plants over the next six years, and that the company would invest up to $ 125 billion in the United States over the next 20 years or more. The company has said it could build up to four manufacturing plants in New York.
"We are rebuilding upstate New York's economy one microchip at a time," Mr. Schumer said on Thursday. He said the investment was expected to create about 50,000 jobs in the Syracuse region. "This is the largest single private investment in all of New York State's history."
Micron's award brings the total announced federal grants to more than $ 29 billion. This month, U.S. officials awarded Samsung up to $ 6.4 billion in grants. Other big chipmakers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have also received awards recently. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
Micron is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. The plant in Idaho is expected to be ready for production in 2026, senior Biden administration officials said. The first plant in New York is expected to open in 2028, with the second ready for production in 2029.
At least $ 40 million of the grant will be set aside for Micron to develop and train its work force. On Thursday, Mr. Biden also announced the creation of four new "work force hubs" in upstate New York, Michigan, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. The hubs are for training and connecting workers to jobs created by new federal investments.
Micron is the last U.S. supplier of chips called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. Those chips play a vital role in computers and smartphones, acting like a scratchpad to temporarily store data that must be retrieved frequently. Leading-edge DRAM chips are critical for advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and wireless communications. All such leading-edge chips are currently manufactured in Asia, but administration officials said Micron's investments would allow the United States to produce its own supply.
Micron conducts most of its manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. Sanjay Mehrotra, the company's chief executive, has made an effort to bolster its U.S. production and win government subsidies for that expansion. But Mr. Mehrotra has reiterated that the timing of such spending will closely track supply and demand, and reflect the company's success in winning federal grants.
"Micron's leading-edge memory is foundational to meeting the growing demands of artificial intelligence," Mr. Mehrotra said in a statement. "We are proud to be making significant memory manufacturing investments in the U.S."

How Johnson Transformed On Ukraine: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Intelligence, politics and personal considerations converted the Republican speaker, who had largely opposed aid to Ukraine as a rank-and-file member, into the key figure pushing it through Congress.
For weeks after the Senate passed a sprawling aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Speaker Mike Johnson agonized over whether and how the House would take up funding legislation that would almost certainly infuriate the right wing of his party and could cost him his job.
He huddled with top national security officials, including William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, in the Oval Office to discuss classified intelligence. He met repeatedly with broad factions of Republicans in both swing and deep red districts, and considered their voters' attitudes toward funding Ukraine. He thought about his son, who is set to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall.
And finally, when his plan to work with Democrats to clear the way for aiding Ukraine met with an outpouring of venom from ultraconservatives already threatening to depose him, Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian, knelt and prayed for guidance.
"I want to be on the right side of history," Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recalled the speaker telling him.
Mr. Johnson's decision to risk his speakership to push the $ 95 billion foreign aid bill through the House on Saturday was the culmination of a remarkable personal and political arc for the Louisiana Republican. It was also an improbable outcome for a man plucked from relative obscurity last fall by the hard right -- which had just deposed a speaker they deemed a traitor to their agenda -- to be the speaker of a deeply dysfunctional House.
As a rank-and-file hard-liner, Mr. Johnson had largely opposed efforts to fund Kyiv's war effort. And early in his speakership, he declared he would never allow the matter to come to a vote until his party's border demands were met.
But by the time he made clear he planned to band together with Democrats to muscle through the aid package over the objections of many in his party, Mr. Johnson was speaking a starkly different language.
"History judges us for what we do," he told reporters at the Capitol last week. "This is a critical time right now. I could make a selfish decision and do something that's different. But I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important."
Mr. Johnson attributed his turnabout in part to the intelligence briefings he received, a striking assertion from a leader of a party that has embraced former President Donald J. Trump's deep mistrust of the intelligence community.
"I really do believe the intel," Mr. Johnson said. "I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Baltics next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies."
Mr. McCaul, who repeatedly huddled with Mr. Johnson and the chairmen of the other congressional national security committees in a secure room of the Capitol where lawmakers can review classified material, described Mr. Johnson's journey as "transformational."
"All of a sudden, he's realizing that the world depends on this," Mr. McCaul said. "This is not some little political game on the floor."
One of the most impactful briefings, according to people familiar with the discussions, came in February in the Oval Office, when congressional leaders met with Mr. Biden to discuss government funding and aid for Ukraine. At that meeting, Mr. Burns and other top national security officials sought to impress upon Mr. Johnson how rapidly Ukraine was running out of ammunition, and how dire the consequences would be if their air defenses were no longer reinforced by American weaponry.
Convinced that they would come around to his way of thinking, Mr. Johnson repeatedly urged Republicans who opposed the funding measure to go to the secure space at the Capitol and receive the same intelligence briefings, according to people he spoke to.
Mr. Johnson was also struck by the stories he heard in meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and others about the magnitude of the misery Russian forces have unleashed across the embattled nation. All of it tugged at Mr. Johnson's sense of Christian faith.
The speaker also faced mounting political pressure to act. Senate Democrats had struck a deal with Republicans to pair the aid to Ukraine with strict border measures, as the G.O.P. had demanded, but after Mr. Trump denounced it, Republicans rejected it out of hand. Then the Senate passed its own $ 95 billion emergency aid legislation for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan without any immigration measures, and the onus was on the House to do the same.
Adding to Mr. Johnson's predicament, he found himself badly out of step with the three other congressional leaders, most notably Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who vocally supported bolstering Kyiv and saw it as a critical part of his legacy.
That was evident at the White House meeting in February, which Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, described as an "intense" pile-on.
"Everyone in that room was telling Speaker Johnson how vital" sending aid was, he said then.
Privately, Mr. Johnson was huddling with his allies and puzzling over what measures they could include in a national security package to make it more palatable to Republicans. At retreats in Florida in February and West Virginia in March, he was already in discussions with Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, about the REPO Act, which would pay for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that had been frozen.
That provision, which he described as "pure poetry," later became a key part of Mr. Johnson's effort to sell his conference on the aid bill.
Around the same time, Mr. Johnson began -- first privately, then loudly -- telling allies that he would ensure the U.S. would send funding to Kyiv.
"I think he always understood the importance of this and believes in the importance of this," Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, said. "The function of being speaker is to try to build consensus, and I think he wanted to find consensus among the conference. Unfortunately, there are some folks that are just unwilling to compromise."
In a small meeting with lawmakers, Mr. Johnson "made it pretty clear that if we didn't get this done in April, that it could be too late for Ukraine," Representative Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, said.
Patience among politically vulnerable Republicans who wanted to cast a vote in support of Ukraine also was running out. Mr. Johnson told reporters on Thursday that he believed that if he did not act soon, G.O.P. lawmakers would try to circumvent him by using a procedure called a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate bill.
"If the House did not do this better policy and process -- allowing for amendments on the floor in the process tomorrow -- we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill," he said.
By the time he agreed to advance an aid package, he had to contend with a wave of anger from his political home -- the right wing of the Republican conference -- whose members accused Mr. Johnson of betraying them, and repeatedly urged him to change course.
In a heated scene in the back row of the House chamber last week, a group of hard-liners surrounded the speaker and urged him to tie the foreign aid package to stringent anti-immigration measures.
Mr. Johnson pushed back, replying that he would not have enough Republican support to advance such a measure. He told them he was not worried about his own speakership, but was seriously worried about Ukraine's ability to hold off Russia without U.S. aid, according to a lawmaker on the floor for the discussion.
"My message to the speaker has been: 'Stay true to the mission,"' Mr. Hill said. "You know what has to be done. And you know that you have to do the best you can, with the circumstances that we found ourselves in."
The passage of the aid package unleashed a fresh wave of fury among hard-liners. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is leading the charge to oust Mr. Johnson, promised that more Republicans would rally to her side.
"This is the third betrayal by Mike Johnson," she fumed on the House steps minutes after the vote on Saturday, citing the government funding bills and legislation he advanced to renew an expiring warrantless surveillance law as his first two transgressions.
"A foreign war package that does nothing for America?" she continued. "It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is."
For his part, Mr. Johnson skipped a victory lap on Saturday, never taking to the House floor to make the case for any of the aid bills -- as speakers almost always do when matters of major import come before the chamber -- and staying away as lawmakers cast their votes. After the legislation's passage, he offered clipped remarks about the importance of the aid and chastised Democrats who had waved Ukrainian flags on the floor, noting that the only flags that should be displayed in the chamber were American ones.
But earlier in the week, Mr. Johnson had been more reflective, telling reporters that during tough times, he took comfort in an adage about former President John Quincy Adams's time in Congress.
Another lawmaker asked Mr. Adams why he continued bringing up the same resolution to end slavery, only to see it fail each time. In Mr. Johnson's telling, Mr. Adams replied: "Duty is ours. Results are God's."
"To me, that's a very liberating thought," Mr. Johnson said. "I'm going to do my duty, and the results are not ultimately up to me. I'm comfortable with that. We'll see what happens, and we'll lay the chips down on the table."

WASHINGTON — For weeks after the Senate passed a sprawling aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, House Speaker Mike Johnson agonized over whether and how the House would take up funding legislation that would almost certainly infuriate the right wing of his party and could cost him his job.
He huddled with top national security officials, including CIA Director William Burns, in the Oval Office to discuss classified intelligence. He met repeatedly with broad factions of Republicans in both swing and deep red districts, and considered their voters’ attitudes toward funding for Ukraine. He thought about his son, who is set to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall.
And finally, when his plan to work with Democrats to clear the way for aiding Ukraine met with an outpouring of venom from ultraconservatives already threatening to depose him, Johnson, an evangelical Christian, knelt and prayed for guidance.
“I want to be on the right side of history,” Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recalled the speaker telling him.
Johnson’s decision to risk his speakership to push the $95 billion foreign aid bill through the House on Saturday was the culmination of a remarkable personal and political arc for the Louisiana Republican. It was also an improbable outcome for a man plucked from relative obscurity in the fall by the hard right — which had just deposed a speaker it deemed a traitor to its agenda — to be the speaker of a deeply dysfunctional House.
As a rank-and-file hard-liner, Johnson had largely opposed efforts to fund Ukraine’s war effort. And early in his speakership, he declared he would never allow the matter to come to a vote until his party’s border demands were met.
But by the time he made clear he planned to band together with Democrats to muscle through the aid package over the objections of many in his party, Johnson was speaking a starkly different language.
“History judges us for what we do,” he told reporters at the Capitol last week. “This is a critical time right now. I could make a selfish decision and do something that’s different. But I’m doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important.”
Johnson attributed his turnabout in part to the intelligence briefings he received, a striking assertion from a leader of a party that has embraced former President Donald Trump’s deep mistrust of the intelligence community.
“I really do believe the intel,” Johnson said. “I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Baltics next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies.”
McCaul, who repeatedly huddled with Johnson and the chairs of the other congressional national security committees in a secure room of the Capitol where lawmakers can review classified material, described Johnson’s journey as “transformational.”
“All of a sudden, he’s realizing that the world depends on this,” McCaul said. “This is not some little political game on the floor.”
One of the most impactful briefings, according to people familiar with the discussions, came in February in the Oval Office, when congressional leaders met with President Joe Biden to discuss government funding and aid for Ukraine. At that meeting, Burns and other top national security officials sought to impress upon Johnson how rapidly Ukraine was running out of ammunition and how dire the consequences would be if its air defenses were no longer reinforced by American weaponry.

Johnson was also struck by the stories he heard in meetings with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and others about the magnitude of the misery Russian forces have unleashed across the embattled nation. All of it tugged at Johnson’s sense of Christian faith.
The speaker also faced mounting political pressure to act. Senate Democrats had struck a deal with Republicans to pair the aid to Ukraine with strict border measures, as the GOP had demanded, but after Trump denounced it, Republicans rejected it out of hand. Then the Senate passed its own $95 billion emergency aid legislation for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan without any immigration measures, and the onus was on the House to do the same.
Adding to Johnson’s predicament, he found himself badly out of step with the three other congressional leaders, most notably Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who vocally supported bolstering Ukraine and saw it as a critical part of his legacy.
That was evident at the White House meeting in February, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., described as an “intense” pile-on.
“Everyone in that room was telling Speaker Johnson how vital” sending aid was, he said then.
Privately, Johnson was huddling with his allies and puzzling over what measures they could include in a national security package to make it more palatable to Republicans. At retreats in Florida in February and West Virginia in March, he was in discussions with Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., about the REPO Act, which would pay for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that had been frozen.

Chipmaker Micron to Use Billions for 3 New Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The grant to the memory chipmaker is the latest federal award aimed at boosting U.S. chip manufacturing.
The Biden administration will give Micron up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to help build its semiconductor plants in New York and Idaho, the latest multibillion dollar award aimed at ramping up the nation's production of vital semiconductors.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, announced the grant on Thursday and said the "monumental" investment would help the company construct two new chip manufacturing plants in New York by the end of the decade, along with another plant under construction in Idaho.
More than a year ago, Micron announced plans to expand its manufacturing footprint in the United States. In September 2022, the company said it would build a $ 15 billion factory in its hometown, Boise, Idaho, the first new U.S. memory chip plant in 20 years. A month later, Micron said it would build a giant manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., pledging to start with a $ 20 billion project by the end of the decade and spending as much as $ 100 billion over the next two decades or more. The complex could eventually include up to four new manufacturing plants.
A senior Biden administration official confirmed the award and said it would help create thousands of jobs. Company officials have said the investment is expected to create roughly 50,000 jobs, including about 9,000 direct positions at its plants.
The announcement is the latest award from federal officials to chipmakers in recent weeks. The funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as leader in the production of semiconductors, the foundational components that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and weapons systems. Equipped with $ 39 billion, the Commerce Department has distributed several grants to chip manufacturers as an incentive for them to build and expand facilities in the United States.
The initiative is intended to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors. Although semiconductors were invented in America, manufacturing has largely shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are currently made in the United States.
Micron's award brings the total announced grants to more than $ 29 billion. On Monday, U.S. officials awarded Samsung up to $ 6.4 billion in grants. Other big chipmakers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have also received awards recently. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
Mr. Schumer, who helped rally Congress to pass the CHIPS Act, said Micron's award would help make sure that "America was no longer dependent on other countries for all kinds of vital chips." He said he had long pushed for Micron to receive a share of the federal grants.
"I always lobby heavily for New York to gain advantage and talked to the administration on many occasions about how Micron was important to the country as a whole," Mr. Schumer said in an interview. "But frankly, my advocacy for chips extends to the whole country."
Mr. Schumer said the award would help bolster the nation's production of critical memory chips, which the country is becoming "more and more dependent on."
Micron declined to comment, citing confidentiality requirements associated with CHIPS Act grants.
Based in Boise, Micron is the last U.S. supplier of chips called dynamic random access memories, or DRAMs. The components play a vital role in computers and smartphones, acting like a scratchpad to temporarily store data that must be retrieved frequently. Micron also has a major sideline in flash memory, a newer variety of chips that store data more permanently.
The DRAM business was a major global battleground in the 1980s and the 1990s, as companies from Japan and later South Korea used manufacturing muscle to drive down prices and squeeze competitors. Much larger U.S. companies, like Intel and Texas Instruments, left the business.
Micron, a much smaller company, managed to hang on as the industry consolidated to just three major players. The South Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix rank first and second place in memory revenues, respectively. The reduced competition has helped moderate the industry's business cycles somewhat, though all three companies last year suffered from severe pricing pressure.
DRAM and flash memory are mainstays of the computers found in data centers, as new applications require greater amounts of data and faster access to it. In the newest wrinkle, makers of specialty chips for artificial intelligence like Nvidia rely on a technology called high-bandwidth memory, which bundles multiple stacks of DRAM chips in packages along with processors that carry out calculations.
Micron, though largely managed through offices in San Jose, Calif., conducts most of its manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive, has spearheaded an effort to sharply boost its U.S. production footprint and win government subsidies for that expansion.
But Mr. Mehrotra has reiterated that the timing of such spending would closely track supply and demand conditions in the memory market, and also reflect the company's success in winning U.S. grants.
Micron is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment, Mr. Schumer said.

A Millennial Weaver Adds to an Old Art: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Spiders are weavers. The Navajo artist and weaver Melissa Cody knows this palpably. As she sits cross-legged on sheepskins at her loom, on one of the wooden platforms that boost her higher as her stack of monumental tapestries grows, the sacred knowledge of Spider Woman and Spider Man, who brought the gift of looms and weaving to the Diné, or Navajo, is right there in her studio with her.
It also infuses "Melissa Cody: Webbed Skies," the first major solo exhibition of the artist's work, which is on view at MoMA PS1 through Sept. 9. in a co-production with the São Paulo Museum of Art in Brazil (known as MASP).
The exhibition is part of the overdue recognition of Indigenous artists by museums and other institutions, from the recent retrospective of Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith's work at the Whitney Museum of American Art to the expanding roster of artists at the Venice Biennale. Cody, 41, is a millennial at the forefront of an art form harking back millenniums -- at once building on tradition and joyously venturing beyond it.
Her show's title alludes to her 2021 work "Under Cover of Webbed Skies," in which hourglass shapes resembling a spider's underbelly stand in for the artist herself, passing Spider Woman's wisdom on to future generations and a web of motherly protection from mountain to sky. (Selected works are also at the Garth Greenan Gallery from April 25 to June 15.)
Cody was weaned on weaving, tapping weft yarns for her nine-foot-tall textiles with the same wood comb she started out with at age 5. She grew up on the western edge of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, the fourth generation from a family of distinguished female weavers, most notably her award-winning mother, Lola S. Cody, who raises her own churro sheep for traditional patterns like "Two Grey Hills," and her grandmother Martha Gorman Schultz, still pioneering in her 90s on her outdoor loom.
Cody's complex and multidimensional woven canvases -- or what she calls her "vibe" -- are layered with past, present and future histories, including her own. She describes herself as a "voice for kids who grew up in the '80s" and she will often incorporate imagery and typography from early video games like Pac-Man and Pong and magnify individual pixels so that they appear to move fluidly across the surfaces of her tapestries and become a life force all their own.
Her weavings are worlds-within-worlds that tweak perspective and juxtapose ancient and contemporary motifs in an electric palette of aniline-dyed yarns. There's a reason the vertiginous Diné patterns of bright serrated diamonds that Cody prizes are called "eye-dazzlers."
In one stunning work, "Into the Depths, She Rappels," a symbolic Spider Woman lowers herself by a single thread into a shocking fuchsia abyss in which animated rainbow-colored pixels seem ready to duke it out with a bevy of eye-dazzlers.
"Hundreds of years ago, Navajo weaving played with illusion, creating 3-D effects with the overlapping and overlay of motifs," said Ann Lane Hedlund, a cultural anthropologist and retired curator who works with artists. "Melissa has taken that to a new realm."
She has mastered a slow art in a fast world.
Cody's vibrant Germantown Revival color palette emerged from a dark era: the devastating 1863-1866 U.S. government campaign to annihilate the Diné by burning villages, killing herds and removing more than 10,000 Navajo from their homelands. In a forced march, the Navajo walked for hundreds of miles to Bosque Redondo at Fort Sumner, in present-day New Mexico, where they were incarcerated. There, in a creative act of resistance, women unraveled government-issued synthetically dyed wool blankets made in Germantown, Pa., and rewove them in their own designs, surmounting trauma and loss through sheer perseverance and beauty.
In the coming decades, white trading post operators convinced many Diné weavers to limit themselves to "authentic" textiles in natural yarns tied to specific Navajo communities. Some non-Native scholars followed suit, dismissing the aniline-dyed Germantown Revival style as inauthentic.
Cody relished color and an eclectic aesthetic early on, spurred by a cache of dizzyingly bold yarns given as a gift by a friend.
She describes Leupp, Ariz., where she grew up, as "desolate and Mars-like," a landscape of towering red rocks, sand dunes and mesas. The family home was lit by kerosene, without running water, and an hour of staticky television was available only when her father, Alfred, a professional carpenter, fired up the gas generator.
Cody thought all little girls had looms, her mother recalled. Young Melissa and her older sister Reynalda traveled frequently to major art shows at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, the Santa Fe Indian Market and elsewhere along with her grandmother Martha and an inventive aunt, Marilou Schultz, whose "Replica of a Chip" -- a 1994 commission by Intel of a microprocessor translated in wool -- is currently at the National Gallery of Art.
Many shows had youth divisions, and Cody would frequently compete against her sister and a male cousin who is half-Hopi. (Diné weavers are traditionally female.) "I wanted to be as good as her," she said of her sister. Cody won her first ribbon at age 8 at the Santa Fe Indian Market, reflecting an inner drive that had her glued to the loom after school and even while watching Saturday morning cartoons.
She credits her mother, whose loom was in the living room, with "instilling independence in what I created."
"She taught me a heightened, technically precise level of work, without a lot of negative space and every inch filled with geometric patterning," she explained. "When I asked her about colors and if she liked them, she'd say, 'Do you like them? What do you think about it?' So there was a lot of self-reflection."
Cody's years perfecting traditional techniques gave her the confidence to experiment and create more personal work. "It's 'What emotion am I trying to convey?"' she said. "What's the thesis behind it?"
Some of her most ambitious pieces have been responses to personal crises. In 2015, her anguish over the sudden death of her 38-year-old fiancé prompted an unusual set of weavings with block lettering, including an excerpt from the Rat Pack crooner Dean Martin's "Sweet, Sweet Lovable You."
Her father's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease led to a similar breakthrough with "Dopamine Regression," one in a series in which hallucinatory eye-dazzlers shift directions and are overlaid with black Spider Woman crosses, some abstracted. A bold red cross synonymous with medical care extends into a rainbow, a symbol indicating the presence of holy people and their blessings. "It's her way of dealing with it," her mother said. "It's how she expresses her thoughts."
Not all curators relate to Cody's boundary-breaking tapestries, however. "She's spicy," said Marcus Monenerkit, the Heard Museum's director of community engagement, and also a fan. "That doesn't always work with people."
Cody conceptualizes her weavings as scrolls that can be "read from bottom to top or top to bottom," she said. "I think of where the attention-grabbing elements are -- and where can the viewers' eye rest."
To a non-weaver, one of the most extraordinary aspects of Navajo weaving is its largely spontaneous quality, accomplished with nary a sketch. "We're graphing it out in a mental image -- maybe a texture out in nature or the feel of a city, or a color, and then replicating it in woven form," Cody said. "It's a slow-moving fluidity, with everything calculated down to each individual string." A large-scale weaving takes six months or more to complete.
Her mother visits frequently to help out, following her daughter's lead as they lay the warp strings out on the floor. The studio is definitely a family affair, the loom built by her brother Kevin and the platforms by her partner, Giovanni McDonald Sanchez.
It's become even more so: The couple are now parents to a 3 ½ year-old daughter, Anihwiiaahii ("the judge" in Navajo), and a 10-month-old son, Naabaahii ("Navajo warrior"). Cody plans to teach them both how to weave, wanting it to become second nature but also letting them decide whether to pursue it further, as her mother did with her.
She has recently transformed her affection for "the mighty pixel" into digitized jacquard weavings that are coded and sent to a production loom in Belgium, a leap that allows her to adapt previous motifs and that has given her access to colors and shapes impossible on a traditional loom.
Along with others, Cody has revived culturally significant motifs like the Whirling Log, a symbol of the origins of the Diné people that had disappeared after World War II because it was mistaken for Nazi swastikas. "To move forward as Indigenous artists, we need to reclaim our stories and respect our true selves in the work we create," she said.
She continues to pass on her knowledge: In Los Angeles, Cody is teaching elementary school students in an under-resourced district through the organization Wide Rainbow. She is also teaming up with the Autry Museum of the American West on summer workshops for local Diné weavers. "A big part of Native American culture is reciprocity," said Amanda Wixon (Chickasaw Nation), an associate curator. "Melissa has it in her bones."
In Long Beach recently, her black hair spilling down the entire length of her spine, Cody manipulated wefts of jubilant yarns. Her thoughts often drift to her grandmother, who continues to experiment and remains a student of the art. "Ancient knowledge coveted by my ancestors comes through my fingertips, which is a huge honor," she said. "I do feel I breathe a life into a textile. And vice versa, the weaving gives me life."

LONG BEACH, Calif. — Spiders are weavers. The Navajo artist and weaver Melissa Cody knows this palpably. As she sits cross-legged on sheepskins at her loom, on one of the wooden platforms that boost her higher as her stack of monumental tapestries grows, the sacred knowledge of Spider Woman and Spider Man, who brought the gift of looms and weaving to the Diné, or Navajo, is right there in her studio with her.
It also infuses “Melissa Cody: Webbed Skies,” the first major solo exhibition of the artist’s work, which is on view at MoMA PS1 in New York through Sept. 9. in a co-production with the Sao Paulo Museum of Art in Brazil (known as MASP).
The exhibition is part of the overdue recognition of Indigenous artists by museums and other institutions, from the recent retrospective of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art to the expanding roster of artists at the Venice Biennale. Cody, 41, is a millennial at the forefront of an art form harking back millenniums — at once building on tradition and joyously venturing beyond it.
Her show’s title alludes to her 2021 work “Under Cover of Webbed Skies,” in which hourglass shapes resembling a spider’s underbelly stand in for the artist herself, passing Spider Woman’s wisdom on to future generations and a web of motherly protection from mountain to sky. (Selected works are also at the Garth Greenan Gallery from April 25 to June 15.)
Cody was weaned on weaving, tapping weft yarns for her nine-foot-tall textiles with the same wood comb she started out with at age 5. She grew up on the western edge of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, the fourth generation from a family of distinguished female weavers, most notably her award-winning mother, Lola S. Cody, who raises her own churro sheep for traditional patterns like “Two Grey Hills,” and her grandmother Martha Gorman Schultz, still pioneering in her 90s on her outdoor loom.
Cody’s complex and multidimensional woven canvases — or what she calls her “vibe” — are layered with past, present and future histories, including her own. She describes herself as a “voice for kids who grew up in the ’80s” and she will often incorporate imagery and typography from early video games like Pac-Man and Pong and magnify individual pixels so that they appear to move fluidly across the surfaces of her tapestries and become a life force all their own.
Her weavings are worlds-within-worlds that tweak perspective and juxtapose ancient and contemporary motifs in an electric palette of aniline-dyed yarns. There’s a reason the vertiginous Diné patterns of bright serrated diamonds that Cody prizes are called “eye-dazzlers.”
In one stunning work, “Into the Depths, She Rappels,” a symbolic Spider Woman lowers herself by a single thread into a shocking fuchsia abyss in which animated rainbow-colored pixels seem ready to duke it out with a bevy of eye-dazzlers.
“Hundreds of years ago, Navajo weaving played with illusion, creating 3-D effects with the overlapping and overlay of motifs,” said Ann Lane Hedlund, a cultural anthropologist and retired curator who works with artists. “Melissa has taken that to a new realm.”
She has mastered a slow art in a fast world.
Cody’s vibrant Germantown Revival color palette emerged from a dark era: the devastating 1863-1866 U.S. government campaign to annihilate the Diné by burning villages, killing herds and removing more than 10,000 Navajo from their homelands. In a forced march, the Navajo walked for hundreds of miles to Bosque Redondo at Fort Sumner, in present-day New Mexico, where they were incarcerated. There, in a creative act of resistance, women unraveled government-issued synthetically dyed wool blankets made in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and rewove them in their own designs, surmounting trauma and loss through sheer perseverance and beauty.
In the coming decades, white trading post operators convinced many Diné weavers to limit themselves to “authentic” textiles in natural yarns tied to specific Navajo communities. Some non-Native scholars followed suit, dismissing the aniline-dyed Germantown Revival style as inauthentic.
Cody relished color and an eclectic aesthetic early on, spurred by a cache of dizzyingly bold yarns given as a gift by a friend.
She describes Leupp, Arizona, where she grew up, as “desolate and Mars-like,” a landscape of towering red rocks, sand dunes and mesas. The family home was lit by kerosene, without running water, and an hour of staticky television was available only when her father, Alfred, a professional carpenter, fired up the gas generator.
Cody thought all little girls had looms, her mother recalled. Young Melissa and her older sister Reynalda traveled frequently to major art shows at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, the Santa Fe Indian Market and elsewhere along with her grandmother Martha and an inventive aunt, Marilou Schultz, whose “Replica of a Chip” — a 1994 commission by Intel of a microprocessor translated in wool — is currently at the National Gallery of Art.
Many shows had youth divisions, and Cody would frequently compete against her sister and a male cousin who is half-Hopi. (Diné weavers are traditionally female.) “I wanted to be as good as her,” she said of her sister. Cody won her first ribbon at age 8 at the Santa Fe Indian Market, reflecting an inner drive that had her glued to the loom after school and even while watching Saturday morning cartoons.
She credits her mother, whose loom was in the living room, with “instilling independence in what I created.”
“She taught me a heightened, technically precise level of work, without a lot of negative space and every inch filled with geometric patterning,” she explained. “When I asked her about colors and if she liked them, she’d say, ‘Do you like them? What do you think about it?’ So there was a lot of self-reflection.”
Cody’s years perfecting traditional techniques gave her the confidence to experiment and create more personal work. “It’s ‘What emotion am I trying to convey?’” she said. “What’s the thesis behind it?”
Some of her most ambitious pieces have been responses to personal crises. In 2015, her anguish over the sudden death of her 38-year-old fiance prompted an unusual set of weavings with block lettering, including an excerpt from the Rat Pack crooner Dean Martin’s “Sweet, Sweet Lovable You.”
Her father’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease led to a similar breakthrough with “Dopamine Regression,” one in a series in which hallucinatory eye-dazzlers shift directions and are overlaid with black Spider Woman crosses, some abstracted. A bold red cross synonymous with medical care extends into a rainbow, a symbol indicating the presence of holy people and their blessings.
“It’s her way of dealing with it,” her mother said. “It’s how she expresses her thoughts.”
Not all curators relate to Cody’s boundary-breaking tapestries, however. “She’s spicy,” said Marcus Monenerkit, the Heard Museum’s director of community engagement, and also a fan. “That doesn’t always work with people.”
Cody conceptualizes her weavings as scrolls that can be “read from bottom to top or top to bottom,” she said. “I think of where the attention-grabbing elements are — and where can the viewers’ eye rest.”
To a non-weaver, one of the most extraordinary aspects of Navajo weaving is its largely spontaneous quality, accomplished with nary a sketch. “We’re graphing it out in a mental image — maybe a texture out in nature or the feel of a city, or a color, and then replicating it in woven form,” Cody said. “It’s a slow-moving fluidity, with everything calculated down to each individual string.” A large-scale weaving takes six months or more to complete.
Her mother visits frequently to help out, following her daughter’s lead as they lay the warp strings out on the floor. The studio is definitely a family affair, the loom built by her brother Kevin and the platforms by her partner, Giovanni McDonald Sanchez.
It’s become even more so: The couple are now parents to a 3-1/2-year-old daughter, Anihwiiaahii (“the judge” in Navajo), and a 10-month-old son, Naabaahii (“Navajo warrior”). Cody plans to teach them both how to weave, wanting it to become second nature but also letting them decide whether to pursue it further, as her mother did with her.
She has recently transformed her affection for “the mighty pixel” into digitized jacquard weavings that are coded and sent to a production loom in Belgium, a leap that allows her to adapt previous motifs and that has given her access to colors and shapes impossible on a traditional loom.

U.S. Grants $6.4 Billion To Samsung: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The federal grants will support Samsung's new chip manufacturing hub in Taylor, Texas, along with the expansion of an existing site in Austin.
The Biden administration will give up to $ 6.4 billion in grants to Samsung, one of the world's largest chipmakers, the latest in a slew of awards intended to shore up domestic production of cutting-edge semiconductors.
The money will help Samsung, the South Korean company, fund its new chip manufacturing hub in Taylor, Texas, and expand an existing site in nearby Austin. Samsung will now build an additional manufacturing plant and upgrade a facility under construction in Taylor. It will increase its investment in Texas to roughly $ 45 billion, up from the $ 17 billion it announced more than two years ago, administration officials said on Sunday.
Federal officials said the grants would help create a U.S. hub for the development and production of leading-edge semiconductors. Aside from manufacturing chips, Samsung will now construct a research and development facility in Taylor as well as an advanced factory for packaging them, the final step before semiconductors can be used in electronic systems.
The announcement follows other awards that federal officials have made to semiconductor manufacturers in recent weeks. The initiative is funded by the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors, the vital components that power everything from phones and computers to cars and weapons systems. The legislation gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to dole out as grants as incentives to chipmakers to construct and expand plants in the United States.
The effort is intended to help reverse a decades-long decline in the U.S. share of global chip manufacturing. Although semiconductors were invented in America, only about 10 percent of the world's chips are currently made in the United States.
The Samsung grant is the third big award aimed at increasing U.S. production of the most sophisticated semiconductors. Last week, federal officials said they would award up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading maker of the most advanced chips. The administration also announced last month that Intel, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, would receive up to $ 8.5 billion in grants, which officials said would be the single largest grant under the new program.
Both Samsung and TSMC have committed to producing two-nanometer chips, using what is currently the world's most advanced production technology, in the United States in the coming years.
Samsung's investment also includes the construction of a new advanced packaging facility. Packaging typically involves encasing chips in combinations of plastic and metal that allow them to connect to other devices in a system. New packaging technologies have become a focal point for the industry as more companies have taken to bundling multiple small chips -- sometimes called chiplets -- in a package to boost computing power rather than trying to pack more capability into each semiconductor.
In addition, Samsung will build a research and development facility that will study advances in manufacturing processes, which add computing power and storage capability to chips. Among the largest chip manufacturers, only Intel currently conducts such research in the United States. Federal officials view Samsung's new research and development facility as vital for ensuring the country's access to cutting-edge developments in the field, senior Biden administration officials said.
As part of the award, Samsung will also directly supply chips to the Defense Department. The Austin facility's expansion is intended to support the production of chips used in industries that are critical for national security, including aerospace, defense and automotive.
In addition to receiving the grants, Samsung is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting the Texas factories with production equipment.
Samsung's award brings the total announced federal grants to more than $ 23 billion. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
The pandemic set off a global shortage of semiconductors that crippled major industries and shed light on the vulnerabilities in the domestic supply chain for chips, motivating lawmakers to pass the CHIPS Act.
Federal officials view the lack of domestic manufacturing capacity as a major national security risk, given that the components power missiles, satellites and fighter jets. Cutting-edge semiconductors are also critical for major technological industries like artificial intelligence.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, emphasized that much of the semiconductor supply chain -- from research and development to packaging -- was concentrated in a few Asian countries.
"That leaves the U.S. supply chain incredibly vulnerable to disruption," Ms. Raimondo said on Sunday. "It's unsafe and it weakens our national and economic security."
Ms. Raimondo said the new investment would help create a "state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem" in Texas and re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of the most advanced semiconductors. In February, Ms. Raimondo said new investments would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade. Currently, the United States produces none.
In November 2021, Samsung first announced that it would build a $ 17 billion semiconductor factory in Taylor, responding to a push by the Biden administration and U.S. customers to ramp up chip production in the United States. The company will now upgrade the facility's manufacturing capacity. In addition to four-nanometer chips, the first plant will now produce two-nanometer chips. Samsung is expected to open the first facility in 2026, administration officials said.
The second plant will also manufacture two-nanometer chips and is slated to open in 2027, according to the officials. The research and development facility is expected to open in 2027, too, and the advanced packaging facility is set to open in 2028.
Lael Brainard, the director of the National Economic Council, said the Samsung award would be the "third and final leg" of the president's plan to bring leading-edge chip manufacturing back to the United States. About $ 40 million in grants will be set aside for the company to develop and train its workers, Ms. Brainard said. Samsung's investment is expected to create more than 4,500 manufacturing jobs and at least 17,000 construction jobs, federal officials said.
Similar to the other award recipients, Samsung will have to meet certain milestones before payments are made.
Samsung plays an unusually influential position in the industry by supplying two major varieties of semiconductors. It is the largest maker of memory chips, which store data in smartphones, computers and other products. But the company also makes and designs logic chips -- a category that includes processors that handle calculations in electronic hardware. And the company offers a service that manufactures such chips to order for other companies.
Most of Samsung's factories are in South Korea. But in 1996, the company built a facility in Austin, which initially produced memory chips and later shifted to logic chips for products such as Apple's iPhone. In recent years Apple has frequently turned to TSMC to manufacture chips that Apple designs, though Samsung also boasts some of the industry's most advanced production processes.

Chip Facility Gets Billions To Bolster Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plans to build an additional factory and upgrade another planned facility in Phoenix with the federal grants.
The Biden administration will award up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading maker of the most advanced microchips, in a bid to bring some of the most cutting-edge semiconductor technology to the United States.
The funds, which come from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, will help support the construction of TSMC's first major U.S. hub, in Phoenix. The company has already committed to building two plants at the site and will use some of the grant money to build a third factory in Phoenix, U.S. officials said on Sunday. TSMC will also increase its total investments in the United States to more than $ 65 billion, up from $ 40 billion.
Bringing the world's most sophisticated chip manufacturing to the United States has been a major goal for the Biden administration. TSMC announced that it would now produce two-nanometer chips at the hub, a significant step forward given that the United States currently produces none of the most advanced semiconductors.
Federal officials view the investment as vital for building up a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors, the small chips that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and fighter jets. Although semiconductors were invented in the United States, production has largely shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10 percent of the world's chips are made in the United States.
The award is the second largest by the federal government under a program intended to re-establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It was unveiled a few weeks after President Biden announced that Intel, another major chipmaker, would receive $ 8.5 billion in grants and up to $ 11 billion in loans during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
The CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022, gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute as subsidies to encourage companies to build and expand chip plants across the United States. The program is a major pillar of Mr. Biden's economic policy agenda, which is centered on strengthening American manufacturing.
TSMC's award will bring the total announced grants to more than $ 16 billion. Three smaller companies, GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems, received the first awards.
In addition to the grants, the federal government will provide up to $ 5 billion in loans to TSMC. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. About $ 50 million of the grants will be set aside to train and develop the company's work force, federal officials said.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said the investment would help the United States start manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones and the most sensitive military hardware.
"It's a national security problem that we don't manufacture any of the world's most sophisticated chips in the United States," Ms. Raimondo said on Sunday. "Now, because of this announcement, these chips will be made in the United States."
Earlier this year, Ms. Raimondo said new investments in semiconductor companies would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade.
TSMC's investment is expected to create about 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and more than 20,000 construction jobs, federal officials said. TSMC will have to meet certain construction and production milestones before payments are made.
The company has been counting on federal aid for years. Talks about a partly subsidized expansion in the United States began in 2019, during the Trump administration, according to company officials. TSMC first announced that it would build a new facility in Phoenix in May 2020, a project that company officials said would eventually require government subsidies to help address the higher cost of building and operating chip plants in the United States.
In December 2022, several months after the passage of the CHIPS Act, TSMC announced that it would build a second factory at the site, increasing its total investment to $ 40 billion from $ 12 billion.
But since TSMC started construction in 2021, various stumbling blocks have delayed the start of production. Last summer, TSMC pushed back initial production at its first factory to 2025 from this year, saying local workers lacked expertise in installing some sophisticated equipment. In January, the company said the second plant would not meet its original schedule of beginning manufacturing in 2026.
Production at the second facility is expected to begin in 2028, and production at the third factory is expected to start by the end of the decade, according to the Biden administration officials.
TSMC's expansion in the United States could have an outsize impact on the global supply chain for semiconductors, the vulnerabilities of which were laid bare by crippling chip shortages during the pandemic.
TSMC, which pioneered the idea of manufacturing chips to order for others that design them, operates massive factories in Taiwan that churn out the vast majority of the small components that supply processing power to computers, phones, networking gear, appliances and military gear. America's reliance on the company's factories, on an island that China does not recognize as independent and claims is part of its territory, has long worried U.S. officials.
New generations of production technology are often described in terms of nanometers, or billionths of a meter, a measure of key dimensions of microscopic circuitry. In December 2022, TSMC said it would produce three-nanometer chips at its second Arizona factory. It will now also introduce the next generation of technology, at two nanometers, in the second plant, Biden administration officials announced.
Such advances determine how many transistors can be packed on each small slice of silicon, which allow chips to perform calculations more quickly and store more data. In the past decade, TSMC supplanted Intel in delivering the most sophisticated production technology, producing components that Apple designs for its latest smartphones and Nvidia develops to power artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT.
Though the planned addition of two-nanometer technology represents a substantial advance, that does not necessarily mean that TSMC's U.S. factories will offer the latest technology at the same time as its factories in Taiwan. The company carries out research on new technologies on the island, and adapting those processes to high-volume manufacturing is typically done first in nearby buildings to speed the transition and reduce travel time for engineers.
It remains possible that Intel, which is racing to regain its lead in manufacturing technology, will offer the most advanced production technology in the industry by 2028 at U.S. factories. The company carries out its manufacturing technology research in Oregon.
Biden administration officials are expected to award more grants in the coming months to other big chipmakers that have invested in new or expanded domestic facilities in recent years, including Micron Technology and Samsung.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will award up to $6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the leading maker of the most advanced microchips, in a bid to bring some of the most cutting-edge semiconductor technology to the United States.
The funds, which come from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, will help support the construction of TSMC’s first major U.S. hub, in Phoenix. The company has already committed to building two plants at the site and will use some of the grant money to build a third factory in Phoenix, U.S. officials said Sunday. TSMC will also increase its total investments in the U.S. to more than $65 billion, up from $40 billion.
Bringing the world’s most sophisticated chip manufacturing to the United States has been a major goal for the Biden administration. TSMC announced that it would now produce 2-nanometer chips at the hub, a significant step forward given that the United States currently produces none of the most advanced semiconductors.
Federal officials view the investment as vital for building up a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors, the small chips that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and fighter jets. Although semiconductors were invented in the U.S., production has largely shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10% of the world’s chips are made in the U.S.
The award is the second largest by the federal government under a program intended to reestablish the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It was unveiled a few weeks after President Joe Biden announced that Intel, another major chipmaker, would receive $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
The CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022, gave the Commerce Department $39 billion to distribute as subsidies to encourage companies to build and expand chip plants across the U.S. The program is a major pillar of Biden’s economic policy agenda, which is centered on strengthening U.S. manufacturing.
TSMC’s award will bring the total announced grants to more than $16 billion. Three other smaller companies, including GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems, received the first awards.
In addition to the grants, the federal government will provide up to $5 billion in loans to TSMC. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25% of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. About $50 million of the grants will be set aside to train and develop the company’s workforce, federal officials said.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the investment would help the U.S. start manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones and the most sensitive military hardware.
“It’s a national security problem that we don’t manufacture any of the world’s most sophisticated chips in the United States,” Raimondo said Sunday. “Now, because of this announcement, these chips will be made in the United States.”
This year, Raimondo said new investments in semiconductor companies would put the U.S. on track to produce roughly 20% of the world’s most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade.
TSMC’s investment is expected to create about 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and more than 20,000 construction jobs, federal officials said. TSMC will have to meet certain construction and production milestones before payments are made.
The company has been counting on federal aid for years. Talks about a partly subsidized expansion in the U.S. began in 2019, during the Trump administration, according to company officials. TSMC first announced that it would build a new facility in Phoenix in May 2020, a project that company officials said would eventually require government subsidies to help address the higher cost of building and operating chip plants in the U.S.
In December 2022, several months after the passage of the CHIPS Act, TSMC announced that it would build a second factory at the site, increasing its total investment to $40 billion from $12 billion.
But since TSMC started construction in 2021, various stumbling blocks have delayed the start of production.

Black Women Help In Telling Her Story: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In "My Black Country," the musician and author who cracked a Nashville color barrier is telling her story -- and hearing her songs reimagined.
The country singer Rissi Palmer could not understand why Alice Randall was emailing her.
By fall 2020, when Palmer received the message, Randall was a Nashville institution, not only the first Black woman to write a chart-topping country hit but also a novelist whose books undermined entrenched racial hierarchies. Palmer herself was no slouch: "Country Girl," her 2007 anthem of rural camaraderie, had been the first song by a Black woman to infiltrate country's charts in two decades. She had just started "Color Me Country," a podcast exploring the genre's nonwhite roots and branches.
But 11 years earlier, Palmer had fled Nashville, hamstrung by contract disputes, with "my tail between my legs," she recalled recently in a video interview from her North Carolina kitchen.
Randall, however, was very interested in Palmer -- and her history. Working as a writer-in-residence at Vanderbilt University, she had urged the school's Heard Libraries to acquire Palmer's archives: notebooks, sketches, a dress worn during her Grand Ole Opry debut.
"I've been in this business since I was 19. I made the charts when I was 26. I've had these items the whole time," said Palmer, 42. "No one has ever called me and said they had value, until Alice. There are more important people, but she saw value in me."
Randall also saw something of herself -- and a glimpse of gradual progress -- in Palmer. After breaking a Nashville color barrier when her treatise about being an overworked mother, "XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)," became a 1994 hit for Trisha Yearwood, Randall quit writing country songs.
"My songs were only going to work if I sang them, or if we found the Black woman who could," Randall said on a recent afternoon over heaping meat-and-three plates at Arnold's, a Nashville mainstay that opened in 1982, a year before she arrived. Every few minutes, someone else -- a former congressperson, a prominent downtown investor, the restaurant's scion -- stopped to shake hands. "But I didn't think we would find the star, and my characters were being erased."
Just as one of the world's biggest stars, Beyoncé, makes her own long-gestating country turn, Randall's people have been restored on a new compilation, "My Black Country," which arrives April 12. A dozen Black women -- Palmer, Rhiannon Giddens, Allison Russell -- reimagine Randall's best-known songs in their own voices, for their own lives. In a corresponding memoir, releasing April 9, Randall weaves her country career into a corrective genre history that reorients its Black past, present and future.
"I had never heard my own songs sound in real life like they sounded in my imagination," Randall, 64, said of the album's sessions, grinning broadly behind tears. "That was a Sankofa moment, a Juneteenth moment -- good news at long last."
For years, Randall's daughter, the writer and scholar Caroline Randall Williams, had encouraged her mother to publish a memoir. She had lived, after all, a remarkable life: Born in Detroit to parents who fled penury and racism in Alabama and Ohio, Randall witnessed the rise of Motown. Her father, a silk-suited tough guy who ran a laundromat and reportedly knew the Bible and "Macbeth" by heart, was a titan of the city's Black community, a friend of Anna Gordy who dazzled his daughter with her feats.
Randall rubbed childhood elbows with the prodigal Stevie Wonder and sparkled stage-side in a homemade dress when the Supremes debuted at the Copacabana. After her parents split, her mother moved her to Washington, D.C., where Randall was "a Black girl in an overgrown Southern town," she writes, attending private school alongside white bohemians. She and her mother later moved in with a man on a farm outside of the city. Soon after Randall started high school, he raped her. A John Prine cassette helped saved her life, allowing her to pour out "some of everything haunting me into it." She escaped to Harvard. And that was all before she moved to Nashville, started a publishing company, met her first husband through working on the set of a Johnny Cash music video, became a mother and wrote best-selling novels.
"Most of her life was in those novels, turned around and sideways," Williams said, framed by books in the sprawling home her mother bought two decades ago, where Williams is raising her own family. "But she is an intensely discreet person who shares what she's willing to share, not one word more."
In 2018, though, Randall was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. The time to share a more direct, personal history of her primary scenes -- Detroit, in the 2020 novel "Black Bottom Saints," and Nashville, in "My Black Country"-- had come. "I asked myself, 'If I have five years left to live, what am I going to do?"' Randall said. "I'm going to love this family, take trips with my friends and tell these two stories."
Randall's Nashville was one of perseverance, back doors and unlikely allies. Soon after she arrived, the only Black woman she saw in the music licensing agency Ascap's massive Music Row headquarters was Shirley Washington, who greeted visitors with a coffee or Coca-Cola. She sneaked Randall into the boardroom to write and gave her intel about who to meet and where to shop. The self-portrait that emerges is one of relentless work: booze-free nights studying other songwriters at the Bluebird Cafe, building a company to pitch songs to stars, a writing practice that bordered on the sacred.
"When I first got here, I would wake up in the middle of the night, write down all the songs on the radio and study them. There was no way I could afford them all," Randall said. "I didn't have any musical skills, so I had to use my literary analysis. I had to find my authority."
Randall has always been a world-builder. At age 3, in Detroit, her first song demanded her father not leave her for the bar (he took her). "My Black Country," both the album and the book, suggests a widening path Randall helped create. Its producer, Ebonie Smith, studied the recorded versions of Randall's songs, which were often Trojan horses for getting progressive ideas onto country radio, and encouraged the performers to find their own ways into the texts. Adia Victoria's "Went for a Ride," an entendre-rich tale of a beautiful Black cowboy, ripples with exquisite ache. Williams transforms "XXX's and OOO's," the hit written in part about her, into a spoken-word taunt.
In the book, Randall posits Los Angeles as the capital of Black country and widens the genre's lens to encompass Swamp Dogg and the Pointer Sisters. Most striking, though, is her First Family of Black Country, a lineage she argues is anchored by the early Grand Ole Opry star DeFord Bailey and the pianist and songwriter Lil Hardin Armstrong, extending through Ray Charles and Charley Pride to the likes of Palmer and Lil Nas X. It is a sharp rejoinder to the standard country origin story, where the sound spills from pre-Depression sessions by acts including the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers in Bristol, Tenn.
"I was injured by that mythology, and I am interested in creating counter-narratives," Randall said. She bounded among topics -- Barbie dolls, transcontinental train travel, the influence of Donna Summer on Dolly Parton and drag culture -- before gliding back toward this unifying thesis. "It took 41 years of doing this and teaching to understand that if you tell people just that much, it transforms them. You can make a different First Family. I want to start the discussion."
Now, of course, there is another branch on the family tree: Beyoncé. Randall long heard rumors about the star's latest direction, and watching the Super Bowl with friends when news of "Cowboy Carter" broke, they shared an epiphany: "Oh my God. This changes your life." For decades, Randall had waved the banner of Black women in country; on the eve of a project that reintroduced her Black country characters, she now had backup.
The next day, Randall listened through laptop speakers and transcribed Beyoncé's new songs. She made notes: the singing cowboy tradition, looking for God, the conceptual underpinnings of "sweet redemption."
"I typed the lyrics to study because that's what I did when I got here," she said, waving the annotated sheets and smiling. "I had to bring my authority."

Wall Street Steadies Itself After Its Worst Day in Weeks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: U.S. stocks held firmer on Wednesday, a day after their worst drop in weeks.
The S&P 500 inched up by 5.68 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,211.49. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 43.10, or 0.1 percent, to 39,127.14, and the Nasdaq composite added 37.01, or 0.2 percent, to 16,277.46.
GE Aerospace helped lead the S&P 500 with a jump of 6.7 percent. It was the second day of trading for the company after splitting off its power and energy business to signal the end of the General Electric conglomerate. Cal-Maine Foods rose 3.6 percent after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, selling a record number of eggs.
They helped offset an 8.2 percent drop for Intel, which disclosed financial details about key parts of its business for the first time, including its money-losing foundry business. The Walt Disney Co. fell 3.1 percent after shareholders voted against installing an activist investor to its board who had promised to shake up the company to lift its stock price. The pair's drops were a large reason the Dow lagged other indexes.
Stocks have broadly slowed their roll since screaming 26 percent higher from November through March. Worries are rising that a remarkably resilient U.S. economy could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering as many cuts to interest rates this year as hoped. Critics have also been saying that at least a pullback was due after stock prices had overperformed by several measures.
The Fed has indicated that it may still cut its main interest rate three times this year, which would relieve pressure on the economy. But Fed officials say they will do so only if more evidence arrives to show inflation is heading down toward their goal of 2 percent.
The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, reiterated that message in a speech on Wednesday, spelling out the risks of cutting rates either too early or too late. "Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy," he said.
What has Wall Street worried has been a litany of reports showing the economy remains stronger than expected. That's positive because it means the economy continues to avoid a recession, and it should provide support for corporate profits. But it could also add upward pressure on inflation and discourage the Fed from cutting rates.
Markets took encouragement from a report on Wednesday morning that showed growth in construction, retail and other U.S. services businesses cooled last month. The report from the Institute from Supply Management also said an index of prices paid was at its lowest level since March 2020, an encouraging trend for inflation.
That calmed Wall Street's nerves following a report earlier in the morning that markets found more discouraging. It suggested stronger gains than expected in hiring within the private sector. That report from the ADP Research Institute said employers accelerated their hiring last month, when economists were forecasting a slowdown.
A more comprehensive report on the job market for March will arrive from the U.S. government on Friday, and it will likely be the week's headline economic data.
Traders have already drastically reduced their expectations for how many times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, halving them from a forecast of six at the start of the year. That has them on the same page with Fed officials generally. Some investors, though, are preparing for two or even zero cuts this year because the Fed may not want to begin lowering rates too close to November's election out of fear of appearing political.
But Mr. Powell said on Wednesday the central bank has the independence that "both enables and requires us to make our monetary policy decisions without consideration of short-term political matters."

Is This the Silicon Valley of Latin America?: [Editorial]

Full text: Americans used to think of China as a place to do business and Latin America as a place to vacation. More recently, our neighbors to the south are seen as the source of desperate migrants. That mind-set led us to the mess that we are in now. Today the American economy is far too dependent on China for critical supplies while imports from countries in our hemisphere, aside from Canada and Mexico, are lagging, experts say. Our influence in our own neighborhood is waning.
It doesn't have to be this way. I saw evidence of that in Costa Rica, a stable democracy that is vying to become the Silicon Valley of Latin America -- with active support from the United States.
Costa Rica is crucial to the gargantuan U.S. effort to reduce dependence on microchips from China, which plays an outsize role in packaging and testing the tiny gadgets that run everything from smartphones to fighter jets. More than 40 percent of the chips the U.S. Department of Defense uses for weapons systems and infrastructure rely on Chinese suppliers. More than 90 percent of advanced chips are produced in Taiwan, a self-governing island claimed by China.
Now Costa Rica is positioning itself to become a major hub outside Asia for packaging and testing microchips. In the 1990s, Intel built a factory near San José to do just that. That opened the door to more factories and industries and, as a result, an increasingly tech-oriented work force. Today Costa Rica's biggest category of exports is no longer coffee or bananas but medical devices.
On a recent Thursday afternoon, in a hotel ballroom outside the capital, San José, President Rodrigo Chaves touted tax incentives, regulatory reforms and a 99 percent-renewable-energy grid as he rolled out a national strategy to expand the industry. "Welcome to Costa Rica, a country where thou shall not face red tape," he boomed.
His audience -- which included the U.S. commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo; Gen. Laura Richardson, the four-star who leads the U.S. Southern Command; and top executives from Intel -- enthusiastically applauded.
"We need allies closer to home," Ms. Raimondo told me. She is in charge of doling out tens of billions in subsidies to bring the industry closer to home, an effort that is crucial to ensuring that Americans stay on the cutting edge of A.I. and other critical technologies in the future.
This great reshuffling of the U.S. supply chain could be the key to building better relationships in Latin America at a time of rising isolationism in the United States, when both parties have grown skeptical of free trade and frustrated by record numbers of migrant arrivals.
While the CHIPS and Science Act is best known for its billion-dollar subsidies to build facilities on U.S. soil, it also provides modest funding for our allies. Costa Rica and Panama have received money to beef up their work forces and their infrastructure. The Dominican Republic looks poised to be next in line.
It's no accident that building resiliency for supply chains is a main goal of the Americas Act, the new bipartisan bill that would revamp relations with friendly neighbors and put them on a path to join the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade agreement that replaced NAFTA.
I was a vocal critic of NAFTA, a view I came to while writing about American factory workers who lost their jobs when their plant moved to Mexico. Exporting our industrial base hurt American workers and U.S. national security. But the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which passed overwhelmingly in Congress a few years ago, has gone a long way toward addressing workers' concerns. It's popular. Why not expand it? And if more trade with Latin America will build up an industrial base that would have otherwise gone to Asia, it could make our region stronger, not weaker.
Nations that trade the most with their nearest neighbors get the biggest benefits from trade while minimizing the dislocating job loss that can come with it, as Shannon O'Neil argues in the recent book "The Globalization Myth." Europe and Asia are mastering that. America is not.
When America turned to Asia for low-cost labor, that left a void in our own backyard, as Karina Fernandez-Stark and Penny Bamber noted in a recent article in The Wilson Quarterly. China is filling it, becoming the most important trade partner and investor in much of Latin America. Twenty-two countries in the Western Hemisphere have signed onto China's Belt and Road initiative. Chinese companies are building a deepwater port in Peru, a bridge across the Panama Canal and a deep space ground station in Argentina.
We can't blame our Latin American friends for turning to China to make investments that we won't provide. While we've been off trying to run the world, we've been elbowed out of our own hemisphere.
Supply chain diplomacy can help. Until now, Costa Rica has hedged its bets, signing onto Belt and Road while lobbying for the chance to join the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. But the chance to be a microchip hub seems to have tipped the balance. Mr. Chaves abruptly excluded the Chinese vendor Huawei -- alongside others -- from building the country's 5G network, angering China.
"Sometimes you need to make difficult decisions," Mr. Chaves told his audience. "We're not imagining the future; we are building it, with those with whom we share values."
It's smart, both geopolitically and economically, to nurture that sense of shared destiny. It won't be a quick fix to the region's many problems, but it can help turn the tide over time. Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic are relatively small countries with limited influence. But if their economies are booming, they can provide more opportunities to those fleeing crisis-ridden places like Haiti and Nicaragua. Fewer migrants will arrive at our doorstep.
Like any policy, supply chain diplomacy has its risks. We could be building up our future competitors. I couldn't help but notice that San José seems better poised for the digital age than rural Ohio. Some technical high schools already teach an artificial intelligence curriculum, a senior Intel executive in Costa Rica told me. The industry attracts top talent and fierce loyalty. At Intel's plant near San José, one factory manager told me that he "bleeds blue" -- the color of the company logo.
But this factory wouldn't be competitive in the United States. Even in Costa Rica, it has struggled to compete with the low labor costs of Asia. Intel closed the plant in 2014 and sent its work to Malaysia, leaving a skeleton crew doing research and development. The factory reopened in 2020, after the pandemic set off a chip shortage. Intel has been expanding ever since, gobbling up space that used to be a cafeteria. Demand for chips will only increase with the rise of artificial intelligence.
How we navigate the challenges posed by A.I. -- and a far more powerful China -- will determine our future. We have a choice: face those challenges by ourselves or with friendly neighbors.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He conceived an early version of cyberspace and predicted the "technological singularity," a tipping point at which machines would become smarter than humans.
Vernor Vinge, a mathematician and prolific science fiction author who in the 1980s wrote a novella that offered an early glimpse of what became known as cyberspace, and who soon after that hypothesized that artificial intelligence would outstrip human intelligence, died on March 20 in the La Jolla area of San Diego. He was 79.
James Frenkel, who edited nearly all of his work since 1981, said the cause of death, in an assisted living facility, was Parkinson's disease.
David Brin, a science fiction writer and a friend of Mr. Vinge's, said in a tribute on Facebook, "Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters and the implications of science."
Mr. Vinge (pronounced VIN-jee) was renowned for his novella "True Names" (1981), in which he created an early version of cyberspace -- a virtual reality technology he called the "Other Plane" -- a year before William Gibson gave the nascent digital ecosystem its name in a story, "Burning Chrome," and three years later popularized the word in his novel "Neuromancer."
In "True Names," Mr. Slippery, one of the anonymous computer hackers known as warlocks who work within the Other Plane, is identified and caught by the government (the "Great Enemy") and forced to help stop a threat posed by another warlock.
In a 2001 article about Mr. Vinge, Katie Hafner, at the time a technology reporter for The New York Times, wrote that "True Names" "portrays a world rife with pseudonymous characters and other elements of online life that now seem almost ho-hum," adding that in retrospect the book seemed "prophetic."
Mr. Vinge's immersion in computers at San Diego State University, where he began teaching in 1972, led to his vision of a "technological singularity," a tipping point at which the intelligence of machines possesses and then exceeds that of humans.
He described an early version of his vision in Omni magazine in 1983.
"We're at the point of accelerating the evolution of intelligence itself," he wrote, adding, "Whether our work is cast in silicon or DNA will have little effect on the ultimate results." He wrote that the moment of the intellectual transition would be as "impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole," and that at that moment "the world will pass far beyond our understanding."
A decade later, he fleshed out the intellectual transition -- the singularity -- in a paper (subtitled "How to Survive in the Post-Human Era") for a symposium sponsored by the NASA Lewis Research Center and the Ohio Aerospace Institute.
"Within 30 years," he said, "we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended. Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided so that we may survive?"
That prediction has not come true, but artificial intelligence has accelerated to the point that some people fear that the technology will replace them.
Mr. Frenkel said that Mr. Vinge had used the concept of singularities in his "Zones of Thought" series, in which they are superintelligent beings in a part of the galaxy called the Transcend.
"They are entities of pure thought," Mr. Frenkel said in an interview. "They're enormously powerful. Some are beneficent and some are malevolent."
Two of the novels in that series, "A Fire Upon the Deep" (1993) and "A Deepness in the Sky" (2000), won the Hugo Award, the top honor in science fiction. Mr. Vinge received Hugos for another novel, "Rainbows End" (2007), and for the novellas "Fast Times at Fairmont High" (2002) and "The Cookie Monster" (2004).
Reviewing "A Fire Upon the Deep" in Wired magazine, Peter Schwartz wrote: "Not since William Gibson gave us the fully realized world of cyberspace in 'Neuromancer' has anyone given us so rich a diet of new ideas. Imagine a universe where the laws of physics vary along the axis of the great wheel of the Milky Way galaxy."
Vernor Steffen Vinge was born on Oct. 2, 1944, in Waukesha, Wis., and moved with his family to East Lansing, Mich., where his father, Clarence, taught geography at Michigan State University. His mother, Ada Grace (Rowlands) Vinge, was a geographer who wrote two books with her husband.
After graduating from Michigan State with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1966, Mr. Vinge received his master's degree and his Ph.D. in the same subject at the University of California, San Diego, in 1968 and 1971. He began teaching math at San Diego State University in 1972 but shifted to computer science after he began "playing with real computers" in the early 1970s, he told The Times. He retired in 2000 to focus on writing.
"Vernor liked teaching, and was very popular with students, but he mentioned he could only really find time to write between semesters (principally summers)," John Carroll, a colleague in the computer science department at San Diego State and the executor of his estate, wrote in an email. "Something had to give, and his teaching could be done by others, but the increased flow of novels and ideas was irreplaceable."
Mr. Vinge's first published short story, "Apartness," appeared in New Worlds magazine in 1965. Four years later, he published his first novel, "Grimm's World," which revolves around a 700-year-old science fiction magazine -- published on a gargantuan globe-traveling barge -- that is the source of technological progress in the world.
His marriage to Joan Dennison in 1972 ended in divorce seven years later, but they remained friends. As Joan Vinge, she has won five Hugo Awards. She married Mr. Frenkel, who is her editor, in 1980. Mr. Vinge's sister, Patricia Vinge, is his only immediate survivor.
Mr. Vinge was teaching networks and operating systems when he got the idea for "True Names." He had been using an early form of instant messaging called Talk in the late 1970s when he and another user tried to figure out each other's names.
"Finally, I gave up and told the other person I had to go -- that I was actually a personality simulator, and if I kept talking, my artificial nature would become obvious," he was quoted as saying in the 2001 Times article. "Afterwards I realized that I had just lived a science fiction story."
Mr. Vinge occasionally returned to the subject of the singularity.
When he was interviewed in 2000 for the NPR program "Fresh Air," he said his prognostication was inspired in part by Moore's Law, which was posited in 1965 by Gordon Moore, then the head of research and development at Fairchild Semiconductor and later a founder of Intel. The law stated that every year the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double, without much of a rise in cost, exponentially increasing the power of computing. Mr. Moore later amended it to every two years.
The logical conclusion suggested by Moore's Law, Mr. Vinge said, was that "we will hit a crossover point" that would make computers as intellectually powerful as humans -- "assuming someone can program them."

Tariff Fight Over Solar In Germany: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Domestic manufacturers are caught between China's low prices and U.S. protectionist policies, even as demand increases.
Before China came to dominate the solar panel industry, Germany led the way. It was the world's largest producer of solar panels, with several start-ups clustered in the former East Germany, until about a decade ago when China ramped up production and undercut just about everyone on price.
Now as Germany and the rest of Europe try to reach ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for solar panels has only increased.
Some of the last remaining manufacturers in Germany's solar industry are not ready to give up.
They are demanding that the government in Berlin offer incentives to protect producers that have survived by catering to niche markets and expanding beyond making panels. They argue that Europe's high standards for the origin of materials and shorter supply chains make production in Germany more environmentally friendly and reliable.
Not everyone is convinced protectionism is the way to go. Some critics note that the European Union's tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 2013 to 2018 failed to save the domestic industry. Others argue that affordable, widely available solar panels are desperately needed regardless of their origin.
Because Europe relies "to a very important degree" on imported solar panels, any measure to restrict imports "needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition," Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial stability, told the European Parliament last month.
But for European solar manufacturers, the problem has gotten worse in the past year. Not only have the Chinese increased their production of solar panels, but the United States tightened its tariffs to include Chinese panels shipped to Southeast Asian countries for final assembly. That has caused a flood of Chinese panels to reach Europe at below-market prices, government officials and company executives say, crushing any chance at fair competition.
Last year, more than 97 percent of the solar panels installed on roofs and in fields across Europe were made abroad, the vast majority in China, where cheap energy and government support keep prices low.
"Chinese competitors are currently giving away their products in unimaginable quantities in Europe at far below their own production costs," said an open letter to the government written by Gunter Erfurt, the chief executive of Meyer Burger, a Swiss solar energy company that has two factories and a research center in Germany.
"We are fighting for fair market conditions, which have not existed for just under a year," Mr. Erfurt wrote.
Mr. Erfurt's appeal cited several other German companies involved in solar production that all want the government to help shore up the industry in the face of the fierce competition from China.
The German Solar Association is calling on the government to push through a proposed incentive, called a "resilience bonus," that would pay solar panel owners a higher rate for electricity that is fed into the grid from domestically produced panels.
"While other countries such as the United States and China are strongly promoting the establishment and scaling up of solar gigafactories, the German government has yet to take concrete action," the group warned in January.
To meet its ambitious climate goals, Germany needs to generate an additional 80 gigawatts of solar power annually. But last year, the country installed enough to generate just 9 gigawatts -- and domestic photovoltaic companies say they have the capacity to produce only about 1 gigawatt of solar power per year.
That reality has led to a bitter dispute within the German solar industry, where some believe subsidies will do more harm than good.
Philipp Schröder, a former Tesla executive who runs 1Komma5, a solar company he co-founded, said it got its components mainly from Europe and the United States and successfully competed against low-cost Chinese panels by bundling panels with heat pumps, batteries and software to run the complete system. He is against any form of government support.
"The resilience bonus being discussed in Germany right now might be beneficial for a few profiteers in the short term, but in the medium term it acts like an addictive drug that suppresses innovation and fragments the E.U. market," Mr. Schröder said in a post on LinkedIn.
This month, Meyer Burger deepened the dispute when it halted production at a facility in Freiberg in the eastern German state of Saxony and said it would shift the company's focus to expanding production in Arizona and Colorado. There, it can take advantage of U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese panels and incentives offered through the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.
"Due to a lack of European protection against unfair competition from China, nearly four years of hard work by great employees in Europe is at risk," the board of Sentis Capital Cell 3 PC, the largest shareholder in Meyer Burger, said in a statement. In a slap at German lawmakers, the board cited "strong bipartisan commitment" in Washington "to protect U.S.-based companies against unfair competition."
Further stoking anger in the solar industry are the billions in subsidies that the government has pledged to attract other companies, including the battery producer Northvolt and the microchip manufacturers Intel and TSMC, as it appears stymied over the question of how to handle solar.
Sven Giegold, an under secretary in the Economy Ministry, told reporters this month that Germany would propose measures to help "support the local production of solar technology," but quickly added: "Trade defense measures are not helpful."
Germany has been here before. In the early 2000s, a combination of government incentives, scientific research and cutting-edge technology helped make its solar industry the world's leading producer of photovoltaic panels and technology.
Then manufacturers from abroad, especially China, caught on and sold solar panels at prices well below what the Germans were offering. The impact was swift and brutal. Companies such as Q-Cells, Solon and SolarWorld declared bankruptcy and disappeared. But some businesses held on by focusing on assembling, installing and integrating solar panels in comprehensive green power systems.
Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank, said he agreed that new tariffs would not make sense. To achieve a secure supply of panels, as well as support the green transition and economic growth, he suggested that Europe instead support development of new solar technologies.
"Go for the new generation of solar panels, products that are still at the forefront of innovation," Mr. Tagliapietra said. "If we cannot beat the Chinese on quantity, we need to try to beat them on quality."
Solarwatt, based in the former East Germany, said it might also have to close one of its solar panel plants. But making panels is only one part of the company; it also creates systems that connect the power generated by solar panels to wall boxes that can charge cars and heat pumps to warm homes.
"The future of our company is not a risk, even if production had to be shut down," the company said in a statement, adding that other divisions could absorb the roughly 120 people whose jobs would be at stake.
Meyer Burger's decision to shut its plant in Freiberg has left as many as 500 jobs in limbo. The company's chief executive, Mr. Erfurt, said the factory's future depended on political leaders in Berlin. "But we don't see a bridge being built from the government at the moment," he said.
At the same time, the company is contemplating other alternatives, he said, adding that "one option is simply to dismantle and rebuild it in U.S."

Meyer Burger’s decision to shut its plant in Freiberg has left as many as 500 jobs in limbo. The company’s CEO, Erfurt, said the factory’s future depended on political leaders in Berlin. “But we don’t see a bridge being built from the government at the moment,” he said.
At the same time, the company is contemplating other alternatives, he said, adding that “one option is simply to dismantle and rebuild it in U.S.”

A.I. Leaders Lobby Congress as China Tensions Rise: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In recent weeks, American lawmakers have moved to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok. President Biden reinforced his commitment to overcome China's rise in tech. And the Chinese government added chips from Intel and AMD to a blacklist of imports.
Now, as the tech and economic cold war between the United States and China accelerates, Silicon Valley's leaders are capitalizing on the strife with a lobbying push for their interests in another promising field of technology: artificial intelligence.
On May 1, more than 100 tech chiefs and investors, including Alex Karp, the head of the defense contractor Palantir, and Roelof Botha, the managing partner of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, will come to Washington for a daylong conference and private dinner focused on drumming up more hawkishness toward China's progress in A.I.
Dozens of lawmakers, including Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, will also attend the event, the Hill & Valley Forum, which will include fireside chats and keynote discussions with members of a new House A.I. task force.
Tech executives plan to use the event to directly lobby against A.I. regulations that they consider onerous, as well as ask for more government spending on the technology and research to support its development. They also plan to ask to relax immigration restrictions to bring more A.I. experts to the United States.
The event highlights an unusual area of agreement between Washington and Silicon Valley, which have long clashed on topics like data privacy, children's online protections and even China.
"At the end of the day, whether you are in industry or government, or whatever side of the aisle you are on, we play for team America," said Representative Jay Obernolte of California, the Republican chair of the House A.I. Task Force, who will give opening remarks at the conference.
After the rise over the past year of generative A.I. -- technology that has the potential to fundamentally shift productivity, innovation and employment trends -- lobbying on the topic has exploded. Last year, more than 450 companies, nonprofits, universities and trade groups reported lobbying on A.I., more than double the number of organizations in the previous year, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit research group. Palantir more than doubled its spending on lobbying last year to $ 5 million, its highest level on record.
As tech leaders capitalize on anti-China fervor in Washington, civil society groups and academics warn that debates over competition for tech leadership could hurt efforts to regulate potential harms, such as the risks that some A.I. tools could kill jobs, spread disinformation, and disrupt elections.
"The dynamics of this U.S. v. China race has profound implications because on the other side of slowing down China is minimal friction and regulation for U.S. companies," said Amba Kak, who is the executive director of the AI Now Institute, a research firm, and a former senior adviser on A.I. to the Federal Trade Commission.
A.I. experts say China lags the United States in generative A.I. by at least a year and may be falling further behind, although a new study suggests that it is ahead in the talent.
May's event is being organized by Jacob Helberg, a senior adviser to Palantir and a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which reports to Congress on national security threats posed by China. He expanded this year's forum from the first gathering he organized last year, which was a private dinner focused largely on the threat of TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance.
In addition to A.I., lawmakers speaking at the event in the Capitol will push for the Senate to pass legislation to ban TikTok, and Tom Mueller, a founding employee of SpaceX, will speak about the space race between the United States and China. Attendees will include Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
"Tech companies can't be neutral any more," Mr. Helberg said, adding that he recuses himself from any work involving contracts on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission that could give Palantir an advantage.
Venture capitalists attending the event have dozens of A.I. investments. Sequoia has invested in more than 70 A.I. startups. Khosla Ventures, a $ 15 billion venture firm, has several investments, including in OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT chatbot.
"It's become even more obvious, even more critical, that we treat China as an adversary," said Vinod Khosla, the head of Khosla Ventures who will speak at the forum. "What I'm worrying about is Western values versus a different set of values in China."

Promising Higher Taxes on Rich, Biden Has Cut Overall: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden has called for $ 5 trillion in new taxes on corporations and high earners. But his record so far is as a net tax cutter.
President Biden, amping up a populist pitch in his re-election campaign, has repeatedly said he would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations to make them pay their "fair share."
Republicans say Mr. Biden has "an unquenchable thirst for taxing the American people." His Republican opponent in the election, former President Donald J. Trump, said recently that Mr. Biden was "going to give you the greatest, biggest, ugliest tax hike in the history of our country."
So it might come as a surprise that, in just over three years in office, Mr. Biden has cut taxes overall.
The math is straightforward. An analysis prepared for The New York Times by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank that studies fiscal issues, shows that the tax cuts Mr. Biden has signed for individuals and corporations are larger than the tax increases he has imposed on big corporations and their shareholders.
The analysis estimates that the tax changes Mr. Biden has ushered into law will amount to a net cut of about $ 600 billion over four years and slightly more than that over a full decade.
"It's reasonable to conclude from those numbers that the Biden tax policy hasn't been some kind of radical tax-raising program," said Benjamin R. Page, a senior fellow at the center and author of the analysis.
The analysis strictly looks at changes to taxes over the course of Mr. Biden's presidency, including some direct benefits to people and businesses that flow through the tax code. It does not measure the effects of inflation or certain regulations, which Republicans sometimes label "tax hikes" since they can raise costs for companies and individuals.
It also does not measure the social or economic benefits of Mr. Biden's spending policies, or of his regulatory efforts meant to help consumers, like cracking down on so-called junk fees and limiting the cost of insulin and other medication.
Instead, the analysis provides a comprehensive look at what Mr. Biden has done to the tax code, and how those policies add up.
It is clear by that measure that his record has not matched his own ambitions for taxing the rich and big companies -- or Republicans' attempts to caricature him as a tax-and-spend liberal.
That's largely because Mr. Biden has struggled to pass his most ambitious tax-raising plans. "It's what can be got through Congress and signed," Mr. Page said. "They were subject to compromise."
A White House spokesman, Michael Kikukawa, said in an email that Mr. Biden was "proud to have cut taxes for the middle class and working families while cracking down on wealthy tax cheats and making big corporations pay more of their fair share."
The president's enacted tax cuts include incentives for companies to manufacture and install solar panels, wind turbines and other technologies meant to reduce fossil fuel emissions, which are a centerpiece of the climate law he signed in 2022. That law also contained tax cuts for people who buy certain low-emission technologies, like electric vehicles and heat pumps.
Mr. Biden gave tax breaks to semiconductor factories as well, as part of a bipartisan advanced manufacturing bill he signed earlier that year.
The president also included temporary tax breaks for individuals and certain businesses in his 2021 economic stimulus bill, the American Rescue Plan. The legislation expanded a tax credit for parents. It provided $ 1,400 direct checks for low- and middle-income Americans, which were technically advance payments on tax credits.
Mr. Biden has partly offset all of his tax cuts with a pair of major new levies. Corporations are now required to pay a tax when they buy back their own stock. Another tax requires large corporations to pay a minimum 15 percent federal income tax, even if they qualify for deductions that would have made them owe less.
The president has also directed tens of billions of dollars to the Internal Revenue Service to help crack down on high earners and corporations that evade paying the taxes they owe -- an effort that will increase federal tax revenues but does not increase tax rates.
But the president has struggled to persuade Congress -- including a sufficient number of Democrats, in the two years his party controlled the House and the Senate on his watch -- to sign on to a fleet of other proposed tax increases.
Mr. Biden's budget requests have been filled with ideas for taxing high earners and corporations. Those have failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. His most recent budget includes about $ 5 trillion of tax increases spread over a decade, including longstanding Democratic plans like raising the corporate income tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent.
Republicans assailed Mr. Biden for tax plans they say will cripple the economy. Representative Jodey C. Arrington, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Budget Committee, said in a hearing on Thursday that Mr. Biden believed "in more government and more spending and more taxing as the answers to the problems that our country faces."
Mr. Biden has emphasized his tax proposals in recent weeks, including during his State of the Union address. The president has repeatedly said he would not raise taxes on people earning less than $ 400,000 a year, while calling on millionaires and billionaires to pay more.
He has also vaunted his tax record, as he did this week in Las Vegas. "In 2020, 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies made $ 40 billion in profits," Mr. Biden said. "They paid zero in federal taxes. Not anymore."
Mr. Biden was referring to the corporate minimum tax created by the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law that also included the climate-related tax incentives. The Treasury Department has struggled to implement that tax, which companies faced for the first time last year.
The department does not yet have data on how many corporations will pay the tax for 2023, officials said this week.

Is Apple Antitrust Suit An Echo of Microsoft?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prosecutors compare their new fight against Apple to the seminal case against Windows in the 1990s.
Impeding innovation. Reducing consumer choice. Extending dominance to other markets.
These are accusations that the Justice Department leveled against a technology giant it accused of running an illegal monopoly. But they aren't from this week's antitrust lawsuit against Apple -- they're from the case the department brought against Microsoft in 1998.
The move against Apple is, along with the Justice Department's 2020 lawsuit against Google over search, perhaps the most ambitious tech antitrust battle since the Clinton administration's effort to open up Microsoft's Windows operating system.
And federal prosecutors are explicitly connecting the Apple lawsuit to that earlier fight. "They're really presenting this case as a successor to that: Microsoft 2.0," said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.
But the comparison isn't perfect. And it isn't clear whether the Justice Department will be able to achieve here what it claims to have done by suing Microsoft.
The Justice Department sees a direct connection between the two cases. "Microsoft" appears 26 times in the Apple complaint. And prosecutors say Apple wouldn't have achieved its current towering success had it not been for the government's fight against Microsoft:
The iPod did not achieve widespread adoption until Apple developed a cross-platform version of the iPod and iTunes for Microsoft's Windows operating system, at the time the dominant operating system for personal computers. In the absence of the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft, it would have been more difficult for Apple to achieve this success and ultimately launch the iPhone.
In the 1998 case, the Justice Department argued that Microsoft illicitly sought to protect its Windows software from competition like the Netscape Navigator browser and Apple's QuickTime multimedia software.
This week, the agency said Apple was doing something similar, unlawfully restricting competition by denying rivals access to key iPhone features like its contactless payment chip. "Each step in Apple's course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly," prosecutors wrote in Thursday's lawsuit.
The Justice Department sees another opportunity. Any hold Microsoft had on the emerging internet economy, the agency says, was broken, allowing companies like Google, Facebook and, yes, Apple, to prosper.
"Today, we stand here, once again, to protect competition and innovation for the next generation of technology," Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said at Thursday's news conference.
Others say the Microsoft case's legacy is less clear. Hurwitz told DealBook that the reality was more complicated. Netscape failed in part because a botched upgrade turned off users, while Microsoft missed out on the dawn of internet 2.0 services because of bad strategic decisions.
"In terms of actual industrial changes, I think the case yielded very little," Hurwitz said.
The comparison of the lawsuits falls short in several ways. For one, the Apple case is more ambitious, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. While both cases accused companies of using exclusivity to hamper rival technologies, the more recent case also demands that Apple ease operability across platforms, like ensuring that text messages from iPhone and Android devices work the same.
Then there is the matter of defining market share. In 1998, over 80 percent of Intel-based personal computers used Windows software. By contrast, the iPhone had about 64 percent of the U.S. smartphone market at the end of last year, according to one estimate. (Globally, it's closer to 20 percent.) That said, federal prosecutors say Apple controls 70 percent of what they call the "performance" smartphone market, which also includes high-end devices by Samsung and Google.
And technology advances more quickly than it did in 1998. Smartphones could evolve in unexpected directions by the time the Apple case wraps up, potentially limiting the case's effect on innovation. "Technology is racing ahead like a Formula 1 automobile," Kovacic said, "and antitrust is riding a bicycle trying to catch up."
The Microsoft fight does underscore the risks Apple faces. Regardless of what the earlier antitrust lawsuit accomplished, Microsoft was tied up in litigation for years, a costly distraction. Apple -- which is already battling tighter regulations around the world -- will have to devote some of its considerable resources to defending itself here.
"That might open up opportunities for competitors," Hurwitz said. But he added, "That's not necessarily the best way of facilitating competition in the market." -- Michael J. de la Merced and Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Microsoft poached an artificial intelligence pioneer. The Windows maker hired Mustafa Suleyman, a former Google executive, and most of the staff at Inflection AI, the start-up he co-founded. Suleyman will lead Microsoft's consumer A.I. business.
The Federal Reserve reiterated expectations to cut rates three times this year. The central bank held interest rates steady at about 5.3 percent, with inflation not yet at the Fed's 2 percent target. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said the economy was performing strongly, a sign that a recession may not be needed to bring down inflation.
The Biden administration issued one of its toughest climate rules yet. New Environmental Protection Agency regulations will require most cars sold in the United States to be electric or hybrid by 2032. The rules will gradually limit allowed tailpipe emissions, but will give carmakers more time to adapt than previously planned.
Donald Trump's social media company merged with a shell company. Shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corporation voted to give the parent company of Truth Social its stock market listing. The transaction will add $ 3 billion to Trump's wealth, potentially providing a new cash source to pay his mounting legal bills.
Redditors on the Reddit I.P.O.
Reddit is the first social media company to go public since Snap in 2017. It is also the first to do so in the meme stock era, making its own users one of the biggest risks to its share price. Leading up to the initial public offering on Thursday, some wondered if Reddit users on forums like WallStreetBets, which helped power the rise of meme stocks, would try to manipulate the company's share price as they did for GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. But Ivan Cosovic, the managing director of the data company Breakout Point, told DealBook that chatter in the community had been "a mix of short-term excitement driven by FOMO and long-term skepticism based on fundamentals."
Mentions of RDDT, Reddit's stock ticker symbol, on WallStreetBets peaked after its shares started trading Thursday afternoon, rising to be on a par with mentions of the chipmaker Nvidia, a favorite stock of retail investors. But they amounted to just 5 percent of the daily mentions of GameStop in January 2021, when the forum helped drive the retailer's stock up more than 1,700 percent. And they petered out shortly after Reddit's shares listed.
Opinions on the forum largely varied between two extremes. "This is a death sandwich, which exists purely as VC exit liquidity," read one popular post. Another said users bashing Reddit's stock in the forum "all use it for 12 hours a day and would be helpless without it."
How China views the new U.S. crackdown on TikTok
Dan Wang is a leading observer of contemporary China. As a tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, and through his well-read newsletter, Wang has charted the country's rise as a fast-growing high-tech economy and, more recently, its slowdown and rising tensions with the United States.
Wang is now a visiting scholar at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center and writing a book about the relationship between China and the U.S. The interview has been edited and condensed.
How does China see the latest TikTok fight?
Chinese state media and the government have made it clear that this is very unwelcome. China feels that ByteDance is a very, very successful company that is being bullied in America because it is Chinese. The Chinese people are affronted by the U.S. government declaring it a national security threat. And Beijing has passed laws that recommendation algorithms are subject to Chinese export controls, so the sense is that the government will not allow a sale to go through.
Is the Chinese government using the case as a propaganda tool?
State media is keeping its powder dry because there are still several steps before ByteDance might have to sell TikTok in the U.S. These include Senate passage, the White House's signature, as well as the legal challenges that ByteDance is sure to bring. Before this looks imminent, state media is not rallying citizens to object too much.
What does it look like when state media mobilizes the public?
In 2022, Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and a lot of Western companies made anodyne statements. Chinese state media seized on one company, H&M, which made a fairly typical statement that it did not source from Xinjiang or tolerate forced labor in its supply chains. China's Communist Youth League reposted a statement on social media saying that you cannot both make money in China as well as criticize China. That incited a consumer boycott. H&M products disappeared from pretty much all e-commerce sites, and H&M stores disappeared from online maps. The company was essentially erased from the Chinese internet, and it was really difficult to buy its products or find its physical stores.
How could China retaliate toward U.S. companies?
The more important question is: Does Beijing decide that this act is worthy of retaliation? I spent all four years of President Trump's trade war living in China, and Beijing was highly forbearing toward U.S. companies.
First, Beijing realizes that big U.S. companies are major employers in China, like Apple, through Foxconn, as well as Tesla. Second, Beijing realizes that American businesses are its last best friends left in Washington, and it would prefer that American companies continue to lobby Congress to maintain ties. It would also prefer that Elon Musk doesn't spend all day tweeting about how terrible China is.
Is China playing a long game?
Beijing might well treat this as a pretty substantial propaganda victory if the U.S. government forces a sale or actually bans TikTok. It would play into Beijing's hands to say that the U.S. has been talking about free speech for a long time but this illustrates that the U.S. is a hypocrite.
How is the fact that Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, is working on a bid to buy TikTok perceived?
If it is successful, it would be viewed as in bad taste -- not just in China but pretty much everywhere -- that an official who ordered a sale then ends up actually owning it. For Beijing, it would be the cherry on the cake in terms of its propaganda.

Ohio's Senior Senator Faces an Uphill Climb: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ohio will almost certainly go for Donald Trump this November. The Democratic senator will need to defy the gravity of the presidential contest to win a fourth term.
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has always had the luxury of running for election in remarkably good years for his party. He won his seat in 2006, during the backlash to the Iraq War, won re-election in 2012, the last time a Democrat carried the state, and did so again in 2018, amid a national reckoning of Donald J. Trump's presidency.
His campaign in 2024 will be different, and most likely the toughest of his career, with a Republican Party determined to win his seat and a Democratic president hanging off him like one of his trademark rumpled suits. In an election year when control of the Senate relies on the Democratic Party's ability to win every single competitive race, an enormous weight sits on the slumped shoulders of the famously disheveled 71-year-old.
"I fight for Ohioans," Mr. Brown said in an interview on Wednesday. "There's a reason I win in a state that's a little more Republican."
Mr. Brown's tousled hair and gravelly voice have spoken to working-class voters since he was elected Ohio's secretary of state in 1982. His arms may be clenched tightly around his chest, but he projects a casual confidence that he can win once again in firmly red Ohio, where he is the last Democrat holding statewide office.
But beneath that image is trouble. On Monday, he had just received an endorsement from the 100,000-strong Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, when a retired bricklayer, Jeff King, pulled him aside in a weathered union hall in Dayton.
Mr. Brown has had plenty of achievements to run on, Mr. King, who made the trip from his local in Cincinnati, told the senator. But, he asked, would workers in a blue-collar state that has twice handed Mr. Trump eight-percentage-point victories understand who should get the credit?
"That's the mission," Mr. Brown said, leaning in. "They don't know enough."
The party and its union allies have made the re-election of Ohio's senior senator their highest priority -- "the very top," said Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political committee.
The election could be breaking Mr. Brown's way. With Mr. Trump's endorsement -- and a nudge from a Democratic super PAC -- the Democrats' preferred Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, easily prevailed in the Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, handing the incumbent a foil with staggering wealth, little political experience and the imprimatur of a former president who could prompt some voters to split their tickets.
The next day, the Biden administration announced an $ 8.5 billion deal to fund Intel Corporation's semiconductor manufacturing, much of it destined for Ohio, courtesy of legislation that Mr. Brown helped secure. Because of Mr. Brown, that law, the Chips and Science Act, requires so-called project labor agreements to be struck between management and union laborers before plant construction could begin. So 7,000 union tradesmen will be employed at the massive Intel complex outside of Columbus.
On that same Wednesday, the administration finalized stringent new car and truck emissions standards that should increase electric-vehicle manufacturing at the Stellantis Jeep complex in Toledo and automotive battery plants around Youngstown.
Finally, construction should begin around election time on a long-sought replacement for the Brent Spence Bridge, linking Cincinnati to its suburbs in Kentucky. That, too, was delivered in part by Mr. Brown.
Yet Republicans are supremely confident for a much simpler reason: political gravity. In March polling, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden in Ohio by as few as nine percentage points, and as many as 18. Mr. Brown will most likely run ahead of Mr. Biden in the state, Republicans say, but not by enough to win.
"We have an opportunity now to retire the old commie," Mr. Moreno proclaimed at his victory party on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Brown.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Brown insisted that his toughest Senate race was his first, when he unseated Mike DeWine, who went on to win two terms as Ohio's governor.
And Mr. DeWine lent credence to that confidence on Monday night, pleading with voters in Columbus to cast their ballots for the candidate he thought could beat Mr. Brown, State Senator Matt Dolan.
"This is not going to be an easy race, folks," Mr. DeWine advised at the Hey Hey Bar & Grill in Columbus's German Village. "I've run against this man."
This year could be different.
"Nothing can save Sherrod Brown from the fact that he votes with Joe Biden 99 percent of the time," Mr. Moreno said.
Compared to Mr. Moreno, a political newcomer, Mr. Brown is a fixture in Ohio. "People just know I stand up for them," he said.
Two years ago, Tim Ryan, who was then a U.S. representative, ran for the Senate as a blue-collar Democrat from the Mahoning Valley, cut from the mold of Mr. Brown. Though he ran what has almost universally been hailed as a textbook campaign, he lost to J.D. Vance by six percentage points.
But Mr. Ryan said he lacked something Mr. Brown has: a fixed identity across the state. To win in Ohio as a Democrat, he said, "the one thing you need to do is have the name Sherrod Brown."
This fight will be about Mr. Moreno trying to define Mr. Brown's policy agenda -- and the Democrat removing Mr. Biden's name from it. Mr. Brown talks up his action to save more than 1,460 pensions of union drivers in Ohio through the Butch Lewis Act, a pension provision named in memory of an Ohio Teamster and inserted into the enormous Covid relief law, the American Rescue Plan.
He tells audiences of his role in the huge law signed by Mr. Biden that extended veterans health care to former service members who were exposed to toxic "burn pits" in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was also named after an Ohioan, Sgt. First Class Heath Robinson, who died of lung cancer at 39.
He speaks effusively of the CHIPS Act, which ensures that the two new semiconductor plants being built in Ohio with federal money will employ union-trained workers.
But even he said he understood the road ahead, especially when Mr. Moreno was calling his record "job-killing, Green New Deal radicalism."
"They know the accomplishments," Mr. Brown said. "They just don't really know who did it."
The incumbent will almost certainly be able to match Republicans dollar for dollar and then some. Between the allegiances he has built in the labor movement and the corporate interests with business before the Senate Banking Committee, which he chairs, Mr. Brown has built a formidable war chest: $ 33.5 million raised since 2019, and $ 13.5 million cash on hand at the end of last month.
Mr. Moreno, after a brutal three-way primary, emerged with $ 2.4 million in cash, according to late February federal campaign finance records.
And Mr. Brown said beneath Ohio's pro-Trump tilt was a state less conservative than Republicans believe. Last August, Ohioans crushed a ballot measure engineered by Republicans to make it harder for future ballot measures to pass, a transparent effort to defeat a pending vote on abortion rights. Three months later, they enshrined the right to abortion in the state's Constitution, by 13 percentage points. On the same day, they voted to legalize marijuana -- by 14 points.
"That ought to scare them," Mr. Brown said of his Republican opponents. "They need to figure out how to win those voters."
Just how much Mr. Brown can continue to outperform national Democrats is a subject of debate in Ohio. David Pepper, a former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the senator outperformed the rest of the Democratic ticket in 2018 by more than 10 percentage points, beating Republican James B. Renacci by 7 percentage points when Mr. DeWine was beating his Democratic opponent for governor, Richard Cordray, by 3.7 points.
"The question is, how much does Biden compete here?" said David Pepper, a former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. "If he competes hard, he keeps it in reach for Brown."
At the Dayton union hall of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 82, it was impossible to find anyone not firmly in Mr. Brown's camp.
"As many pensions as he's saved, absolutely" he's going to win, David Bruce, the president of the Dayton Building Trades Council, declared.
But beneath the bravado was an acknowledgment of the work ahead.
"That's our battle," the retired bricklayer, Mr. King, said, citing the stream of right-wing information consumed by many of his union brethren. "We're called as union leaders to do a better job with our message. The problem is, we're bricklayers. We don't understand messages."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Born and raised in Dublin, Liam Cunningham speaks in Joycean streams of consciousness that often have no discernible beginning, middle or end. He talks with his hands and taps his feet, salting his anecdotes with friendly F-bombs, catching his breath only long enough to take a puff of his distinctively scented e-cigarettes. They aren't very popular on the set.
"They smell like if you took the cardboard that comes with a dry cleaned shirt and held it over a burner," said D.B. Weiss, who, with his production partner David Benioff, has given Cunningham choice roles in "Game of Thrones" and now "3 Body Problem." A heady new science-fiction series, based on a trilogy of novels by the Chinese author Liu Cixin, "3 Body Problem" premieres Thursday on Netflix.
In it, Cunningham plays Thomas Wade, the no-nonsense spy master who leads a team of physicists chosen to save the world from a very slow-moving but ominous alien invasion. Unlike Davos Seaworth, the emotionally vulnerable knight Cunningham played in "Thrones," Wade is gruff, bellicose and secretive, an enigmatic authority figure whose back story left even Cunningham with questions.
"So little about him is known, and everybody you talk to that's seen this thing is like, 'What's his story?"' Cunningham said on an Austin hotel patio during the South by Southwest Film Festival, where the series had its world premiere. "He's got the U.N. Secretary General on the end of the phone, and people do what he tells them to, and you go, 'Who's giving him this authority?' And the funny thing is, I never felt the need to talk to the boys" -- Weiss and Benioff, that is -- "they never offered, and I never asked, which probably is not a good thing to say, I should probably say to everybody, 'Oh, I know everything about him, but I'm not telling you."'
Breath. Puff.
Cunningham, 62 with salt-and-pepper hair and bright blue eyes, came to acting relatively late in life. He worked as an electrician until he was 29, spending a chunk of his 20s in Zimbabwe bringing electricity to rural communities. "You know the song 'Wichita Lineman'?" he asks, referring to the '60s country hit by Glen Campbell. "That was me, except I was the Zimbabwe lineman. For an Irish, pale-skinned elf from Dublin, it was mind-blowing." For a time he worked in a national park, "the size of Belgium and with 16,000 elephants."
This was new and exciting, and when he returned to Dublin and resumed driving from job to job in a little yellow van, he found he missed the charge of his life in Africa. Always interested in film and television, he saw a newspaper ad for an acting school and figured he could pick up a new hobby. As he began landing theater roles, it started to feel more like a vocation. He fell in love with the process, and with how it fed his natural sense of curiosity.
"It was the problem solving, the 'How do we get that to work?"' he said. "I just found all of that so fascinating."
Then it was time to break the news to his family. "I love my poor wife," he said. "I told her, 'We may be starving for the rest of our lives: I'm about to say goodbye to a nicely paid, semi-government job where the only way you can get sacked is if you shoot someone.' And I walked away from it."
She gave her blessing. Next he told his father, a practical-minded dockworker. Cunningham said that after he broke the news, his dad, without looking up from his newspaper, uttered just three words: "For [expletive] sake."
Cunningham soon found steady work in film and television, landing roles in movies like Alfonso Cuarón's "A Little Princess" (1995), Michael Winterbottom's "Jude" (1996) and opposite Cillian Murphy in Ken Loach's "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" (2006). Benioff and Weiss fell hard for Cunningham when they saw him in "Hunger" (2008), Steve McQueen's movie about the hunger strike of the Irish Republican Army martyr Bobby Sands. They were particularly taken with a long scene, much of it shot in a continuous take, in which a priest played by Cunningham tries to talk Michael Fassbender's Sands into ending his strike.
"It was just one of the most gripping things that any of us had ever seen," Weiss said, sitting alongside Benioff and their fellow "3 Body Problem" creator, Alexander Woo, in an interview in Austin. Benioff and Weiss cast Cunningham in "Thrones" starting in Season 2, and Davos became a fan favorite.
When the showrunners came back to Cunningham for "3 Body Problem," they almost didn't get him. "We were like Dustin Hoffman at the end of 'The Graduate,"' as Benioff put it, begging Cunningham, who had already committed to a movie, to join their project.
"I got a phone call from Dave and Dan, who had obviously done their intel," Cunningham recalled. "They said, 'You're not going with those guys, you're coming with us.' And I went, 'Yep, OK, thank you.' I hung the phone up, and then the professional side of my brain kicked in, and I thought, 'That was a bit [expletive] stupid, this could be a week's work or a couple of days. I didn't even ask them about the project."'
The way Cunningham's colleagues describe it, hiring the actor doesn't just mean getting a fiercely focused performer when the cameras are rolling. They also get a tireless raconteur for the downtime hours.
"He loves telling a long story," Benioff said. "The other night, we were having a drink and he started telling this story about Thailand. Then, midway through, he stops and looks at us and he goes, 'Where was I going with this?' And we're like, 'We don't know, Liam. Where were you going with it?' He just lost the thread.
"He also does an act with a napkin that Dan and I had to sit through."
A napkin act? This sounded intriguing.
"I'm not doing it," Cunningham said. "It's one of those things where you have to have a few drinks in you. It's appalling, and it takes 15 minutes."
Jess Hong, who plays the physicist Jin Cheng in "3 Body Problem," shares several scenes with Cunningham, as Wade tries to badger Jin into bringing her skills to the fight to save Earth. She said the Cunningham vigor also comes in handy when it's time to get down to business.
"It's incredible to watch him work because as soon as the camera rolls, all of that crazy, almost childlike energy gets focused into the lens," she said in a video call from London, where she was promoting the series. "On the way to the set, he's chatting away in the car about what decisions he might make, and when we rehearse he's chatting away, trying to figure out the best way we can collaborate. Those are always the most creatively fulfilling times, when you have someone really wanting to push the work to its potential."
But Cunningham comes across as more intuitive than systematic, especially when it comes to choosing roles. "I try not to analyze that too much because you put up parameters, and if you analyze it, your parameters get a little bit smaller every time," he said. "You start to find a niche and that involves repetition, and I get bored really, really easily."
One gets the feeling he'd rather talk about something other than acting. For instance, barbecue. He had just been to one of Austin's most popular pit stops, and he was still buzzing over the experience.
"I went down to the room where they cook, and it looks like the engine room of a submarine," he said. "And the pit master, you can tell he loves his work. It was really cool just to watch him and the pride he took and how they were loading it all up; six hours for the pork ribs, eight hours for the beef ribs, 12 hours for the brisket. He went through the whole thing, it was really entertaining. Beautiful smells."
He's going to save the world, but first he'll try the ribs. And, of course, tell you how good they are.

Apple Aims To Rewrite Patent Rules: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After losing two complaints before the U.S. International Trade Commission, Apple has stepped up its lobbying to change the agency's practices.
Over the past decade, some of Apple's biggest regulatory headaches have come from a little-known federal agency called the U.S. International Trade Commission. The agency's patent judges have found Apple guilty of appropriating innovations in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches. And recently, they forced Apple to remove a health feature from Apple Watches.
Now the tech giant is pushing back. While it defends itself from patent complaints before the I.T.C., Apple has begun lobbying lawmakers to help rewrite the agency's rules.
The company has been campaigning across Washington for legislation that would make some patent owners ineligible to bring complaints before the I.T.C. It has sought to influence the language of committee reports that could affect how the agency levels punishments. And it has added to its lobbying might by enlisting one of the agency's former commissioners.
The lobbying effort comes as Apple is enmeshed in a multiyear legal battle with two U.S. medical device makers over technology in the Apple Watch. The companies, AliveCor and Masimo, filed complaints in the I.T.C. against Apple in 2021 for appropriating innovations they had developed to measure the heart's electrical activity and people's blood oxygen levels.
After losing both cases, Apple this year removed the technology to measure blood oxygen in its watches, which infringed on Masimo's patent. It is appealing the I.T.C.'s decision. A similar punishment is on hold as court proceedings continue related to the I.T.C.'s finding that Apple infringed on AliveCor's innovations with the Apple Watch's electrocardiogram feature.
Apple is trying to blunt the agency's signature power. Unlike traditional patent courts, where juries or judges typically issue fines, the I.T.C.'s judges can discipline a company that violates a patent by banning imports of the infringing product.
Because Apple makes all its signature devices overseas, a block on the import of its devices would be perilous to the company. To avoid that penalty in the future, the company says, it wants the agency to put the public interest of a product ahead of a ban. The company is betting that the court would then give more credence to Apple's argument that Americans would be harmed by an import ban because they would lose access to the communication and health features in iPhones and Apple Watches.
An Apple spokeswoman said the existing law requires that the I.T.C. consider how the public interest could be affected before ordering an import ban. But it said public data showed that the agency had made public-interest evaluations in only one-fifth of cases it had heard since 2010. As a result, its lobbyists have been talking with White House and congressional leaders about the I.T.C., as well as other issues such as privacy and domestic manufacturing.
Adam Mossoff, a patent law expert and a professor at George Mason University, said Apple was misinterpreting the law, which requires the I.T.C. to block a product if it finds that it infringes on a patent. An import ban is supposed to be overruled only if there's a proven threat to health or safety, he said. Blocking sales of an Apple device wouldn't qualify as harmful.
"The problem with their lobbying is that they're trying to neuter a well-functioning court by closing its doors to Americans who have had their rights infringed," he said.
When Congress set up what became the I.T.C. in 1916, it wanted to protect American innovation by allowing the U.S. government to ban the import of products with stolen technology. But as manufacturing moved overseas, the federal agency's court system became a forum for disputes between U.S. companies.
The I.T.C.'s judges, who are appointed by the commission, hold hearings with different standards for patent disputes than those that govern District Court cases. The cases are fast and compressed and can culminate with the judge's punishing a patent abuser by blocking its products.
Before a ban is put into effect, a company that's found guilty can appeal to the White House for a reprieve. But it's rare for an administration, which oversees the agency, to go against a judge's recommendation.
Apple has become the pre-eminent example of how the I.T.C. can be used. Because the company manufactures almost all its products overseas, the judges who have found it guilty of infringing on patents in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches say it should be punished by blocking the import of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.
Apple has largely escaped the import bans. In 2013, the Obama administration vetoed the I.T.C.'s plan to block iPhone imports after the agency determined that Apple had infringed on one of Samsung's smartphone patents. In 2019, Apple agreed to pay Qualcomm a royalty for some wireless technology patents, heading off an I.T.C. ruling that could have blocked iPhone sales. And after losing the Masimo case, Apple agreed to remove the infringing health feature to dodge an Apple Watch ban.
For years, Apple avoided the kind of lobbying that was customary for a large corporation. It kept a small office in Washington staffed by just a few people and employed only one lobbying firm, two people familiar with the company's practices said. But as regulatory challenges to its business have risen, its policy team has swelled to include dozens of people and 11 lobbying firms.
In the face of the patent complaints from AliveCor and Masimo, Apple's team in Washington gave priority to lobbying to change the I.T.C. In 2022, it began working with the ITC Modernization Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of companies that includes Samsung, Intel, Dell, Google, Verizon and Comcast. The group worked with members of Congress as it wrote the Advancing America's Interest Act in 2019 and supported its reintroduction in 2023.
The bill's backers -- Representatives David Schweikert, a Republican from Arizona, and Donald S. Beyer Jr., a Democrat from Virginia -- have promoted it as a way to curb abuse of the I.T.C. by patent trolls. It would prohibit patent holders from suing unless they manufactured a product that used the patented technology or had licensed the technology to someone else already.
AliveCor and Masimo are medical companies that have focused on selling products to health care providers and consumers more than licensing innovations to consumer technology companies like Apple.
Last year, Apple's lobbyists filed three reports disclosing that it had campaigned on behalf of the bill, according to Open Secrets, a campaign finance research nonprofit. It also added to its lobbying ranks by hiring Deanna Tanner Okun, a former I.T.C. chair who works for the law firm Polsinelli. (The hiring was previously reported by Politico.)
The lobbying campaign coincided with an effort to argue in Washington that an I.T.C. ban on Apple Watch imports would deprive people of a device that was crucial to their health, two people familiar with the lobbying said.
In addition to lobbying directly on legislation, Apple worked with a member of Congress to put language on Page 97 of a committee report for the 2024 Appropriations Bill, said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado. The language would require the I.T.C. to review how it determined the value to the public of a product before suggesting a ban and to report to Congress on that process.
"To me, this went around the legitimate process," said Mr. Buck, who is leaving Congress this month. He told Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky who is on the Rules Committee, that he had 10 votes and would block the bill unless the language was removed. Mr. Massie's office confirmed that the language had been removed at Mr. Buck's request but declined to comment further.
An Apple spokeswoman disagreed with Mr. Buck's claims that its lobbying circumvented the legitimate legislative process. She said its public federal lobbying reports detailed how it worked on issues important for its products and customers.
The spokeswoman also pointed to the Senate's passage of a committee report with a sentence expressing its support of the I.T.C.'s doing thorough analysis of the public health implications of a product ban before issuing one, which is what Apple wants in the future.

Aid for the Chip Industry Might Have Hit a Ceiling: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president hopes the money will kick-start semiconductor production in America, but that might take a lot more investment in the future.
President Biden's announcement on Wednesday of an $ 8.5 billion federal grant to Intel to build some of the world's most advanced computer chips is one of the most remarkable American experiments in industrial policy since Dwight D. Eisenhower used federal funds to build the nation's highway system.
But rather than a new beginning in America's effort to restore a technological ability it invented -- and then all but lost -- there is significant risk it could be the high point of the effort.
When the CHIPS and Science Act passed two years ago, it was promoted as a down payment on the kind of long-term investment in critical sectors of the economy that made Taiwan the world's dominant player in chip manufacturing. It is a strategy China began emulating nearly a decade ago, pouring new money, year after year, into chips and high-capacity batteries, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, to name just a few.
But while Mr. Biden celebrated the construction of Intel's plant as a turning point in American industrial and national security strategy, there is no prospect of a follow-on program anytime soon. And quietly, Congress has sliced away at the billions of dollars that were authorized -- but never fully allocated -- for research, training and production.
So as Mr. Biden ticks off the immediate benefits of the Intel investment -- 10,000 manufacturing jobs in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio, and 20,000 construction jobs to get things rolling -- many in his administration worry privately that their strategy may not survive this moment of political polarization.
That is the reason Mr. Biden and his commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, do not talk much about the scale of additional government investment that may be needed if the country is serious about spurring investment in everything from the most expensive semiconductor plants to the technologies carmakers will need to meet emissions mandates.
"President Biden often talked about this act as an 'inflection point,' a new role for the federal investments in the hardest problems in high technology," said Doug Calidas, a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard and a senior vice president for Americans for Responsible Innovation, an advocacy group for emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence.
"And he was right, it was," said Mr. Calidas, who recently published a study of the changing politics of the CHIPS Act. "But if it is a one-and-done effort, there is reason to question how effective it will be."
There was a hint of that concern in comments to reporters on Tuesday night by Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive.
"It doesn't get fixed in one three- to five-year program," Mr. Gelsinger said. "I do think we'll need at least a CHIPS 2 to finish that job."
That was an optimistic appraisal. Many involved in the industry say they believe the federal investments will have to be repeated as technological challenges shift, along with assessments about which technologies are simply too critical for the United States to depend on foreign supply chains for. Past efforts to bolster the chip industry with one- or two-shot investments, back when Japan was the primary competitor, turned into spectacular failures.
The passage of the CHIPS Act in 2022 was the result of the confluence of some extraordinary events. The most vivid was the discovery during the coronavirus pandemic of how fragile the supply of critical goods could be -- from surgical masks to the precursors for vaccines to the run-of-the-mill chips needed to produce cars and washing machines. Added to the mix was the growing fear of China's power, both to disrupt the American economy and to threaten Taiwan, where more than 90 percent of the world's most complex and advanced semiconductors are made.
Ms. Raimondo and Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, briefed senators in the weeks before the bill's passage about the remarkable vulnerabilities of America's defense industrial base and how a cutoff of certain technologies could ground missiles and bring fighter-plane production to a halt. The specter of a rising, manipulative China that could hold Taiwan's semiconductor production centers hostage brought over enough Republicans to win a truly bipartisan majority. In the Senate, the bill passed 64 to 33.
Even then, there were doubters. Morris Chang, the M.I.T.-educated engineer who left Texas Instruments and founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, argued that money alone would not be enough to reproduce the magic he had created. He called the billions in subsidies "a very expensive exercise in futility."
At the core of Mr. Chang's critique was an argument that even if Intel copied Taiwan Semiconductor's core strategy, becoming a "foundry" that produces chips designed by the likes of Apple and Nvidia, American engineers would not put in the grueling hours and perfectionism needed to be successful.
But there was a different critique, coming from the advocates of industrial policy: that Mr. Biden's drive to bring manufacturing home had come too late, and that the bill was far too small to propel the private investment needed to bring about a real manufacturing renaissance.
The politics of an election year add yet another layer of difficulty.
Former President Donald J. Trump has launched regular attacks on another form of industrial policy: Mr. Biden's incentives to purchase electric vehicles, a key part of his climate agenda.
Those cars have become part of Mr. Trump's campaign rally diatribes. He argues, with no evidence, that electric cars will "kill" the American auto industry and said that the Biden administration had "ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing" by enticing buyers to electric vehicles through tax breaks and other subsidies.
But even Mr. Biden seems somewhat hesitant to fully back his own policy. The original CHIPS Act authorized the United States to spend $ 35 billion on science and innovation research through government agencies in 2025; Mr. Biden's budget request, issued last week, is closer to $ 20 billion.
"The rhetoric is a lot more impressive than the budget numbers," Mr. Calidas said.

Intel Receives $8.5 Billion in Grants to Build Chip Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The award, announced by President Biden at a plant in Arizona, is the biggest the government has made under a new program that aims to rebuild the nation's semiconductor manufacturing industry.
President Biden on Wednesday awarded $ 8.5 billion in grants to Intel, a major investment to bolster the nation's semiconductor production, during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
Speaking from the Intel campus in Chandler, Ariz., Mr. Biden said the award would support thousands of new manufacturing jobs, including ones that do not require a college degree.
"It's going to transform the semiconductor industry," Mr. Biden said. "Where the hell is it written saying that we're not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world again?"
The award, which will go to the construction and expansion of Intel facilities around the United States, is the biggest the federal government has made with funding from the CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022 to help re-establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.
The Biden administration, equipped with $ 39 billion in subsidies to distribute, is spearheading an ambitious effort to ramp up production of the tiny chips that power everything from smartphones to computers and cars. The effort is at the center of Mr. Biden's goal to reduce America's reliance on foreign countries: Although semiconductors were invented in the United States, only about 10 percent of the world's chips are made domestically.
"Nearly all manufacturing of leading-edge chips across the entire industry moved overseas to Asia years ago," Mr. Biden said. "That's why today's investment is such a big deal: We will enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America."
In addition to the grants, the federal government is planning to award Intel up to $ 11 billion in loans on what the company characterized as generous terms. Intel is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the expense of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $ 100 billion over five years.
The grants are intended to help fund the company's construction plans in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The projects are expected to create more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and roughly 20,000 construction jobs, according to Biden administration officials.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose department is overseeing the distribution of the grants, said the award would help ramp up the country's production of the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones, supercomputers and the most sensitive military hardware. The United States currently produces none.
Ms. Raimondo said the Intel award would be the single largest grant to a chipmaker under the new program. The investment will help put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's leading-edge chips by the end of the decade, she said.
"This investment will enable Intel to produce leading edge, the most sophisticated chips in the world that will power our economic and national security," Ms. Raimondo said at the Intel campus on Wednesday.
In Arizona, the money will help fund Intel's recent construction of two advanced plants and the modernization of another facility. The money will also help establish an entirely new site near Columbus, Ohio, starting with two factories, in its first move to a new U.S. region in more than 40 years.
In Rio Rancho, N.M., Intel will use the federal funds to transform two plants into advanced packaging facilities, where chips are assembled together to enhance performance and reduce costs. The company will also expand and modernize an innovation hub in Hillsboro, Ore., which is expected to further the company's technological leadership and development of new innovations.
Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies view the semiconductor investments as a key way to try to turn around perceptions of the economy among voters in battleground states like Arizona.
"We have not been talking to folks about the issues that President Biden has been delivering on, and that's what we are determined to do," Yolanda Bejarano, the Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman, said on Tuesday, adding that Democrats would need to talk more about the effects of the semiconductor investments.
Although Intel will have to meet certain milestones before the money is distributed, senior Biden administration officials said they expected the funds to start flowing to the company by the end of this year.
Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday evening that the government incentives represented a proud moment for his company and a major achievement for politicians of both parties. Though satisfied with the incentives earmarked for Intel, he said officials might need to invest more in the industry to reverse decades of shifting investment from the United States to countries in Asia.
"It doesn't get fixed in one three- to five-year program," Mr. Gelsinger said. "I do think we'll need at least a CHIPS 2 to finish that job."
Intel is the fourth company to receive a federal award under the new program, and brings the total announced grants to more than $ 10 billion. The first three grants -- to GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems -- were to makers of legacy chips, which are created with older production processes but are still used in many products like cars and dishwashers.
Biden administration officials are expected to announce more awards in the coming months to other major chipmakers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Micron Technology. Those companies have also made major investments in new or expanded semiconductor manufacturing plants in the United States in recent years.
The United States' dependence on Asia for its chips has become even more pronounced with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nearly all chips used to power the latest generative A.I. services were manufactured in Taiwan by T.S.M.C., though designed by the Silicon Valley company Nvidia.
Intel has been trying to change that by developing new manufacturing technology, beginning to build chips designed by other companies and lobbying heavily for the legislation. The investment in Intel is intended to help enable U.S. companies to lead in the A.I. industry by ensuring there is a domestic supply of advanced chips.
About $ 50 million of federal funding will be set aside for Intel to spend on training and developing "a new generation of workers for the semiconductor industry," Mr. Biden said. Many semiconductor companies and industry groups have voiced concerns about potential shortages of technicians, engineers and other workers to fill all of the positions that will be created once the facilities are constructed.
In total, private companies have announced more than $ 240 billion in semiconductor and electronic manufacturing investments since Mr. Biden took office, according to administration officials. Some chipmakers, however, have run into obstacles while trying to expand their domestic manufacturing capacity, resulting in delays.

Let's Ask A.I. How Long Nvidia Can Keep Rising: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A.I. fervor has rocketed the chip company's share price upward. Our columnist asked A.I. chatbots how big Nvidia would become if it kept growing as fast as it had over the past year.
It's not a household name quite yet, but anyone who follows the stock market knows at least a little about Nvidia.
The company is the wonder of the year, a stock by which all others are measured. Nvidia designs the chips that make artificial intelligence work, and because A.I. is being hailed as the most important technological development since the internet, Nvidia shares have been rocketing since last year.
I'm not qualified to assess how important -- or how dangerous -- A.I. will one day become, but I do pay close attention to the stock market, which values Nvidia at more than $ 2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest public company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.
Enthusiasm for A.I. is raising the share prices not only of Nvidia, but also of many other tech companies that are believed to be imbued with the technology's potential, including Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet as well as other chipmakers like AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel.
But the blistering rate of Nvidia's gains -- an increase of about 290 percent over the past 12 months -- has me and many Wall Street analysts wondering how sustainable this run is. The answer has implications for the entire market.
There are many ways to examine this, including traditional stock analysis, which considers sales, earnings, cash flow, business growth and momentum. I took an offbeat approach: asking several A.I. chatbots about Nvidia's prospects as a stock. Specifically, I asked how big Nvidia's market value would be in a decade if the company's share price kept its current pace.
What they told me amounted to this: Nvidia stock's sharp rise can't continue like this for very long. And because much of the stock market is bound up in the same feverish A.I.-driven stock frenzy, the message is broadly true. If the market doesn't slow down soon, it may inflate itself into a bubble -- and all bubbles eventually burst.
On a personal level, I love new tech but I try not to become too excited about it until I'm confident it works safely and reliably. From what I can tell, A.I. produces spectacular images and is fun to play with, but it's neither reliable nor safe (yet).
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
What's in a quadrillion?
To their credit, all three of the A.I. chatbots I asked -- Microsoft Copilot, powered by OpenAI's Chat GPT-4; Google Gemini; and Anthropic's Claude 3 -- were reluctant to answer my questions directly.
Each one said it couldn't assess stock valuations reliably or predict with the slightest degree of accuracy how a stock or the overall market would perform in the future. I wish human stock analysts said as much.
Just because Nvidia's stock price is growing fast now doesn't mean it will keep growing fast, and certainly not over periods as long as a decade, they all warned me.
But I pressed them to perform some basic calculations anyway, which I backstopped with 20th-century technology -- a spreadsheet and a calculator.
The chatbots didn't arrive at the same numbers every time and never agreed on the details. That's another sign, in my humble estimation, that they're not ready for prime time. I wouldn't use them for math homework.
But in this case, the details didn't really matter. Ultimately, and with considerable prompting, they all came up with the same basic conclusion: The simple laws of compound arithmetic tell us that if the company's share price keeps rising at its current rate, Nvidia will end up with a market cap in the quadrillions of dollars.
Quadrillions are an order of magnitude I'm not comfortable with, so I resorted to a dictionary: One quadrillion dollars is 1 with 15 zeros after it, or a thousand trillion dollars in American parlance. (In British English, a quadrillion is even bigger: 1 with 24 zeros. I'm using the American definition.)
How big is that? The world economy -- the combined size of all of the annual gross domestic products of every country on the planet -- amounted to $ 100.88 trillion in 2022, according to the World Bank. So if Nvidia kept growing at its current annual rate, it would dwarf the output of the entire known economic universe within 10 years.
Claude 3, the Anthropic A.I. chatbot, calculated that Nvidia, at it's current growth rate, would become a $ 2.76962 quadrillion company in 10 years, and then warned me: "This is an extraordinarily large number that seems implausible in reality, as it would make Nvidia larger than the entire global economy many times over."
In plain English, Nvidia's astonishing growth rate over the past year is far too high to continue for long. I'd be wary about buying shares of Nvidia, or any other stock, in the belief that its momentum is perpetual. What goes up can come down, and, somewhere down the line, it certainly will.
This warning reinforces what traditional valuation measures show. Nvidia's share price, and the prices of many stocks, are high. They can be justified on the assumption that their sales and earnings will grow at a rip-roaring pace. But if share prices rise faster than earnings, the market party will eventually crash.
Remember Apple?
Nvidia is an impressive company. Its products have a great reputation and are in high demand, and it generates enormous, rapidly growing profits.
Its latest earnings report in February, which unleashed tremendous stock market optimism, contained eye-popping numbers. And in a conversation with Wall Street analysts then, Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, gave Wall Street something exciting to mull over. The company's technology is providing the foundations for a new industrial revolution, he said.
"We are now at the beginning of a new industry where A.I.-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence," he said. "Like A.C. power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, Nvidia A.I. supercomputers are essentially A.I. generation factories of this industrial revolution."
The sky is the limit for the next couple of years, he suggested.
But Nvidia will inevitably begin to grow more slowly. It's absurd to think it can become bigger than everything else in the universe.
But it could still grow swiftly. Some companies have managed to sustain long-term rapid growth before.
Apple, at various stages since its founding in 1976, has perplexed skeptics who have periodically said it had become too large to keep expanding quickly. In 2012, for example, Apple's market capitalization was $ 500 billion and its stock price had risen 68 percent in just eight months.
Back then, The New York Times cited an analyst who used a spreadsheet, not a chatbot, to assess Apple's prospects. The analyst concluded that if the company grew at just 20 percent a year over the following decade -- much slower than its growth rate had been in 2012 -- Apple would be worth an impossible number by 2022: more than $ 3 trillion. That number doesn't look outlandish now.
Apple's market cap isn't quite there yet, but it's close, at about $ 2.7 trillion. Its old rival, Microsoft, which was much smaller than Apple in 2012, now has a market cap that surpasses $ 3 trillion. These two giants have risen and fallen many times and show every prospect of being able to do so again.
I don't know whether Nvidia belongs in that exalted category, but it's clear that even though Nvidia won't be bigger than the entire universe, it could end up being substantially more valuable in the next 10 or 20 years. Then again, it might not.
It could be more like Cisco Systems, the most valuable company in the stock market in March 2000. That was the peak of another technology boom -- the dot-com bubble. Cisco is still a solid company. Its products make up the backbone of the internet. But its market capitalization in 2000 was $ 567 billion. Now, it's around $ 200 billion.
It will be fascinating to watch Nvidia's destiny unfurl. But because I can't predict how it or any company will fare in the long run, I don't buy individual stocks -- not Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco or anything else.
Instead, I settle for broad low-cost index funds that track the entire market. They are a passive and less risky bet on the future that requires no stock picking.
If Nvidia grows rapidly for years to come, I won't miss out entirely because the overall stock market will probably grow, too. If Nvidia falters, other stocks are likely, at some point, to pick up the slack. That's what has happened over the past 100 years, anyway. The A.I. boom is a thrilling ride. If it starts to slow, those who have hedged their bets will be pleased that they did.

Malaysia Rises as Crucial Link in Tech Supply Chain: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Construction cranes still surround the brand-spanking new plant in Kulim's industrial park in Malaysia. But inside, legions of workers hired by the Austrian tech giant AT&S are already gearing up to produce at full capacity by year's end.
Outfitted in head-to-toe coveralls, with oversized safety glasses and hard hats, they're reminiscent of the worker bees in the movie "Minions," but color coded by function: Blue for maintenance. Green for vendors. Pink for janitors. White for operators.
AT&S is just one of a flood of European and American companies that have recently decided to move to or expand operations in Malaysia's electrical and electronics manufacturing mecca.
The American chip giant Intel and the German corporation Infineon are each investing $ 7 billion. Nvidia, the world's leading maker of chips powering artificial intelligence, is teaming up with the country's utilities conglomerate to develop a $ 4.3 billion artificial intelligence cloud and supercomputer center. Texas Instruments, Ericsson, Bosch and Lam Research are all expanding in Malaysia.
The boom is evidence of how much geopolitical friction and competition are reshaping the globe's economic landscape and driving multibillion-dollar investment decisions. As rivalries between the United States and China over cutting-edge technology simmer and trade restrictions pile up, companies -- particularly those in crucial sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles -- are looking to strengthen their supply chains and production capabilities.
AT&S had production sites in Austria, India, South Korea and China -- its largest plant -- when it started hunting for a new location.
"It was clear after 20 years of investment in China, we needed to diversify our footprint," said Andreas Gerstenmayer, chief executive of AT&S. The company manufactures high-end printed circuit boards and substrates, which serve as the foundation for advanced electronic components that power artificial intelligence and supercomputers.
The company's site search started in early 2020, just as warnings began to spread about a dangerous new coronavirus in China. AT&S scouted 30 different countries on three continents before settling on Malaysia.
Southeast Asia's strategic position in the South China Sea and longstanding economic ties to China and the United States make the region an attractive place to set up shop. Nations like Thailand and Vietnam, AT&S's second choice, are also aggressively courting semiconductor firms to expand, offering tax incentives and other lures.
But Malaysia has the advantage of a head start.
The country has been riding the tech wave since the 1970s when it energetically courted some of the world's electrical and electronic superstars, like Intel and Litronix (now ams Osram, with headquarters in Austria and Germany). It created a free-trade zone on the island of Penang, offered tax holidays, and built industrial parks, warehouses and roads. Cheap labor was an additional draw, as was its large English-speaking population and a government supportive of foreign investment.
Malaysia's history in the back end of making semiconductors was one of the primary draws, Mr. Gerstenmayer said.
"They are quite aware of what the needs of the semiconductor industry are," he said. "And they have a well-developed ecosystem in the universities, in education, labor force, supply chain" and more. Support from the government was another attraction, he said.
Tengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia's minister of investment, trade and industry, said foreign investment began to pick up in 2019, driven by the widening use of semiconductors in everything from automobiles to medical devices. "There's 5,000 chips in one car," he said.
After the Covid-19 pandemic revealed devastating weaknesses in global supply chains, interest in Malaysia as an additional source soared.
That trend accelerated as great power conflicts bubbled over.
Both China and the United States moved to forge their own reliable semiconductor supply chains, in addition to supporting other critical sectors like renewable energy and electric vehicles.
"U.S. and European companies and even Chinese companies wanted to diversify out of China," Mr. Zafrul Aziz said. China, too, is locating production facilities outside of the mainland, in part, some say, to sidestep U.S. sanctions. It's a "China plus one" strategy.
Worries about Taiwan, the world's largest producer of semiconductors, has further fueled investment in Malaysia, he said. The island is a source of growing friction between China, which maintains Taiwan is part of its territory, and the United States, which supports it politically.
Malaysia is already the world's sixth largest exporter of semiconductors, and packages 23 percent of all American chips.
"For a country of this size to be having that big an impact on the global semiconductor market is quite fantastic," said David Lacey, director of advanced development and services at Osram, one of the world's largest lighting companies.
Seated at a large conference table at the Sciences University of Malaysia on Penang, he rapidly pointed to the technology around the room. "There's a TV, there are lights, there's a projector, there are phones," he said. "You can pretty much guarantee there is a Malaysia component somewhere."
The proximity of so many tech companies also exerts a gravitational pull. In Penang and Kulim, which are connected by two long, snaking bridges, there are more than 300 companies.
"Everything is here," said Eric Chan, a vice president and general manager at Intel in Malaysia. After a half century, that network and infrastructure are not easily duplicated.
Mr. Chan also mentioned the government's crucial cooperation during the pandemic in keeping factories open.
Foreign direct investment was nearly $ 40 billion last year, more than twice the total generated in 2019.
Mario Lorenz, managing director in Malaysia for the German logistics company DHL Supply Chain, said "most of our big investments have happened in the last two years."
During that time, the semiconductor sector has grown to dominate the company's business in Malaysia. "We followed the trend," he said.
Inside DHL Supply Chain's newest global distribution center, Penang Logistics Hub No. 4, are bespoke orange and blue shelves specifically designed to handle the heavy, oversized crates used by a semiconductor company.
Four new supply chain facilities are in the works in Malaysia.
Malaysia's track record has been mostly in the back end of the semiconductor supply chain -- which includes packing, assembling and testing components -- activities that traditionally have been considered less complex and of lower value.
But now the industry's focus on packaging smaller chips -- chiplets -- more tightly together to increase computing power is increasing the value and technical complexity of those activities.
Intel is building its first overseas facility for advanced 3-D chip packaging in Malaysia. When you bring in cutting-edge technology there is a "ripple effect," said AK Chong, a vice president and managing director of Intel in Malaysia. That development will attract dozens of new businesses and help advance the labor force's entire skill set.
Such advancements will require a huge expansion of utilities like green energy, sanitation, water and a 5G digital infrastructure.
That's a challenge for any country, particularly one whose history has been marred by a multibillion dollar corruption scandal involving its sovereign wealth fund. Even so, several company executives said they were confident in Malaysia's role in the supply chain.
"They have projects to provide green energy by building up big solar farms," Mr. Gerstenmayer of AT&S said. "Malaysia is on a good path to becoming a hot spot in the electronics industry globally."

PENANG, Malaysia — Construction cranes still surround the brand-spanking-new plant in Kulim’s industrial park in Malaysia. But inside, legions of workers hired by Austrian tech giant AT&S are already gearing up to produce at full capacity by year’s end.
Outfitted in head-to-toe coveralls, with oversized safety glasses and hard hats, they’re reminiscent of the worker bees in the movie “Minions,” but color coded by function: Blue for maintenance. Green for vendors. Pink for janitors. White for operators.
AT&S is just one of a flood of European and American companies that have recently decided to move to or expand operations in Malaysia’s electrical and electronics manufacturing mecca.
U.S. chip giant Intel and German corporation Infineon are each investing $7 billion. Nvidia, the world’s leading maker of chips powering artificial intelligence, is teaming up with the country’s utilities conglomerate to develop a $4.3 billion artificial intelligence cloud and supercomputer center. Texas Instruments, Ericsson, Bosch and Lam Research are all expanding in Malaysia.
The boom is evidence of how much geopolitical friction and competition are reshaping the globe’s economic landscape and driving multibillion-dollar investment decisions. As rivalries between the United States and China over cutting-edge technology simmer and trade restrictions pile up, companies — particularly those in crucial sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles — are looking to strengthen their supply chains and production capabilities.
AT&S had production sites in Austria, India, South Korea and China — its largest plant — when it started hunting for a new location.

A British Tabloid Becomes a Real Scandal Sheet: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new play by J.T. Rogers goes behind the scenes of the shady "news-gathering" that rocked Rupert Murdoch's British media empire over a decade ago.
"Corruption," J.T. Rogers's tantalizing new phone-hacking play, starts on Rebekah Brooks's wedding weekend. In a village in the English countryside, the flame-haired power broker, one of Rupert Murdoch's favorite tabloid editors, has drawn the cream of Britain's political class to her celebration.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is there, and so is David Cameron, the Tory who will succeed him. But Brooks (Saffron Burrows) is sequestered in conversation with her charmless boss, Rupert's son James (Seth Numrich). He informs her that television and new media are the company's focus now.
"Newspapers are a relic," James says. So his contempt is already evident when he tells her that she is the new chief executive of News International, the Murdoch-owned British newspaper group. Congratulations?
It will be on Brooks's watch, anyway, that a many-tentacled scandal erupts, with the revelation that her journalists clandestinely acquired the voice mail messages not only of celebrities and politicians but also of a missing child who was later found dead. Multiple arrests ensue, with accusations of phone hacking, police corruption and perverting the course of justice. Rupert Murdoch shuts down News of the World, his top-selling Sunday tabloid. Through it all, he remains loyal to Brooks.
As a news story evolving in real time, the scandal made for jaw-dropping reading. As a play, though, "Corruption" is uncompelling -- counterintuitively so, given the inherent drama: the crimes, the coverup, the comeuppance (or not), the clashes of personality. Also the stakes, which include the well-being of a democracy in which one culture-shaping media magnate holds too much sway.
Tom Watson (Toby Stephens), a Labour member of Parliament as the scandal brews, is the central figure. (Murdoch, frequently mentioned, is a looming unseen presence.) Rumpled and besieged, Watson is determined to expose the widespread, under-the-radar operation: the surveillance, the intimidation, the gathering of secrets. The police, in the meantime, are oddly incurious about the voluminous records of a private investigator who they know hacked phones for News of the World.
Watson teams up with the lawyer Charlotte Harris (Sepideh Moafi, bringing a harried warmth); the journalists Nick Davies (T. Ryder Smith) and Martin Hickman (Sanjit De Silva); Max Mosley (Michael Siberry, wonderfully snobbish), a wealthy onetime target of the newspaper willing to spend big to exact revenge; and Chris Bryant (K. Todd Freeman, a welcome jolt of energy), a Labour member of Parliament who joins the cause despite his loathing of Watson. In taking on the tabloid, they risk their own safety and that of their families.
Directed by Bartlett Sher for Lincoln Center Theater, "Corruption" opened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on Monday, as Murdoch turned 93. But the ominous thrum at the heart of the intrigue has been muffled here by the barrage of information coming at us: from the stage, from the ring of screens suspended above it, from the vast upstage wall. Does so much of the play need to be told in video and projected text? (The set is by Michael Yeargan, projections by 59 Productions.)
One gets the sense of a show undermining itself with its own busyness. Even at the end, as the actors are taking their bows, they are upstaged by projections -- photos of the real people the characters are based on, captioned with their names. In what should be the performers' moment, these fleeting images demand the audience's immediate attention.
The play is inspired by Watson and Hickman's "Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain," a 2012 book so comprehensive that it includes a list of "dramatis personae" as a reference for the reader. It's a chronicle too convoluted to lend itself easily to drama.
That's an obstacle that Rogers ("Oslo") hasn't found his way around. He has, however, streamlined extensively; for example, a team of New York Times reporters is represented by just one, a tough-as-nails Jo Becker (Eleanor Handley). Rogers has also invented scenes, like Brooks and her husband, Charlie (an affably funny John Behlmann), meeting with the wary surrogate (Robyn Kerr) who is carrying their child.
Yet "Corruption," whose throat-clearing first half is laden with exposition, struggles to tap into the visceral and help us feel what's human in the story. More elementally, it doesn't shepherd us through the labyrinth of events, characters and entities in a way that entices us to follow.
Hanging in the balance is a lucrative television deal that Murdoch's News Corp. is eager for the British government to approve. But I'm not at all sure that audience members -- even those primed by "Succession" to become emotionally invested in the arcana of corporate acquisitions -- will grasp its significance amid the play's muchness.
There are sparks of life throughout "Corruption," and Dylan Baker doubles nicely in two bad-guy roles. Stiltedness stalks the play from the start, though, and it all feels terribly remote -- tangled in a thicket of intel, unable to hack its way through.

Duke's D.E.I. Town Hall Asks 'Cameron Crazies' to Heckle Responsibly: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As part of a D.E.I. initiative, the student government held a town hall with fans who are known for their biting intel about opposing players.
The fervent basketball fans at Duke University, hundreds of whom are camping in a tent village to get prime seats for Saturday's rivalry game against the University of North Carolina, have been a target of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts this year.
The student section of Blue Devils fans, called "Cameron Crazies" for the energy and antics they bring to that cramped arena at Duke, heckles opponents with the help of "cheer sheets" that include biographical details and biting comments about opposing players. Past cheer sheets from games against U.N.C. called one of its athletes "the ugliest player in the N.C.A.A." and said of another, "no way he's allowed to live within 200 yards of a school."
The suggested chants were sometimes targeted -- "Caveman" for one player with long hair and a beard -- but largely innocuous, including "Go, Devils, Go," and "Baby!" Duke fans regularly scream and wave their hands at opposing players when they inbound the ball.
At a D.E.I. town hall hosted by Duke's student government this year, sports fans were encouraged to be responsible in any heckling of opposing players and to refrain from slurs, according to Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle.
The town hall, which included comments from basketball players and members of the athletic staff, was intended for students who participate in the tent village tradition called Krzyzewskiville, or K-Ville, after the former men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski. About 100 people attended the event, according to the university.
David Ntim, a sophomore biomedical engineering major who is camping in Krzyzewskiville, did not go to the town hall but said he understood its intention.
"I definitely see how it could warrant just these conversations on, 'How do we promote where people are at and understand the balance of heckling,"' Ntim said.
In a joint response to emailed questions, Duke and the student line monitors who oversee the tent village said the town hall was part of the student group's "proactive emphasis on D.E.I. in K-Ville to foster a greater sense of community in the traditions that surround Duke basketball." Kyle Serba, a spokesman for the Duke men's basketball program, said the event was not in response to a particular situation involving Duke students.
The university has been on both sides of accusations about unruly crowd behavior.
In 2013, a North Carolina State basketball player said fans in Duke's student section had mocked his dead grandmother. In 2022, a Duke volleyball player said fans attending a match at Brigham Young University had called her a racial slur. In both instances, the host school investigated and said it found no evidence to support the claims.
D.E.I. efforts on college campuses have been polarizing, with the University of Florida eliminating all related positions last week.
Danielle Boaz, an associate professor of Africana studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said Duke's town hall might be a sensitive topic because it could displease certain donors, or the event's purpose could be misconstrued.
"Unfortunately, even saying, 'Hey, we shouldn't be racist' can be seen as too liberal or too 'woke,"' Boaz said.
Duke and the line monitors said that discussion points at the town hall included using inclusive and respectful language, as well as an overview of conduct rules at Krzyzewskiville and at games. They said cheer sheets "are a classic part of our game day traditions" and "have always aligned with our goal of 'heckling responsibly."'
In recent years, the student government has tried to make Krzyzewskiville more accessible by providing financial aid in the form of camping supplies. The annual cost to attend Duke is about $ 83,000, according to the university's website.
Krzyzewskiville, located near Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, N.C., started in 1986 as Krzyzewski turned Duke into a basketball juggernaut. He won five national championships in 42 seasons at Duke, retiring in 2022.
Some Duke students sleep in tents for weeks before the annual home game against the North Carolina Tar Heels, who play about 10 miles away in Chapel Hill. It is one of the fiercest rivalries in sports and a cultural moment steeped into the fabric of the state.
"You have to have a delicate balance because you don't want D.E.I. to be killjoys, but at the same time you want it to be a family experience that the whole community can enjoy," said Dan Aldridge, a professor of Africana studies at Davidson College, near Charlotte.
He continued: "I think for Duke, there is a context because their fans are so notoriously obnoxious."
Insensitive conduct from professional fan bases has also been a concern. Native American groups have long protested the tomahawk chop gesture used at Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Braves games. A soccer match in Las Vegas ended early last year as supporters of the Mexican national team erupted in anti-gay chants, and the year before, someone in the Paris crowd threw a banana at a Brazilian soccer player.
"Sports always become this place of tensions and this place that we try to say, 'Well, this should be outside of politics,' but it never really is," Boaz said.

Humanoid Robot Maker
Teams Up With OpenAI
OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is looking to fuse its artificial intelligence systems into humanoid robots as part of a new deal with a robotics start-up, Figure.
Figure, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., announced the partnership on Thursday along with $ 675 million in venture capital funding from a group that includes the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as well as Microsoft, the chipmaker Nvidia and the start-up-funding divisions of Intel and OpenAI.
Figure is less than two years old and doesn't have a commercial product but is persuading influential tech industry backers to support its vision of shipping billions of humanlike robots to the world's workplaces and homes.
OpenAI will build specialized A.I. models for Figure's humanoid robots, likely based on OpenAI's existing technology such as GPT language models, the image-generator DALL-E and the new video-generator Sora.

EARNINGS
Anheuser-Busch InBev
Recovers From Backlash
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Stella Artois and Corona, reported better-than-expected net income in the fourth quarter despite lower beer volumes.
The beverage company said Thursday that its fourth-quarter operating earnings rose 7 percent to $ 19.98 billion, or 82 cents per share, more than the 76-cent profit analysts expected, according to FactSet.
Revenue in the United States declined 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 9.5 percent for the year. Bud Light, the company's best-selling U.S. brand, faced a conservative backlash last year after it sent a commemorative can to the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. Transgender rights supporters also deserted the brand, saying it didn't do enough to support Ms. Mulvaney.

LAYOFFS
Electronic Arts Cuts 5%
Of Work Force in Pullback
Electronic Arts is cutting about 5 percent of its work force, or approximately 670 employees, as layoffs in the technology and gaming sector continue after a surge of hiring in recent years.
The video game maker said in a regulatory filing that its board approved a restructuring plan that includes the layoffs, as well as closing some offices or facilities.
The Redwood City, Calif., company had 13,400 workers globally as of March, 31, 2023, according to a filing.
Electronic Arts estimates incurring about $ 125 million to $ 165 million in total charges related to the restructuring. The company anticipates approximately $ 50 million to $ 65 million in charges associated with office space reductions and about $ 40 million to $ 55 million related to severance and employee-related costs.
The announcement comes just days after Sony said that it would cut about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Chipmakers Seek Billions In Subsidies: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said new investments would put the U.S. on track to produce roughly 20% of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade.
Companies that produce the most advanced semiconductors have requested more than $ 70 billion in federal subsidies, roughly twice the amount of funding that is available, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday.
In an effort to revitalize domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, the federal government is distributing $ 39 billion in subsidies as an incentive for companies to produce more of the tiny chips that power everything from smartphones to cars and fighter jets. The funding is meant to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and reduce the country's reliance on foreign sources of chips. Currently, just 12 percent of chips are made in the United States.
The grants have so far proven popular among companies. In a speech on Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Ms. Raimondo said her department had received more than 600 statements of interest.
Federal officials have had to be "tough with companies," Ms. Raimondo said, adding that she has pushed company executives to "do more for less." She added that the level of interest also meant that officials would "have to say no to excellent companies."
Ms. Raimondo emphasized the need to bolster domestic production of the most technologically advanced chips, which are made largely in Taiwan.
Federal officials plan to award about $ 28 billion of the grants to firms that make such leading-edge chips, Ms. Raimondo said. Those semiconductors -- which are produced by companies including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel and Samsung -- are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones, supercomputers and the most sensitive military hardware.
"It's very hard, but it's our job to stretch the money as far as possible," Ms. Raimondo said in an interview on Monday.
She said the new federal investments would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced types of logic chips by the end of the decade -- currently, it produces zero, Ms. Raimondo said.
While companies might receive only a portion of the amount they originally requested, Ms. Raimondo said she was "very confident" that companies would still "do what they said they would do" with the money, in part because the government will hand out funding as certain milestones are met.
Ms. Raimondo emphasized that manufacturers could also benefit from other types of financial support besides the federal grants. The Commerce Department is able to support up to $ 75 billion in loans and loan guarantees to advance projects. Firms can also receive tax credits reimbursing them for 25 percent of project construction.
"It is a significant amount of money that each company will be receiving," she said.
Interest in the program has been so robust that federal officials, who originally aimed to help create at least two new large-scale manufacturing clusters to produce leading-edge logic chips, now expect to exceed that goal, Ms. Raimondo said.
During the event, Ms. Raimondo said the need for more chip production in the United States was heightened by the rise of artificial intelligence.
"A.I. will be the defining technology of our generation," she said. "You can't lead in A.I. if you don't lead in making leading-edge chips. And so our work in implementing the CHIPS Act just got a whole lot more important."
Federal officials have so far made three grant awards under the new program to companies that produce legacy chips, which are created with older production processes but continue to be used in a variety of products like cars and dishwashers. This month, the Biden administration awarded $ 1.5 billion to the New York chipmaker GlobalFoundries, which officials said would help secure a stable supply of chips for key auto suppliers and manufacturers.
Projects that will be completed by 2030 are receiving priority for awards, Ms. Raimondo said.
Private companies have announced $ 200 billion in semiconductor manufacturing investments since President Biden signed the CHIPS Act in 2022 and before federal officials have "put a single dollar out," Ms. Raimondo said.
Although there has been an uptick in investments, some chipmakers have run into obstacles while trying to expand their manufacturing footprint in the United States. TSMC, Intel, Microchip Technology and others have adjusted their production schedules as a sales slump in many types of chips has put pressure on the firms to manage their spending on new projects.
While the bulk of the money is set aside to cover the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities, the CHIPS Act also includes $ 11 billion to support research into new chip technologies.
Biden administration officials are already facing questions about the potential for another round of subsidies for chip manufacturers. Ms. Raimondo said officials could accomplish the goals of the program with the funding that was already available, but more money may be needed to further strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

Plans for U.S. Chip Manufacturing Hit Obstacles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Delays in finishing new factories are emerging, just as the Biden administration begins handing out money to stoke domestic production.
In December 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the key maker of the world's most cutting-edge chips, said it planned to spend $ 40 billion in Arizona on its first major U.S. hub for semiconductor production.
The much ballyhooed project in Phoenix -- with two new factories, including one with more advanced technology -- became a symbol of President Biden's quest to spur more domestic production of chips, the slices of silicon that help all manner of devices make calculations and store data.
Then last summer, TSMC pushed back initial manufacturing at its first Arizona factory to 2025 from this year, saying local workers lacked expertise in installing some sophisticated equipment. Last month, the company said the second plant wouldn't produce chips until 2027 or 2028, rather than 2026, citing uncertainty about tech choices and federal funding.
Progress at the Arizona site partly depends on "how much incentives that the U.S. government can provide," Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in an investor call.
TSMC is just one of several chip makers running into obstacles with their U.S. expansion plans. Intel, Microchip Technology and others have also adjusted their production schedules, as a sales slump in many kinds of chips pressures the companies to manage their spending on new infrastructure. New chip factories are hugely complex, involving thousands of construction workers, long construction timelines and billions of dollars of machinery.
The delays come as the Biden administration begins dispensing the first major awards from a $ 39 billion pot of money aimed at building up the U.S. semiconductor industry and reducing the nation's dependence on technology manufactured in East Asia. On Monday, the administration said it would award $ 1.5 billion in grants to the chipmaker GlobalFoundries to upgrade and expand facilities in New York and Vermont that make chips for automakers and the defense industry.
But the issues that companies like TSMC face with their projects could undercut this fanfare, raising questions about the prospects of success for President Biden's industrial policy program. The investments are expected to figure heavily in Mr. Biden's re-election campaign over the next few months.
"Nothing has failed yet," said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow and the director of the energy, economics and security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. "But we're going to have to see some progress and those factories actually coming online in the next few years for the program to be considered a success."
The Commerce Department is responsible for handing out federal money from the 2022 CHIPS Act to spur domestic chip production. In addition to the grant to GlobalFoundries, the department has issued two small production grants so far. It is expected to give much larger awards in the billions of dollars to chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron in the coming weeks and months.
The government is locked in complex negotiations with these major chipmakers over the amount and timing of the awards. Companies are also still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department about which investments will qualify for a new tax credit aimed at advanced manufacturing, which had been expected before the end of 2023.
Any delays in the process could hurt the United States as it races to reduce global dependence on chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and China, analysts said. Rival countries are offering their own incentives to court chip manufacturers. TSMC, for example, plans to add production in Japan and Germany as well as in the United States.
The longer the U.S. government waits to distribute benefits, "the more other geographies are going to snap up these investments, and more leading-edge investments will be made in East Asia," said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation. "So the clock is ticking."
A Commerce Department official disputed suggestions that it had been slow in handing out incentives. He said the department was taking time to protect taxpayer interests and push companies to do more to bolster the domestic chip supply chain.
A White House official said the chip companies' schedule changes were minor adjustments that were common at complex projects like the new production sites. He added that forecasts suggested there would be overwhelming demand for these chips when the facilities started making them.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman said that officials there had provided clarity on tax credits to companies planning investments and were working to issue additional guidance as quickly as possible.
The CHIPS Act authorized grants and other incentives to boost U.S. chip production, plus tax credits for investments in factories and manufacturing equipment. More than 600 companies and organizations had submitted statements of interest in the grants, the Commerce Department said, while it estimates pledges of private investment so far at $ 235 billion.
But most expansion plans were set when chips were scarce several years ago, after a pandemic-fueled burst of consumer spending on electronic products. That demand dried up, leaving chip makers stuck with big inventories of unsold components and little immediate need for new factories.
"Companies are rethinking how and what and when investments will occur," said Thomas Sonderman, the chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturer that has won Defense Department subsidies and is aiming for CHIPS Act funding.
One chip maker feeling the pinch is Microchip, an Arizona company. Two years ago, Microchip was swamped with orders. It applied for CHIPS Act funding to stoke production and stands to receive $ 162 million. Yet as sales have slumped, it recently announced two separate two-week factory shutdowns.
Microchip still plans to upgrade its factories in Oregon and Colorado that are set to receive CHIPS Act grants, said Ganesh Moorthy, its chief executive. But ordering machines to increase production capacity will have to wait until business conditions improve.
"We've paused on expansion," Mr. Moorthy said.
Intel, which is expanding production, has also adjusted purchases of costly factory tools. The company recently said it didn't expect to start manufacturing in Ohio, where it is spending $ 20 billion on two new factories, in 2025 as it originally expected. The change was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Still, Intel said neither construction on that site, nor plans to expand in the United States and three other countries, had slowed.
"The strategy is not changing from quarter to quarter," said Keyvan Esfarjani, the executive vice president who oversees Intel's manufacturing operations. "We're staying on course."
Some chip makers, such as Texas Instruments and Micron Technology, are plowing forward with expanding chip production for competitive reasons. New factories can help make higher-quality chips, more of them and for cheaper.
Micron is pushing ahead with building a $ 15 billion factory in Boise, Idaho, its hometown, and plans an even bigger manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., despite a downturn in the market for its memory chips, which store data in devices like smartphones and computers.
Scott Gatzemeier, a Micron vice president overseeing the expansion, said construction projects that took several years should be based on future chip demand rather than current conditions. Renting massive cranes and other equipment and securing construction workers, he added, are big expenses that might need to be repeated if a project is halted.
"Once you start, you don't want to stop," he said.
Other chip makers are unwilling to start construction without government money. Mr. Sonderman of SkyWater, for example, said his company's plans for a $ 1.8 billion facility in Indiana are contingent on obtaining funds through a portion of the CHIPS Act targeting research.
At TSMC's Arizona site, unforeseen problems have piled up over the past year.
Last summer, construction unions in the state raised issues about workplace safety and objected to TSMC's bringing workers from Taiwan to help install sophisticated equipment in the first factory. Delays in installing machines led to an announcement in July about the production delay.
In December, TSMC and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council agreed on ground rules at the site for safety, workplace training, site staffing and other issues. In an emailed statement, Mr. Liu, who recently announced plans to retire, sounded hopeful that worker tensions were over.
He acknowledged "challenges" in building the first Phoenix factory, but said TSMC was still "the fastest player" among its peers in completing such projects. While he told analysts in January that the company would delay the start of production at the second factory, also known as a fab, worker skills aren't likely to be among the reasons.
"We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother," Mr. Liu said. "The workers in Arizona learn things quickly."

Nvidia's Growth Blows Past Predictions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The A.I. chip maker's revenue more than tripled, and profits rose ninefold. It also projected that its revenue would more than triple again.
Nvidia, the kingpin of chips powering artificial intelligence, on Wednesday released quarterly financial results that reinforced how the company has become one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence boom, and it said demand for its products would fuel continued sales growth.
The Silicon Valley chip maker has been on an extraordinary rise over the past 18 months, driven by demand for its specialized and costly semiconductors, which are used for training popular A.I. services like OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. Nvidia has become known as one of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, which, including others like Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, have helped power the stock market.
Nvidia's valuation has surged more than 40 percent to $ 1.7 trillion since the start of the year, turning it into one of the world's most valuable public companies. Last week, the company briefly eclipsed the market values of Amazon and Alphabet before receding to the fifth-most-valuable tech company. Its stock market gains are largely a result of repeatedly exceeding analysts' expectations for growth, a feat that is becoming more difficult as they keep raising their predictions.
On Wednesday, Nvidia reported that revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter more than tripled from a year earlier to $ 22.1 billion, while profit soared nearly ninefold to $ 12.3 billion. Revenue was well above the $ 20 billion the company predicted in November and above Wall Street estimates of $ 20.4 billion.
Nvidia predicted that revenue in the current quarter would total about $ 24 billion, also more than triple the year-earlier period and higher than analysts' average forecast of $ 22 billion.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, argues that an epochal shift to upgrade data centers with chips needed for training powerful A.I. models is still in its early phases. That will require spending roughly $ 2 trillion to equip all the buildings and computers to use chips like Nvidia's, he predicts.
"Accelerated computing and generative A.I. have hit the tipping point," Mr. Huang said in a news release. "Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations."
In an interview later Wednesday, Mr. Huang said much more growth for the company lay ahead. "We are one year into generative A.I.," he said. "My guess is we are literally into the first year of a 10-year cycle of spreading this technology into every single industry."
Some analysts had predicted a sell-off after the Nvidia announcement, a reaction to just how high its share price has risen. But shares increased more than 8 percent in after-hours trading.
"Despite concerns over its high valuation, Nvidia's unparalleled A.I.-related intellectual property, rooted in decades of visionary investment, sets it apart in a league of its own," wrote Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, in a research report before the company reported.
One factor driving Nvidia's latest revenue growth is the ability of the company's production partners, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, to boost supplies of Nvidia's flagship A.I. chip, which commands prices ranging from $ 15,000 to $ 40,000.
Mr. Huang said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that the availability of those chips had improved significantly, but noted that the company would soon introduce new products that would again be scarce.
"Whenever we have new products, it ramps from zero to a very large number, and you can't do that overnight," he said during the call.
But giant cloud computing companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are designing their own A.I. chips to use in addition to Nvidia's, and rival chipmakers keep introducing their own A.I. products.
Intel, which has long dominated the standard microprocessor chip industry but lags in A.I., marshaled an array of partners and potential customers in Silicon Valley on Wednesday to discuss its plans to offer manufacturing services, which could boost industry capacity to build A.I. chips. Attendees included Sam Altman, who relies heavily on Nvidia chips as OpenAI's chief executive.
"Intel was the evil Borg of the industry at one time," said Daniel Newman, chief executive of Futurum Research, which tracks the semiconductor industry. Now, he said, "companies are kind of coming together to make sure Nvidia doesn't get too much more powerful."
The Biden administration has raised another set of hurdles for Nvidia and other U.S. chip manufacturers, placing restrictions on their chip sales in China. Nvidia has responded by selling less-powerful versions of some products in the market.
Still, the company said Wednesday that its sales to China had dropped to a mid-single-digit percentage of its data center chip revenues, from 19 percent in its 2023 fiscal year.
Meanwhile, some experts worry that a global rollout of the company's pricey, power-hungry chips will overtax countries' power grids and budgets.
Mr. Huang addressed some of those concerns in February at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. He said that Nvidia's chips were cheap and efficient compared with using slower standard microprocessors to get the same work done -- and that much faster chips were on the way, some of which the company is expected to unveil in March.
"If you assume that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion we need 14 different planets and three different galaxies and four more suns to fuel all this," Mr. Huang said. "But obviously computer architecture continues to advance."

Small Businesses Sound Alarm At Faltering German Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Thousands of companies, concerned that Germany is facing a recession, are calling for an end to political infighting that has blocked a possible stimulus plan.
Thousands of the small and midsize companies that form the backbone of the German economy warned this week that the country was losing its edge, as the country's central bank signaled the threat of a recession would loom over Germany in the first three months of 2024.
"Every day, Germany is losing its ability to remain internationally competitive," read an open letter to the government signed by 18 associations representing the businesses, in industries ranging from technology to trucking to taxi companies.
The aim of the letter was to urge lawmakers to overcome partisan fighting that is blocking passage of a law intended to provide tax credits for investments that speed the transition to a green economy. But the sweeping statement ticked off a list of concerns facing businesses, including high energy prices, labor shortages, slow efforts to digitize the bureaucracy and high taxes. "The economic downturn is homemade," it said.
Those strains are reflected in a report released on Monday by Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, which said that the country's economy, Europe's largest, was poised to shrink in the first three months of the year. After a contraction of 0.3 percent in the final months of 2023, a second consecutive decline would land the country in a technical recession.
The Bundesbank cited a weak export market, price-conscious consumers who remain cautious about spending and a lack of investment by companies spooked by higher borrowing costs.
The country's minister for the economy, Robert Habeck, called the state of the economy "dramatically bad" last week. On Wednesday, he will present the government's economic report for 2024, which includes projections of just 0.2 percent annual growth, scaled back from the 1.3 percent expansion forecast issued last year.
Mr. Habeck's ministry has drafted legislation, inspired by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, to provide billions in tax credits to companies that invest in green energy. The idea is to attract many German firms that have shifted their investments to the United States.
Corporate taxes in Germany are among the highest in Europe, at more than 29 percent, compared with about 25 percent in neighboring France and the Netherlands. .
The lower house of Parliament passed the law in November, but members of the conservative opposition parties are blocking its final passage through the upper house. They point out that application of the proposed law will fall to the states, which lack sufficient resources. They are also demanding that planned cuts for subsidies to agricultural diesel fuel -- a proposal that sent farmers into the streets in nationwide protests last month -- should be dropped in exchange for their support.
The public appeal from the business associations is an unusual campaign for groups that usually remain in the background. It reflects the frustration felt by many of the small and midsize firms -- known as the Mittelstand -- over the government's willingness to spend billions to attract large firms such as the chipmaker Intel or the battery producer Northvolt, said Jens Südekum, a professor of economics at the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf.
"That's why this law is so important -- it is an instrument for everybody," Mr. Südekum said. "For small and midsize enterprises, this is really essential."

Firms in U.S. Helped Fund China's Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A congressional investigation determined that U.S. funding helped fuel the growth of a sector now viewed by Washington as a security threat.
A congressional investigation has determined that five American venture capital firms invested more than $ 1 billion in China's semiconductor industry since 2001, fueling the growth of a sector that the United States government now regards as a national security threat.
Funds supplied by the five firms -- GGV Capital, GSR Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Walden International -- went to more than 150 Chinese companies, according to the report, which was released Thursday by both Republicans and Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The investments included roughly $ 180 million that went to Chinese firms that the committee said directly or indirectly supported Beijing's military. That includes companies that the U.S. government has said provide chips for China's military research, equipment and weapons, such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, China's largest chipmaker.
The report by the House committee focuses on investments made before the Biden administration imposed sweeping restrictions aimed at cutting off China's access to American financing. It does not allege any illegality.
In August, the Biden administration barred U.S. venture capital and private equity firms from investing in Chinese quantum computing, artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors. It has also imposed worldwide limits on sales of advanced chips and chip-making machines to China, arguing that these technologies could help advance the capabilities of the Chinese military and spy agencies.
Since it was established a year ago, the committee has called for raising tariffs on China, targeted Ford Motor and others for doing business with Chinese companies, and spotlighted forced labor concerns involving Chinese shopping sites.
The report recommended that Congress curb investments in all Chinese entities that are subject to certain U.S. trade restrictions or included on federal "red flag" lists, as well as their parent companies and subsidiaries. That would include companies that work with the Chinese military or have ties to forced labor in China's Xinjiang region. The U.S. government should also consider imposing controls on other industries, like biotechnology and fintech, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the committee's ranking Democrat, said.
Sequoia said in June, before the committee announced its investigation into private funding, that it would separate its China arm from its U.S. operations and rename it HongShan. A few months later, GGV Capital said it would separate its Asia-focused business.
Walden did not respond to a request for comment. A representative from GSR declined to comment. GGV provided a list of corrections and clarifications to the report and stated that it had been in compliance with all applicable laws. GGV is also trying to sell its stakes in three companies discussed in the report.
A Sequoia spokeswoman said the firm took U.S. national security issues seriously and had always had processes in place to ensure compliance with U.S. law. The firm completed its split from HongShan on Dec. 31.
A Qualcomm spokeswoman said its investments were small compared with those of the venture capital firms and made up less than 2 percent of the investments discussed in the report.
Officials in Washington increasingly see business ties even with private Chinese technology companies as problematic, arguing that China has tried to draw on the expertise of the private sector to modernize its military.
Committee leaders conceded that many of these investments were made when the United States was encouraging greater economic engagement with China.
"We all made this bet 20 years ago on China's integration into the global economy, and it was logical," said Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the committee's chairman. "It just happened to have failed." He added, "Now, I just I think there's no excuse anymore."
The 57-page report draws on information provided to the committee by the firms about their investments, as well as interviews with senior executives at multiple firms.
The committee's report looked at just some of the funding flowing to China. Between 2016 and July 2023, Chinese semiconductor companies raised $ 8.7 billion in deals that included U.S. investment firms, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-up funding. That investment peaked in 2021.
Venture capital firms pursued aggressive global expansion, particularly into Asia, for several decades. But they have known since the Trump administration took a more aggressive stance toward China that investments in Chinese companies would be subject to increasing scrutiny.
"No one is touching China now," said Linus Liang, an investor at the venture firm Kyber Knight Capital.
Splitting off investment entities with ties to China, as Sequoia and GGV did, may not resolve the committee's concerns that American financing and technology will end up in Chinese companies, the report stated. Sequoia's newly separated Chinese-based firm, HongShan, counts U.S. investors among its backers. And HongShan and GGV's new unit, GGV Asia, could still invest in U.S. start-ups, the report said.
Much of the report focuses on Walden International, a California-based company that was one the earliest and most influential foreign investors in the Chinese chip sector. Walden is led by Lip-Bu Tan, a former chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, a chip design firm, and a current member of Intel's board.
Walden International created various funds for the chip sector in partnership with the Chinese government and Chinese state-owned companies, including a prominent military supplier, the report said.
It was a founding shareholder and early source of financing for SMIC, which is now subject to U.S. trade restrictions because of its ties to the Chinese military. Walden gave $ 52 million to SMIC over several decades, the committee found, as well as tens of millions of dollars to SMIC affiliates. Mr. Tan also served on SMIC's board of directors.
He is credited with bringing SMIC and other firms a combination of financing, tools and intellectual property for chip design, as well as profitable connections with customers.
While the U.S. government labeled SMIC a "trusted customer" in 2007, skepticism of the company's activities has grown in Washington in more recent years. Today, the company is key to China's ambitions to create a thriving chip sector and lessen its dependence on the United States.
Walden, along with Qualcomm Ventures, the investing arm of chipmaker Qualcomm, invested tens of millions of dollars into Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, or AMEC, a Chinese company that makes the machines needed to manufacture chips. AMEC, a supplier to SMIC and other Chinese chipmakers, is vital to China's efforts to build up its chip-making industry after the United States placed restrictions on selling China the most advanced chip-making machines.
China's semiconductor companies are well funded by the country's government. But ties with U.S. venture capital firms provide Chinese companies with managerial expertise as well as access to technology and the American and European markets. American venture capital firms have also tried to sway U.S. officials and regulators on behalf of Chinese companies in their portfolio, like TikTok.

Kenyan Court Blocks Plan for Police to Lead Haiti Security Mission: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A contingent of 1,000 Kenyan officers was intended to lead a multinational force financed by the United States to restore security in a Caribbean country terrorized by armed gangs.
A Kenyan court on Friday prohibited the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, jeopardizing a multinational security force charged with stabilizing the chaos-hit Caribbean island nation before it even got off the ground.
The force, which is backed by the United Nations and financed by the United States, had been stalled since October, when Kenyan opponents of the mission challenged it in court, calling it unconstitutional. The High Court upheld those arguments on Friday, throwing into doubt the latest international effort to rescue an impoverished country that is spiraling ever deeper into violence and instability.
"An order is hereby issued prohibiting the deployment of police officers to Haiti or any other country," Justice Chacha Mwita said at the conclusion of a judgment that took over 40 minutes to read.
The international force was meant to help break the grip of the armed gangs that control most of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and that have turned Haiti into one of the world's most dangerous nations. Haiti's government has pleaded for foreign military forces to restore order, but the United States and Canada have been unwilling to commit their own troops.
Kenya agreed last summer to lead the mission, with backing from Washington, which pledged $ 200 million. The force was intended to eventually increase to 3,000 security officers.
But just a handful of Caribbean nations have stepped forward to contribute police officers, and the court order on Friday raised questions about whether the mission will deploy anytime soon.
While Kenya's military has participated in numerous U.N. peacekeeping missions to countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan, the court ruled Kenya's government had not followed correct procedure in authorizing the mission to Haiti -- although it also appeared to leave room for it to still go ahead.
The Kenyan government said it would appeal the decision.
Prime Minister Ariel Henry released a short statement saying only that he "continues diplomatic efforts with the support of the international community." His spokesman said there was no more to add.
Many Haitians were disappointed in the court decision because they were expecting the deployment to start early this year, said Allen Joseph, the program manager for Mercy Corps, an international organization operating in Haiti. But he acknowledged that opinion is mixed because the last U.N. mission did not improve Haiti's security.
"I would prefer a Haitian solution," he said.
For the Biden administration, calming the waters in Haiti is important in an election year in which migrants seeking asylum has become a political and humanitarian crisis. The number of Haitians immigrating to the United States has more than doubled in the past two years, with more than 160,000 people arriving in 2023, according to U.S. data.
The daunting task facing any mission to Haiti was highlighted by the latest violent eruption in the capital last week.
Flaming barricades sprang up across Port-au-Prince as police officers clashed with armed gangs, sending the city into lockdown as residents retreated into their homes, seeking shelter. About 24 people were killed -- not an unusual toll in a country of fewer than 12 million people where about 5,000 people died violently last year, twice as many as in 2022, and about 2,500 were kidnapped, the United Nations said this week.
Haiti's political system is teetering on the verge of collapse. Calls have been growing for the resignation of the interim prime minister, Mr. Henry, who has been in charge since the assassination in 2021 of President Jovenel Moïse.
Western officials who had been briefed on the plans for the Kenyan force said it was intended to initially comprise up to 400 officers drawn mostly from Kenya's Border Police Unit and the paramilitary General Service Unit -- officers whose work normally involves fighting Islamist militants, border smugglers and cattle rustlers.
All of that is now in doubt, even though Kenya's Parliament approved the mission in November.
The ruling also represents another rebuke to Kenya's president, William Ruto, from the country's fiercely independent higher courts, which have blocked or stalled several major policy initiatives in the past six months. (A separate court ruling, also issued on Friday, confirmed that citizens should not pay a contentious housing levy that Mr. Ruto sought to introduce.)
Those decisions have visibly angered the Kenyan president, whose prominent global image contrasts with his sinking popularity at home. He has publicly hinted that he might defy the courts, stoking worries about a wider clash between his government and the judiciary.
In his ruling on Friday, the judge said that Kenya's National Security Council was not authorized to deploy a police mission to Haiti -- something that could only happen if a "reciprocal arrangement" was in place with the Haitian government, he said.
The prohibition is also a major challenge for Mr. Ruto's relationship with the United States, the Haiti mission's main sponsor.
Since he came to power in 2022, Mr. Ruto has developed a strong relationship with the U.S. ambassador, Meg Whitman, a former chief executive officer of eBay and Hewlett-Packard. In September, soon after Kenya agreed to lead the international mission to Haiti, Ms. Whitman accompanied Mr. Ruto to California on a tour of major Silicon Valley firms like Apple, Google and Intel, hoping to attract investment in Kenya.
The Haiti mission ran into legal trouble in October when a Kenyan opposition politician brought a court challenge that resulted in an order freezing the deployment. But even as judges considered the case in recent months, the Kenyan police pressed ahead with preparations at training centers near the capital, Nairobi.
In explaining their motivations to undertake a dangerous mission in a distant country, Kenyan officials cited their country's longstanding ties with the Caribbean stretching back to their founding father, Jomo Kenyatta. Financial considerations may have played a role too: Many developing nations view international security missions as a way to subsidize or reward their security forces.
Still, many Kenyans questioned if the mission was worth it. The Kenyan public is sensitive to casualties and the deaths of Kenyan soldiers deployed to neighboring Somalia to fight Al Shabab militants often stirs vocal public opprobrium. Any further deaths from a Haiti mission could stoke criticism of Mr. Ruto's government, which is already grappling with a severe economic downturn.
The American commitment of $ 200 million, about half from the Defense Department, was intended to pay for equipment, advisers and medical support, as well as help with planning, logistics and communications, a State Department spokeswoman said. But Kenyan officials insisted that much more was needed.
Many Haitians are wary of international interventions. In 2010, a United Nations peacekeeping force brought cholera to the country as poor sanitation at a base camp sent sewage downriver, leading to over 9,000 deaths. Sexual exploitation by peacekeepers and aid workers has been documented repeatedly, and researchers say it resulted in the births of hundreds of children.
Still, the country's increasingly desperate security crisis has left many people open to another international intervention. Armed gangs regularly abduct passengers from buses, to be held for ransom. Six nuns were released on Wednesday, six days after they were kidnapped.For Haiti's demoralized, poorly supplied police force, the court decision came as yet another blow. "It's a slap in the face," Lionel Lazarre, the head of SYNAPOHA, a Haitian police union, said on Friday.
Thousands of Haitian officers have left their jobs in the past two years, leaving the force even less well equipped to battle gangs. Just 21 of its 47 armored vehicles were operational in November, a recent United Nations report found.
Mr. Lazarre said that instead of committing hundreds of millions of dollars to a Kenya-led mission, the international community should focus on building up the local police.
As international bodies and the Haiti government seek a solution, he added, "the gangs are gaining ground."

Wall Street Ends Winning Week With Mixed Finish: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out its latest winning week with a mixed finish on Friday, as drops for technology stocks dragged on the market.
The S&P 500 slipped 3.19 points, or 0.1%, to 4,890.97. It's the first decline for the index after a six-day winning streak led it to set record highs for five straight days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 60.30, or 0.2%, to 38,109.43. The weakness for tech stocks, meanwhile, dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 55.13, or 0.4%, to 15,455.36.
Intel led chip stocks lower even though it reported stronger profit for the last three months of 2023 than analysts expected. It dropped 11.9% after giving forecasts for revenue and profit for the start of 2024 that fell short of Wall Street's estimates.
KLA, a supplier for the chip industry, also dragged on tech stocks despite reporting better quarterly results than expected. It sank 6.6% after saying it still sees market conditions as challenging in the near term and giving a forecast for upcoming revenue that fell short of analysts' estimates.
The U.S. stock market nevertheless closed out another winning week as reports keep suggesting inflation is cooling while the economy continues to power higher. The unexpected backdrop has hopes high that Wall Street's dream scenario can come true: one where a resilient economy drives profits higher for companies, while inflation moderates enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates many times this year.
The latest report on Friday showed the measure of inflation the Fed prefers to use behaved just about exactly as expected in December. Overall inflation by that measure was 2.6% during the month, matching November's rate.
The Fed pays more attention to the inflation figure after ignoring prices for food and fuel, which can zigzag sharply month to month. That figure cooled to 2.9% from 3.2% and was a bit better than economists expected.
At the same time, spending by U.S. consumers strengthened by more in December than expected. That helped calm worries that a resilient U.S. economy, which has so far refused to fall into a long-predicted recession, would mean upward pressure on inflation.
The expectation is for the labor market to soften some in upcoming months, which would further cool pressure on inflation, but not enough to halt the economy's growth. That has the market looking forward to what EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco calls "the 'holy grail' of non-inflationary growth."
Treasury yields yo-yoed in the bond market following the report but later rose modestly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.13% from 4.12% late Thursday.

NAIROBI, Kenya — A Kenyan court on Friday prohibited the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, jeopardizing a multinational security force charged with stabilizing the chaos-hit Caribbean island nation before it even got off the ground.
The force, which is backed by the United Nations and financed by the United States, had been stalled since October, when Kenyan opponents of the mission challenged it in court, calling it unconstitutional. The High Court upheld those arguments Friday, throwing into doubt the latest international effort to rescue an impoverished country that is spiraling ever deeper into violence and instability.
“An order is hereby issued prohibiting the deployment of police officers to Haiti or any other country,” Justice Chacha Mwita said at the conclusion of a judgment that took over 40 minutes to read.
The international force was meant to help break the grip of the armed gangs that control most of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, and that have turned Haiti into one of the world’s most dangerous nations. Haiti’s government has pleaded for foreign military forces to restore order, but the United States and Canada have been unwilling to commit their own troops.
Kenya agreed last summer to lead the mission, with backing from Washington, which pledged $200 million. The force was intended to eventually increase to 3,000 security officers.
But just a handful of Caribbean nations have stepped forward to contribute police officers, and the court order Friday raised questions about whether the mission will deploy anytime soon.
While Kenya’s military has participated in numerous U.N. peacekeeping missions to countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan, the court ruled Kenya’s government had not followed correct procedure in authorizing the mission to Haiti — although it also appeared to leave room for it to still go ahead.
The Kenyan government said it would appeal the decision.
Prime Minister Ariel Henry of Haiti released a short statement saying only that he “continues diplomatic efforts with the support of the international community.” His spokesperson said there was no more to add.
Many Haitians were disappointed in the court decision because they were expecting the deployment to start early this year, said Allen Joseph, the program manager for Mercy Corps, an international organization operating in Haiti. But he acknowledged that opinion is mixed because the last U.N. mission did not improve Haiti’s security.
“I would prefer a Haitian solution,” he said.
For the Biden administration, calming the waters in Haiti is important in an election year in which migrants seeking asylum has become a political and humanitarian crisis. The number of Haitians immigrating to the United States has more than doubled in the past two years, with more than 160,000 people arriving in 2023, according to U.S. data.
The daunting task facing any mission to Haiti was highlighted by the latest violent eruption in the capital last week.
Flaming barricades sprang up across Port-au-Prince as police officers clashed with armed gangs, sending the city into lockdown as residents retreated into their homes, seeking shelter. About 24 people were killed — not an unusual toll in a country of fewer than 12 million people where about 5,000 people died violently last year, twice as many as in 2022, and about 2,500 were kidnapped, the U.N. said this week.
Haiti’s political system is teetering on the verge of collapse. Calls have been growing for the resignation of the interim prime minister, Henry, who has been in charge since the assassination in 2021 of President Jovenel Moïse.
Western officials who had been briefed on the plans for the Kenyan force said it was intended to initially comprise up to 400 officers drawn mostly from Kenya’s Border Police Unit and the paramilitary General Service Unit — officers whose work normally involves fighting Islamist militants, border smugglers and cattle rustlers.
All of that is now in doubt, even though Kenya’s Parliament approved the mission in November.
The ruling also represents another rebuke to Kenyan President William Ruto from the country’s fiercely independent higher courts, which have blocked or stalled several major policy initiatives in the past six months. (A separate court ruling, also issued Friday, confirmed that citizens should not pay a contentious housing levy that Ruto sought to introduce.)
Those decisions have visibly angered the Kenyan president, whose prominent global image contrasts with his sinking popularity at home. He has publicly hinted that he might defy the courts, stoking worries about a wider clash between his government and the judiciary.
In his ruling Friday, the judge said that Kenya’s National Security Council was not authorized to deploy a police mission to Haiti — something that could only happen if a “reciprocal arrangement” was in place with the Haitian government, he said.
The prohibition is also a major challenge for Ruto’s relationship with the United States, the Haiti mission’s main sponsor.
Since he came to power in 2022, Ruto has developed a strong relationship with U.S. Ambassador Meg Whitman, a former CEO of eBay and Hewlett-Packard. In September, soon after Kenya agreed to lead the international mission to Haiti, Whitman accompanied Ruto to California on a tour of major Silicon Valley firms including Apple, Google and Intel, hoping to attract investment in Kenya.
The Haiti mission ran into legal trouble in October when a Kenyan opposition politician brought a court challenge that resulted in an order freezing the deployment. But even as judges considered the case in recent months, the Kenyan police pressed ahead with preparations at training centers near the capital, Nairobi.
In explaining their motivations to undertake a dangerous mission in a distant country, Kenyan officials cited their country’s long-standing ties with the Caribbean stretching back to their founding father, Jomo Kenyatta. Financial considerations may have played a role too: Many developing nations view international security missions as a way to subsidize or reward their security forces.
Still, many Kenyans questioned if the mission was worth it. The Kenyan public is sensitive to casualties and the deaths of Kenyan soldiers deployed to neighboring Somalia to fight al-Shabab militants often stirs vocal public opprobrium. Any further deaths from a Haiti mission could stoke criticism of Ruto’s government, which is already grappling with a severe economic downturn.
The U.S. commitment of $200 million, about half from the Defense Department, was intended to pay for equipment, advisers and medical support, as well as help with planning, logistics and communications, a State Department spokesperson said. But Kenyan officials insisted that much more was needed.
Many Haitians are wary of international interventions. In 2010, a U.N. peacekeeping force brought cholera to the country as poor sanitation at a base camp sent sewage downriver, leading to over 9,000 deaths. Sexual exploitation by peacekeepers and aid workers has been documented repeatedly, and researchers say it resulted in the births of hundreds of children.
Still, the country’s increasingly desperate security crisis has left many people open to another international intervention. Armed gangs regularly abduct passengers from buses, to be held for ransom. Six nuns were released Wednesday, six days after they were kidnapped.
For Haiti’s demoralized, poorly supplied police force, the court decision came as yet another blow. “It’s a slap in the face,” Lionel Lazarre, the head of SYNAPOHA, a Haitian police union, said Friday.
Thousands of Haitian officers have left their jobs in the past two years, leaving the force even less well equipped to battle gangs. Just 21 of its 47 armored vehicles were operational in November, a recent U.N. report found.
Lazarre said that instead of committing hundreds of millions of dollars to a Kenya-led mission, the international community should focus on building up the local police.
As international bodies and the Haiti government seek a solution, he added, “the gangs are gaining ground.”

As Earnings Reports Flood In, Indexes Mostly Rise: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/as-earnings-reports-flood-indexes-mostly-rise/docview/2917726299/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The S&P 500 climbed to another record Tuesday as earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies picked up the pace.
The index rose 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite also climbed, up 0.4 percent. But the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.3 percent, a day after topping 38,000 for the first time.
Procter & Gamble climbed 4.1 percent after posting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company behind Charmin and Olay benefited from price increases for its products, and it raised its forecast for profit for this full fiscal year.
United Airlines ended 5.3 percent higher after it also reported stronger profit for the last three months of 2023 than analysts expected. It made more in revenue from customers in both basic economy and premium seats, though it warned it may lose money in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max 9 planes.
They helped offset an 11 percent tumble for 3M after it gave a forecast for earnings this upcoming year that fell short of analysts' expectations. The maker of Post-it notes and Command strips was the main reason the Dow dropped from its record.
Johnson & Johnson was also a heavy weight on the market and fell 1.6 percent after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected.
Earnings season is kicking into gear, and more than a dozen companies in the S&P 500 reported their latest quarterly results Tuesday morning. More than 50 are scheduled to follow up later this week, including Tesla and Intel.
Among Tuesday's headliners was Verizon Communications, which rose 6.7 percent after beating analysts' profit estimates. General Electric also topped expectations, but its stock slipped 1 percent after it gave a forecast for profit this quarter that fell short of analysts' forecasts. Shares of the homebuilder D.R. Horton sank 9.2 percent after the company reported weaker profit than expected.
Expectations are relatively low for companies' profits at the end of 2023. Analysts have forecast companies in the S&P 500 will deliver weaker overall earnings per share than a year earlier, which would be the fourth such decline in the last five quarters, according to FactSet.
Stocks have nevertheless rallied to records, mostly on expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year.
Such cuts can boost prices for investments while relaxing the pressure on the economy and financial system. The Federal Reserve itself has said it may cut rates three times this year as inflation cools, which would allow the central bank to loosen its leash on the economy.
Treasury yields have already eased considerably since the autumn on expectations for coming rate cuts, though critics warn traders may have gone overboard again in forecasting how many cuts will come and how soon the Fed will begin.
Yields were mixed in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.14 percent from 4.11 percent late Monday, though it remained well below its 5 percent level during October.
The "everything rally" that began late last year on hopes for a pivot by the Fed likely caused mutual-fund managers to scramble to increase their ownership of stocks to keep up. Even when stocks took a mini-breather at the start of 2024, investors seemed to "remain little concerned with downside risk," according to strategists at Barclays led by Venu Krishna. That could leave "less room for fundamental upside from here."
In stock markets abroad, Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.6 percent to recover some of its sharp loss for the year so far on hopes that Chinese authorities may try to shore up markets. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dipped 0.1 percent after analysts took comments by a bank official as hints that rate increases may be coming this year.

Wall Street Ticks Higher, With S&P Adding to Its Record: [Correction]

Full text: Most stocks rose on Wall Street Monday to build on the record high reached last week.
The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite added 0.3 percent.
Macy's climbed 3.5 percent after the retailer said it rejected a buyout offer from two investment companies, in part because it didn't offer "compelling value." SolarEdge Technologies rose 4 percent after it said it would cut 16 percent of its work force, and NuStar Energy jumped 18.2 percent after Sunoco said it would buy the pipeline and storage company in a deal valued at $ 7.3 billion, including debt.
They helped offset a 24.2 percent drop for Archer Daniels Midland, which put its chief financial officer on leave. After getting a document request from U.S. regulators, it said it was investigating some of its accounting practices. ADM also said it expected to report profit for the full year of 2023 that was below what analysts were forecasting.
This upcoming week will have a rush of companies reporting their results for the last three months of 2023, with roughly 70 companies from the S&P 500 on the calendar. They include American Airlines, Intel, Procter & Gamble and Tesla.
Analysts are expecting companies in the S&P 500 to report an overall dip in earnings for the fourth quarter, down nearly 2 percent from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they're right, it would be the fourth quarter in the last five where profits have fallen.
After the initial week of earnings reporting season, companies that have been topping analysts' forecasts for profits and revenue have been getting smaller bumps to their stock prices than usual, according to strategists at Bank of America.
Companies that fall short of expectations have seen their stock prices get punished more than usual. It all points to "a higher bar after a big rally," Savita Subramanian and Ohsung Kwon wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
That big rally, which carried the S&P 500 to a record for the first time in two years, came largely on hopes that a cool-down in inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year. It would be a sharp turnaround from the last two years, when the Fed jacked its main interest rate drastically higher in hopes of slowing the economy enough to grind down high inflation.
Some stronger-than-expected reports on the economy recently have reinforced hopes that no recession is arriving, while also forcing traders to push out their forecasts for when the Fed will begin cutting rates. They overall see a less than 42 percent probability that it could begin in March, down from more than 80 percent a week ago, according to data from CME Group.
But the expectation is still for the Fed to cut rates more this year than the three times it's indicated.
Some upcoming reports on the economy could shift those expectations further. On Thursday, the government will give its first estimate for how strongly the economy grew during the last three months of 2023.
Economists expect it to show the economy is still growing, but at a slower pace than during the summer. That's what the Federal Reserve wants to see, because too strong of an economy would keep upward pressure on inflation.
On Friday, the government will release the latest reading for the inflation gauge that the Fed prefers to use. Economists expect it to show inflation held steady at 2.6 percent in December from a month earlier.
Treasury yields have eased significantly since October on expectations for coming rate cuts. That in turn has relaxed the pressure considerably on the stock market and helped it to rip higher. Yields dipped further on Monday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.10 percent from 4.13 percent late Friday and from 5 percent in October.
The two-year Treasury yield ticked up to 4.41 percent from 4.39 percent.

German Economy Staggers Into New Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The economy shrank last year and is not predicted to grow much in 2024. Farmers are angry, industrial output is falling and the government is bickering.
Germany started the year with Berlin's streets choked with tractors and farmers blaring horns in furious protest of proposed budget cuts. Then train engineers walked off the job to demand better pay, stranding commuters and carloads of freight and leaving the country angry and gridlocked.
The same could be said for the state of the German economy. Last year it contracted 0.3 percent, official figures showed this week, making it not only the largest economy but also the slowest growing among the 20 countries using the euro. Industrial production has fallen five months in a row.
"The economy is at a standstill in Germany," said Siegfried Russwurm, the president of the Federation of German Industries. "We don't see any chance of a rapid recovery in 2024."
Since it was rebuilt after World War II, Germany has been Europe's main driver of economic growth, becoming an industrial powerhouse known for vast factories and fine-tuned engineering.
But now its automakers must compete with relatively cheap electric cars from China, and it vies with the United States to attract tech giants. There is a growing realization that Germany has not been successful updating its industry with sufficient flexibility and digital know-how to remain competitive.
As the economy sputtered last year, the government was nearly paralyzed by bickering among members of the three parties that make up Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition. Then came a budget crisis in November, causing the government's popularity to plunge in polls.
Many of those disputes were over how to fill a 17 billion-euro ( $ 18.5 billion) gap in the budget after the country's highest court in November threw out the previous spending plan. That decision was driven by the country's so-called debt brake, a law enshrined in its Constitution to keep public deficits low.
But geopolitical crises and new industrial rivalries in China and the United States have weakened demand for German-made products abroad. Germany grew rich in recent decades by selling its goods to the world, racking up a trade surplus that strained ties with the United States under President Donald J. Trump.
The restrictions on borrowing are preventing the government from making badly needed investments in public infrastructure, from schools and public administration to railways and energy networks.
"Writing that into the Constitution gave it the binding effect that was intended at the time," when debt soared after reunification with East Germany and spending rose after the financial crisis in 2008, Monika Schnitzer, a government adviser, told the podcast "Hessischer Rundfunk." "But nobody thought it through to the end about what it could mean in a serious crisis, that there is not enough room to maneuver."
Ms. Schnitzer, who heads the German Council of Economic Experts, is among the economists urging lawmakers to adjust the mechanism. But that would mean changing the Constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament, implying a level of cooperation between the opposition and the government that is unthinkable in the current political environment.
That means, for this year and the next, Germans will instead find themselves faced with cuts on government spending, affecting a raft of subsidies to farmers and filmmakers alike. Travelers will face a new tax on airline tickets. Incentives for solar power and electric vehicles will be curtailed. Money to improve rail links will also be cut.
Economists have warned that taking a red pen to spending instead of raising taxes -- a move vehemently opposed by the fiscally libertarian Free Democrats, the smallest party in Mr. Scholz's coalition but the one that controls the finance ministry -- will be a further drag on the economy.
The spending cuts could not come at a worse time for Germany's stumbling economy. They have prompted the country's three leading economic institutes to cut their economic growth forecasts for 2024 to between 0.6 and 0.9 percent, down from a range of 1.1 to 1.4 percent predicted in September.
Within the Group of 20 nations, which include developed and developing economies from around the world, Germany is expected to come in at the bottom, with only Argentina seeing weaker growth projected for the year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Slowing growth in China has also reverberated in Germany. Although China's economy grew 5.2 percent in 2023, it is undergoing significant change as the country's leaders try to wean it off property and construction, long pillars of growth.
Not everything is negative, economists say. Double-digit inflation fell to 3.8 percent in December, and high interest rates are expected to begin easing later this year. That, coupled with an increase in wages won after labor actions like the train engineers' strike, could encourage German consumers to spend more, albeit at the risk of fanning further inflation.
But that will not be enough to fix Germany's structural problems. One is a lack of domestic energy sources: The country relies on imports to sustain the industries that have formed the backbone of its economy for decades. They include car making, steel and the chemicals industry, which reported that production fell 11 percent last year.
Overall, Germany's industrial sector is struggling to cope with not only the high price of energy but with the transition to a future that is more nimble and more digital. Plans to digitize the country's prized but paperbound bureaucracy, which traces its roots to 19th-century Prussia, largely stalled last year, according to an official index.
The country failed to reach its goal, set in 2017, of requiring all public offices to offer digital services by the end of 2022. That infrastructure lags miles behind the rest of the European Union, where on average 56 percent of homes are connected to fiber-optic cables, compared with 19 percent of German homes.
In the private sector, companies complain that the amount of paperwork required to build or expand hampers growth.
Germany recently showed that it can move quickly when it has no choice. After Russia cut off flows of natural gas in 2022, the government approved the procurement and construction of several terminals to bring in liquefied natural gas.
Within months, Germany was able to fill natural gas storage facilities to the brim while it encouraged companies and consumers to conserve fuel.
"Germans are so risk-averse, it's almost a psychological thing," said Sander Tordoir, an economist at the Center for European Reform, a think tank in Berlin.
He pointed to the country's growing green tech sector as a bright spot in the economy, those industries that develop technology for environmental protection, renewable energies and the efficient use of resources.
Semiconductor makers are another source of investment. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plan to build factories in eastern Germany, helped by subsidies worth €20 billion, which have survived government budget cuts.
Economists have argued over the wisdom of spending so much to attract such deep-pocketed companies, worth billions in their own right. But the idea that such firms are needed to help bring German industry into the 21st century is not in doubt.
"The Germans need to think about what kind of economy they want," Mr. Tordoir said. "But once they make the jump to deregulate and let go of fiscal straitjackets, there is a lot of potential in the German economy. It's just not being used."

How the War With Hamas Damaged Israel's Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Israel's technology sector, a key part of the economy, has been jolted by worker shortages and funding fears, which could drive a wider slowdown in 2024.
At 6:45 a.m. on Oct. 7, Jack Bigio, the founder of the technology company UBQ Materials, talked to his chief operating officer, who said terrorists were on his kibbutz. Other employees texted that they were hiding in safe rooms, and one said her husband had been shot in the stomach.
"It was like doomsday," Mr. Bigio said.
The attack by Hamas on Israel forced UBQ Materials to shut its plant, 20 miles from the Gaza border, and left its work force in shock. Two employees were murdered. Many lost their homes and were relocated 100 miles away.
Founded in 2012, UBQ Materials uses technology that turns household garbage into a plastic substitute used to make tables, chairs, McDonald's trays and car parts for Mercedes-Benz. The company was able to get up and running within three weeks, but many others are facing continuing problems with operations and financing.
About 23,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since Oct. 7, according to the Gazan health ministry, which does not distinguish between deaths of civilians and fighters. About a million evacuees from the territory's north have fled south. The strip has suffered widespread destruction, with hunger; disruption of water, electricity and communications networks; and limited medical care as many hospitals have sustained damage.
In Israel, the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 killed 1,200 people and resulted in hundreds being taken hostage, including more than 100 who are still held in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities. The war has upended life, as hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers were called up, and 200,000 people have been displaced from border areas in the north and south.
In ways that are often less visible outside the country, the war has also hurt Israel's economy. Tourism has come to a virtual standstill, and government spending has jumped. The hit to tech companies has shaken confidence in a sector that has become a key driver of Israel's economy.
The call-up of 350,000 army reservists disrupted operations at many companies. Many customer orders were put on hold or canceled outright, and investors were getting cold feet, according to a survey by the Israel Innovation Authority, a government-funded agency, and the Start-Up Nation Policy Institute.
Israel's technology sector has grown rapidly over the past decade and accounts for almost half of all exports and a fifth of economic output, the Israeli Innovation Authority said.
As a result, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, the war will cause a "temporary but pronounced slowdown" of Israel's economy. It had grown about 3 percent before the Oct. 7 attacks and is now expected to slow to 1.5 percent this year. Weighing on the economy are labor shortages, lower consumer and business confidence, and higher inflation.
Another concern is foreign investment, which was already weak before Oct. 7 because of uncertainty caused by the dispute between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government and Israel's Supreme Court, said Jonathan Katz, a former economic forecaster in the Israeli Finance Ministry.
"Now the question is whether foreigners will still want to invest in Israeli high tech, or if they'd rather invest their money in some place that's safe and quiet, like Ireland," Mr. Katz said.
To stimulate the flagging economy, the Bank of Israel cut interest rates by a quarter point, to 4.5 percent, last week. It was its first rate cut since the start of the Covid pandemic, and the governor of the central bank, Amir Yaron, said additional cuts were expected.
Mr. Yaron has said that the economy was already adjusting to the war conditions and showing signs of recovery, but that the ramifications of the prolonged hostilities would be significant.
In particular, he emphasized the importance of stability and the need to rein in soaring government spending, which the central bank expects to contribute to more public debt and higher deficits.
"It is clear to us all that the current economic uncertainty is connected very closely to the security situation and how the war will develop," Mr. Yaron said.
Israel has taken several steps to tamp down the uncertainty, including stabilizing the Israeli shekel. The government is planning to increase the number of foreign workers allowed in the country to 70,000, from 50,000, to address a sudden labor shortage. Workers from abroad have fled, and more than 100,000 West Bank Palestinians have been barred from working in Israel.
In recent weeks, the military has also started withdrawing several thousand troops from the Gaza Strip, at least temporarily, in part because of the economic toll of such a massive deployment of reservists.
Still, Mr. Yaron issued a stern warning on Jan. 1 to Mr. Netanyahu over fiscal priorities at a time when more spending must be directed to defense and security and pressing domestic needs, like making the communities near the Gaza and Lebanese borders habitable after they came under attack from Hamas and Hezbollah militants. Criticism of the Netanyahu government's funding of West Bank settlements and the ultra-Orthodox has intensified since the war.
"Not acting now to adjust the budget via cuts in expenditures, removing redundant ministries and increasing revenues in view of the needs of the war is likely to cost the economy much more in the future," Mr. Yaron said.
The war in Gaza, one of the longest Israel has ever waged, is already reverberating throughout the economy.
Construction, which represents 14 percent of Israel's economy, has slowed because of the labor shortage. Though volunteers have been pitching in, the departure of foreign workers and loss of Palestinian labor have meant that fruit and vegetables were left rotting on trees and in fields.
In addition, some imports are in short supply because attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen have disrupted transport through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.
Tourism took an immediate nosedive on Oct. 8, just as it was recovering after the Covid pandemic, government officials said.
"There's nothing -- no Israeli tourists, no non-Israeli tourists, no weddings, no henna celebrations before the weddings, no house warmings. No one is celebrating," said Tomer Bent, who runs King David Treasures, a Judaica store on Jerusalem's popular Ben Yehuda street arcade, which is usually teeming with people eating pizza and falafel or having coffee at sidewalk restaurants.
"But it will get better," Mr. Bent said, and he pointed skyward. "We believe in Him."
Stores on Ben Yehuda used to stay open until midnight in late December, when American tourists visited during the winter break and Christmas holiday, said Moshe Saudi, who was staffing a souvenir shop. Now they are closing early.
The Israel Innovation Authority has $ 100 million in government funds to support technology companies, especially start-ups that have lost financing. The sector was encouraged by last month's announcement that the semiconductor giant Intel would proceed with a planned $ 25 billion investment to expand a chip factory in southern Israel, after receiving a $ 3.2 billion grant from the government.
"All our entrepreneurs understand that regardless of how much our customers abroad support us and empathize with us, if we cannot meet our commitments they have to move on," said Dror Bin, general manager of the Innovation Authority.
Shortly after the war erupted, the organization started a new promotional campaign to boost confidence in Israeli tech companies, despite the war. The slogan: "Israeli tech delivers. NO MATTER WHAT."

The Next Front In the Chip Wars Is Emerging: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A U.S.-born chip technology called RISC-V has become critical to China's ambitions. Washington is debating whether and how to limit the technology.
NASA has chosen the technology to help it land future spacecraft on unmapped planets. Meta uses the technology for artificial intelligence. Chinese engineers have turned to it to encrypt data.
And it could represent the next front in the semiconductor trade war between the United States and China.
The technology is RISC-V, pronounced "risk five." It evolved from a university computer lab in California to a foundation for myriad chips that handle computing chores. RISC-V essentially provides a kind of common language for designing processors that are found in devices like smartphones, disk drives, Wi-Fi routers and tablets.
RISC-V has ignited a new debate in Washington in recent months about how far the United States can or should go as it steadily expands restrictions on exporting technology to China that could help advance its military. That's because RISC-V, which can be downloaded from the internet for free, has become a central tool for Chinese companies and government institutions hoping to match U.S. prowess in designing semiconductors.
Last month, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party -- in an effort spearheaded by Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin -- recommended that an interagency government committee study potential risks of RISC-V. Congressional aides have met with members of the Biden administration about the technology, and lawmakers and their aides have discussed extending restrictions to stop U.S. citizens from aiding China on RISC-V, according to congressional staff members.
The Chinese Communist Party is "already attempting to use RISC-V's design architecture to undermine our export controls," Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on the House select committee, said in a statement. He added that RISC-V's participants should be focused on advancing technology and "not the geopolitical interests of the Chinese Communist Party."
Arm Holdings, a British company that sells competing chip technology, has also lobbied officials to consider restrictions on RISC-V, three people with knowledge of the situation said. Biden administration officials have concerns about China's use of RISC-V but are wary about potential complications with trying to regulate the technology, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Department of Commerce and the National Security Council declined to comment.
The debate over RISC-V is complicated because the technology was patterned after open-source software, the free programs like Linux that allow any developer to view and modify the original code used to make them. Such programs have prompted multiple competitors to innovate and reduce the market power of any single vendor.
But RISC-V is not code that can directly be used to make anything. It is a set of basic computing instructions that determine the calculations a chip can perform. Engineers can download these instructions and incorporate them in the much more complex task of creating design blueprints for parts of a semiconductor. Many companies sell RISC-V chip designs, and some universities and other institutions distribute them free.
As with Linux -- but not technologies from companies like Arm and Intel -- engineers around the world can make suggestions to enhance the underlying instructions. That process is overseen by RISC-V International, a nonprofit with more than 4,000 members -- including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese firms like Huawei and Alibaba, as well as Google and Qualcomm -- in 70 countries.
The group changed its incorporation from the United States to Switzerland in 2020 to calm "concerns of political disruption" and control by any single country. Its leaders said their model mirrored that of other international groups that govern standard technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
"Open standards have been around for 100 years," Calista Redmond, chief executive of RISC-V International, said in an interview. "This is no different."
Open-source technologies have generally been granted exceptions to U.S. export controls. Any change to that treatment "is certainly going to raise thorny legal issues and important public policy concerns," said Daniel Pickard, a lawyer specializing in trade and national security at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.
U.S. regulations limit Arm and RISC-V companies from exporting chip designs to China based on certain performance limits. But trying to restrict the underlying instructions is like trying to control words or letters, Silicon Valley executives said.
"It is absolutely silly," said Dave Ditzel, the chief technology officer of Esperanto Technologies, a chip start-up that uses RISC-V. "It's like saying, 'Well, the Chinese can read a book on nuclear weapons that's written in English, so let's solve the problem by banning the English alphabet."'
As RISC-V helps Chinese firms including Huawei design more of the world's semiconductors, some U.S. officials have raised concerns that Beijing could use Chinese foundries to insert cyber vulnerabilities into chips that may be used to cripple American electrical grids and other critical infrastructure.
RISC-V backers counter that technologies with inner details that can be openly studied are much more secure. Any new restrictions, RISC-V backers said, would weaken U.S. influence over the technology while doing little to hold China back because the instruction set is already widely distributed.
The original inspiration for RISC-V was saving money. Starting in 2010, a professor and two graduate students began developing a new instruction set based on technology pioneered by David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who had helped invent reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. The aim was to help study the inner workings of computing without having to pay Arm, which charges royalties for every chip that uses its technology.
"I just wanted to learn how to build computers," said Yunsup Lee, one of the graduate students, who now works at SiFive, a start-up that sells RISC-V designs. Then the goal evolved "to benefit everybody in the world," he said.
The RISC-V variant swiftly attracted interest among engineers. Having a standard set of instructions can allow software programs to work on all chips that use them.
In China, engineers and officials were also quick to see the potential, viewing open-source technology as a way to become self-sufficient and counter risks like embargoes and supply interruptions, Ni Guangnan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote in an article about RISC-V in June.
In 2019, Mr. Patterson, who now works at Google, helped establish a RISC-V lab in Shenzhen, China, which was supported by an institute set up earlier by Berkeley and Tsinghua University in China. Representative Gallagher, in a video his committee released in November, expressed concerns about the professor's work and collaboration between the institute and organizations with links to Chinese military and intelligence activities.
Mr. Patterson declined to comment through a Google spokeswoman.
A U.C. Berkeley spokesman said that the university's work with the institute had been basic research that was unrestricted, and that the university was responding to requests for information from Congress.
More than 100 "significant" Chinese companies are designing chips with RISC-V today, as are at least 100 more start-ups, said Handel Jones, an analyst at International Business Strategies. Many of the applications are in fairly mundane consumer products, but engineers believe the technology will eventually take over some of the most demanding tasks.
Chinese aerospace scientists have proposed using RISC-V to develop high-performance spaceborne computers. Other Chinese companies and institutions are aiming to string together RISC-V processors to run bigger jobs in data centers, including A.I. applications.
At a RISC-V conference in Silicon Valley in November, T-Head, Alibaba's semiconductor subsidiary, discussed RISC-V designs that Sophgo, another Chinese company, used in a chip powering a large server deployed at Shandong University in China. It's the first instance of RISC-V technology's running a cloud-style computing service, the companies said.
"We just made a small step, but we put RISC-V on the starting line," David Chen, ecosystem director at Alibaba, said at the event.

SAN FRANCISCO — NASA has chosen the technology to help it land future spacecraft on unmapped planets. Meta uses the technology for artificial intelligence. Chinese engineers have turned to it to encrypt data.

Full text: The Biden administration said its second grant under a new program would help Microchip Technology expand its facilities in Oregon and Colorado.
The Biden administration on Thursday announced plans to provide $ 162 million in federal grants to Microchip Technology, an Arizona-based semiconductor company that supplies the automotive, defense and other industries.
The agreement is the second award announced under a new program intended to help ensure that American companies that rely on semiconductors have a stable supply. Last month, the Biden administration announced a $ 35 million grant for BAE Systems, a defense contractor.
The investment will enable Microchip to increase its production of semiconductors that are used in cars, airplanes, appliances, medical devices and military products. The administration said it expected the award to create more than 700 jobs in construction and manufacturing.
"Today's announcement with Microchip is a meaningful step in our efforts to bolster the supply chain for legacy semiconductors that are in everything from cars to washing machines to missiles," Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo said in a statement.
Microchip plans to use $ 90 million to modernize and expand a facility in Colorado Springs and $ 72 million to expand a facility in Gresham, Ore. The administration said the funding would help Microchip triple its output at the two sites and decrease the company's reliance on foreign facilities to help make its products.
The company's chips aren't cutting-edge but are key components of nearly every military and space program. Microchip is one of the largest suppliers of semiconductors to the defense industrial base and a part of the military's trusted foundry program. It also plays a crucial role in industries that are important for the national economy, U.S. officials said.
That role became more obvious during the pandemic, when a global chip shortage cast a spotlight on domestic suppliers like Microchip. With foreign chip factories shut down to help contain the virus, automakers and other companies scrambled to secure supplies. As a result, demand for Microchip's products surged.
Those shortages also helped motivate lawmakers to pull together a funding bill aimed at shoring up American manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign chips. The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act gave the Commerce Department $ 53 billion to invest in the semiconductor industry, including $ 39 billion for federal grants to encourage chip companies to set up U.S. facilities.
The Commerce Department is expected to begin announcing larger awards in the coming months for major chip fabrication facilities owned by companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC.
Microchip previously announced plans to increase its capacity in both Oregon and Colorado, but the government funding would be used to expand those enhancements and bring more production back to the United States, officials said. According to its filings, Microchip relies on outside facilities to make a significant proportion of its products -- roughly 63 percent of its net sales in 2023 -- a relatively common practice in the industry.
While attention has focused on ensuring that U.S. facilities can manufacture some of the world's most advanced chips, there are growing concerns about Chinese investments in less advanced semiconductors, also known as legacy chips, which help power cars, computers, missiles and dishwashers.
U.S. officials are questioning whether such investments could increase the United States' reliance on China or allow Chinese firms to undercut competitors. The Commerce Department has said it plans to begin a survey this month to identify how U.S. companies are getting their legacy chips and reduce security risks linked to China.
The deal announced Thursday is a nonbinding preliminary agreement. The Commerce Department will carry out due diligence on the project before reaching the award's final terms.
The department said it had received more than 570 statements of interest and more than 170 pre-applications, full applications and concept plans from companies and organizations interested in the funding.

Demand for Labor PersistsEven as Job Openings Dip
Employers in the United States posted 8.8 million job openings in November, a dip from October and the fewest since March 2021. But demand for workers is still strong.
A Labor Department report on Wednesday showed a drop in the number of job vacancies from 8.9 million in October. It said the number of people quitting their jobs -- a sign of confidence in the labor market -- fell to its lowest point since February 2021 and is now roughly at the level just before the pandemic nearly four years ago.
In November, job openings dropped by 128,000 in transportation, warehousing and utilities and by 78,000 at hotels and restaurants. The federal government reduced job openings by 58,000. Openings in construction rose by 43,000 and in retail by 42,000.
Job openings peaked at a record 12 million in March 2022. But they remain historically high: Before 2021, monthly job openings had never topped eight million.

TRAVEL
Canceled Flights in 2023Were Lowest in a Decade
U.S. flight cancellations in 2023 fell to the lowest rate in at least a decade, after a string of bumpy years for air travel, the Transportation Department said Wednesday.
There were 16.3 million U.S. flights in 2023 and a cancellation rate below 1.2 percent, the lowest since at least 2013, the department said.
It added that the rate from Dec. 17 through Jan. 1 was even better, at 0.8 percent, despite a record number of passengers. That was far below last holiday season's 8.2 percent cancellation rate, which included the Southwest Airlines meltdown that disrupted two million passengers and led to a record $ 140 million civil penalty.
"We've been pushing the airlines hard," Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on CNBC on Wednesday. "We've pressed them on realistic scheduling."

Intel Announces CreationOf Separate A.I. Company
Intel said on Wednesday that it was forming a new independent company around its artificial intelligence software efforts with backing from the digital-focused asset manager DigitalBridge Group and other investors.
Intel executives would not comment on the deal's value or whether it would retain a majority stake in the new venture. They said the new firm would have an independent board of directors and Intel would be a shareholder.
The new entity will not be publicly traded and will be called Articul8 AI (pronounced "Articulate A.I."), and Arun Subramaniyan, formerly vice president and general manager in Intel's data center and A.I. group, will become Articul8 AI's chief executive.
"We've been really trying to address the biggest gap in generative A.I. today," Mr. Subramaniyan said, adding, "Getting things into production and doing it safely and in a cost-sustainable way is really what is missing." REUTERS

Indiana Tech-Growth Plan Spurs Groundwater Battle: [National Desk]

Full text: The state is courting high-tech investments, but a new industrial park may lack enough water. Opponents say piping it from miles away might dry out residential wells.
When Indiana officials created a new industrial park to lure huge microchip firms to the state, they picked a nearly 10,000-acre site close to a booming metropolis, a major airport and a university research center.
But the area is missing one key ingredient to support the kinds of development the state wants to attract: access to the huge amounts of water that microchip makers might need.
Officials floated a plan to pipe in enormous volumes of water from an aquifer about 40 miles away. But the plan raised concerns about straining groundwater supplies at the source, prompting widespread calls to scrap the idea, at least until more studies can be carried out.
Last week, state officials said they would do just that, with Gov. Eric Holcomb and other leaders pledging to move on the project only after studies could be completed to ensure any withdrawals are sustainable.
"The data -- yet still to be gathered -- will drive any or all future decisions," Gov. Holcolmb said in a news release.
The fight in Indiana is an example of increased tension over water as urban growth, industrial demands and spotty regulation collide in communities that are putting increasing strain on their limited groundwater supplies. Overlying all of it is a changing climate and the potential for more erratic weather, including droughts like one that dried out the state in 2012.
Critics say the pipeline plan could cause some residential wells to run dry and overstress an aquifer that farmers rely on for irrigation, as well as possibly reduce flows in nearby rivers and streams. Supporters say initial tests show the aquifer has plenty of water, and that the new investments -- including a drug factory to make a rival medication to Ozempic, the diabetes and weight-loss drug -- would create jobs and boost the economy.
The debate has also exposed how the state's lack of groundwater regulation could lead to future problems in the region, which is trying to take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for chip research and development.
"We're not against economic development and growth, we just want to make sure our citizens in our area are protected and our precious resources are protected," said Indiana State Rep. Sharon Negele.
Indiana leaders have courted semiconductor firms in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan in hopes of turning the state into a microchip hub. But chip making requires huge amounts of water to prevent contamination.
The Central Indiana industrial park is in Lebanon, Ind., surrounded by corn and bean fields . Water is increasingly in demand there, not only from population growth in nearby Indianapolis, but also from a gravel-mining industry that uses significant amounts of water to cool stone during cutting and to keep dust at bay.
The plan from officials at a quasi-public economic development corporation would transport water from an aquifer under the Wabash River in Tippecanoe County to the new industrial park, which is in an area that lacks significant access to rivers and lakes or to ample groundwater.
Officials have said they may transfer as many as 100 million gallons a day, an amount that Rep. Negele called "shocking." By comparison, she said, the city of Lafayette, Ind., with its population of more than 71,000, uses 17 million gallons a day.
"The state appears to have pretty much targeted us, and they're using our money to fight us and steal the water," said Jeff Findley, a retired well driller who lives in Tippecanoe County and who is leading an opposition group against the project.
Indiana allows most groundwater users to pump as much as they want. Because many parts of the state have access to sufficient water, regulation largely comes only after a crisis hits, Rep. Negele said.
It's a pattern that exists across other states. This year, a New York Times investigation of groundwater regulations across the country found a patchwork of state and local rules so lax and outdated that, in many places, oversight is all but nonexistent. Groundwater is being dangerously depleted nationwide, The Times found, a problem that is being exacerbated by climate change.
Indiana regulators track major groundwater users by requiring them to register and self-report their annual withdrawals. But the state has relatively few monitoring wells to track groundwater levels, according to scientists. And responsibility for water issues is spread among several state agencies.
Land in Boone County is being prepared where the industrial park, called LEAP for Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace, would be situated.
Eli Lilly and Company announced plans to build two new $ 2.1 billion manufacturing sites there to make its weight-loss drug, as well as others. Lilly plans to draw its water from existing sources in Lebanon rather than rely on piping in water, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Potential chipmakers would require significantly more water. Indiana is still smarting from being passed over last year by Intel, which chose Ohio as the site of a $ 20 billion chip facility.
In November, after complaints about a lack of transparency at the economic development corporation, Gov. Holcomb shifted responsibility for a groundwater study to the Indiana Finance Authority. He also announced plans for a broader regional water study of north-central Indiana, as well as for installing new water monitoring devices.
The study will provide data "to gain a greater understanding of the amount of excess water that is truly available to support all the surrounding region's growth prior to any action being taken that could inadvertently jeopardize this needed resource," the governor said in a November news release.
His office did not respond to a request for comment. At a news conference last week, he said that "not one drip or drop of water will be piped until we know what volume is needed, not just for that region, but for a greater region throughout Indiana."
A spokesperson for the Indiana State Department of Natural Resources, which helps regulate groundwater, declined to comment aside from sending links to official websites showing the state's big water users and a brochure outlining groundwater rules. The state can restrict pumping during drought and if it determines an aquifer isn't recharging, according to the brochure.
Hydrologists say some aquifers can withstand extraordinarily large withdrawals because they recharge with rain and snowmelt. Also, some industrial users of groundwater return it to the watershed. But that wouldn't be the case for the water taken from Tippecanoe County, opponents say.
The aquifer there supports several large farmers of corn, soy, wheat, hay and other crops, which require irrigation because they are largely grown in sandy soils. Carly Sheets, whose husband farms in Granville, Ind., said officials carried out tests on one well during the summer irrigation season.
"For the first time ever, nearby residences experienced gravel in their filter, grit in their sinks and toilets, lowered water pressure and hydrogen sulfide odors," she wrote in an email, adding: "The state's solution to restore one depleted aquifer is to deplete another."
In early December, Tippecanoe County commissioners voted to support a nine-month moratorium on large withdrawals of groundwater from the area, a move designed to halt the project until legislators can act in next year's session. Rep. Negele, among others, intends to push for measures that would create a permitting process for big groundwater users.
Keith Cherkauer, a Purdue University professor of agricultural and biological engineering and the director of the Indiana Water Resources Research Center, said that, under normal circumstances, it is possible that the aquifer under the Wabash River could withstand huge withdrawals. But he worries about drought years.
Large withdrawals in times of drought could significantly draw down the river, he said, as well as cause the shallow wells of nearby homeowners to run dry. Most of the state's crops are rain-fed, he said, but irrigation generally has been on the rise since the 2012 drought.
"Since the state has no regulation and no permitting, there's nothing to stop another one and another one and another one," he said, referring to users who want to make huge withdrawals. "And, at some point, you break the aquifer."

Apple Can Resume Selling Watches, a Court Allows
Apple can, for now, resume sales of its flagship smartwatches, after a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday paused a government commission's import ban on the devices imposed in a patent dispute over its medical monitoring technology.
The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission, which had ruled that Apple had infringed on Irvine, Calif.-based Masimo's patents.
A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said. Ultimately, though, any financial hit for Apple is likely to be dwarfed by the bad publicity the lawsuit is generating, they said.
Masimo shares were down almost 4 percent following the decision, and Apple shares were largely flat.
The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Starting with its Series 6 model in 2020, Apple included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches.
Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.
Apple has countersued, calling Masimo's legal actions a "maneuver to clear a path" for its own competing smartwatch.
In a four-paragraph ruling on Wednesday, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple's motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. Reuters
TECHNOLOGY
Intel to Invest $ 25 Billion On Chip Factory in Israel
The semiconductor giant Intel confirmed on Wednesday that it would invest $ 25 billion to expand a chip factory in southern Israel after a $ 3.2 billion grant from the government, a major investment in a country at war.
Expanded operations at the existing manufacturing site in Kiryat Gat, northeast of Gaza, are set to begin by 2028 and last through at least 2035, and are expected to create thousands of jobs.
"The expansion plan for the Kiryat Gat site is an important part of Intel's efforts to foster a more resilient global supply chain," Intel said in a statement.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced a preliminary version of the deal during a cabinet meeting in June, calling the Intel investment the largest ever in Israel.
"This is an expression of great confidence in the Israeli economy and exactly reflects the strength of the free economy that we have built here, and the technological economy that we are developing here," Mr. Netanyahu said.
Intel, which employs 11,700 people in Israel, is the country's largest private employer. Over the last 50 years, it has built four development centers in Israel and invested more than $ 50 billion there, according to the company.
The investment is the latest sign that chipmakers are seeking to diversify their manufacturing globally amid a chip arms race. In August, Intel and Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli chip manufacturer, terminated a planned merger after China's antitrust regulators failed to rule on the transaction. YIWEN LU

Wall Street Closes Higher as Tech and Industrials Climb: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks notched more gains on Tuesday, as Wall Street kicked off what's expected to be a quiet, holiday-shortened week of trading.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent, finishing less than 0.5 percent below its all-time high set nearly two years ago. The benchmark index is coming off eight straight weekly gains, its longest winning streak since 2017.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite ended 0.5 percent higher.
Trading was relatively light as U.S. markets reopened following the Christmas Day holiday. Still, the latest gains were widespread, with advancers outnumbering decliners by nearly 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Technology and industrial stocks accounted for a big share of the gains. Intel climbed 5.2 percent for the biggest gain among S&P 500 stocks. Caterpillar added 1.8 percent.
Energy stocks climbed as the price of U.S. crude oil rose 2.7 percent. Hess closed 1.4 percent higher.
Solid gains by smaller company stocks also helped lift the market, pushing the Russell 2000 index 1.2 percent higher.
Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.90 percent.
Some stocks surged on company deal news. Drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb said Tuesday that it will acquire RayzeBio in a $ 4.1 billion deal, just days after buying Karuna Therapeutics for $ 14 billion. Bristol Myers shares fell 1.6 percent, while RayzeBio doubled to $ 61.40, close to the $ 62.50 that each share will fetch in its acquisition.
Shares in HollySys Automation Technologies jumped 5.2 percent after the company received an updated buyout offer from a consortium led by Dazheng Group Acquisition.
Stratasys vaulted 13 percent to $ 14.82 per share after Nano Dimension announced it has offered to pay $ 16.50 per share in cash for the maker of 3D printers. Stratasys rejected an earlier buyout bid from Nano Dimension in April.
Gracell Biotechnologies surged 60.3 percent after the Shanghai-based biopharmaceutical company agreed to be acquired by AstraZeneca.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 20.12 points to 4,774.75. The Dow gained 159.36 points to 37,545.33, and the Nasdaq added 81.60 points to 15,074.57.
With less than a week to go in 2024, the S&P 500 is now up more than 24 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 44 percent.
Investors have been encouraged by reports showing inflation is on the decline even as the economy appears stronger than expected.
The Federal Reserve is walking a tightrope, seeking to slow the economy enough through elevated interest rates to cool inflation, but not so much that it tips the nation into recession.
Traders are still largely betting the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at least 1.50 percentage points by the end of next year, according to data from CME Group. The federal funds rate is currently sitting within a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent at its highest level in more than two decades.
The Federal Reserve released projections earlier this month showing its typical policymaker expects to cut the federal funds rate several times next year, but likely by only half as much as what Wall Street is expecting.
But many see too much optimism over the pace of interest rate cuts early in the year, and that the big run for stocks since late October on anticipation of such support may be overdone.
This week is light on economic reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond issues its monthly manufacturing activity index on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Labor Department releases its weekly tally of unemployment benefit claims and the Commerce Department delivers its preliminary November snapshot of wholesale inventories.
European markets remained closed Tuesday.

Using Middlemen, Russia Evades Sanctions on Imported Technology: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, engineers at Convex, a Russian telecommunications company, needed to find American equipment to transmit data to the country's feared intelligence service. But no gear was flowing in after Western nations imposed sweeping new trade limits on Russia.
Convex's employees soon found a solution.
While Cisco, a U.S. tech provider, had halted sales to Russia on March 3, 2022, Convex's engineers easily obtained the Cisco gear they needed through an obscure Russian e-commerce site called Nag, which had gotten around international trade restrictions by buying the American equipment through a web of suppliers in China.
Convex engineers then visited the offices of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., in Yekaterinburg to install the gear that would help categorize and send data to the authorities. "Coordinate with the F.S.B. the placement of the Cisco Catalyst WS-C4948E switch," a Convex engineer wrote on March 23, 2022, according to a company communications log obtained by The New York Times.
In the 22 months since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has largely continued getting the technology it needs to keep its economy running. After export restrictions and corporate bans initially led to trade disruptions, Russian suppliers found loopholes and cultivated workarounds. Almost no piece of commercial hardware -- including basic telecom equipment, surveillance gear, microchips for advanced computing and weapons systems, and drones -- has been too hard to get.
Russian authorities and companies have united to take advantage of cracks in the global response. They have tapped webs of intermediaries, including middlemen in China, and disguised their activity through shell companies, according to leaked Russian government emails, trade documents and records of online conversations between Russian engineers obtained by The Times.
They have also turned to countries that have staked out neutral positions in the conflict, such as Morocco and Turkey, and used their ports to receive goods from global tech manufacturing centers that are then placed on other ships headed toward Russia, a process known as transshipment. The prohibited tech products were then made available to buy from well-known suppliers and on easy-to-use e-commerce sites like Nag.
Flexibility has been paramount. In weekly emails, Russian trade officials shared tips on which ports would transfer goods, who would trade in rubles and where Russian-flagged ships could be repaired, the documents show. If one supplier stopped selling, they found another. If a shipping route was cut off, new ones took up the slack.
The documents offer a rare glimpse of a race in which Russian traders have reliably stayed one step ahead of U.S.-led efforts to cut them off. Their success shows how difficult it is to stop the global movement of commercial technology, raising questions about the effectiveness of Western trade restrictions and whether tech giants should better control the destinations of their products -- and if it is even possible to do so.
Cisco declined to comment. Convex did not respond to requests for comment.
Understaffed government investigators in the United States and Europe cannot keep pace with the often shadowy flow of goods, said Elina Ribakova, an economist who has studied sanctions evasion at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a U.S. think tank. Major tech companies, she added, must do more to cut off supplies to Russia.
"It's an endless Whac-a-Mole game," she said. "There should be alarm, particularly among the policymakers, that we have announced a lot of sanctions and may believe they are working but in reality they are not."
A Beautiful Friendship
As sanctions against Russia took effect last year, ProSoft, a Moscow-based electronics provider, experienced the fallout.
Officials at the company, which sells biometric surveillance equipment and tech for heavy industry and critical infrastructure, emailed the Russian government trade mission in Morocco for help, according to a message reviewed by The Times.
"Just a week ago, it was not difficult to ship them to us from American and European suppliers," a ProSoft executive wrote, referring to now-banned tech. Now "we run the risk of starting to reduce production (there are small reserves in the warehouse)."
A spreadsheet attached to the message listed hundreds of American, European and Japanese microchips and sensors that ProSoft needed.
At the time, Russia's economy was absorbing the initial effects of trade restrictions. The ruble tumbled, inflation and interest rates soared, Russian banks were cut off from large swaths of the global financial system and oligarchs sat helpless as their yachts were seized.
But the pain did not last as President Vladimir V. Putin remade Russia's economy. Russian officials and executives swiftly teamed up to find workarounds. Political loyalists profited as Western companies fled.
In Morocco, Russia's trade office, which looks after the country's economic interests overseas, also helped Russian companies regain their footing. After ProSoft reached out for help, trade officials jumped into action.
"We're in constant contact with the general director" of Morocco's state-run port of Tanger Med, one Russian official wrote in an April 2022 email. "In the event of ships entering under the Russian flag, there will be no problems with maintenance."
A spokeswoman for Tanger Med, which hugs the Strait of Gibraltar, said the port leased space to shipping companies and had "no information nor responsibility" about vessels moving through the complex. The port, which handles more than eight million containers annually connecting to 180 international ports, was "not aware" of shipped goods calling at Russian ports before or after being at Tanger Med, or maintenance of Russian ships being performed, she added.
By November 2022, Russian trade officials in Morocco were bragging that their "direct support" had turned the African country into an electronics transshipment hub. Goods from Taiwan, China and other manufacturing centers were offloaded at Tanger Med and then placed on other ships headed to Russia.
"Given the long-term nature of the cooperation with the Moroccan partner, the volume of supplies could amount to about $ 10 million per year," the trade officials wrote about their work for ProSoft.
ProSoft also maintained supplies of Western tech with the help of an obscure scrap metal company registered in Casablanca, Morocco. After the war began, the company, Invent Maroc, set up a new website and routed restricted technology through Morocco to Russia, including microchips from Texas Instruments, Intel and NXP, according to trade data. In 2022, the United States had limited the export of semiconductors made with American equipment or intellectual property to Russia.
Invent Maroc, run by a man named Alexander Trinz, had no prior history of international exports. Yet it sourced electronics from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Japan and Mexico, according to trade records.
In a call this month, Mr. Trinz said he had supplied technology to Russia in the past, but not since the war. "Before, we worked with Russia, but in this moment we can't," he said.
An analysis of ProSoft's offerings found nearly 300 products for sale that contain Intel chips, as well as components made by Nvidia and an A.I. optimized computer chip designed by Google. Although it is unclear how the imports were ultimately used, American chips have been found on Russian missiles and drones, according to weapons experts.
Nvidia, Intel and Google declined to comment. Texas Instruments said it opposed "the illicit diversion of our products to Russia." ProSoft, NXP and Russia's trade representative to Morocco did not respond to requests for comment.
In October 2022, Russian trade officials said they had established 20 operators at the Tanger Med port to "promptly carry out" the logistics of getting cargo loaded onto "feeder" vessels ultimately bound for Russia, according to a weekly shipping report. Another report noted that ports in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, had accepted payment in rubles.
"The sanctions restrictions have been successfully overcome," one government report said of a Turkish trade route this March.
Click and Buy
On little-known Russian e-commerce sites like Nag, OCS Distribution, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom, complex technologies made by major American and European telecom manufacturers, such as Cisco, HP, Juniper, Ericsson and Nokia, are listed for sale.
Many of these sites freely sold Western technology for decades, but overhauled their supply chains because of the war. Since then, the platforms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in technology from China, according to trade records.
China and Hong Kong supplied 85 percent of semiconductors imported to Russia from March 2022 to September 2023, up from 27 percent before the conflict, according to the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit that studies Russian trade routes.
Nag, which sells hardware to regional telecoms and surveillance contractors, is one major platform. Through intermediaries, it has bought roughly $ 100 million in restricted American tech since the war began, according to trade data. In total, it imported $ 150 million in hardware from China this year, the data show. Communications gear, which has ostensibly been prohibited from reaching Russia, is readily available on its site, filtered by price, product type and quantity.
Nag employees have talked about logistical challenges that international sanctions have caused, according to internal communications. In May 2022, a Nag employee wrote to a Russian customer that "the old transit system has ended," delaying delivery of $ 20,000 of Juniper equipment. A month later, Nag followed up to say that the problem had been resolved and that the gear would arrive in the coming months.
Tech for building online surveillance and censorship was also available. Russian telecom operators are required by law to provide communications data about customers to the security services, meaning they must buy specialized equipment that sends the information to government agents. On Nag message boards, now accessible only from within Russia, engineers posted technical tips for making the systems work to F.S.B. specs.
Ericsson, Juniper, Nokia and IBM said any imports into Russia were done without their consent. OCS Distribution said that it "does not sell products in violation of international sanctions and restrictions" and that any such tech listed on its website for purchase was there because it was in the midst of an overhaul. HP, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom did not respond to requests for comment.
A network of Nag-operated companies and brands in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates has also helped obscure shipments of sanctioned technology. In total, Nag brought in almost $ 10 million in Cisco equipment and about $ 1 million in Nokia and Intel products to Russia over the past year.
At the F.S.B. offices in Yekaterinburg, the Cisco gear that Convex engineers installed sat alongside routers made by Juniper, according to Convex's records. Less than a year later, the availability of Western tech was so abundant that Convex's engineers could shop around.
In a conversation on Convex's internal messaging system this year, engineers focused on a new supplier that they had "spotted." Operating under the name sale-server.ru, the supplier had plenty of restricted name-brand technology from HP, IBM and others. More important, the price was right.
"Cheaper than Nag," one Convex employee wrote.

Full text: In designing warehouse-size data centers that behaved like a single computer, he changed the fabric of the internet.
When Google arrived in the late 1990s, hundreds of thousands of people were instantly captivated by its knack for taking them wherever they wanted to go on the internet. Developed by the company's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the algorithm that drove the site seemed to work like magic.
But as the internet search engine expanded its reach to billions of people over the next decade, it was driven by another major technological advance that was less discussed, though no less important: the redesign of Google's giant computer data centers.
Led by a Brazilian named Luiz Barroso, a small team of engineers rebuilt the warehouse-size centers so that they behaved like a single machine -- a technological shift that would change the way the entire internet was built, allowing any site to reach billions of people almost instantly and much more consistently.
Dr. Barroso, who changed the fabric of the internet, died on Sept. 16 at 59. His wife, Catherine Warner, said the cause was cardiac arrest. His death was not widely reported at the time.
Before the rise of Google, internet companies stuffed their data centers with increasingly powerful and expensive computer servers, as they struggled to reach more and more people. Each server delivered the website to a relatively small group of people. And if the server died, those people were out of luck.
But Google took a different tack. Working alongside Urs Hölzle, the company's first vice president of engineering, Dr. Barroso realized that the best way to distribute a wildly popular website like Google was to break it into tiny pieces and spread them evenly across an array of servers. Rather than each server delivering the site to a small group of people, the entire data center delivered the site to its entire audience.
"Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of internet service performance," he and Dr. Hölzle wrote in their seminal textbook, "The Datacenter as a Computer."
"In other words, we must treat the data center itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer."
The computer could deliver a website far more efficiently. And if one machine inside the data center died, the others could pick up the slack. Widespread outages became a rarity, especially as Dr. Barroso and his team expanded these ideas across multiple data centers. Eventually, Google's entire global network of data centers behaved as a single machine.
Luiz André Barroso was born on June 30, 1964, in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Fernando Luiz Barroso, was a surgeon. His mother, Maria Cecilia Bomfim Vellozo, was a professor of marketing.
After earning a bachelor's and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Pontifícia Universidade Católica in Rio de Janeiro, he enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, studying computer engineering. By the mid-1990s, he was working as a researcher in a San Francisco Bay Area lab operated by the Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the computer giants of the day.
There, he helped create multi-core computer chips -- microprocessors made of many chips working in tandem. A more efficient way of running computer software, such chips are now a vital part of almost any new computer.
But by the late 1990s, DEC was in decline. It made big, expensive computer servers using microprocessors based on the RISC architecture -- a dying method of building computer chips -- at a time when businesses were moving to lower-cost machines equipped with rival processors from chipmakers like Intel.
In 1998, DEC was acquired by computer maker Compaq. Four years later, Compaq merged with HP. And the leading engineers from DEC's two research labs -- Western Research Lab in Palo Alto, Calif., and the Systems Research Center two blocks away -- soon moved to Google. Dr. Barroso was among them.
These engineers were among the most talented in the field. They included software specialists like Jeff Dean, who is now among those leading Google's A.I. lab, as well as hardware experts like Dr. Barroso. Together, they designed and built the underlying infrastructure that allowed Google to reach a global audience.
At first, Dr. Barroso worked on software. But as Dr. Hölzle realized that Google would also need to build its own hardware, he tapped Dr. Barroso to lead the effort. Over the next decade, as it pursued his warehouse-size computer, Google built its own servers, data storage equipment and networking hardware.
"Luiz was good at realizing what he did not yet know, and then acting on it," Dr. Hölzle said in an interview. "He was good at seeing what he needed to do in the future."
For years, this work was among Google's most closely guarded secrets. The company saw it as a competitive advantage. But by the 2010s, companies like Amazon and Facebook were following the example set by Dr. Barroso and his team. Soon, the world's leading computer makers were building and selling the same kind of low-cost hardware, allowing any internet company to build an online empire the way Google had.
In 2020, in honor of his data center work, Dr. Barroso received the Eckert-Mauchly Award, named for John Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly, who built one of the world's first computers in the 1940s. In March 2022, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother and three siblings.
Like many prominent engineers, Dr. Barroso was also a musician. He played his guitar nearly every day, both at home and at work, and he carried the instrument with him on every vacation, no matter how remote the destination. This year, he released an album called "Before Bossa," playing and singing alongside the Brazilian jazz musicians Zeca Assumpção and Sergio Reze.
Dr. Hölzle said that Dr. Barroso's music had been a vital part of his work at Google.
Inside the company, there are constant battles over what the future will look like, and Dr. Barroso could navigate these battles, Dr. Hölzle said, thanks to an endearing personality and his guitar.
"He used his guitar as a tool," he said. "It was a way of getting people to relax and look at their disagreements less as a battle and more as a meeting of humans."

New York Will Invest in Chip Research: [Correction]

Full text: The move is aimed at drawing $ 9 billion in corporate investment, as New York jockeys to host a new national semiconductor technology center.
Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced on Monday a plan to invest $ 1 billion to expand chip research activities in Albany, N.Y., as the state aims to continue as a global semiconductor center.
The plan is expected to create 700 new permanent jobs and retain thousands more, and includes the purchase of a new version of one of the world's most expensive and sophisticated manufacturing machines, along with the construction of a new building to house it.
At an event in Albany, Gov. Hochul positioned the investment as a national priority. "The Chinese are attempting to dominate this industry," she said. "We have no intention of letting that happen. "
The initiative should draw $ 9 billion in additional investments from chip-related companies, according to state officials. They expect it to boost New York's chances to be selected to host a new National Semiconductor Technology Center, a planned centerpiece of the research portion of federal money that Congress allocated in 2022 as part of the CHIPS Act.
"We're hoping that this level of investment will attract more investment from the U.S. CHIPS Act to make it even bigger," said Mukesh Khare, an IBM vice president who is general manager of its semiconductor operations.
Besides IBM, which has long conducted chip research in Albany, companies participating in the project include Micron Technology, Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron.
The focus of the effort is the Albany Nanotech Complex, a cluster of research buildings owned and operated by a state-affiliated nonprofit called NY CREATES. The state plans to spend about $ 500 million to build a new 50,000-square-foot clean room building.
A different building is needed to accommodate the next major advance in a technology called lithography, which projects patterns of circuitry on silicon wafers to make chips. Advances in such equipment are needed to create smaller transistors and other circuitry to boost the power of computers and other devices.
The most sophisticated chips are currently made using technology called extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography. The Dutch company ASML is the dominant supplier of the machines, which officials in the United States and the Netherlands have prevented from being sold to China as part of an effort to limit that country's progress in chip manufacturing.
Albany Nanotech has owned prototype EUV tools and currently operates a commercial version. Under the new plan, New York will invest $ 500 million to purchase a next-generation EUV system -- known by the phrase "High NA," for numerical aperture -- that will allow the center to develop much more advanced chips.
Besides permanent research jobs, state officials estimated that the Albany project would generate 500 to 600 temporary construction jobs over roughly two years.
Albany NanoTech won't be the first to use the High NA tool. Intel has ordered the first system from ASML, which is expected to begin installing it in early 2024. The comparable machine is expected to arrive in Albany in late 2025, Mr. Khare said.
The effort is unusual in several ways, including that the new machine will be owned by the state and operated as a public resource to help the broader U.S. semiconductor industry, he added.
States in the Northeast United States seem destined to play a big role in the chip industry's evolution. U.S. Commerce Department officials also said Monday that BAE Systems in New Hampshire will receive the first grant under the manufacturing portion of the CHIPS Act.
Micron, a Boise, Idaho, company that is the only American maker of chips used to store data, has also said it will spend up to $ 100 billion over a decade or more to develop a new manufacturing site near Syracuse, N.Y.

Military Supplier Awarded First CHIPS Act Grant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The award, which will go to BAE Systems, is part of a new government program aimed at creating a more secure supply of semiconductors.
The Biden administration announced on Monday that BAE Systems, a defense contractor, will receive the first federal grant from a new program aimed at shoring up American manufacturing of critical semiconductors.
The company is expected to receive a $ 35 million grant to quadruple its domestic production of a type of chip used in F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as satellites and other defense systems. The grant is intended to help ensure a more secure supply of a component that is critical for the United States and its allies.
The award is the first of several expected in the coming months, as the Commerce Department begins distributing the $ 39 billion in federal funding that Congress authorized under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The money is intended to incentivize the construction of chip factories in the United States and lure back a key type of manufacturing that has slipped offshore in recent decades.
The decision to select a defense contractor for the first award, rather than a commercial semiconductor facility, was meant to emphasize the administration's focus on national security, officials said.
At an event at BAE Systems in Nashua, N.H., Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that the United States had become "dangerously reliant" on a few countries in Asia for its chips, including technology that goes into military systems. Posters showing a pilotless drone, fighter pilots and a jet engine were displayed behind her.
"In order to defend our great country, we need to make the chips that go into military equipment in the United States of America, by Americans," Ms. Raimondo said. "And that's what this is about."
In the coming months, the Biden administration is expected to announce much larger grants for major semiconductor manufacturing facilities run by companies like Intel, Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC. Ms. Raimondo said that within the next year, the department would announce 10 or 12 grants to other companies, some of them worth several billions of dollars and other in the tens of millions.
Speaking after the event, Ms. Raimondo said that the commerce department had "purposefully" chosen a relatively small award as its first grant but said bigger sums to other firms would be announced next year. Awards for facilities that make the most advanced chips are likely to be announced in the first months of 2024, she said in an interview.
"Fundamentally, you'll see, all over the country, big expansions in semiconductor manufacturing and the supply chain," she said.
Semiconductors originated in the United States, but the country now manufactures only about a tenth of chips made globally. While American chip companies still design the world's most cutting-edge products, much of the world's manufacturing has migrated to Asia in recent decades as companies have sought lower costs.
Chips power not only computers and cars but also missiles, satellites and fighter jets, a reality that has prompted officials in Washington to deem the lack of domestic manufacturing capacity a serious national security vulnerability.
A global shortage of chips during the pandemic shuttered car factories and dented the U.S. economy, highlighting the risks of supply chains that are outside of America's control. The chip industry's high reliance on Taiwan, a geopolitical flashpoint, is also considered an untenable security threat given that China sees the island as a breakaway part of its territory and has talked of reclaiming it.
"When we talk about supply chain resilience, this investment is about shoring up that resilience and ensuring that the chips are delivered when our military needs them," said Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser.
The BAE chips that the program would help fund are produced in the United States, but administration officials said the money would allow the company to upgrade aging machinery and make the facility more efficient, ultimately halving the cost of the chips made at the factory.
BAE, partly through operations purchased from Lockheed Martin, specializes in chips called monolithic microwave integrated circuits that generate high-frequency radio signals and are used in electronic warfare and aircraft-to-aircraft communications.
The company's Nashua facility, which employs roughly 3,700 people, is part of the Pentagon's "trusted foundry" program, which produces chips for defense-related needs under tight security restrictions. BAE is a British arms and aerospace company; the award will go to its U.S. subsidiary.
Like other grants under the program, the funding would be doled out to the company over time, after the Commerce Department carries out due diligence on the project and as the company reaches certain milestones. The company has also promised to undertake work force training programs as part of the grant, including a program at the local community college.
The Biden administration is hoping to create a thriving U.S. chip industry, which would encompass the industry's most cutting-edge manufacturing and research, and factories pumping out older types of chips and various types of suppliers to make the chemicals and other raw materials that chip facilities need.
Part of the program's focus has been establishing a secure source of chips to feed into products needed by the American military. The supply chains that feed into weapons systems, fighter jets and other technology are opaque and complex. Chip industry executives say that some military contractors have surprisingly little understanding of where some of the semiconductors in their products come from. At least some of the chip supply chains that feed into American military goods run through China, where companies manufacture and test semiconductors.
Since the chips legislation was first introduced in early 2020, chips companies have announced more than $ 220 billion in new U.S. manufacturing facilities in hopes of winning some portion of the federal money. The law also offers a 25 percent tax credit for funds that chip companies spend on new U.S. factories.
The funding will be a test of the Biden administration's industrial policy and its ability to pick the most viable projects while ensuring that taxpayer money is not wasted. The Commerce Department has spun up a special team of roughly 200 people who are now reviewing company applications for the funds.
Tech experts expect the law to help reverse a three-decade-long decline in the U.S. share of global chip manufacturing, but it remains uncertain just how much of the industry the program can reclaim.
While the amount of money available under the new law is large in historical proportions, it could go fast. Chip factories are packed with some of the world's most advanced machinery and are thus incredibly expensive, with the most advanced facilities costing tens of billions of dollars each.
Industry executives say the cost of operating a chip factory and paying workers in the United States is higher than in many other parts of the world. East Asian countries are still offering lucrative subsidies for new chip facilities, as well as a large supply of skilled engineers and technicians.
Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of "Chip War," a history of the industry, said there was "clear evidence" of a major increase in investment across the semiconductor supply chain in the United States as a result of the law.
"I think the huge question that remains is how enduring will these investments be over time," he said. "Are they one-offs or will they be followed by second and third rounds for the companies involved?"

Full text: LITIGATION
$ 2.18 Billion Award In Patent Case Tossed Out
A U.S. appeals court on Monday threw out a $ 2.18 billion patent-infringement award won by the patent owner VLSI Technology against Intel, overturning one of the largest verdicts in the history of U.S. patent law.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the jury's 2021 verdict that Intel infringed one VLSI patent, and sent the case back to Texas for a new trial to determine how much Intel owes for infringing a second VLSI patent. An Intel spokesperson said the company was pleased with the ruling and will argue at the new damages trial that VLSI's patent is "of little value." VLSI has sued Intel in multiple U.S. courts, accusing it of infringing several patents covering semiconductor technology.
The Washington-based appeals court affirmed that Intel infringed another VLSI patent, but said that problems with the damages analysis justified a new trial to determine the proper award. Reuters
Banking
Banque Pictet Paying After Helping Tax Evasion
The Swiss private bank Banque Pictet has admitted to helping U.S. taxpayers hide more than $ 5.6 billion from the Internal Revenue Service and has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, federal prosecutors said on Monday. According to prosecutors, U.S. taxpayers with Pictet accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere evaded about $ 50.6 million in taxes between 2008 and 2014. As part of the agreement, Banque Pictet agreed to pay $ 122.9 million to the U.S. Treasury.
"This case should provide a clear message to others who try to hide their assets and income offshore," Jim Lee, the chief of the I.R.S.'s criminal investigation division, said in a statement.
Pictet will implement remedial measures and cooperate with the authorities' investigation. If it complies for three years, U.S. prosecutors will move to dismiss charges of conspiring to defraud the IRS. Reuters
Economy
Orders for Goods Tumbled In the U.S. in October
New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in October, marking the biggest monthly drop in roughly three and a half years, constrained by weakening demand for durable goods and transportation equipment, and bolstering the view that high interest rates are beginning to bite into spending.
Factory orders fell 3.6 percent, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Monday, the biggest monthly drop since April 2020.
The manufacturing sector, buoyed by a jump in spending on goods in the third quarter, is increasingly feeling the strain of higher interest rates and adds to signs the economy will more meaningfully slow in the fourth quarter.
The sector accounts for 11.1 percent of the economy.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Todd Haynes's latest, Natalie Portman is an actress studying the real-life model for her character, (Julianne Moore), a woman with a tabloid back story.
Much of Todd Haynes's sly, unnerving "May December" takes place in and around a picture-perfect home, that favorite movieland setting for American dreams turned nightmares. This one comes wrapped in a dappled, hazy light that blunts hard lines and brightens every face, so much so that characters sometimes look lit from within. Even the evening has an inviting velvetiness, as if all of life's shadows have been banished. In characteristic Haynes fashion, though, nothing is as it first seems in this shimmering Gothic, including the light that becomes more like a queasy, suffocating miasma.
"May December" is the story of two women and their worlds of lies. They meet when a TV actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), visits Gracie (Julianne Moore), the inspiration for her next role. Gracie lives in a large waterfront house in Savannah with her husband, Joe (Charles Melton), their teenage twins and two Irish setters. They have another kid in college, jobs they seem to enjoy and a complicated history that's summed up by the box Elizabeth finds at their front door, and which Gracie opens with a shrug of familiarity. It's feces, she explains coolly, and this isn't the first such package.
That box is a blunt metaphor for the ugliness at the core of "May December" -- years ago, Gracie became tabloid fodder after she was caught having sex with Joe when he was in seventh grade -- a setup that Haynes brilliantly complicates with his three knockout leads, great narrative dexterity and shocks of destabilizing humor that ease you into the story. The first time I watched the movie, I almost clapped my hand over my mouth during one absurd moment, unsure if I was supposed to be laughing this hard. Of course I was: Haynes is having fun, at least for a while, partly to play with our expectations about where the movie is headed.
A progenitor of the New Queer Cinema movement of the early 1990s, Haynes likes to dig into that space between the world that exists (or we believe exists) and the world of appearances. He's a virtuoso of paradoxes. That partly explains why he's drawn to the woman's film, with its focus on ordinary life, its domestic spaces, moral quandaries, political dimensions and tears. These films evoke what the critic Molly Haskell once described as "wet, wasted afternoons" and reveal what lies "beneath the sunny-side-up philosophy congealed in the happy ending." She might as well have been talking about this movie.
Written by Samy Burch -- it's her first produced screenplay -- "May December" is a woman's picture in a distinctly Haynesian key. As he has in some of his earlier films ("Far From Heaven," "Carol"), Haynes at once embraces and toys with genre conventions. He uses beautiful images (and people), bursts of lush music, pointed metaphors and floods of feeling to provide the familiar pleasures of a well-told, absorbing narrative film, even as he picks it apart at the seams. This can create an uneasy dissonance, and there are instances when it seems as if you're watching two overlaid movies: the original and its critique, a doubling that works nicely in "May December," which soon becomes a labyrinthine hall of mirrors.
Gracie's character is loosely based on Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who in 1997 was arrested for having sex with one of her sixth-grade students, abuse that started when he was 12. She pleaded guilty to child rape and eventually served time in prison, where she gave birth to their first two children. (They later married.) The case generated a predictable tsunami of grotesque media slavering and found putatively serious journalists referring (and continuing to refer) to the sexual assault as a "tryst" and "forbidden love," language that prettied up the crime as a passionate romance.
Gracie rationalizes her relationship with Joe on her own terms, which emerge as Elizabeth gathers intel. As Elizabeth plays detective -- she scans old tabloids, interviews family and friends -- she helpfully establishes the back story. Gracie isn't a teacher, and she and Joe met in a pet store, a seemingly incidental detail that takes on poignantly metaphoric resonance as the story unfolds. At one point, Elizabeth also accompanies Gracie and her daughter Mary (Elizabeth Yu) on a shopping trip. When the girl tries on a sleeveless dress, Gracie tells Mary she's "brave" for baring her arms and not caring about "unrealistic beauty standards." Mary looks crushed, Gracie oblivious and Elizabeth a bit stunned but oh-so fascinated.
At this stage in her process, Elizabeth has begun to imitate Gracie's gestures and expressions, a turn that Haynes expresses in the tricky shot that opens the shopping scene. As Mary tries on dresses, the women sit side-by-side facing the camera, two mirrors flanking them like drawn curtains. Because of the angles of the mirror, Elizabeth looks as if she's seated between Gracie and Gracie's reflection. It takes a beat to read the image and figure out why there are two Gracies, although as Elizabeth slips into character, suddenly there are three.
Moore and Portman's synced performances give the movie much of its weird comedy. Elizabeth guides you into the story, and you're tagging along when she pulls up to her Savannah digs and later to Gracie and Joe's home. Portman gives Elizabeth the studied agreeability of someone who has to work to present a friendly front, an effort that will be familiar to anyone who's ever interviewed a bored film star. Elizabeth is quick to smile, but Portman shows you the character's brittle affect, so that you see the flickers of hesitation in her eyes and twitches around her mouth. Mostly, you see that Elizabeth isn't a very good actress. (Presumably that's why when she tries out Gracie's lisping voice, she evokes Madeline Kahn.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Gracie doesn't need to put up a false front because her existence is nothing but a fully committed, melodramatically rich performance that Moore supplely delivers with alternating eerie calm and impressive histrionic mewling and caterwauling. Gracie has embraced her roles as a loving wife and doting mother, and seems to be living in a profound state of denial about what these roles have cost her husband and children, a lack of understanding (and remorse) that establishes the story's inaugural moral crisis. It's not at all clear, at first, if Gracie is lying to herself, blissfully self-unaware or just another garden-variety sociopath playing at the American dream, uncertainty that gives the story a frisson of mystery.
Gracie and Elizabeth dominate the first half of "May December." Then, almost imperceptibly, the focus shifts to Joe, and the story grows ever more serious, heavy and very, very sad. Moore and Portman are tremendous, but it's Melton's anguished performance that gives the movie its slow-building emotional power. A stunted man-child with a hulking, ponderous body, Joe too has multiple roles as a father and husband, an object of desire and exoticized other. Yet none fit as persuasively, and he's most at ease in the scenes of him with the Monarch butterflies he raises in little cages. It's a sweet pastime and a potentially blunt metaphor, one that Haynes handles with enormous, moving delicacy, never more so than when these beautiful creatures emerge from their chrysalises and Joe tenderly watches them take flight.

Debt Limit in Germany Is Likely to Be Overriden: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged financial support for economic modernization and Ukraine, but will need backing for new borrowing to fill a spending gap.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged lawmakers on Tuesday to override Germany's borrowing limits for a fourth consecutive year, allowing his government to take on billions of euros in fresh debt to modernize his country's economy despite a budget crisis triggered by a constitutional court ruling.
"It would be a grave, unforgivable mistake to neglect the modernization of our country in the face of all these acute challenges," Mr. Scholz told Parliament, citing persistently high energy prices and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
Afterward, a powerful leader of the opposition Christian Democrats signaled he may be willing to accept Mr. Scholz's plan, a sign that the fiscal crisis that has gripped Germany for two weeks and threatened to fracture the government's three-party coalition may begin to ease.
Germany's highest court on Nov. 15 threw out a special fund set up by the government that shifted credits approved in 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic to instead finance environmental projects and green technology. The court ruled that credits taken out in a given year for a specific purpose had to be spent within that time, and for the designated purpose.
That ruling opened up a 60 billion-euro, or $ 64.6 billion, hole in the budget and forced Mr. Scholz's government to find a new way to meet spending demands that have further strained the already fractious coalition between his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the fiscally conservative Free Democrats.
Lawmakers had planned before the court ruling to hold a vote on Friday to approve the coming year's budget. That plan has been postponed until the government can clarify spending for the current year. Mr. Scholz said his government would finalize a new spending plan for 2024 "as quickly as possible" and warned that it would include spending cuts.
For the current year, the government is now preparing to ask Parliament to approve about €45 billion, or $ 49 billion, in fresh debt for 2023. To justify this borrowing, a supplementary budget drawn up on Monday cited the spillover effects from the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But that will still leave a gap, making painful spending cuts of several billion euros necessary at a time when high energy prices, stubborn inflation and a slump in foreign trade is expected to hit the German economy.
One part of the budget that will not be affected by cuts in spending is support for Ukraine. Germany is the second-largest donor to Ukraine, after the United States, and Mr. Scholz has pledged to double Berlin's support to €8 billion next year.
This support was of "existential importance" for Kyiv and for Europe, Mr. Scholz said. "We will continue this support as long as necessary."
Other important spending commitments include billions in subsidies aimed at attracting new industries to Germany, such as the chipmakers Intel and TSMC. Both companies have planned factories in states in eastern Germany, lured in part by government subsidies financed by the fund that was struck down by the court ruling.
Governors for the two states where the chipmakers plan to build have expressed confidence that the subsidies will be fully funded, but the government has not yet clarified where the money would come from.
On Monday the economy minister and vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, heard from leaders of Germany's 16 states -- including several Christian Democrats -- who urged the government to maintain its spending commitments to projects aimed at attracting green industry and modernizing the economy to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.
Mr. Scholz needs parliamentary approval for two special funds to allow the government to borrow beyond the limit set in the constitution, which restricts annual borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product.
This borrowing limit can be exceeded only in cases of emergency, as happened when the economy came to a standstill at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, or to provide aide to a region hit by a natural disaster, as happened when severe flooding struck the Ahr valley in 2021.
Friedrich Merz, leader of the center-right Christian Democrats, the party that filed the legal challenge against the special funds approved by Mr. Scholz's government, indicated that his party would scrutinize the proposed fix, but did not appear likely to oppose it.
But he cautioned that his party, the leading opposition against Mr. Scholz's Social Democrats, would be less willing to support more emergency funds in the budget for the coming year.
"If the federal government is of the opinion that it should again have an extraordinary emergency situation in 2024, then I do not see this as constitutional," Mr. Merz said. "At least from today's perspective."

Amazon Q, Workplace A.I., Is Introduced: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon has been racing to shake off the perception that it is lagging in the push to take advantage of artificial intelligence.
OpenAI has ChatGPT. Google has the Bard chatbot. Microsoft has its Copilots. On Tuesday, Amazon joined the chatbot race and announced an artificial intelligence assistant of its own: Amazon Q.
The chatbot, developed by Amazon's cloud computing division, is focused on workplaces and not intended for consumers. Amazon Q aims to help employees with daily tasks, such as summarizing strategy documents, filling out internal support tickets and answering questions about company policy. It will compete with other corporate chatbots, including Copilot, Google's Duet AI and ChatGPT Enterprise.
"We think Q has the potential to become a work companion for millions and millions of people in their work life," Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of Amazon Web Services, said in an interview.
Amazon has been racing to shake off the perception that it is lagging behind in the A.I. competition. In the year since OpenAI released ChatGPT, Google, Microsoft and others have jumped into the frenzy by unveiling their own chatbots and investing heavily in A.I. development.
Amazon was quieter about its A.I. plans until more recently. In September, it announced that it would invest up to $ 4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems.
As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private.
Many companies "told me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns," he said.
In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.
Companies can also give Amazon Q permission to work with their corporate data that isn't on Amazon's servers, such as connecting with Slack and Gmail.
Unlike ChatGPT and Bard, Amazon Q is not built on a specific A.I. model. Instead, it uses an Amazon platform known as Bedrock, which connects several A.I. systems together, including Amazon's own Titan as well as ones developed by Anthropic and Meta.
The name Q is a play on the word "question," given the chatbot's conversational nature, Mr. Selipsky said. It is also a play on the character Q in the James Bond novels, who makes stealthy, helpful tools, and on a powerful "Star Trek" figure, he added.
Pricing for Amazon Q starts at $ 20 per user each month. Microsoft and Google both charge $ 30 a month for each user of the enterprise chatbots that work with their email and other productivity applications.
Amazon Q was one of a slew of announcements that the company made at its annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas. It also shared plans to beef up its computing infrastructure for A.I. And it expanded a longtime partnership with Nvidia, the dominant supplier of A.I. chips, including by building what the companies called the world's fastest A.I. supercomputer.
Most such systems use standard microprocessors along with specialized chips from Nvidia called GPUs, or graphics processing units. Instead, the system announced on Tuesday will be built with new Nvidia chips that include processor technology from Arm, the company whose technology powers most mobile phones.
The shift is a troubling sign for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, the dominant microprocessor suppliers. But it is positive news for Arm in its long-running effort to break into data center computers.

Germany Halts New Spending After Budget Crisis Gets Worse: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Latest
The German government said on Tuesday it would immediately halt all new spending as it grappled with how to plug a gap of tens of billions of euros following a court ruling that has triggered a budget crisis in Europe's largest economy.
The Constitutional Court, Germany's highest, ruled last week that Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government had acted improperly by taking money borrowed in 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic and shifting it to a new fund to finance environmental projects and green technology. The sum amounts to 60 billion euros, or $ 64.6 billion.
The ruling has not only undermined those environmental projects and investments, but has thrown the country's overall spending plans into disarray.
The court decision has also strained Mr. Scholz's three-way governing coalition, pitting the economy minister, a member of the Greens who favors spending to spur the economy, against the finance minister, from the more fiscally conservative Free Democrats.
What Is Affected: No funding pledges for next year.
The halt in new spending authorizations applies to all ministries. It also covers a special fund of about €200 billion that was set up to support companies in the aftermath of the pandemic and the energy crisis ignited by Russia's war in Ukraine.
"We are not talking about a shutdown like in the United States," said Christian Hasse, a budget expert for the center-right Christian Democrats. "But it means new commitments can't be made, except under exceptional circumstances."
The freeze will be in effect through Dec. 31, the Finance Ministry said.
Why It Matters: The "core substance" of the economy is at stake.
The economy minister, Robert Habeck, issued a dire warning of the ruling's impact, even as Mr. Scholz raced to work out a solution.
"The core substance of the German economy is at stake," Mr. Habeck said Monday in an interview with German public radio broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.
Economists warned on Tuesday that the ruling could dent economic growth next year. The German economy is already expected to contract in 2023, dragged down by flagging industrial production and high inflation.
"We are not yet able to see in detail what the impact of these fallouts could be, but it means that we will not be able to count on gross domestic product to grow next year," Michael Hüther, director of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research, told a parliamentary committee.
What's at Stake: Leaders warn investment is needed.
Among the spending commitments that could be threatened are billions in subsidies aimed at attracting new industries to Germany, such as the chipmakers Intel and TSMC.
The chancellor and Mr. Habeck have insisted that the ruling would not affect those commitments.
The pledges were made to help Germany transform its industrial sector from heavy industries to green technology, aimed at helping the country meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.
Background: Germany's controls on government debt.
In 2009, Germany imposed strong borrowing limits on itself. The so-called debt brake, written into its Constitution, restricts annual borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product, or roughly €12 billion a year. Exceptions are allowed in emergencies, including natural disasters or a pandemic. The court ruled that the €60 billion, borrowed during the pandemic, could not be used for purposes unrelated to the spread of Covid.
Germany is the only leading industrial economy to have such stringent controls.
What Happens Next: The 2024 budget is in question.
Lawmakers were expected to pass Germany's 2024 budget last week. But after the ruling effectively ripped a $ 64.6 billion hole in this year's spending plan, the talks were postponed pending a solution.
The coalition partners are aiming to reach a solution by the end of the week, Bloomberg News reported.

Economic Partners Go Separate Ways: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For more than a quarter century, the fortunes of the United States and China were fused in a uniquely monumental joint venture.
Americans treated China like the mother of all outlet stores, purchasing staggering quantities of low-priced factory goods. Major brands exploited China as the ultimate means of cutting costs, manufacturing their products in a land where wages are low and unions are banned.
As Chinese industry filled American homes with electronics and furniture, factory jobs lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese from poverty. China's leaders used the proceeds of the export juggernaut to buy trillions of dollars of U.S. government bonds, keeping America's borrowing costs low and allowing its spending bonanza to continue.
Here were two countries separated by the Pacific Ocean, one shaped by freewheeling capitalism, the other ruled by an authoritarian Communist Party, yet conjoined in an enterprise so consequential that the economic historian Niall Ferguson coined a term: Chimerica, shorthand for their "symbiotic economic relationship."
No one uses words like symbiotic today. In Washington, two political parties that agree on almost nothing are united in their depictions of China as a geopolitical rival and a mortal threat to middle-class security. In Beijing, leaders accuse the United States of plotting to deny China's rightful place as a superpower. As each country seeks to diminish its dependence on the other, businesses worldwide are adapting their supply chains.
Chimerica has yielded to a trade war, with both sides extending steep tariffs and curbs on critical exports -- from advanced technology to minerals used to make electric vehicles.
American companies are shifting factory production away from China to less politically risky venues. Chinese businesses are focused on trade with allies and neighbors, while seeking domestic suppliers for technology they are barred from buying from American companies.
Decades of American rhetoric that celebrated commerce as a wellspring of democratization in China have given way to resignation that the country's current leadership -- under President Xi Jinping -- is intent on crushing dissent at home and projecting military might abroad.
For Chinese leaders, the once-prevailing faith that economic integration would undergird peaceful relations has been relinquished to a muscular form of nationalism that is challenging a global order still dominated by the United States.
"In a perfect political world, these are two countries that are made in heaven, exactly because they are complementary," said Yasheng Huang, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. "Essentially, these two countries kind of got married without knowing one another's religions."
But divorce is not a practical option. The United States and China -- the world's two largest economies -- are intertwined. Chinese manufacturing has evolved from basic areas like footwear and apparel into advanced industries, including those central to efforts to limit the ravages of climate change. The United States remains the paramount consumer marketplace. Even as geopolitical tensions fray their ties, these two countries still depend on each other, their respective roles not easily replaced.
Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, even as it has been shifting some production to India. A Chinese brand, CATL, is the world's largest maker of electric car batteries, and Chinese companies dominate the refining of critical minerals like nickel used in such products. Chinese businesses make up more than three-fourths of the global supply chain for solar energy panels.
China is a leading source of sales for major global brands, from Hollywood studios and multinational automakers to manufacturers of construction equipment like Caterpillar and John Deere. Computer chip-makers like Intel, Micron and Qualcomm derive roughly two-thirds of their revenues from sales and licensing deals in China.
The powerful tug of those commercial entanglements will be in the background of planned discussions on Wednesday between Mr. Xi and President Biden. The meeting, at a global conference in San Francisco, would be their first in a year.
It was never going to last.
Still, the prospect that their political schism will endure is altering global supply chains. In place of relying on China as the factory floor to the world, businesses are increasingly exploring ways to diversify. Mexico and Central America are gaining investment as companies that sell to North America set up factories there.
Some trade and national security experts celebrate these shifts as an overdue adjustment to decades of growth propelled by a perilous codependency between the United States and China.
Beijing's purchases of American debt -- though steadily declining since 2012 -- kept borrowing costs low, but also encouraged investors to seek out greater returns. That led financial speculators to gorge on low-grade mortgages, delivering the global financial crisis of 2008, said Brad Setser, a former U.S. Treasury Department official and now an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"It was certainly a form of interdependence," Mr. Setser said. "But the notion that China saves and the U.S. spends, China lends and the U.S. borrows, and all is good because we are two sides of the same coin, we're complementary, that was never sustainable."
The pandemic brought home the risks of American reliance on Chinese factories to produce vital goods like masks and medical gowns, to say nothing of exercise bikes and smartphones, all of which became scarce. Chaos at ports and increases in shipping prices exposed the pitfalls of leaning on a single country on the other side of an ocean.
The Biden administration took the disruption and growing rivalry with China as impetus for an industrial policy aimed at encouraging American manufacturing and greater trade with allies -- especially in strategically vital industries like computer chips.
Yet economists caution that even a marginal shifting of factory production from China will entail higher costs for consumers while slowing global economic growth.
The share of American imports from China has dropped 5 percent since 2017. The goods imported from other countries are more expensive -- 10 percent more in the case of Vietnam, and 3 percent higher from Mexico, according to research by Laura Alfaro at Harvard Business School and Davin Chor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.
Though wages have risen in China, no other country possesses the depth and breadth of manufacturing capacity.
That did not happen by accident.
How China came to bet on trade.
Beginning in the late 1970s under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese government sought to rescue the country from its state of poverty and isolation by unleashing a series of market reforms. National wealth would be amassed by making products and selling them to the world. Officials courted foreign investment while building out infrastructure -- highways, ports, power plants.
The culmination came in 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization, winning global access for its exports in exchange for promising to open its own markets to foreign competitors.
American leaders championed China's inclusion in the global trading system as far more than an effort to sell Big Macs and bulldozers to the world's most populous nation.
"By joining the W.T.O., China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products," President Bill Clinton declared on the eve of a key congressional vote in 2000. "It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values: economic freedom."
Yet beneath such high-minded rhetoric, American brands pushed for greater access to China for the simple reason that its factories could turn out goods more cheaply than anywhere else.
"China makes products that working families can afford," said Clark A. Johnson, chief executive of the then-prominent chain Pier 1 Imports, as he represented the National Retail Federation during congressional testimony in 1998.
That formulation carried the day.
In the two decades after China became part of the W.T.O., American imports from China multiplied fivefold to $ 504 billion a year, according to census data.
Walmart, a company ruled by a zeal for low prices, opened a procurement center in the boomtown of Shenzhen. The company would gather hundreds of representatives from surrounding factories. They would sit in wooden chairs, sipping tea out of flimsy plastic cups, as they waited for hours to meet Walmart's buyers. The company could demand rock-bottom prices, aided by the implicit threat that if one factory balked, another could be summoned from inside the same waiting room.
Two years after China entered the W.T.O., Walmart was spending $ 15 billion on Chinese-made products, a sum that encompassed almost one-eighth of all of China's exports to the United States. A decade later, Walmart was importing $ 49 billion of Chinese goods into the United States, according to one analysis.
Gaining from this trade was virtually anyone walking into a store. Chinese imports effectively boosted the spending power of the average American household about 2 percent, or $ 1,500, a year from 2000 and 2007, according to one study. Chinese goods pressed down American prices 0.19 percent a year from 2004 to 2015, another study found.
The people left behind.
Those hurt by Chinese imports were concentrated and conspicuous. Once-thriving American factory towns sank into joblessness and despair, swapping restaurants and hardware stores for food banks and pawnshops.
From 1999 to 2011, a surge of low-priced Chinese imports eliminated nearly one million American manufacturing jobs and two million positions throughout the broader economy, according to a paper by the economists David H. Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson.
The resulting anger helped deliver Donald J. Trump to the White House. During his 2016 campaign, he vowed to unleash a trade war.
"We can't continue to allow China to rape our country," Mr. Trump said at a rally. "It's the greatest theft in the history of the world."
Such inflammatory characterizations collided with the reality that low-priced goods from China were an antidote to the rising cost of living. Still, Mr. Trump's accusations resonated in many working-class communities.
There was truth to the notion that Chinese industry was breaching the rules of international trade. The government lavished credit on the largest companies via loans from state-owned banks. Chinese industrial ventures could evade environmental and labor laws by sharing a cut of the profits with local officials. The Chinese market remained full of barriers to competition from foreign companies. Those that invested in China suffered brazen theft of intellectual property and rampant counterfeiting of their products.
Yet in many ways, the United States benefited from trade with China. Cheaper goods helped households cope with stagnating incomes while padding corporate coffers. The trouble was that most of the gains flowed to the shareholders of companies making products in China, while Washington failed to cushion those left behind.
A federal program called Trade Adjustment Assistance was supposed to compensate those rendered jobless by cheap imports, offering cash and training for other work. But Congress vastly underfunded the program. Fewer than one-third of those eligible for benefits in 2019 received help, according to an analysis of Department of Labor data.
In a triumph of simple political messaging over the complex accounting of trade, the public increasingly came to believe that Chinese industry was solely a predatory force -- that Americans "were just taken advantage of," said Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University and a former State Department official in the Biden administration. "We didn't do a good job of distributing the benefits, but they were nonetheless real."
Part of the change in American sentiment appeared to reflect bitterness over how engagement with China failed to deliver the promised political transformation.
The Chinese government used its trade winnings to expand its military capabilities, while menacing neighbors like the Philippines. It constructed an Orwellian surveillance apparatus, wielding it against the Uyghurs, an ethnic minority in the western region of Xinjiang.
American trade with China also failed to promote Beijing's promised market reforms. Instead, Mr. Xi's government has amplified the power of state-owned companies, while cracking down on the private sector.
For decades, foreign automakers were forced to team up with state-owned car companies as a way to get a crack at the Chinese market. Now, a fresh crop of Chinese companies is harnessing the know-how gleaned from those ventures to take markets from foreign automakers.
In the end, the engagement policy led to the moment at hand: a messy and bewildering process of disengagement.
The Biden administration argues that, by reducing dependence on Chinese industry, the American economy will become more resilient and less vulnerable to disruption in the face of shocks and conflict.
But many factory goods made in countries like Vietnam contain large volumes of parts and materials produced in China, according to research by Caroline Freund, an international trade expert at the University of California, San Diego.
As Chimerica dissolves, the world could end up with greater complexity in its supply chains -- more factories in more countries -- yet still reliant on critical components made largely in just one.
"You still depend on China, it's just that it takes more steps along the way," said Mr. Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations. "There's more places where things could go wrong."

The Rise and Fall of the World’s Most Successful Joint Venture

For more than a quarter century, the fortunes of the United States and China were fused in a uniquely monumental joint venture.
Americans treated China like the mother of all outlet stores, purchasing staggering quantities of low-priced factory goods. Major brands exploited China as the ultimate means of cutting costs, manufacturing their products in a land where wages are low and unions are banned.
As Chinese industry filled American homes with electronics and furniture, factory jobs lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese from poverty. China’s leaders used the proceeds of the export juggernaut to buy trillions of dollars of U.S. government bonds, keeping America’s borrowing costs low and allowing its spending bonanza to continue.
Here were two countries separated by the Pacific Ocean, one shaped by freewheeling capitalism, the other ruled by an authoritarian Communist Party, yet conjoined in an enterprise so consequential that economic historian Niall Ferguson coined a term: Chimerica, shorthand for their “symbiotic economic relationship.”
No one uses words like symbiotic today. In Washington, two political parties that agree on almost nothing are united in their depictions of China as a geopolitical rival and a mortal threat to middle-class security. In Beijing, leaders accuse the United States of plotting to deny China’s rightful place as a superpower. As each country seeks to diminish its dependence on the other, businesses worldwide are adapting their supply chains.
Chimerica has yielded to a trade war, with both sides extending steep tariffs and curbs on critical exports — from advanced technology to minerals used to make electric vehicles.
American companies are shifting factory production away from China to less politically risky venues. Chinese businesses are focused on trade with allies and neighbors, while seeking domestic suppliers for technology they are barred from buying from American companies.
Decades of American rhetoric that celebrated commerce as a wellspring of democratization in China have given way to resignation that the country’s current leadership — under President Xi Jinping — is intent on crushing dissent at home and projecting military might abroad.
For Chinese leaders, the once-prevailing faith that economic integration would undergird peaceful relations has been relinquished to a muscular form of nationalism that is challenging a global order still dominated by the United States.
“In a perfect political world, these are two countries that are made in heaven, exactly because they are complementary,” said Yasheng Huang, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. “Essentially, these two countries kind of got married without knowing one another’s religions.”
But divorce is not a practical option. The United States and China — the world’s two largest economies — are intertwined. Chinese manufacturing has evolved from basic areas such as footwear and apparel into advanced industries, including those central to efforts to limit the ravages of climate change. The United States remains the paramount consumer marketplace. Even as geopolitical tensions fray their ties, these two countries still depend on each other, their respective roles not easily replaced.
Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, even as it has been shifting some production to India. A Chinese brand, CATL, is the world’s largest maker of electric car batteries, and Chinese companies dominate the refining of critical minerals such as nickel used in such products. Chinese businesses make up more than three-fourths of the global supply chain for solar-energy panels.

New Critics of Argentina's Far Right: Fans of Taylor Swift and BTS: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Javier Milei wants to be Argentina's next president. But first he must get around legions of angry Taylor Swift and BTS fans.
Javier Milei, a far-right libertarian economist, has stayed aloft in Argentina's presidential campaign on the wings of the youth vote.
To win the runoff election this month, he will need to hold on to that key demographic, pollsters say. But now, a major hurdle stands in his way: Swifties.
Squadrons of Argentine fans of the pop star Taylor Swift have gotten political. They have trained their online sights on Mr. Milei and his rising libertarian party, framing them as a danger to Argentina, while Ms. Swift herself is preparing to arrive in Argentina next week for the launch of her Eras Tour outside North America.
"Milei=Trump," said one post from a group called Swifties Against Freedom Advances, which is the name of Mr. Milei's party.
After Mr. Milei placed second in Argentina's election last month, sending him to a runoff on Nov. 19, a group of 10 Argentine fans of Ms. Swift created the group and issued a news release calling on fellow fans to vote against Mr. Milei. They said they were inspired by Ms. Swift's past efforts to confront right-wing politicians in the United States.
"We cannot not fight after having heard and seen Taylor give everything so that the right doesn't win in her country," the group said in the statement. "As Taylor says, we have to be on the right side of history."
The two-page missive was viewed 1.5 million times on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, before it suspended the group's account without explanation, the group said.
In the statement, it called Mr. Milei's positions against legal abortion, his support for the loosening of gun laws and his proposals to overhaul public education and public health care as "a danger to democracy."
The statement also took aim at Mr. Milei's comments that criticized feminism, claimed a pay gap between men and women does not exist and referred to the atrocities committed by Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 as simply "excesses."
Mr. Milei, in response, has shrugged off the Swifties. "I'm not the far right," he told a radio station. "They can express what they want." His campaign declined to comment.
Ms. Swift, who will perform the first of a series of three sold-out shows in Buenos Aires on Thursday, has not commented publicly on the Argentine election.
The Swifties' criticism of Mr. Milei has shifted the conversation to his conservative social views and away from his drastic proposals to reverse Argentina's economic crisis, which include ditching the Argentine peso for the U.S. dollar and closing the country's central bank.
But it isn't just Swifties who are organizing against Mr. Milei. He and his running mate, Victoria Villarruel, are also contending with criticism from legions of loyal fans of another musical juggernaut, the K-pop band BTS. They are so active and organized on the internet that they have become known as the BTS Army.
Last week, the fury of that army was unleashed upon Ms. Villarruel after a series of her tweets denigrating the K-pop group resurfaced. In 2020, she likened the name BTS to a sexually transmitted disease. She also mocked the dyed pink and green hair of some members.
Those tweets prompted such a fierce response from BTS fans, accusing her of xenophobia, that a large BTS fan club in Argentina felt compelled to try to calm their fellow fans down. "The message that BTS always transmits is one of respect to oneself and everyone else," said a statement from the club, which has been viewed 1.9 million times, according to X.
Ms. Villarruel's only reaction online to the BTS blowback has been a post in which she called her S.T.D. post part of "funny chats" from "a thousand years ago."
Mr. Milei's political base is particularly reliant on young voters. One survey of 2,400 people in October showed that nearly 27 percent of his support came from people ages 17 to 25, versus less than 9 percent for Sergio Massa, the center-left economy minister who opposes Mr. Milei in the runoff. People under 29 account for 27 percent of all eligible voters in Argentina.
Many young voters said they see Mr. Milei, who has taken to wearing leather jackets and wielding a chain saw at his campaign events, as the "cool" outsider candidate who has also become a sort of online meme.
"The majority of people our age, from about 16 to 25, are voting for him," said Mateo Guevara, 21, a student who attended a Milei rally last month in Salta, a northern city. "He is a guy that came out of nowhere."
Mr. Milei and Mr. Massa appear to be headed toward a close contest. A poll published Friday by Atlas Intel showed that Mr. Milei had a lead of four percentage points, with a margin of error of two points.
Ms. Swift shunned politics for most of her career. But in 2018 she broke her silence to oppose the Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn in Ms. Swift's home state, Tennessee, helping to trigger a spike in young-voter registrations in the U.S. midterms that year.
Ms. Swift said she felt compelled to speak out against Ms. Blackburn, who was endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump, because the politician's record "appalls and terrifies me," including positions on equal pay for women, violence against women and gay rights. Ms. Blackburn wound up winning.
Ms. Swift's song "Only the Young," a rallying cry that describes young people as agents of change, was featured in an ad from Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, in a push to get out the vote in 2020.
And Ms. Swift's comments in a 2020 documentary, in which she said she had decided to publicly oppose Mr. Trump despite the risk to her career, have been circulating widely in Argentina in recent weeks.
BTS fans are their own political force, having most likely helped suppress turnout at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Okla., in 2020 by reserving seats and not showing up.
Outside the River Plate soccer stadium in Buenos Aires, where Ms. Swift will perform next week, a contingent of Swifties has been camping out to see the show. Many said they were not eager to mix politics with music.
"The reality of the United States is a very different reality than the one that we are living here," said Barbara Alcibiade, 22, a pastry chef. "It's true that a large percentage of fans may or may not follow certain ideals or the values that she represents, but that doesn't mean that represents everyone."
The Swifties behind the anti-Milei news release said they never claimed to speak for Ms. Swift or all her fans. "That's why we were very careful not to say that Taylor wouldn't vote for Javier Milei," said one member, Macarena, 29, who declined to give her last name because she said the group had received threats online.
But for Macarena and her friends, the parallels between Mr. Milei and Mr. Trump are clear.
"There isn't any Taylor statement that you can use to say that I'm going to vote for a candidate from the far right," she said.
At a K-pop dance school in Buenos Aires, BTS fans said the 2020 comments by Mr. Milei's running mate disparaging the group served only to reinforce their aversion to Mr. Milei.
"It was really upsetting because it's always the same thing, xenophobic attacks, treating them as if they're different," said Marcela Toyos, 36, a teacher, after dancing to the BTS hit "Mic Drop."
Macarena said she and her friends now have a WhatsApp group of 140 Swifties in Buenos Aires that is planning to put up posters opposing Mr. Milei outside Ms. Swift's concerts next week. The Swifties are also coordinating with smaller groups in other provinces, she said.
Ahead of Ms. Swift's arrival, the Buenos Aires Legislature voted Thursday to name Ms. Swift a guest of honor. The only officials to vote against the proposal were members of Mr. Milei's party.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Javier Milei, a far-right libertarian economist, has stayed aloft in Argentina’s presidential campaign on the wings of the youth vote.
To win the runoff election this month, he will need to hold on to that key demographic, pollsters say. But now, a major hurdle stands in his way: Swifties.
Squadrons of Argentine fans of pop star Taylor Swift have gotten political. They have trained their online sights on Milei and his rising libertarian party, framing them as a danger to Argentina, while Swift herself is preparing to arrive in Argentina next week for the launch of her Eras Tour outside North America.
“Milei=Trump,” said one post from a group called Swifties Against Freedom Advances, which is the name of Milei’s party.
After Milei placed second in Argentina’s election last month, sending him to a runoff on Nov. 19, a group of 10 Argentine fans of Swift created the group and issued a news release calling on fellow fans to vote against Milei. They said they were inspired by Swift’s past efforts to confront right-wing politicians in the United States.
“We cannot not fight after having heard and seen Taylor give everything so that the right doesn’t win in her country,” the group said in the statement. “As Taylor says, we have to be on the right side of history.”
The two-page missive was viewed 1.5 million times on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, before it suspended the group’s account without explanation, the group said.
In the statement, it called Milei’s positions against legal abortion, his support for the loosening of gun laws and his proposals to overhaul public education and public health care as “a danger to democracy.”
The statement also took aim at Milei’s comments that criticized feminism, claimed a pay gap between men and women does not exist and referred to the atrocities committed by Argentina’s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 as simply “excesses.”
Milei, in response, has shrugged off the Swifties. “I’m not the far right,” he told a radio station. “They can express what they want.” His campaign declined to comment.
Swift, who will perform the first of a series of three sold-out shows in Buenos Aires on Thursday, has not commented publicly on the Argentine election.
The Swifties’ criticism of Milei has shifted the conversation to his conservative social views and away from his drastic proposals to reverse Argentina’s economic crisis, which include ditching the Argentine peso for the U.S. dollar and closing the country’s central bank.
But it isn’t just Swifties who are organizing against Milei. He and his running mate, Victoria Villarruel, are also contending with criticism from legions of loyal fans of another musical juggernaut, the K-pop band BTS. They are so active and organized on the internet that they have become known as the BTS Army.
Last week, the fury of that army was unleashed upon Villarruel after a series of her tweets denigrating the K-pop group resurfaced. In 2020, she likened the name BTS to a sexually transmitted disease. She also mocked the dyed pink and green hair of some members.
Those tweets prompted such a fierce response from BTS fans, accusing her of xenophobia, that a large BTS fan club in Argentina felt compelled to try to calm their fellow fans down. “The message that BTS always transmits is one of respect to oneself and everyone else,” said a statement from the club, which has been viewed 1.9 million times, according to X.
Villarruel’s only reaction online to the BTS blowback has been a post in which she called her STD post part of “funny chats” from “a thousand years ago.”
Milei’s political base is particularly reliant on young voters. One survey of 2,400 people in October showed that nearly 27% of his support came from people ages 17 to 25, versus less than 9% for Sergio Massa, the center-left economy minister who opposes Milei in the runoff. People under 29 account for 27% of all eligible voters in Argentina.
Many young voters said they see Milei, who has taken to wearing leather jackets and wielding a chain saw at his campaign events, as the “cool” outsider candidate who has also become a sort of online meme.
“The majority of people our age, from about 16 to 25, are voting for him,” said Mateo Guevara, 21, a student who attended a Milei rally last month in Salta, a northern city. “He is a guy that came out of nowhere.”
Milei and Massa appear to be headed toward a close contest. A poll published Friday by Atlas Intel showed that Milei had a lead of 4 percentage points, with a margin of error of 2 points.
Swift shunned politics for most of her career. But in 2018 she broke her silence to oppose Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn in Swift’s home state, Tennessee, helping to trigger a spike in young-voter registrations in the U.S. midterms that year.
Swift said she felt compelled to speak out against Blackburn, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, because the politician’s record “appalls and terrifies me,” including positions on equal pay for women, violence against women and gay rights. Blackburn wound up winning.
Swift’s song “Only the Young,” a rallying cry that describes young people as agents of change, was featured in an ad from Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., in a push to get out the vote in 2020.
And Swift’s comments in a 2020 documentary, in which she said she had decided to publicly oppose Trump despite the risk to her career, have been circulating widely in Argentina in recent weeks.
BTS fans are their own political force, having most likely helped suppress turnout at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2020 by reserving seats and not showing up.

The Swifties behind the anti-Milei news release said they never claimed to speak for Swift or all her fans. “That’s why we were very careful not to say that Taylor wouldn’t vote for Javier Milei,” said one member, Macarena, 29, who declined to give her last name because she said the group had received threats online.

Markets Fall as Big Companies Show Disappointing Earnings: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street slipping Friday following the latest batch of corporate earnings and some mixed readings on the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 was 0.6 percent lower in afternoon trading, coming off its ninth loss in 11 days and its lowest level in five months. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 339 points, or 1 percent, as of 1:56 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2 percent higher.
Stocks have struggled recently for a couple reasons: Several Big Tech stocks tanked following profit reports for the summer, and rising Treasury yields in the bond market tightened their vise on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 has slumped about 4 percent in October raising concerns about where the market may be headed in the final months of 2023.
"What you have is an oversold market, by any metric," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. "That typically leads to a significant rally, but the question is, does that bring you to the end of the year."
The market got some relief after Amazon rose 6.2 percent following its profit report. Both its profit and revenue for the summer were better than expected. As one of the most massive companies on Wall Street, Amazon's stock movements carry huge weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.
It's one of the "Magnificent Seven" Big Tech stocks that was responsible for much of the stock market's climb early this year. But those huge gains also meant big expectations built for them, and Alphabet, Meta and Tesla all fell sharply following their latest reports.
Intel, which is outside the Magnificent Seven, was also helping to support the market. It rose 9.1 percent after reporting much stronger profit for the summer than analysts expected.
Big Tech stocks have faced an additional challenge as Treasury yields have soared since the summer. When bonds are paying more in interest, prices for most investments fall because investors suddenly have more alternatives for their dollars. Among the hardest hit are stocks seen as the most expensive or requiring their investors to wait the longest for big growth.
That tends to hurt stocks in Big Tech, biotechnology and other high-growth areas in particular.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury was ticking higher Friday following a suite of data on the U.S. economy. It rose to 4.84 percent from 4.84 percent late Thursday.
Several big companies slipped after reporting disappointing earnings for their latest quarters. Exxon Mobil fell 1.4 percent after reporting a bigger drop in profits than Wall Street expected. Chevron fell 6 percent after also falling short of analysts' profit forecasts.
Ford stumbled 11.5 percent after reporting disappointing earnings and revenue a day after it reached a tentative contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.
The market has been unforgiving when it comes to the latest round of corporate earnings, though they have mostly been solid, said Krosby. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings growth of about 2.4 percent overall for companies in the S&P 500.
"This market has been looking at every single component of what companies are saying," Krosby said. "You could see this is a market that is very careful about rewarding companies."
A report showed that the measure of inflation preferred by the Federal Reserve remained high last month, but within economists' expectations. It also showed spending by U.S. consumers was stronger than expected, even though growth in their incomes fell short of forecasts.
A separate report said that U.S. consumers' expectations for inflation in the coming year are rising, up to 4.2 percent from 3.2 percent last month. That's particularly concerning for the Federal Reserve, which fears such expectations could lead to a vicious cycle that worsens high inflation.

Summit Chief Is Out After Criticizing Israel: [National Desk]

Full text: Paddy Cosgrave, the C.E.O. of the tech conference, said he would resign as Alphabet, Meta and Intel joined other companies pulling out of a show next month.
The chief executive of Web Summit, one of Europe's biggest technology conferences, stepped down on Saturday after major sponsors and speakers withdrew from the event, set for next month, following backlash over his public criticism of Israel's response to the Hamas attacks.
Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit in 2009, announced his resignation after companies including Google, Intel, Meta, Siemens and the payments giant Stripe -- many of whom were set to have executives speak at the event -- said they were no longer coming.
"Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event, and our team, our sponsors, our start-ups and the people who attend," he said in a statement. "I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused."
A spokeswoman for Web Summit said that the organization aimed to appoint a new chief executive as soon as possible. The event, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 13, is still set to go forward.
Mr. Cosgrave's move was meant to insulate Web Summit, which runs events across the globe. Its flagship conference, which is now held in Lisbon, drew about 70,000 attendees last year and speakers that included both senior tech executives and celebrities.
Since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, business leaders have taken aim at institutions that they said have been associated with unfair criticisms of Israel, or worse. In the United States, wealthy donors have threatened to withhold donations to schools like the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.
Web Summit's troubles began just over a week after Mr. Cosgrave criticized Western leaders and governments for supporting Israel as it responded to the Hamas raid. "War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are," he wrote on X on Oct. 13.
His comments drew rebukes from prominent technology executives, particularly those from Israel. "I'll never be part of your future initiatives and we'll never work together again," Adam Singolda, the Israeli-born founder of the advertising company Taboola, replied.
Within days of the post, venture capitalists, including Ravi Gupta of Sequoia Capital and Garry Tan of the technology incubator Y Combinator, said they were dropping out.
Some tech executives worked behind the scenes to pressure participants to withdraw. And a group of Israeli technology and venture capital firms wrote in a public letter that they were boycotting the event, according to the trade publication Calcalist.
Initially, Mr. Cosgrave alternately struck both apologetic and defensive tones, condemning the Hamas attacks but also repeating his criticism of Israel's military campaign. But by Tuesday, he published an apology on Web Summit's site in which he said he defended "Israel's right to exist and to defend itself."
That did not appear to allay Mr. Cosgrave's critics.
Starting midweek, tech giants announced that they would not be participating in the conference. And figures outside of technology who were initially listed as speakers at the event, including the actors Gillian Anderson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, were no longer mentioned on Web Summit's site as of Saturday.
Whether Mr. Cosgrave's departure is enough to bring back those who have withdrawn is unclear. Representatives for Intel and Deel, a global payroll company that pulled its sponsorship of Web Summit midweek, said there currently weren't plans to return.
Some critics also questioned on Saturday whether Mr. Cosgrave still retains his majority stake in Web Summit. His stake stood at 81 percent as of last summer, according to company filings in Ireland. A representative for Web Summit did not respond to requests for comment on his ownership.
It is unclear how many people will attend this year, though Web Summit said on Friday that the event expected about 70,000 people, the same as last year.

U.S. Adds Restrictions On Chips For China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The further limits on shipments could cripple Beijing's A.I. ambitions and dampen revenues for U.S. chip makers, analysts said.
The Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms, shoring up restrictions issued last October to limit China's progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
The rules appear likely to halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of artificial intelligence. More U.S. companies seeking to sell China advanced chips, or the machinery used to make them, will be required to notify the government of their plans, or obtain a special license.
To prevent the risk that advanced U.S. chips travel to China through third countries, the United States will also require chip makers to obtain licenses to ship to dozens of other countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
The Biden administration argues that China's access to such advanced technology is dangerous because it could aid the country's military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles, setting up advanced surveillance systems or cracking top-secret U.S. codes. Leading A.I. experts have warned that the technology, if not properly managed, could pose existential threats to humanity.
But artificial intelligence also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies that have been trying to develop A.I. chatbots like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China's economy, given that A.I. is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chip makers earn as much as a third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions.
U.S. officials said the rules would exempt chips that were purely for use in commercial applications, like smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles and gaming systems. Most of the rules will take effect in 30 days, though some will be effective sooner.
In a statement, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major chip makers, said it was evaluating the impact of the updated rules.
"We recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal," the group said. "Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere."
A spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company complied with all applicable regulations and that it did not expect a meaningful near-term effect on its financial results, given worldwide demand for Nvidia's products.
In a call with reporters on Monday, a senior administration official said that the United States had seen people try to work around the earlier rules, and that recent breakthroughs in generative A.I. had given regulators more insight into how the so-called large language models behind it were being developed and used.
Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the changes had been made "to ensure that these rules are as effective as possible" and that she expected the rules to be updated at least annually as technology advanced.
Referring to the People's Republic of China, she said, "The goal is the same goal that it's always been, which is to limit P.R.C. access to advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to P.R.C. military applications."
She added, "Controlling technology is more important than ever as it relates to national security."
The tougher rules could anger Chinese officials when the Biden administration is trying to improve relations and prepare for a potential meeting between President Biden and China's top leader, Xi Jinping, in California next month.
The Biden administration has been trying to counter China's growing mastery of many cutting-edge technologies by pumping money into new chip factories in the United States. It has simultaneously been trying to set tough but narrow restrictions on exports of technology to China that could have military uses, while allowing other trade to flow freely. U.S. officials describe the strategy as protecting American technology with "a small yard and high fence."
But determining which technologies really pose a threat to national security has been a contentious task. Major semiconductor companies have argued that overly restrictive trade bans can sap them of the revenue they need to invest in new plants and research facilities in the United States.
Some critics say the limits could also fuel China's efforts to develop alternative technologies, ultimately weakening U.S. influence globally. Chinese researchers have made significant progress in developing domestic versions of advanced chips, but experts say the country remains years behind Western capabilities.
The changes announced Tuesday appear to have particularly significant implications for Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom.
In response to the Biden administration's first major restrictions on artificial intelligence chips a year ago, Nvidia designed new chips, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market that worked at slower speeds but could still be used by Chinese firms to train A.I. models. A senior administration official said the new rules would restrict those sales.
Nvidia has said that China typically generates 20 percent to 25 percent of the company's data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable A.I. Analysts said that growing global demand for Nvidia chips for use in A.I. might allow the company to offset those losses by selling to other markets instead. But concerns about the impact of new performance limits on a wider set of Nvidia chips caused its stock price to fall more than 3 percent Tuesday.
The administration also placed two Chinese chip design companies and their subsidiaries -- units of Moore Threads Technology and Biren Technology -- on an "entity list" that requires U.S. companies to receive special permission before they can ship materials to them.
The United States also said it would create a new "gray list" that requires makers of certain less advanced chips to notify the government if they are selling them to China, Iran or other countries subject to a U.S. arms embargo.
"What strikes me is the significant expansion of countries to which exports will now require a license," said Emily Benson, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The rules did not appear to limit Chinese firms' access to foreign cloud services run by Amazon and Microsoft. The administration had considered clamping down on that business in recent months because Chinese firms had used such services as a kind of backdoor to access advanced artificial intelligence chips outside of China. But Ms. Benson said such a measure could come later in the form of an executive order.
In a note to clients last week, Julian Evans-Pritchard, the head of China economics at the research firm Capital Economics, said the effects of the controls would become more apparent as non-Chinese companies rolled out more advanced versions of their current products.
"The upshot is that China's ability to reach the technological frontier in the development of large-scale A.I. models will be hampered by U.S. export controls," Mr. Evans-Pritchard wrote. That could have broader implications for the Chinese economy, he added, since "we think A.I. has the potential to be a game changer for productivity growth over the next couple decades."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms, shoring up restrictions issued last October to limit China’s progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
The rules appear likely to halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of AI. More U.S. companies seeking to sell China advanced chips, or the machinery used to make them, will be required to notify the government of their plans, or obtain a special license.
To prevent the risk that advanced U.S. chips travel to China through third countries, the United States will also require chipmakers to obtain licenses to ship to dozens of other countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
The Biden administration argues that China’s access to such advanced technology is dangerous because it could aid the country’s military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles, setting up advanced surveillance systems or cracking top-secret U.S. codes.
Leading AI experts have warned that the technology, if not properly managed, could pose existential threats to humanity.
But AI also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, that have been trying to develop AI chatbots, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China’s economy, given that AI is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chipmakers earn as much as one-third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions.
U.S. officials said the rules would exempt chips that were purely for use in commercial applications, such as smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles and gaming systems. Most of the rules will take effect in 30 days, though some will be effective sooner.
In a statement, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major chipmakers, said it was evaluating the impact of the updated rules.
“We recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal,” the group said. “Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere.”
A spokesperson for Nvidia said the company complied with all applicable regulations and that it did not expect a meaningful near-term effect on its financial results, given worldwide demand for Nvidia’s products.
In a call with reporters Monday, a senior administration official said the United States had seen people try to work around the earlier rules, and that recent breakthroughs in generative AI had given regulators more insight into how the so-called large language models behind it were being developed and used.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the changes had been made “to ensure that these rules are as effective as possible,” and that she expected the rules to be updated at least annually as technology advanced.
Referring to the People’s Republic of China, she said, “The goal is the same goal that it’s always been, which is to limit PRC access to advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to PRC military applications.”
She added, “Controlling technology is more important than ever as it relates to national security.”
The tougher rules could anger Chinese officials when the Biden administration is trying to improve relations and prepare for a potential meeting between President Joe Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, in California next month.
The Biden administration has been trying to counter China’s growing mastery of many cutting-edge technologies by pumping money into new chip factories in the United States. It has simultaneously been trying to set tough but narrow restrictions on exports of technology to China that could have military uses, while allowing other trade to flow freely. U.S. officials describe the strategy as protecting American technology with “a small yard and high fence.”
But determining which technologies really pose a threat to national security has been a contentious task. Major semiconductor companies have argued that overly restrictive trade bans can sap them of the revenue they need to invest in new plants and research facilities in the United States.
Some critics say the limits could also fuel China’s efforts to develop alternative technologies, ultimately weakening U.S. influence globally. Chinese researchers have made significant progress in developing domestic versions of advanced chips, but experts say the country remains years behind Western capabilities.
The changes announced Tuesday appear to have particularly significant implications for Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom.
In response to the Biden administration’s first major restrictions on artificial intelligence chips a year ago, Nvidia designed new chips, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market that worked at slower speeds but could still be used by Chinese firms to train AI models. A senior administration official said the new rules would restrict those sales.
Nvidia has said that China typically generates 20% to 25% of the company’s data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable AI. Analysts said that growing global demand for Nvidia chips for use in AI might allow the company to offset those losses by selling to other markets instead. But concerns about the impact of new performance limits on a wider set of Nvidia chips caused its stock price to fall more than 3% Tuesday.
The administration also placed two Chinese chip design companies and their subsidiaries — units of Moore Threads Technology and Biren Technology — on an “entity list” that requires U.S. companies to receive special permission before they can ship materials to them.
The United States also said it would create a new “gray list” that requires makers of certain less advanced chips to notify the government if they are selling them to China, Iran or other countries subject to a U.S. arms embargo.
“What strikes me is the significant expansion of countries to which exports will now require a license,” said Emily Benson, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The rules did not appear to limit Chinese firms’ access to foreign cloud services run by Amazon and Microsoft. The administration had considered clamping down on that business in recent months because Chinese firms had used such services as a kind of backdoor to access advanced AI chips outside of China. But Benson said such a measure could come later in the form of an executive order.

“The upshot is that China’s ability to reach the technological frontier in the development of large-scale AI models will be hampered by U.S. export controls,” Evans-Pritchard wrote. That could have broader implications for the Chinese economy, he added, since “we think AI has the potential to be a game changer for productivity growth over the next couple decades.”

Big Chip Makers Push Back on Biden's Limits on Sale of Semiconductors to China: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm are campaigning to protect their businesses before further crackdowns on the sale of semiconductor technology to Beijing.
A year after the Biden administration took its first major step toward restricting the sale of semiconductors to China, it has begun drafting additional limits aimed at denying Beijing the technology critical to modern-day weapons.
But in recent months, its progress has been slowed as American chip companies have pushed back with a blunt warning: Cutting sales to China would gut their businesses and derail the administration's plan to build new semiconductor factories in the United States.
Since July, Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm, three of the world's largest chip makers, have pressed their case that cracking down on China would have unintended consequences. They have challenged the White House's national security wisdom in meetings with officials like Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, wooed think tanks and urged leaders across Washington to reconsider additional chip controls, according to interviews with two dozen officials across the government, industry and policy organizations.
The companies have warned that a U.S. pullback could accelerate China's development of an independent chip industry, paving the way to a world dominated by Chinese-created chips rather than American-designed chips.
"What you risk is spurring the development of an ecosystem that's led by competitors," said Tim Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, who has helped lead the lobbying campaign. "And that can have a very negative effect on the U.S. leadership in semiconductors, advanced technology and A.I."
The campaign has contributed to the delay of new restrictions and narrowed the list of changes that the administration may make, two people familiar with the process said. But spokespeople for the Commerce Department and the National Security Council, which lead the rule-making process, said the agencies were committed to protecting sensitive technology.
"The timing and scope of export control decisions are carefully designed to have the maximum impact," said Sarah Weinstein, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.
The push by the big chip companies has rankled some national security experts, lawmakers and semiconductor rivals. Many favor confronting Beijing and find it distasteful that the companies have questioned the White House shortly after the government committed $ 50 billion to the industry through the CHIPS and Science Act. The 2022 measure provides money to bolster American chip manufacturing and counter China.
Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of a select committee on U.S.-Chinese competition, has discussed holding a hearing with the chip companies to question their compliance with export controls, two people familiar with the conversations said.
A spokesman for Mr. Gallagher's office did not respond to requests for comment.
The warnings from the companies speak to the tension between national security concerns and commercial interests and highlight an unavoidable quandary for the Biden administration: The economic interdependence of the United States and China, which has roots stretching back decades, means that any action by Washington to confront Beijing risks causing harm at home.
China accounts for about a third of the global semiconductor market and more than $ 50 billion in combined annual revenue for Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm. The companies have cautioned that losing that revenue could force cuts in technology development, jobs and spending on semiconductor factories in Arizona, Ohio and New York.
Last year, the industry tacitly accepted the restrictions that the administration issued on Oct. 7, shortly after President Biden signed the CHIPS Act. Companies adjusted their businesses. Nvidia developed a version of its signature artificial intelligence chip, the H100, for China by reducing its performance power below the maximum levels that the rules allowed.
But losses associated with the restrictions mounted. China banned the sale of some products from Micron Technology, an American memory chip company. National security experts in Washington identified shortcomings with the limits. And administration officials started questioning whether Nvidia's chip for China contravened the spirit of the rules.
In July, industry executives were alarmed by talk that the administration was close to expanding its limits by banning Nvidia's sales of the A.I. chip it developed for Chinese use, among other changes. They worried that the administration could also target Nvidia's and Intel's sales to subsidiaries of Inspur Group, a Chinese conglomerate with military ties, and Qualcomm's sale of 4G mobile chips to the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, which it had a special permit to supply, two industry executives said.
That month, three chief executives -- Patrick Gelsinger of Intel, Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm -- traveled to Washington to meet with the administration.
During meetings with Mr. Blinken, Ms. Raimondo and Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden's national security adviser, the chief executives outlined the costs of losing access to China and warned that it could force spending cuts in the United States, Mr. Gelsinger said when recounting the meeting at a security conference in Aspen, Colo.
In conversations with White House officials, Intel officials also questioned whether National Security Council aides understood semiconductor technology, two sources familiar with the companies' activities said.
An Intel spokesman said that it was "absolutely untrue" that the company had questioned security officials.
The companies also pressed their trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, to issue a statement criticizing the government's restrictions as "broad, ambiguous and at times unilateral." It warned that further limits would harm "the industry's competitiveness."
When the statement was drafted, no members of the association spoke out against it, according to three people familiar with the process, but several members later said it had made them uneasy because of the Biden administration's support of the CHIPS Act.
The Semiconductor Industry Association declined to comment.
The companies broadened their campaign to target think tank researchers, as well. This summer, Mr. Huang met with the leaders of organizations including the security-focused Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Atlantic Council.
Nvidia's interest in think tanks raised some alarm, with word spreading across Washington that the company had questioned the research of Gregory C. Allen, the director of a center for advanced studies at C.S.I.S. who supports export restrictions, four of these people said.
Amid discussions between Nvidia and members of C.S.I.S.'s fund-raising staff, several people in policy circles, including Jason Matheny, the president of the RAND Corporation, called the center to voice concerns that Nvidia was trying to use its influence to sideline Mr. Allen, two people familiar with the calls said.
John Hamre, C.S.I.S.'s chief executive, assured Mr. Matheny and others that companies couldn't influence personnel decisions. In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Allen said, "He told me that he was proud of my contributions to C.S.I.S -- he had just promoted me only a few months earlier -- and had absolutely no intention to fire me now or in the future."
Eventually, Nvidia donated $ 65,000 to C.S.I.S., which amounted to less than 1 percent of annual donations, according to the think tank. It said Nvidia had not behaved "improperly."
Mr. Teter, Nvidia's general counsel, said the company had never taken issue with Mr. Allen's work. "We're confident he's presenting the best research he can, and we completely respect that," he said.
In addition to meeting with the White House, the chief executives met with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and chairman of Google.
Since stepping aside as executive chairman of Google in 2018, Mr. Schmidt has emerged as a power player in Washington, serving on two Defense Department advisory boards and funding his own think tank, the Special Competitive Studies Project. He also has supported limiting China's access to American-designed semiconductors.
In mid-July, Mr. Gelsinger, Mr. Amon and Mr. Huang talked to Mr. Schmidt about the pitfalls of chip limits, two people briefed on the conversation said. Representatives for Mr. Schmidt declined to comment.
Last month, Mr. Schmidt's think tank invited Mr. Gelsinger and Mr. Huang to give fireside chats at an annual conference in Washington on national security and technology. Neither executive fielded questions about semiconductor restrictions and China.

The Danger of Pulling Too Far Back From China: [Editorial]

Full text: Many Americans, even once-ardent proponents of globalization, have soured on trade with China. But there is a growing danger that as the United States tries to address its difficulties with China, it will pull back too far, severing economic ties that benefit American families and contribute to global peace and prosperity.
The relationship problems are real, and cannot be minimized. Chinese industrial subsidies, often maintained despite promises to the contrary, stripped millions of jobs from America's industrial heartland. Chinese companies flagrantly steal American innovations. China's increasingly confrontational posture toward the United States and its allies -- including the economic support it is providing for Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- have underscored the need for the United States to align trade policy more closely with other aspects of America's national interest. In an example of the prevailing mood in Washington, Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who serves as the chairman of the pointedly named "Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," recently called for broad prohibitions on U.S. investment in China, writing in an essay published in The Washington Post that "we are quite literally funding our own potential destruction."
A new rule book is needed. Too few leaders, however, appear willing to note that Americans also benefit from trade with China, that the two nations are economically intertwined whether they like it or not, and that it is in America's interest for the rest of the world to prosper. Americans bought almost $ 40 billion of Chinese toys, games and sports equipment last year. Soybean farmers in the Upper Midwest sold a record $ 16.4 billion of their beans to China, mostly for pig feed. Intel takes profits from low-end chips it makes and sells in China to fund the high-end chips it sells in America and to its allies. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have come out of poverty thanks to global trade, and have become consumers of U.S. goods and services. Cummins, an engine maker based in Indiana, operates 21 factories in China, and earns a fifth of its profits from its operations there. "Our success in China has led to global success and U.S. job growth," Jon Mills, a spokesman for the company, recently told the Times reporter Alexandra Stevenson.
Amid the harsh talk, the dollar value of American trade with China -- Americans buying Chinese products and the Chinese buying American products -- rose to a record in 2022. The goal of American policymakers ought to be safeguarding the vast majority of those trade flows while addressing the problems that have emerged.
The Biden administration's top priority in its dealings with China is, as it should be, national security. The president has emphasized the need to limit China's access to advanced technologies with military applications. An executive order recently signed by Mr. Biden that restricts American investment in Chinese firms that work on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum computing is a measured and necessary intervention. The government's push to provide subsidies for the domestic production of semiconductors is also a sensible policy. The United States needs to secure reliable access to critical materials.
Hawkish politicians from both parties and American companies that stand to gain from protectionist policies, however, are pushing for a broader retreat from trade with China. Donald Trump, whose dim view of trade helped to propel his successful presidential candidacy in 2016, and who is again the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, is promising to "tax China to build up America." After the Biden administration suspended tariffs on some Chinese solar panels to accelerate America's conversion to renewable energy, Senate Democrats and Republicans joined in a vote to reimpose the tariffs. "This vote was a simple choice: Do you stand with American manufacturers and American workers, or do you stand with China?" said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. Mr. Gallagher's committee, with bipartisan support, has been investigating whether U.S. financial giants like BlackRock and MSCI invested in blacklisted Chinese firms, a warning shot aimed at Wall Street.
The Biden administration describes its approach to trade limitations as "small yard, high fence," meaning that it is aiming to restrict China's access to a small number of advanced technologies. But some strictures on trade, notably the broad tariffs on Chinese imports first introduced by Mr. Trump and maintained by President Biden, already go too far, imposing costs on American households without much benefit to them or national security.
Keeping the yard from getting bigger is also likely to prove difficult. During Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's recent visit to China, the country's leading mobile phone manufacturer, Huawei, provocatively released a new smartphone powered by an advanced chip made in China most likely using American technology and machinery. A group of House Republicans sent a letter to the Biden administration citing the phone's release as evidence of the need for tighter restrictions on China's access to advanced chips. But China's ability to make serviceable smartphones does not threaten America's national security. Restraint is the best policy here. The United States has a legitimate interest in limiting China's access to military technology, not in preventing the Chinese from checking email.
And while high walls are sometimes essential, so too are broad bridges. It is important to create real penalties for bad behavior by China, but it is also important to reward good behavior. Just as in the United States, there is a debate inside China between trade hard-liners and reformers. America has natural allies among those in China who understand that Beijing has to change and can succeed by playing by the rules.
Defending trade is politically fraught in part because so many American leaders underestimated the impact of China's rise on American workers and failed to ensure that the benefits were broadly shared.
That failure has changed Americans' views of how our country relates to the rest of the world. A recent study reports that younger Americans are more skeptical than previous generations that trade is mutually beneficial for participating nations, part of a broader turn toward zero-sum thinking -- the belief that gains for one group tend to come at someone else's expense. The authors argue that the outlook of older generations was shaped by an era of higher growth, in which it seemed plausible that everyone's boat would rise. Younger generations, by contrast, have been embittered, and policymakers can rebuild support for trade only by addressing those past failures.
The United States can do that by pursuing economic relationships with the world that include protections for the environment and for workers. Other nations will continue to provide industrial subsidies, and the United States can use similar policies to develop new industries, like the renewable energy sector. "We're retaking control of our energy security and our energy future," Ali Zaidi, Mr. Biden's climate adviser, said in an interview with The Times's editorial board. At the same time, America should continue to pursue deeper economic ties with allied nations, as in a recent agreement to allow electric vehicle batteries made with minerals from Japan to qualify for U.S. tax credits.
American engagement with China is complicated by China's contradictions. The country remains eager for access to advanced technologies and global markets, but resists giving reciprocal access to its own markets. In recent months, even as China has ended pandemic restrictions and made a show of reopening its doors, it has made life difficult for foreign firms, with raids on corporate offices, for instance. Some measures, like the refusal of Chinese antitrust authorities to let the American chip maker Intel buy the Israeli chip maker Tower, appear to be responses to U.S. restrictions. But longstanding grievances remain unresolved. It has been 22 years since China promised to let Visa and Mastercard operate on equal terms, and 11 years since the W.T.O. ruled that China wasn't keeping that promise, yet the companies still are struggling for access.
The best reason for optimism is that the two nations still depend on each other. China's recent struggles -- slowing growth, an imploding housing sector, high youth unemployment and capital flight -- appear to be motivating a more open stance among Chinese policymakers. And after a period of escalating tensions, the Biden administration also has sought to calm the waters by sending a series of senior officials to the country. In recent years, Chinese airlines have largely refrained from placing new orders for Boeing airplanes, making a political point of buying jets from Airbus, its European rival. But Guillaume Faury, the Airbus chief executive, predicted in a recent interview that the trend would not continue. "I don't believe that China can rely on one aircraft manufacturer," he said. "They need competition." The first narrow-body jets produced by a Chinese company, Comac, entered commercial service earlier this year. The engines were manufactured in Durham, N.C.
The steadily rising trade between the United States and China from 1979 to the present has disrupted the lives of many Americans and caused real harm to some. That said, in the sweep of history those four decades were an era of remarkable peace between, and prosperity for, the two countries.
Some U.S. politicians want to take advantage of China's dependence to constrain its economic development by denying China the technologies that it needs. The better course is to focus on limiting the reach of China's military, not its economy as a whole. China sees that it cannot isolate itself from the world; this is not the time for the United States to do so, either.

Reversal in Britain Favors Microsoft-Activision Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Britain's antitrust regulator said the companies had addressed its main concerns about the $ 69 billion deal, though final approval is yet to come.
Microsoft came one step closer on Friday to completing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game maker Activision Blizzard, in a deal that has become an example of how a company can successfully ride out stricter regulatory scrutiny of the power of tech giants.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, the last remaining agency that must sign off before Microsoft can complete the acquisition, said the companies had taken action that "substantially addresses" remaining antitrust concerns. The regulator initially tried to block the deal, saying it would undercut competition, but reversed course after Microsoft agreed not to buy a part of Activision's business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry.
First announced in January 2022, the acquisition has been heavily scrutinized by antitrust officials around the world and held up as a test of whether regulators would approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry's power. The deal would upend the video game market, combining Microsoft's Xbox business with Activision, a publisher of such hit video games as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.
But Microsoft, with experience in thorny antitrust disputes going back to the 1990s, was able to navigate its way through stiff regulatory resistance on both sides of the Atlantic. In July, the company won a court battle against the Federal Trade Commission, which had tried to block the deal. The European Union, typically an aggressive regulator of American tech firms, cleared the deal in May.
"Microsoft was very strategic in its approach in how it played the whole process from beginning to end," said Ioannis Kokkoris, professor of competition law and economics at Queen Mary, University of London.
He said that it was incredibly rare for Britain's C.M.A. to reverse course and that the agency had faced a lot of pressure to approve the deal after it cleared hurdles in other jurisdictions.
"When you are the last man standing, you cannot realistically block a deal when the U.K. represents less that 5 percent of the global revenues," said Tommaso Valletti, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School who used to work on antitrust cases for the European Commission.
On Friday, British regulators said Microsoft had satisfied their concerns. The C.M.A. initially blocked the deal because, it said, a merger between the maker of a top-selling console with the publisher of hit games threatened to stunt the development of the emerging area of cloud gaming technology. Although still a very small market, the technology allows people to stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, diminishing the need for traditional consoles.
Microsoft agreed to transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher. The arrangement lasts for 15 years, a move seen as preventing Microsoft from releasing Activision games exclusively on its own streaming service.
"The C.M.A. considers that the restructured deal makes important changes that substantially address the concerns it set out in relation to the original transaction earlier this year," the agency said in a statement on Friday.
The regulator said it was now holding a "consultation" through Oct. 6 about the remedies Microsoft had proposed before making a final decision on whether to approve the deal.
"We are encouraged by this positive development in the C.M.A.'s review process," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with Microsoft toward completing the regulatory review process," Activision Blizzard said in a statement.
The companies have said they intend to close the deal by Oct. 18.
Government scrutiny of the tech industry's growing power shows no signs of slowing down. This month, a trial began over claims by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states that Google abused its power in the online search market. On Friday, E.U. regulators said they would reimpose a $ 400 million fine against Intel for abusing its power in the market for semiconductors. E.U. authorities are also investigating Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft for other anticompetitive business practices.
Mr. Kokkoris said Microsoft's mix of fighting in court and offering business concessions provided a playbook for other tech companies to follow when making large acquisitions.
"This is definitely going to make Big Tech more willing to continue deal making, but the companies know now that they will have to give up something more than they thought before this case," he said.
This week, Cisco agreed to buy the cybersecurity company Splunk for $ 28 billion. Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, is also getting closer to completing an acquisition of the software company VMware for $ 61 billion.

U.S. Sets Chip Fund Rules So China Doesn't Benefit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rules, which aim to prevent chip makers from using new U.S. subsidies to benefit China, take into account the industry's perspective.
The Biden administration on Friday issued final rules that would prohibit chip companies vying for a new infusion of federal cash from carrying out certain business expansions, partnerships and research in China, in what it described as an effort to protect United States national security.
The regulations come as the Biden administration prepares to disburse more than $ 52 billion in federal grants and tens of billions of dollars of tax credits to build up the U.S. chip industry. The new rules aim to prevent chip makers that benefit from U.S. grants from passing technology, business know-how or other benefits to China.
The final restrictions will prohibit firms that receive federal money from using it to construct chip factories outside the United States. They also restrict companies from significantly expanding semiconductor manufacturing in "foreign countries of concern" -- defined as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea -- for 10 years after receiving an award, the administration said.
The rules also prevent companies that receive funding from carrying out certain joint research projects in those countries, or licensing technology that would raise national security concerns to those countries.
If a company violated those guardrails, the Commerce Department said, the government could claw back the firm's entire award.
"These guardrails will protect our national security and help the United States stay ahead for decades to come," Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement.
The restrictions have been the subject of heavy lobbying from the chip industry, which collectively earns about one-third of its revenue from China. Chip makers in comments filed this year expressed concerns that overly restrictive measures could disrupt supply chains and hamper their global competitiveness.
Many of the rule's broad principles, like the 10-year limit on new investments in China, were outlined in the bipartisan legislation that authorized funding for the sector. But Commerce Department officials were responsible for writing the detailed provisions of the rule.
In its final rules issued Friday, the department appeared to take the perspective of chip makers and others into account. A comparison of the restrictions showed that the department had made several changes supported by chip makers, such as abolishing a specific dollar threshold for transactions that would expand chip companies' manufacturing capacity in China, Russia, North Korea or Iran. Under the proposed rule in March, the Commerce Department would have reviewed any transaction that expanded a company's semiconductor manufacturing capacity in such a "country of concern" valued at more than $ 100,000.
But companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company suggested that it would be more pragmatic for the department to monitor the physical expansion of the footprint of semiconductor factories, a standard that the commerce department adopted.
It remains to be seen if any of the changes will prompt a backlash from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have criticized the Biden administration as not being tough enough on Beijing and condemned a recent set of trips to China by top administration officials.
In an interview on Friday, Commerce Department officials said that they had received various requests from the industry to relax certain guidelines, but that they had maintained or even strengthened some provisions where necessary to protect national security.
One official added that the national security goal of the program was to have companies operating in the United States and doing so successfully, and that the department aimed to work with companies to ensure they were executing on U.S. grants.
"My sense is that they struck a reasonable balance between trying to be restrictive but also not trying to be draconian with the impact on existing facilities in China," said Chris Miller, the author of "Chip War" and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.

E.U. Hits Intel With $ 400 Million Antitrust Fine
European Union antitrust enforcers slapped Intel on Friday with a fresh $ 400 million fine in a long-running legal fight that the chipmaker appeared to have won last year.
The European Commission imposed the 376.4 million-euro fine after a court threw out an original 1.06 billion-euro penalty issued in 2009 over allegations that the Santa Clara, California-based company used illegal sales tactics to shut out smaller rival AMD.
The commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust watchdog, accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in the global market for x86 microprocessors with a strategy to exclude rivals by using rebates and sales restrictions.
The EU's General Court last year annulled the original decision, saying that the commission's analysis of the rebates didn't meet legal standards.

McDonalds to Raise Franchises's Royality Fees
McDonald's is raising royalty fees for new franchise restaurants in the United States and Canada for the first time in nearly three decades, according to a letter viewed by Reuters on Friday, bringing them on a par with what the company charges in other markets.
The fees are being increased to 5 percent from 4 percent starting Jan. 1, and will not affect franchises that are looking to rebuild or renovate existing locations or transfer an outlet to another party, the letter showed.
McDonald's sees slowing revenue growth for the rest of the year, as signs of easing inflation prompt it to lower menu prices, but Jim Sanderson, a Northcoast Research analyst, said the rate increase would have a "very limited" revenue impact because very few new stores are opening in the United States.

Shimano Recalls Bike Parts Over Crash Risk
Cycling company Shimano is recalling some 760,000 bike cranksets in the U.S. and Canada due to a crash hazard that has resulted in several reported injuries.
According to a Thursday notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the now-recalled crank parts can separate and break, risking crashes. More than 4,500 incidents of the cranksets separating and six injuries have been reported to date -- including bone fractures, joint displacement and lacerations.
The recall impacts Shimano Ultegra FC-6800, Dura-Ace FC-9000, Ultegra FC-R8000, Dura-Ace FC-R9100 and FC-R9100P 11-Speed Bonded Hollowtech Road Cranksets that were manufactured in Japan prior to July 2019.
The cranksets were sold both individually and on bicycles sold by other companies, including Trek and Specialized, regulators said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

G.O.P. Candidates Focus on China to Exhibit Foreign Policy Chops: [National Desk]

Full text: The 2024 hopefuls are rolling out plans to counter Beijing, criticizing President Biden while largely sidestepping topics more divisive among Republican voters.
Republican presidential hopefuls eager to demonstrate their foreign policy credentials on the campaign trail have homed in on China, a topic that allows them to assail President Biden while focusing less on global issues more divisive with primary voters.
While the candidates are in near-unanimous agreement that Beijing is the United States' foremost foreign adversary, their remarks and policy prescriptions reveal significant divides within their party on how to approach it.
Former Vice President Mike Pence used a China-focused speech on Monday at the Hudson Institute in Washington to criticize Donald J. Trump, his former running mate and the race's front-runner, and other competitors as being isolationist. Nikki Haley, who was one of Mr. Trump's ambassadors to the United Nations, has suggested he was not aggressive enough on China.
Vivek Ramaswamy, in a policy speech on Thursday at a packaging plant in New Albany, Ohio, attacked the protectionist trade policies that have been promoted by some in the party, including Mr. Trump.
Still, to a large extent, the Republican contenders have all raced to see who can be the most hawkish toward Beijing, following a path set by Mr. Trump in 2016 when he made attacking China a central policy plank and then sharply hardened America's trade policy toward the country. By focusing on China, the candidates can make detailed policy pronouncements and play up their credentials, yet avoid discussion of Russia or Ukraine, an increasingly divisive topic among Republicans.
All of the candidates have blasted President Biden's attitude toward China. Mr. Biden has sought to stabilize relations after escalating espionage accusations inflamed tensions. But he has also tried to counter Beijing's growing global influence with a multilateral approach, aiming to shore up economic and diplomatic ties with regional allies.
One of the Biden administration's focal points has been targeting China's semiconductor industry. The administration has enacted export controls and helped push the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that provided billions of dollars toward fostering a homegrown semiconductor industry that could make America less dependent on foreign suppliers.
But even that bipartisan effort has come in for criticism. On Thursday, as Mr. Ramaswamy stood miles away from the site of a new Intel chip manufacturing complex that will be assisted by the CHIPS Act, he attacked the law for including provisions related to addressing climate change.
"I am opposed to the CHIPS Act," he said, "because it is really the Green New Deal masquerading in CHIPS masquerade clothing."
He also claimed without evidence that China had propagated the "climate change agenda" in order to hamper American industry.
Mr. Ramaswamy also said he would focus on job training programs to develop a stronger work force for a robust chip industry. Doing so, he added, would make the United States less reliant on Taiwan, the world's biggest chip producer, and reduce the threat that a Chinese attack on Taiwan might pose on American interests.
Mr. Ramaswamy has previously suggested he would be less committed to defending Taiwan if the United States were less reliant on its semiconductors. That view, and his suggestion that Ukraine concede territory to Russia, have drawn fire from Mr. Pence and Ms. Haley.
In his speech on Monday, Mr. Pence, who emphasized his role in crafting the Trump administration's China policy, did not single out Mr. Ramaswamy. But he used the threat of Beijing as a lens through which he could posit his larger view of foreign policy: that America could not retrench from decades of global leadership.
He accused some candidates of "abandoning the traditional conservative position of American leadership on the world stage, and embracing a new and dangerous form of isolationism."
Mr. Pence also criticized President Biden over the U.S. military's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, suggesting it had shown weakness on the world stage to China. (The Biden administration has said it was constrained in its options for ending the nation's longest war by decisions made during the Trump-Pence administration.)
During his term, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on more than $ 360 billion worth of Chinese goods, initiating a protracted trade war that eased somewhat when the United States and China signed a trade deal in early 2020. Seeking the nomination, his talk on economic issues has been combative even as he has praised China's president, Xi Jinping, for his "iron fist" leadership.
He has vowed to "completely eliminate U.S. dependence on China," in part by reducing imports, restricting American companies' ability to invest there and revoking the "most favored nation" trade status.
Ms. Haley said earlier this year that she believed Mr. Trump had been so focused on trade that he ignored other Chinese threats.
At town halls in New Hampshire on Thursday, she warned that China was outpacing the United States in shipbuilding and developing "neuro-strike weapons" that she said could be engineered to change brain activity and be used to target military commanders and segments of the population.
China was more than just an economic rival, she suggested.
"They don't see us as a competitor," Ms. Haley said. "They see us as an enemy."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The performance of the British chip designer's shares signals that the I.P.O. market may revive after a very quiet year.
Call it Wall Street's Groundhog Day.
When shares of Arm, the British chip designer, began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday in the year's biggest initial public offering, investors, tech executives, bankers and start-up founders were watching closely for how it performed.
If Arm's stock fell, they knew the market for I.P.O.s was likely to stay frozen for longer. But a warm welcome for the shares would probably mean many more companies going public in the coming months, ending the cold streak.
They quickly got their answer: It was an early spring. Arm's shares opened trading at $ 56.10, up 10 percent from its initial offering price of $ 51. Shares quickly soared further, rising 25 percent by the end of trading to close at $ 63.59 and giving the company a fully diluted valuation of $ 67.9 billion.
That is positive news for listings from the grocery delivery start-up Instacart and the advertising tech company Klaviyo, which are expected to go public next week. It also provides a boost to the entire tech industry, which has been waiting for market conditions to improve for nearly two years.
"Offerings like this are often beacons to try to decipher what is the sentiment, overall, of this marketplace," said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Arm's debut may encourage other companies to tap the public markets, he said. "If you can break a logjam in one important corner of this private market, that tends to flow all the way down to the private capital providers."
Arm is the largest company to brave the public markets in 2023, a year that has been almost deathly quiet for I.P.O.s. The chip designer, which is owned by SoftBank, had priced its offering on Wednesday at $ 51 a share, raising $ 4.87 billion.
That stands out in a year that has been the worst for I.P.O.s since 2009, according to an analysis by EquityZen, a marketplace for private company stock. So far this year, 73 I.P.O.s in the United States -- including Arm -- have raised $ 14.8 billion, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks public offerings. That's a fraction of the listings during 2021, when 397 companies raised $ 142 billion.
There is a backlog of roughly 200 companies that should have gone public by now, according to an analysis by PitchBook, which tracks start-ups. The shoe company Birkenstock, owned by the private equity firm L Catterton, filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange this week.
"A lot of companies are exploring the market right now," Kyle Stanford, an analyst at PitchBook, said. "The demand is there."
Arm is a particularly interesting test of the public market because it provides an essential technology that is geopolitically and strategically coveted, which also means it faces challenges.
Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, the company sells blueprints of a part of a chip known as a processor core. Its customers include many of the world's largest tech companies, like Apple, Google, Samsung and Nvidia.
Arm's chip designs are primarily used in smartphones, but the company has pitched itself as able to ride the wave of artificial intelligence sweeping Silicon Valley. Many A.I. companies need the most advanced computer chips to do the sophisticated calculations required to develop the tech.
Arm has been the subject of much global interest, with Japan-based SoftBank buying the company for $ 32 billion in 2016. SoftBank, which needs a big win after years of deals that didn't live up to their promise, is set to retain a majority stake in Arm after the I.P.O.
In 2020, Nvidia reached a deal to buy Arm from SoftBank for $ 40 billion. But that plan collapsed 18 months later after opposition from regulators and customers.
On Thursday, Rene Haas, Arm's chief executive, rang the Nasdaq opening bell at the exchange's studio in New York's Times Square, along with Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank's chief financial officer, and other executives. Around 2,000 Arm employees in Cambridge, England, joined the festivities through a video feed.
In an interview, Mr. Haas said he was pleased that Arm's offering priced near the top of the proposed range but was more focused on the future.
"While today is an amazing day, I'm far, far more excited about the next five to 10 years," he said. Arm has been diversifying to place its technology in myriad other products equipped with some level of computing power, including cars, consumer products and data centers.
The company is not receiving any proceeds from the offering, since all shares were sold by SoftBank. Arm had more than $ 2 billion in cash and short-term investments to fund its activities as of the end of June.
SoftBank, which needed a big win from Arm after stumbles with other investments, had bought back Arm shares from investors a few weeks ago at a valuation of $ 64 billion.
In an interview with CNBC, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's chief executive, said he paid that price tag because of his confidence in Arm's future and that he expected the stock to have "good upside" over the long term.
He added that SoftBank was unlikely to sell more of its roughly 90 percent stake in the company. "Our intent is to hold as much as possible as long as possible," he said.
Investors remain cautious to skeptical about other tech companies -- such as Instacart and Klaviyo -- that are readying to go public, with expectations low.
Instacart, which kicked off its I.P.O. pitch meetings this week by setting a price range that valued the company at $ 8.6 billion to $ 9.3 billion, counting all outstanding shares, is set to be valued far below its onetime valuation of $ 39 billion in the private market. Klaviyo started its pitch meetings with a valuation range of $ 7.7 billion to $ 8.3 billion, slightly below its last private valuation of $ 9.5 billion.
To instill confidence in the public offerings, many of the companies have tried reassuring Wall Street that they are desirable investments. Before its offering, Arm said it had lined up $ 735 million of "stated interest" in buying its shares from companies it works with, including Nvidia, Google, Samsung, Apple and Intel.
Arm on Thursday did not disclose additional details concerning those investments, but Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said this week that its directors had approved an investment of up to $ 100 million in the offering.
Instacart made a similar move, selling $ 175 million of its I.P.O. shares to PepsiCo. Klaviyo also announced that it had secured the investment firms BlackRock and AllianceBernstein as "cornerstone" investors ahead of its offering. Trumpeting such commitments ahead of an I.P.O. is not as common in times when the market is flush, Mr. Hsu of Wharton said.
Arm, Klaviyo and Instacart have also drawn attention to their profits. Rising interest rates and inflation have made investors more risk-averse, with many shifting their priorities from fast-growing companies to those that can make money.
The profits contrast with the many cash-burning companies that went public in the boom times of 2021, which have since seen their stock prices plummet. Bird, a scooter company once worth $ 2.5 billion, has fallen to a valuation of $ 11 million. WeWork, the office sharing company that was valued at $ 40 billion on the private market, now trades at a market capitalization of around $ 270 million.

SoftBank, Needing a Win, Is Betting on Arm: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Softbank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, believes the chip design company he bought in 2016 is poised to reap the fruits of the A.I. revolution.
Masayoshi Son, the chief executive and billionaire founder of the tech conglomerate SoftBank, believed so strongly in Arm, the British chip design company he bought in 2016 for $ 32 billion, that he guaranteed some big investors they wouldn't lose money on the deal.
If anything, Mr. Son told those investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, he would be willing to pay them as much as double the acquisition price when they eventually exited, according to four people with knowledge of the negotiations, who requested anonymity to discuss a private arrangement.
Mr. Son recently made good on his guarantee, agreeing to buy out his fellow investors at a $ 64 billion valuation. But as Arm prepares for its initial public offering, one of the biggest in recent years, Mr. Son's conviction is being put to the test. The company, which designs chips used in cellphones, including all iPhones, is seeking a market value of $ 51 billion to $ 54 billion in its I.P.O. -- far below where Mr. Son pegged the company's value.
Mr. Son's bullish moves reflect his deeply held belief that Arm -- which he recently described as the financial and existential centerpiece of SoftBank -- is well positioned to take advantage of the revolution in artificial intelligence. At SoftBank's annual meeting in June, Mr. Son, now 66, said he had a recent revelation: He wanted to spend the remainder of his life and career as "an architect to build the future of humankind" through artificial intelligence. Arm's chip designing capabilities, he said, would "play a central role" in accelerating the development of A.I. Mr. Son also sees several other big markets for Arm, such as data centers and automotive.
But his monumental bet on Arm also reflects the urgent need for a big win for SoftBank after years of deals that didn't live up to their promise.
Mr. Son, who started SoftBank in Tokyo in 1981 after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, built it into one of the largest technology investors in the world. Early investments in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and in Japan's mobile phone industry were critical to SoftBank's success. However, some of SoftBank's later investments made through its $ 100 billion Vision Fund, including WeWork, have been far less rewarding.
Leading up to Arm's public offering, Mr. Son has been determined to keep as much of the company under SoftBank's control as he can, according to four people involved in the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly. SoftBank will sell just 10 percent of Arm to investors in the public offering. On average, companies have sold 16 to 29 percent of their shares in I.P.O.s over the past 10 years, according to Dealogic.
Mr. Son originally wanted to sell even less than 10 percent, one of the people said. However, he had taken a large personal loan using his stake in Arm as collateral, and the lenders forced him to sell at least a tenth of the company so they could have access to publicly traded shares -- which are easily sellable -- in case of a default or a steep plunge in Arm's value.
Mr. Son has repeatedly told underwriters and potential investors that after this offering, SoftBank has no plans to sell additional shares for several years, according to one person involved in the deal.
Arm's success is crucial to SoftBank, which in recent years has reeled from a series of troubled bets on technology companies. SoftBank's Vision Fund, which Mr. Son launched in 2017, raised tens of billions of dollars from big investors, including $ 50 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.
It also gained notoriety for making money-losing bets on companies that ran into trouble, including WeWork; a robot-making pizza company called Zume; and the Indian hotel chain Oyo. Losses at SoftBank's Vision Fund unit widened to more than $ 30 billion in its last fiscal year, which ended in March.
Arm's public offering comes roughly 18 months after Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker and a customer of Arm, abandoned its offer to buy Arm for $ 40 billion. The Federal Trade Commission had sued to stop the deal.
While Mr. Son has highlighted how Arm's chip-design technology could be central to an A.I. revolution, it has yet to produce the kind of growth that would bedazzle investors. The company's revenue declined slightly for the fiscal year that ended in March, to $ 2.68 billion from $ 2.7 billion a year earlier. Profitability dropped as well. Arm had net income of 10 cents per share in the most recent quarter, down from 22 cents the previous year.
Arm's I.P.O. underwriters pitched the company's shares to Wall Street investors conservatively, based on what they expected the initial demand to be. But investors who initially appeared to be wary of the chip designer's valuation and growth potential have become more optimistic after Arm shared its prospects with them, two people with knowledge of the deal said.
The company also offered many of its customers the opportunity to buy up to $ 100 million each in the I.P.O., two people involved in the deal said. Arm is expected to raise a total of $ 735 million from companies including Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia.
SoftBank and Arm have other enduring ties. Arm's chief executive, Rene Haas, who took the helm in 2022 shortly after the company called off its deal with Nvidia, recently joined SoftBank's board of directors. He travels to Tokyo regularly to meet with Mr. Son and talks to him multiple times a day, according to two people familiar with those activities.
Mr. Son has rarely left Japan since the start of the pandemic but plans to travel to the United States for the first time since 2020 for the Arm I.P.O., one of the people said. He'll be watching the start of trading from SoftBank's offices in California. Mr. Haas will spend the morning at Nasdaq's New York headquarters.

JetBlue Steps Up Effort
To Acquire Spirit Airlines
JetBlue Airways said on Monday that it has reached an agreement to turn over Spirit Airlines' operations at airports in Boston and Newark, as JetBlue ramps up its effort to win regulatory or court approval to buy Spirit.
JetBlue C.E.O. Robin Hays said the announcement "is aimed at removing any doubt of our commitment to promoting competition."
The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block JetBlue's proposed $ 3.8 billion purchase of Spirit, arguing that it will hurt competition and raise prices by eliminating Spirit, the nation's biggest discount airline. Lawyers for two dozen consumers have filed a similar lawsuit in the same court.
Under the deal, Allegiant would acquire Spirit's two gates at Boston's Logan Airport and two gates and takeoff and landing rights at Newark Liberty Airport.
Financial terms were not disclosed, but JetBlue said the deal is contingent on its acquisition of Spirit. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Qualcomm Extends Deal To Supply Chips to Apple
Qualcomm said on Monday that it had signed a deal with Apple to supply 5G chips until at least 2026, at a time when the iPhone maker faces increased challenges in China and looks to reinforce its supply chains elsewhere.
The deal extends a relationship worth billions of dollars to Qualcomm for at least three years, and indicates Apple is not rushing out its own modem, despite moving all its computers to processing chips of its own design.
Under the accord announced Monday, Qualcomm said it will supply Apple with chips for phones that will come out each year until 2026. Qualcomm did not disclose the value of the deal, saying only that the terms are "similar" to its previous agreement.
Apple is working on its own modem technology and spent $ 1 billion to buy Intel's modem unit in 2019. Apple has not said how quickly it plans to ramp up the use of its own chips. REUTERS
CAPITAL MARKETS
Truist's Cost-Cutting Plan Includes 'Sizable' Layoffs
Truist Financial is planning "sizable reductions" to its work force over the next few months to save roughly $ 300 million in costs, and said the bank's revenue for the current quarter was likely to be in line with its expectations.
The layoffs will be underway from the current quarter to the first quarter of 2024, Truist said in a presentation to investors on Monday.
"Other cost savings initiatives include aggressively managing third-party spend, further reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing tech spend," Truist's chief executive, Bill Rogers, said at the Barclays Financial Services Conference.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the expense program helps provide a "credible" path to holding costs relatively flat.
Truist added that along with tech optimization and organizational simplification, it will yield a combined $ 750 million in savings over 12 to 18 months. REUTERS

The American Renaissance Is Already at Hand: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Two megatrends have shaped American life since the 1980s: The rise of China and the hollowing out of American industry.
China's economic boom prompted a thousand predictions -- that it will soon surpass us as an economic power, that the 21st century is going to be a Chinese century, that America is an aging, decadent nation destined for second place.
The hollowing out of American industry fed the sense that capitalism is betraying the middle class. America has a parasitic financial sector, but we don't make things anymore. Manufacturing jobs got outsourced to China and Mexico, and wages stagnated.
These two trends contributed to the sense that America is in decline -- to the angry, gloomy pall that has settled over political life.
But it's beginning to look as if those two megatrends are reversing.
China does not look like a growing dynamic power, but a troubled, stagnating one. Growth rates are falling. The unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 24 in urban areas is at a demoralizing 21 percent. Private investment is sluggish. A forecast from Bloomberg Economics now projects that the size of the Chinese economy will not successfully surpass the size of the American economy -- despite its vastly greater population.
The causes of China's stagnation are myriad and deep: An overinvestment in real estate, the decline in foreign investment as the state become more menacing, the decline of exports, the demographic doom spiral. Since 2016, the actual number of births in China has fallen by nearly 50 percent.
But the core problems are endemic to the regime: Centralized authoritarian control is incompatible with a wide-open, innovative, free-flowing modern economy. Industrial policy may look good for a short time, but it ossifies. China now has a plethora of zombie corporations, which suck up subsidies without successfully competing in the marketplace. Open information flow is crucial to any nation; when the state suppresses information unflattering to the regime, then everything is bound to sink into mediocrity.
As the Chinese economy deflates, American industry is looking less hollow. America has a net gain of 530,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017. The manufacturing boom has been torrid of late. Since late 2021, investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities has more than doubled.
Much of that boom is happening in the mountain West, the Upper Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and batteries are being manufactured in places like Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota and Arizona.
Over the last few years, for example, scads of tech firms have decided to invest in manufacturing plants in formerly rust belt Ohio: Intel ( $ 20 billion), Amazon ( $ 7.8 billion), Google ( $ 3.7 billion). According to a Hoover Institution study, Ohio in 2020 attracted almost 14 times more new capital projects per capita than California.
In short, capital, construction and manufacturing are flowing back into many places that have taken their hits. Since 2011, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wage growth has "accelerated more for high school graduates than for college graduates."
What lessons are we to draw from these two ongoing turnarounds? The first is that there's a lot of resilience and dynamism in America's brand of broadly free market capitalism. As I've noted before, in 1990 the European and American gross domestic products per capita were nearly neck and neck. Since then, America has surged ahead. American labor productivity increased by 67 percent between 1990 and 2022, compared to 55 percent in Europe and 51 percent in Japan.
In 2012 I heard a commencement speech by Dr. Atul Gawande that introduced me to the phrase "failure to rescue." He reported on a study that found the best hospitals don't necessarily prevent bad things from happening, but they're really good at rescuing people when they have a complication to prevent failures from becoming catastrophes.
The American economy, especially in the Midwest, is kind of like that. Many of those places have experienced economic decline, but governments and people have shifted and adapted, and they are bouncing back.
The second lesson I draw is that Bidenomics is working -- big time. President Biden promised to help America outcompete authoritarian China and to heal some of the economic divides at home. Both those goals are being achieved.
According to the Treasury Department, over 80 percent of the investment made through the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with college graduation rates lower than the national average. Nearly 90 percent of investments are being made in counties with below-average weekly wages.
I know many of you think Biden is too old, but I'd vote for a 100-year-old who could keep delivering results like that.
The third lesson I draw is that the right-wing populists are hopelessly outdated. Take, for example, the writer Sohrab Ahmari, who argues that "the state must also take a far more active role in coordinating economic activity for the good of the whole community." But China's industrial policy illustrates the classic downsides of excessive state interference. Even the vaunted German model, one of the great success stories of the 20th century, is showing its age. German manufacturing output and gross domestic product have been stagnant since 2018.
American politics is dysfunctional, our social fabric is in tatters, but somehow our economy is among the strongest in the world. Our economic competitors stumble and fall; we stumble, and somehow bounce back.

China Flexes Tech Muscles By Unveiling A New Phone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The release of a homegrown Chinese smartphone during a visit by the Biden official in charge of regulating such technology shows the U.S.-China tech conflict is alive and well.
In the midst of the U.S. commerce secretary's good will tour to China last week, Huawei, the telecom giant that faces stiff U.S. trade restrictions, unveiled a smartphone that illustrated just how hard it has been for the United States to clamp down on China's tech prowess.
The new phone is powered by a chip that appears to be the most advanced version of China's homegrown technology to date -- a kind of achievement that the United States has been trying to prevent China from reaching.
The timing of its release may not have been a coincidence. The Commerce Department has been leading U.S. efforts to curb Beijing's ability to gain access to advanced chips, and the commerce secretary, Gina M. Raimondo, spent much of her trip defending the U.S. crackdown to Chinese officials, who pressed her to water down some of the rules.
Ms. Raimondo's powerful role -- as well as China's antipathy toward the U.S. curbs -- was reflected online, where more than a dozen vendors cropped up on Chinese e-commerce sites to sell phone cases for the new model with Ms. Raimondo's face imprinted on the back. Doctored images showed Ms. Raimondo holding the new phone, next to phrases like "I am Raimondo, this time I endorse Huawei" and "Huawei mobile phone ambassador Raimondo."
Chinese media have referred to the phone as a sign of the country's technological independence, but U.S. analysts said the achievement still most likely hinged on the use of American technology and machinery, which would have been in violation of U.S. trade restrictions.
Beginning in the Trump administration and continuing under President Biden, the United States has steadily ramped up its restrictions on selling advanced chips and the machinery needed to make them to China, and to Huawei in particular, in an attempt to shut down China's mastery of technologies that could aid its military.
For the past several years, those restrictions have curtailed Huawei's ability to produce 5G phones. But Huawei appears to have found a way around those restrictions to make an advanced phone, at least in limited quantities. Though detailed information about the phone is limited, Huawei's jade-green Mate 60 Pro appears to have many of the same basic capabilities as other smartphones on the market.
An examination of the phone by TechInsights, a Canadian firm that analyzes the semiconductor industry, concluded that the advanced chip inside was manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation of China and was operating beyond the technology limits that the United States has been trying to enforce.
Douglas Fuller, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School, said SMIC appeared to have used equipment stockpiled before restrictions went into effect, equipment licensed to it for the purpose of producing chips for companies other than Huawei, and spare parts acquired through third-party vendors to cobble together its production.
"The official line in China of a heroic breaking of the technology blockade of the American imperialists is incorrect," Mr. Fuller said. "Instead, the U.S. has allowed SMIC continued significant access to American technology."
Huawei and SMIC did not respond to a request for comment. The Commerce Department also did not respond to a request for comment.
Chinese social media commentators and news sites celebrated the smartphone's release as evidence that U.S. restrictions could not hold China back from developing its own technology.
"Regardless of Huawei's intentions, the launch of the Mate 60 Pro has been imbued by many Chinese netizens with a deeper meaning of 'rising up under US pressure,"' the state-run Global Times said in an editorial.
The phone was released during a week when both American and Chinese officials had issued numerous statements about renewed cooperation and communication. Chinese officials had asked for the United States to roll back its restrictions on chip exports. But Ms. Raimondo -- whose email, along with other U.S. officials, was targeted this year by Chinese hackers -- told reporters that she had taken a hard line on the technology controls in her meetings, saying the United States was not willing to remove restrictions or compromise on issues of national security.
During the trip, Ms. Raimondo and her advisers set up a dialogue to share information about how the United States was enforcing its technology controls. She said the step would lead to better Chinese compliance but was not an invitation to the Chinese to try to water down export controls.
Ms. Raimondo also met directly with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, during her visit. The week before, Mr. Li had visited Huawei during a visit to southern China, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, and met with the company founder Ren Zhengfei.
The release of the Huawei phone raises questions about whether Ms. Raimondo's department will continue trying to build good will with Chinese officials -- or potentially take a more aggressive stance toward cracking down on China's access to American technology.
The Biden administration is preparing to issue a final version of the technology restrictions it first put out last October, and the revised rules could come within weeks.
Huawei's development of the phone does not necessarily demonstrate a huge leap forward for Chinese technological prowess -- or the total failure of U.S. export controls, analysts said.
Because Chinese firms no longer have access to the most cutting-edge machines for making semiconductors, they have developed novel workarounds that use older machinery to create more powerful chips. But these methods are both relatively time-consuming for manufacturers, and produce a higher proportion of faulty chips, limiting the scale of production.
"This does not mean China can manufacture advanced semiconductors at scale," said Paul Triolo, an associate partner for China and technology policy at Albright Stonebridge Group, a consultancy. "But it shows what incentives U.S. controls have created for Chinese firms to collaborate and attempt new ways to innovate with their existing capabilities."
"It is the first major salvo in what will be a decade or more struggle for China's semiconductor industry to essentially reinvent parts of the global semiconductor supply chain without U.S. technology included," he added.
Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner at Wiley Rein and a former Commerce Department official, said Huawei's progress was "a result of longstanding U.S. policy" -- specifically U.S. licenses that allow companies to continue selling advanced technologies to firms that the Commerce Department placed on a so-called entity list, like Huawei and SMIC.
From Jan. 3 to March 31, 2022, the Commerce Department approved licenses for the sale of $ 23 billion of tech products to companies on the entity list, according to information released in February by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
"Where gaps exist in licensing policies, exports will get funneled through the gaps," Ms. Nikakhtar said. "The U.S. government needs to close the gaps if its intention is to limit exports of critical technologies to China."
In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who heads a congressional committee on China, called for ending all U.S. technology exports to both Huawei and SMIC. U.S. chip makers such as Qualcomm and Intel have received exporting licenses.

Stocks Fade Late in a Losing Month: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/stocks-fade-late-losing-month/docview/2859437770/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A late-afternoon fade left stocks modestly lower Thursday as Wall Street closed out its first losing month since February.
The S&P 500 gave up an early gain to close 0.2 percent lower. The benchmark index ended August down 1.8 percent, although a four-day winning streak going back to last week helped chip away at the severity of the monthly decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
Market jitters over the possibility that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates higher for longer following reports showing the U.S. economy's resilience led to the market's pullback in August after what had been a banner year. This week, reports on job openings, consumer confidence and inflation stoked hopes on Wall Street that the Fed may hold rates steady at its next policy meeting in September.
That helped limit the market's losses for August. The S&P 500, which soared 19.5 percent through July, remains 17.4 percent higher for the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 34.1 percent. The Dow is up 4.8 percent.
"We've kind of entered this point of the year where economic data and earnings are mostly set, in terms of the market's expectations," said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird. "But if we get cooler jobs data, cooler inflation data, if we get cooler spending data, that's what brings rates down dramatically and that gooses stocks higher. That's kind of what we saw this week."
This week's economic data, which includes reports on inflation, jobs and consumer confidence, supports hopes that the Fed will pause its interest rate hikes. The central bank held rates steady at its last meeting and is expected to do the same later this month.
"The last hike they made potentially could be the last for the year," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. "As long as inflation remains controlled and contained, I think the Fed is done raising interest rates."
Bond yields fell again Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.09 percent from 4.11 percent late Wednesday. The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tracks expectations for the Fed, edged lower to 4.85 percent from 4.88 percent late Wednesday.
Wall Street has one more big economic update to look forward to this week. On Friday, the government will report employment data for August. The strong job market, along with consumer spending, has so far helped thwart a recession that analysts expected at some point in 2023. But they also made the Fed's task of taming inflation more difficult by fueling wage and price increases.
The Fed is hoping that it can accomplish tame inflation without sending the economy into a recession. The likelihood of a recession, or at least a severe one, has been fading and in turn has fueled confidence in the market, despite the August slump.
"Sooner or later you need to have a pullback," Mr. Zaccarelli said. "The market can't go up in a straight line all the time."
Health care stocks and banks were among the biggest drags on the market. UnitedHealth Group fell 3 percent, while Elevance Health fell 3.8 percent.
Gains in technology stocks helped stem the S&P 500's slide. Broadcom rose 3.4 percent and Intel rose 1.8 percent.
The software company Salesforce rose 3 percent after raising its profit forecast. The cloud-based security company CrowdStrike jumped 9.3 percent after reporting strong financial results.
Dollar General was among several retailers slipping after reporting weak earnings and forecasts. It slumped 12.2 percent after cutting its profit forecast for the year.
Markets in Europe mostly fell. Annual inflation there held steady in August as food prices raced ahead of falling fuel costs, but there was no clarity about whether the European Central Bank will pause its record series of interest rate hikes.

Raimondo Tells Beijing U.S. Values Trade Ties: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, emphasized U.S. concerns over harsh treatment of foreign companies and national security issues in a meeting with top officials in Beijing.
Gina Raimondo, the U.S. secretary of commerce, told Chinese officials on Tuesday that the United States was not seeking to sever economic ties with China, but she expressed a litany of concerns that were prompting the business community to describe China as "uninvestable."
Ms. Raimondo, who oversees both trade promotion and U.S. limits on China's access to advanced technology, spoke with several of China's top officials on Tuesday. That included meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China's second-highest official, and Vice Premier He Lifeng, who oversees many economic issues, at the Great Hall of the People, next to Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing.
Ms. Raimondo said she had pressed Chinese officials on a variety of challenges facing American businesses operating in China. Companies have expressed concerns about long-running issues like intellectual property theft as well as a raft of newer developments, like raids on businesses, a new counterespionage law and exorbitant fines that come without explanations, she said during an extended interview with reporters on a high-speed train from Beijing to Shanghai on Tuesday evening.
"Increasingly, I hear from businesses China is uninvestable because it has become too risky," she said.
Ms. Raimondo said after the meetings that she had raised the various concerns of U.S. companies like Intel, Micron and Boeing, but that she "didn't receive any commitments." Beijing scuttled Intel's acquisition of another semiconductor company this month by not giving the deal antitrust approval. It has also severely restricted some of Micron's semiconductor sales in China since May and has halted almost all purchases of Boeing jets over the last several years, mainly choosing Airbus aircraft from Europe instead.
"I was very firm in our expectations. I think I was heard," she added. "We'll have to see if they take any action."
Ms. Raimondo also asked for China's cooperation on broader threats like climate change, fentanyl and artificial intelligence. The Chinese in turn asked for the United States to reduce export controls on advanced technology and retract a recent executive order that bans new investments in certain advanced technologies, Ms. Raimondo said.
The commerce secretary said she had refused those requests. "We don't negotiate on matters of national security," she said.
Still, Ms. Raimondo tried to assure the Chinese that export controls applied only to a small proportion of U.S.-China trade, and that other economic opportunities between the countries should be embraced.
"This isn't about decoupling," she said. "This is about maintaining our very consequential trade relationship, which is good for America, good for China and good for the world. An unstable economic relationship between China and the United States is bad for the world."
The official Xinhua news agency said late Tuesday that Premier Li had told Ms. Raimondo that economic relations between China and the United States were "mutually beneficial." But he also warned that "politicizing economic and trade issues and overstretching the concept of security will not only seriously affect bilateral relations and mutual trust, but also undermine the interests of enterprises and people of the two countries, and will have a disastrous impact on the global economy."
Ms. Raimondo's visit is part of an effort by the Biden administration to stop a long deterioration in the U.S. relationship with China and restore communications. She is the fourth senior Biden administration official to travel to China in three months.
Her conversations with Chinese officials -- which ranged from issues of national security to commercial opportunities for tourism -- attested to both the economic potential of the trading relationship and its immense challenges.
Chinese officials have welcomed her visit as an opportunity to reduce tensions and air their concerns. Seated in a red-carpeted reception room on the second floor of the Great Hall, Mr. He said at the start of their meeting that he was ready to work with Ms. Raimondo, and hoped the United States would adopt rational and practical policies. She responded by laying out what the Biden administration sees as its priorities.
"The U.S.-China commercial relationship is one of the most globally consequential, and managing that relationship responsibly is critical to both our nations and indeed to the whole world," Ms. Raimondo said. "And while we will never of course compromise in protecting our national security, I want to be clear that we do not seek to decouple or to hold China's economy back."
On Monday, Ms. Raimondo and China's commerce minister, Wang Wentao, met and agreed to hold regular discussions between the two countries on commercial issues. Those talks are set to include business leaders as well as government officials. The two governments also agreed to exchange information, starting with a meeting by their senior aides on Tuesday morning in Beijing, about how the United States enforces its export controls.
Earlier on Tuesday, Ms. Raimondo met with China's minister of culture and tourism, Hu Heping. That meeting came less than three weeks after Beijing lifted a ban on group tours to the United States that it had imposed during the pandemic, when China closed its borders almost completely for nearly three years.
The two ministers agreed at the meeting that the United States and China would host a gathering in China early next year to promote the travel industry, the latest in a series of business promotion activities that Ms. Raimondo has been organizing.
Travel from China to the United States remains at less than a third of prepandemic levels, the United States Travel Association, an industry group, said on Saturday.
The number of nonstop flights between the two countries is still less than a tenth of its level before the pandemic. Chinese airlines carried most of the passengers between the two countries before the pandemic. But after Beijing frequently blocked American carriers' flights to China during the pandemic because of Covid cases aboard -- while allowing Chinese carriers' flights to continue -- the Biden administration began insisting on strict reciprocity.
After the retirement of many pilots and flight attendants during the pandemic, American carriers have struggled to meet travel demand within the United States. They have been slow to restore long-haul services to China, which require many crews to operate, although United Airlines announced recently that this autumn it would increase the frequency of flights from San Francisco to Shanghai, and would resume flights from San Francisco to Beijing.
Senior American officials previously tended to fly between Beijing and Shanghai during visits to China, but the Commerce Department decided to move its sizable delegation by train on this trip. Huge Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicles carrying Ms. Raimondo and her aides pulled straight up onto the train platform to unload them into one of China's high-speed electric trains, which travel for long stretches at 217 miles per hour, or 350 kilometers an hour.
The trains travel from Beijing to Shanghai, a distance comparable to the journey from New York to Atlanta or Chicago, in as little as four and a half hours, depending on how many stops they make. The trains, usually with 16 or more passenger cars, depart several times an hour in each direction.

The U.S. and China Agree to Broaden Talks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: During a visit to Beijing, Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said the two sides would meet to discuss export restrictions and intellectual property, among other issues.
The United States and China agreed on Monday to hold regular conversations about commercial issues and restrictions on access to advanced technology, the latest step this summer toward reducing tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The announcement came during a visit to Beijing by Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, who is meeting with senior Chinese officials in Beijing and Shanghai this week.
The agreement to hold regular discussions is the latest move toward rebuilding frayed links between the two countries, a process that had already begun during three trips in the past 10 weeks by senior American officials: Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and John Kerry, the president's climate envoy.
"I think it's a very good sign that we agreed to concrete dialogue, and I would say, more than just kind of nebulous commitments to continue to talk, this is an official channel," Ms. Raimondo said in an interview after four hours of negotiations with China's commerce minister, Wang Wentao.
Ms. Raimondo said on Monday night in Beijing that she'd had an "open" and "pragmatic" discussion with Mr. Wang and had raised the American business community's concerns about China's recent actions against Intel and Micron Technology, two semiconductor companies in the United States. The Chinese government has scuttled a large acquisition planned by Intel and has blocked some sales in China by Micron this year.
She said two separate dialogues would be established. One would be a working group that included business representatives and would focus on commercial issues. The other would be a governmental information exchange on U.S. enforcement of its export controls.
Bilateral talks about trade, technology and other economic issues were once the norm between the United States and China, but those discussions have atrophied in recent years. China halted eight bilateral discussion groups a year ago in retaliation for a visit to Taiwan by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was House speaker at the time.
The flight of a Chinese spy balloon that traveled across the United States last winter and was then shot down over the Atlantic Ocean only deepened divisions between China and the United States, and resulted in Mr. Blinken's initially canceling a trip to Beijing.
But relations have begun to thaw as both nations, whose economies are tied to each other, have opened the door to resuming diplomatic ties.
After the meeting, the Chinese ministry of commerce said in a statement that Mr. Wang had expressed serious concerns about U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, as well as the Biden administration's efforts to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry by providing government subsidies. Mr. Wang criticized those new subsidy programs, which are designed to lure manufacturing to the United States, as "discriminatory," and he expressed concerns about U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies.
China is willing to work with the United States to create a sound policy environment for business cooperation between the countries, he told the U.S. side, according to the readout.
Even before Ms. Raimondo traveled to China, Republican lawmakers criticized her for planning a "working group" of U.S. and Chinese officials to discuss American export controls. Four senior Republicans contended in a letter last week that it was "deeply inappropriate for our foremost adversary to have any influence over controls on sensitive U.S. national security technologies that the American people charged her to protect."
Ms. Raimondo announced the new dialogue not as a working group but as an "information exchange." She said that it had been set up to share more information about U.S. export restrictions on advanced technology, but that the group's creation did not mean the United States would be compromising on issues of national security. The first meeting of the export enforcement group was scheduled to take place in Beijing on Tuesday.
A senior Commerce Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly said that American officials in the export enforcement group would discuss with their Chinese counterparts how regulations are enforced, but not which products are covered or how the policies are made. Enforcement has been a difficult issue for the two countries, partly because it involves having American officials conduct inspections in China.
China had halted such inspections for roughly two years, but in the past eight months has allowed over 100 such checks to proceed, the official said. The inspections of facilities in China are aimed at ensuring that the most advanced American technologies aren't being diverted to the Chinese military or security services. Last week, the Commerce Department announced that 27 Chinese companies had passed such checks and were again allowed to import advanced technology.
Ms. Raimondo also said she and the Chinese commerce minister had agreed to meet with each other at least annually.
He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now a trade specialist at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing research group, said the bilateral agreement to have more discussions showed a mutual commitment to pragmatism.
"It means that both sides share the approach to solve practical issues," he said.
But in a sign of how politically fraught relations with China remain, plans for a formal dialogue structure between the two countries drew criticism from some China analysts in the United States.
Matt Turpin, a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution who was China director of the National Security Council during the Trump administration, described the move as a "real head scratcher." He pointed to China's unwillingness to take action to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States, its alliance with Russia and its hacking of Ms. Raimondo's email account before the trip as reasons China did not deserve such outreach.
"It seems that Raimondo gave a significant concession to Beijing and got nothing in return," Mr. Turpin said.
U.S. officials conveyed the concerns of American businesses and investors, including unfair requirements faced by foreign businesses and a declining transparency in China's economic statistics. China suspended the release of youth unemployment data this month after the figure reached a record high this summer.
Ms. Raimondo said that she had spoken to nearly 150 business leaders in preparation for her trip and that they had given her a common message: We need more channels of communication.
"A growing Chinese economy that plays by the rules is in all of our interests," she said.
As the Chinese economy has faltered this summer, Chinese officials have begun softening their stance on some issues. In the latest measure, the foreign ministry announced on Monday that starting on Wednesday, travelers to China would no longer need to test themselves first for Covid.
Michael Hart, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said there had been a change in direction from Chinese officials this summer, with an increased willingness to hold discussions.
"It used to be at every meeting I went to, the first five minutes were 'Everything is America's fault,"' Mr. Hart said. "It's definitely toned down now. Government officials understand the importance of U.S.-China trade."

Full text: From tourism to advanced technology, here are the topics that are dominating the secretary's visit to China this week.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, began meeting Chinese officials on Monday as the latest Biden administration emissary seeking to stabilize ties between the world's two largest economies. In working toward that goal, she has a lot of ground to cover.
During meetings with government officials and business leaders in Beijing and Shanghai this week, Ms. Raimondo is expected to tackle a range of challenging issues in the U.S.-China relationship, from explaining the controls the United States is rolling out on China's access to advanced chips and other technology, to promoting ties in less sensitive areas.
Ms. Raimondo is likely to announce the creation of groups with China to discuss technology and business issues, and to cap her visit with a trip to Shanghai Disneyland to highlight the potential for more tourism between the countries, according to people familiar with the plans.
In a meeting with China's minister of commerce in Beijing on Monday morning, Ms. Raimondo said that it was "profoundly important" for the two countries to manage their differences.
"It's a challenging relationship, we will of course disagree on certain issues, but I believe we can make progress if we are direct, open and practical," Ms. Raimondo said.
The meetings are coming at a critical juncture, where relations between the countries are strained and China's economy appears to be slowing. Here's a look at the issues that are expected to dominate the trip.
U.S.-China tech war
One major topic for both sides will be the mounting restrictions on trade in advanced technology between the countries, particularly those imposed by the United States. Ms. Raimondo's department oversees the export controls that the Biden administration put in place on China's access to advanced chips last October, which have angered Chinese officials and prompted retaliation.
Chinese officials are also upset about the Biden administration's proposal earlier this month to bar private equity and venture capital firms from making investments in China in quantum computing and advanced semiconductors, as well as a new bipartisan law aimed at strengthening the U.S. semiconductor industry, which bars companies that accept federal money from making new, high-tech investments in China.
China has had its own, much broader limits since 2016 on most overseas investments by Chinese companies and households. Chinese officials also recently scuttled a planned merger between Intel and an Israeli chip-maker, and banned some sales by the U.S. chip-maker Micron, which Micron has estimated could cost the company roughly an eighth of its global revenue. The moves against Micron and Intel were seen by some China experts as retaliation for the Biden administration's tougher treatment of China's tech sector.
In an effort to prevent an economically damaging tit-for-tat, Ms. Raimondo is expected to argue that the U.S. trade restrictions are aimed at protecting domestic security, not holding China's economy back.
The two sides are also expected to announce the creation of a new working group during the visit to exchange more information about the controls. Some Republicans have pushed back on the idea of such a group, arguing in a letter to Ms. Raimondo that it would give China a way to influence the measures.
In a briefing with reporters ahead of the trip, Ms. Raimondo said that enforcement of these rules is "not up for debate." But communication with the Chinese government about the policies can help avoid misunderstanding and unnecessary escalation, she said.
A deteriorating business environment for foreign firms
Ms. Raimondo is also expected to air complaints from Western companies about the increasing difficulty of doing business in China. That likely includes raising concerns about China's treatment of Micron, and passing on complaints from other Western executives who say they are increasingly worried about China's expansive national security laws.
In March, the Chinese authorities detained five Chinese nationals working in Beijing for the Mintz Group, an American consulting company, and in April, the authorities questioned employees in the Shanghai office of Bain & Company, the U.S. management consulting firm. The Chinese government imposed a $ 1.5 million fine last month on Mintz for doing unapproved statistical work.
International executives now regularly express worries about carrying out routine business activities in China, like performing due diligence on acquisition targets or transferring data between subsidiaries. American multinationals have begun preparing contingency plans in case their employees are detained in China, and have sent back very few of the expatriates who had evacuated the country during the pandemic.
"People are scared to go to China," said Susan Shirk, a research professor at the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of "Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise."
"This worry about physical security is really putting a damper on interactions at the commercial as well as the academic level," she added.
Promoting commercial ties in other areas
Despite a chillier atmosphere, Ms. Raimondo and other officials insist that there is still plenty of potential for trade between the world's two largest economies. China remains America's third-largest export market, buying more than $ 150 billion of products from U.S. farms and businesses.
Speaking before the trip, Ms. Raimondo noted that U.S. export controls affect only 1 percent of bilateral trade between the countries. Exports to China support more than 80,000 jobs in the United States, and benefit small as well as large firms, she said. The United States also continues to import hundreds of billions of dollars of products from China each year.
Ms. Raimondo is likely to reiterate that message as she meets business leaders in Beijing and Shanghai. Her visit will include meetings with American purveyors of personal care products who are exporting to China, and a trip to Shanghai Disneyland, where she is likely to tout a recent U.S. move to restore group travel from China to the United States.
"Like you, I'm a former governor, I'm a practical leader," she told the Chinese commerce minister in her meeting Monday. "I'm here in the spirit of being practical and finding concrete ways to work together with you."
Government communication
A more basic, but still fundamental, component of the trip is promoting communication between the United States and China. Those channels badly atrophied following the fallout over a Chinese surveillance balloon that flew across the United States early this year.
Speaking before the trip, Ms. Raimondo said she had spoken to President Biden on Thursday, and that he had asked her to carry a message to Chinese leaders that "we need to communicate to avoid conflict."
This will be the first trip to China by a U.S. commerce secretary in seven years.
She is expected to meet several members of a new economic team that has taken office since the Communist Party held its once-in-five-years national congress last autumn.
Economic slowdown and transparency
Looming over the visit are concerns about China's recent economic slowdown, and how that could influence the global economy and bilateral relations going forward.
Economists and observers have expressed concern over a decision by the Chinese Bureau of National Statistics this month to stop publishing monthly unemployment information "for youth and other age groups," which recently reached a record high.
The agency said that it needed to optimize its surveys. But the decision, together with the suspension of tens of thousands of other data series in recent years, led to suggestions that China was trying to hide negative economic data.
Jake Sullivan, the White House's national security adviser, said that Ms. Raimondo was expected to discuss China's economic data during her trip.
"We think, for global confidence, predictability and the capacity of the rest of the world to make sound economic decisions, it's important for China to maintain a level of transparency in the publication of its data as well," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, is the latest Biden administration emissary seeking to stabilize ties between the world’s two largest economies.
The fourth senior U.S. official to travel to China in less than three months, Raimondo is taking her trip at a critical juncture. Relations between the countries are strained, partly because the United States has clamped down on China’s access to technology that could aid its military. China’s economy also appears to be slowing, and Beijing has been trying to woo more foreign investment, while tightening its scrutiny of foreign businesses.
Raimondo’s agenda is varied, including economic diplomacy, getting to know China’s new economic team and defending the interests of American companies and their employees. Both U.S. and Chinese officials have hinted that while many of the large issues probably can’t be resolved in these meetings, there are perhaps a few areas where the two sides might move closer to agreement.
Here’s a look at the issues that are expected to dominate the trip.
U.S.-China Tech War
One major topic for both sides will be the mounting restrictions on trade in advanced technology between the countries, particularly those imposed by the United States. Raimondo’s department oversees the export controls and other restrictions that the Biden administration has put in place, many of which have angered Chinese officials and prompted retaliation.
This month, the Biden administration announced plans to bar private equity and venture capital firms from making investments in China in quantum computing and advanced semiconductors. Though those restrictions weren’t as sweeping as some had expected, Chinese officials are still smarting at the administration’s decision last October to place significant limitations on the kinds of advanced semiconductors and chipmaking machinery that can be sent to China.
A new bipartisan law aimed at strengthening the U.S. semiconductor industry has also rankled Chinese officials, especially because it bars companies that accept federal money from making new, high-tech investments in China.
China has had its own, much broader limits since 2016 on most overseas investments by Chinese companies and households. Chinese officials recently began regulating exports of metals used to make chips, scuttled a planned merger between Intel and an Israeli chip-maker and banned some sales by U.S. chipmaker Micron, which Micron has estimated could cost the company roughly an eighth of its global revenue. The moves against Micron and Intel were seen by some China experts as retaliation for the Biden administration’s tougher treatment of China’s tech sector.
In an effort to prevent an economically damaging tit-for-tat, Raimondo is expected to talk about the U.S. rationale and make clear its efforts are aimed at protecting domestic security.
Raimondo said in a briefing with reporters before the trip that one main goal of the visit will be to “explain and bring further transparency” to the national security strategy of protecting critical technologies.”
Still, she said, enforcement of these rules is “not up for debate, not up for compromise, not up even really for discussion. But it is important that we have transparency with the Chinese and that our national security policies are understood by our PRC counterparts to avoid misunderstanding, to avoid unnecessary escalation, to avoid miscalculation,” she said, referring to the People’s Republic of China.
Deteriorating Business Environment for Foreign Firms
In addition to raising concerns about China’s treatment of Micron, Raimondo is expected to air complaints from other Western businesses who say they are increasingly worried about accidentally triggering China’s expansive national security laws.
In March, Chinese authorities detained five Chinese nationals working in Beijing for the Mintz Group, a U.S. consulting company, and in April, authorities questioned employees in the Shanghai office of Bain & Co., the U.S. management consulting firm. The Chinese government imposed a $1.5 million fine this month on Mintz for doing unapproved statistical work.
International executives now regularly express worries about carrying out routine business activities, such as performing due diligence on acquisition targets or transferring data between subsidiaries. American multinationals have begun preparing contingency plans in case their employees are detained in China, and have sent back few of the expatriates who had evacuated the country during the pandemic.
Those anxieties, along with technology controls, tariffs and other barriers to trade, have most likely contributed to a trend of declining foreign investment in China.
“People are scared to go to China,” said Susan Shirk, a research professor at the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, and the author of “Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise.”
“This worry about physical security is really putting a damper on interactions at the commercial as well as the academic level,” she added.
Promoting Commercial Ties in Other Areas
Despite a chillier atmosphere, Raimondo and other officials insist that there is still plenty of potential for trade between the two economies. China remains America’s third-largest export market, buying more than $150 billion of products from U.S. farms and businesses.
Raimondo noted that U.S. export controls affect just 1% of bilateral trade between the countries. Exports to China support more than 80,000 jobs in the United States, and benefit small as well as large firms, she said. The United States also continues to import hundreds of billions of dollars of products from China each year.
Raimondo said one key goal for the trip would be promoting commercial ties where they align with U.S. interests, naming tourism and “people-to-people exchanges.” As an example, she pointed to the recent U.S. move to restore group travel from China to the United States, saying that a return to 2019 levels of Chinese visitors would generate $30 billion for the U.S. economy.
Government Communication
A more basic, but still fundamental, component of the trip is promoting communication between the United States and China. Those channels badly atrophied following the fallout over a Chinese surveillance balloon that flew across the United States early this year, and the Chinese defense minister still refuses to speak with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
Raimondo said she had spoken to President Joe Biden on Thursday, and that he had asked her to carry a message to Chinese leaders that “we need to communicate to avoid conflict.”
This will be the first trip to China by a U.S. commerce secretary in seven years, Raimondo said. She is expected to have the opportunity to meet several members of a new economic team that has taken office since the Communist Party held its once-in-five-years national congress last autumn.
“There is benefit to communicating to reduce tension,” she said. “That does not mean compromise, that means communicate.”
Economic Slowdown and Transparency
Looming over the visit are concerns about China’s recent economic slowdown, and how that could influence the global economy and bilateral relations going forward.
Economists and observers have expressed concern over a decision by the Chinese Bureau of National Statistics this month to stop publishing monthly unemployment information “for youth and other age groups,” which recently reached a record high.
The agency said that it needed to optimize its surveys. But the decision, together with the suspension of tens of thousands of other data series in recent years, led to suggestions that China was trying to hide negative economic data.
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Raimondo was expected to discuss China’s economic data during her trip.
“We believe in openness and transparency and reporting,” Sullivan said Tuesday. “And we think, for global confidence, predictability and the capacity of the rest of the world to make sound economic decisions, it’s important for China to maintain a level of transparency in the publication of its data as well.”

Let's Stop Pretending College Degrees Don't Matter: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It would be easy to believe, from scanning the headlines, that a college degree is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a fast-evolving job market.
Fourteen states, including 10 in the past year alone, have dropped degree requirements for many state jobs. The trend is gathering steam at many high-profile businesses, notably tech firms like IBM and Accenture. All this comes as college enrollment has dropped, with an assist from a tight job market and worries about student debt.
In a world marked by continued racial disparities in employment and economic well-being, there is a growing outcry that expensive college degrees represent a barrier rather than a steppingstone. The argument goes: Many talented people, including disadvantaged minorities, may possess the skills needed for many white-collar roles without holding the formal credentials listed as prerequisites.
These advocates, who can be found on the left and the right, mean well. Nonetheless, a look at the data suggests the skills-based hiring movement may actually amount to little more than populist virtue signaling. The evidence so far suggests that the movement may do little to expand economic opportunity. What's worse, it sends a degree-skeptical message that risks hurting rather than helping those who would benefit most from pursuing an education beyond high school.
As always, it's useful to look at what economists call "revealed preferences" -- or what people do, regardless of what they say.
The economic advantage of getting a college degree remains at just about an all-time high when compared with the average earnings of Americans with only a high-school diploma. In recent years, a typical college graduate earned a median wage premium of more than $ 30,000, or almost 75 percent more than those who had completed just high school, a 2019 New York Fed analysis found.
In April 2022, a major study by the Society for Human Resource Management, or S.H.R.M., found that 71 percent of executives said that some alternative credentials are equivalent to a bachelor's degree. But only 58 percent of supervisors (most likely beneath those executives on the organization chart) concurred, a figure that fell to 36 percent for human resources professionals, or those typically closest to hiring decisions.
In another experiment by S.H.R.M., hiring managers and human resources professionals evaluated hypothetical job applicants with traditional degrees more highly than those with alternative credentials, particularly when the job ad used strict degree requirements. This was the case even when the latter were viewed as more likely to have the technical skills needed for the job.
Another study often cited as evidence of declining employer interest in college degrees doesn't fully capture what's happening. The Burning Glass Institute's "Emerging Degree Reset" report from last year pointed to a decline in degree requirements for middle-skill jobs in particular. But the analysis was based on online job postings, not actual hiring decisions. A later data analysis found that in some key respects, "employers are hiring more (not less) college grads."
What about all the Silicon Valley firms so often associated with the "death of the degree" narrative? Here, too, revealed preferences are, well, revealing.
Degree requirements in formal job listings remain in the 70 to 90 percent range at blue-chip firms like Google, Apple and Intel. Even much-hyped alternative-credential programs -- like the online Grow with Google certificates, which offer professional training in high-demand tech fields such as cybersecurity and digital support -- aren't designed to get certificate holders hired at Google.
Maggie Johnson, Google's vice president of education and university programs, told me that although the company has made a small number of hires from top coding boot camps, "I still doubt that boot camp graduates can learn new languages and technologies as quickly as someone with" a computer science degree.
There is a reason college graduates earn so much more, and it isn't just because they've got an extra piece of paper. The huge growth in the wage premium for college degrees reflects not state bureaucracies or corporate H.R. policies, but century-long economic changes that generate more jobs requiring the abilities and knowledge acquired in college.
The broad education and targeted skills that college graduates usually obtain prepare them for career success. That includes analytical and communications abilities, tailored preparation in popular subjects like business, nursing and computer science, or liberal arts majors that have significant long-term benefits. When undergrads are also able to develop their social capital to build professional networks, so much the better. It's a category error to treat college degrees like dubious occupational licenses that have become barriers to entry in certain fields.
College degree alternatives may still play a worthwhile role for some students. For all the benefits that accrue to earning traditional two- and four-year degrees, large populations of learners need something different. Tailored, short-term, skills-based programs and credentials in everything from data science to graphic design should be widely accessible -- and they should be simple to acquire and reacquire over a lifetime, to meet changing needs. Whenever possible, students should be able to combine them, over time, into two- or four-year degrees. Remember, much of the growth in skills-based credentials seems to be coming from people who already have degrees and want to supplement them with additional skills. They're taking a "both/and" approach to get ahead, not giving up on degrees altogether.
We often hear that the strong preference for degrees isn't fair to the majority of Americans who didn't go to college. But that majority is falling fast, and the percentage of college-educated American adults is pushing 50 percent when associate degrees are included. And while the percentage of Black and Latino college graduates is significantly lower, it is far higher than a few decades earlier. In fact, in 1960, only 41 percent of Americans had completed high school. It might have been plausible then to argue that plenty of dropouts had great talents and were unfairly penalized by high school diploma requirements. But it would have been badly misguided to oppose efforts to vastly improve high school graduation rates, which stand at 91 percent today.
College degree requirements aren't sacred. But they reflect the unmistakable reality that higher education helps people do well.

Raimondo Heads to China To Push Trade, and Curb It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The commerce secretary's trip may be the clearest demonstration yet of the balancing act the Biden administration is trying to pull off in its relations with China.
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, is heading to China on Saturday with two seemingly contradictory responsibilities: a mandate to strengthen U.S. business relations with Beijing while also imposing some of the toughest Chinese trade restrictions in years.
The head of the Commerce Department is traditionally the government's biggest champion for the business community both at home and abroad, promoting the kind of extensive ties U.S. firms have with China, the world's second-largest economy.
But U.S.-China relations have turned chillier as China has become more aggressive in flexing its economic and military might. While China remains an important economic partner, American officials have increasingly viewed the country as a security threat and have imposed a raft of new restrictions aimed at crippling Beijing's access to technology that could be used to strengthen the Chinese military or security services.
The bulk of those restrictions -- which have stoked anger and irritation from the Chinese government -- have been imposed by Ms. Raimondo's agency.
The Commerce Department has issued extensive trade restrictions on sales of chips, software and machinery to China's semiconductor industry and is mulling an expansion of those rules that could be issued soon after Ms. Raimondo returns to Washington.
Her visit could be the biggest test yet of whether the Biden administration can pull off the balancing act of promoting economic ties with China while clamping down on some trade in the interest of national security.
Ms. Raimondo will be the fourth administration official to travel to China in recent months, following John Kerry, the president's special envoy for climate change; Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen; and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
Ms. Raimondo is expected to reiterate what her counterparts have told Chinese officials: that there is no contradiction between the administration's goals for encouraging commercial engagement with China and protecting U.S. national security. They argue that the United States can maintain economic ties with China that benefit both countries and encourage peace, while also setting narrow but tough restrictions on China's access to advanced technology in the interest of national defense.
But the approach faces skepticism in both countries. In the United States, some Republicans argue that even more innocuous business ties with China could undercut U.S. industries and leave the nation vulnerable to influence from Beijing. And in China, many view what the U.S. government describes as narrow, national-security-related actions as a poorly disguised effort to hold back the Chinese economy.
"I think the Commerce Department has tried to be very targeted," said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. "Now, the Chinese side won't see it that way."
For Chinese officials, Ms. Raimondo simultaneously represents some of their best opportunities for engagement with the United States and their biggest source of frustration.
Experts say her visit presents a chance for Chinese leaders to strengthen trade relations and signal that their country is still open to international business at a moment when the Chinese economy has stumbled, foreign investment has declined and a series of raids on companies with foreign ties have set executives on edge.
But Chinese officials have also harshly criticized the technology curbs issued by her department, a condemnation they are likely to repeat in the week ahead. Officials in Beijing have also been highly critical of the new restrictions on American investment in certain high-tech Chinese industries, which the Biden administration proposed earlier this month.
At a summit in South Africa this week, a Chinese official delivered a prepared statement from Chinese leader Xi Jinping that called for the world to avoid "the abyss of a new Cold War" and blamed "some country, obsessed with maintaining its hegemony" for working to cripple emerging markets and developing countries.
In addition to export controls, Ms. Raimondo is overseeing the distribution of $ 50 billion to chip companies that build facilities in the United States. Any company that accepts that funding must agree not to build new factories for making advanced chips in China for at least a decade.
"The Biden administration is probing for a way to engage the Chinese in a very difficult environment," said Myron Brilliant, a senior counselor at Dentons Global Advisors-ASG who was formerly the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "It's a balancing act for sure, between the national security agenda they are enforcing, while also recognizing that a lot of trade between the countries doesn't touch on national security considerations and should therefore not be restricted."
Ms. Raimondo is set to meet with high-level Chinese officials and representatives of American businesses in Beijing and Shanghai between Monday and Wednesday. People familiar with the government's planning say those talks may result in the creation of working groups to discuss export controls and commercial issues that arise between China and the United States.
American businesses are also hoping that the Biden administration will push for additional intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical companies, more access to the Chinese market for Visa and Mastercard and the completion of a longstanding Chinese order of Boeing airplanes, among other goals, people familiar with the talks said.
But those gains, while important for American firms, would still seem trivial compared with the mounting pressures U.S. companies can now face in China.
China's sputtering economy and harsh lockdowns during the pandemic are giving pause to businesses considering their presence in the country. The Chinese government has also restricted companies sending data from China abroad, making it more difficult for multinationals to do business.
Chinese authorities have responded to increasing technology restrictions from the United States by barring the U.S. chip-maker Micron from sales to companies that handle critical Chinese information and by scuttling a proposed merger between Intel and an Israeli chip-maker with operations in China. And companies exporting from China still face nearly the full suite of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, in addition to the new export controls.
The Biden administration has acknowledged the tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, saying that China poses a threat to U.S. national security but that it is still one of the country's most integral economic partners.
"This isn't about, you know, holding China back or denying them commodity technology," Ms. Raimondo said of the export controls at an event at the American Enterprise Institute in July. "Certainly not about denying U.S. companies revenue. It's about being honest about the fact that China has a military civil fusion strategy, which includes getting our most sophisticated technology and using it to advance their military. And we're not going to allow that."
The United States has for decades imposed export controls on the types of technology that can be sent to China, including restricting sales of satellites and other technology following Beijing's crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But limits on technology trade with China have increased substantially in recent years, since the Trump administration imposed restrictions on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei. In October, the Biden administration expanded the limits to all firms using advanced chips in China.
Chip firms, which earn a third or more of their global revenue through sales to China, have also pushed back, saying that the new restrictions are resulting in less money to invest in new research and innovation.In July, the chief executives of Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel met with Ms. Raimondo in Washington to make that case.
It's not clear how much influence, if any, their lobbying will have on the rules. Ms. Raimondo, a former venture capitalist and governor of Rhode Island, has a long reputation as a business-friendly and pragmatic political actor. But as commerce secretary, she has repeatedly argued that the United States could not compromise on issues of national security.
"We are not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China's," Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in November. "We want to continue to promote trade and investment in those areas that do not undermine our interests or values."

Nvidia Revenue Doubles on Demand for A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales for the current quarter will nearly triple their total a year ago, said the company, which makes chips essential to the development of A.I. systems.
In a sign that the tech industry's next big boom is picking up steam, Nvidia on Wednesday predicted rapid growth in the already rabid demand for the chips it makes to build artificial intelligence systems.
The Silicon Valley company's products, called graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create the vast majority of A.I. systems, including the popular ChatGPT chatbot. Tech companies ranging from start-ups to the industry's giants are fighting to get their hands on them.
Nvidia said heavy demand from cloud computing services and other customers for chips to power A.I. systems caused revenue for its second quarter, which ended in July, to jump 101 percent from a year earlier, to $ 13.5 billion, while profit surged more than ninefold to nearly $ 6.2 billion.
That was even better than what Nvidia had projected in late May, when its $ 11 billion revenue estimate for the quarter stunned Wall Street and helped push Nvidia's market value above $ 1 trillion for the first time.
Nvidia's prediction and lofty market cap became a symbol for the growing exuberance surrounding A.I., which is transforming many computing systems and the way they are programmed. They also sharply raised the interest in what Nvidia might say the next time about chip demand for its current quarter, which ends in October.
Nvidia projected third-quarter sales of $ 16 billion, nearly triple the level a year ago and $ 3.7 billion more than analysts' average expectations of around $ 12.3 billion.
The financial performance of chip makers is often considered a harbinger for the rest of the tech industry, and Nvidia's strong results could reignite enthusiasm for tech stocks on Wall Street. Other tech companies like Google and Microsoft are spending billions and making little on A.I., but Nvidia is cashing in.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry. "The number of applications is just quite spectacular," he said in an interview after a conference call with analysts. "Every single data center will be accelerated."
Nvidia's share price was up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading.
Until recently, Nvidia got the biggest share of its revenue from sales of GPUs for rendering images in video games. But A.I. researchers started using those chips in 2012 for tasks such as machine learning, a trend that Nvidia exploited over the years by adding enhancements to its GPUs and many pieces of software to reduce labor for A.I. programmers.
Chip sales for data centers, where most A.I. training is accomplished, are now the company's biggest business. Revenue from that business grew 171 percent to $ 10.3 billion in the second period, Nvidia said.
Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the rush to add generative A.I. capability has become a fundamental imperative to corporate chiefs and boards of directors. Nvidia's only limitation at the moment, he said, is its struggle to supply enough chips -- a gap that may create opportunities for major chip companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and start-ups such as Groq.
Nvidia's roaring sales contrasted sharply with the fortunes of some of its chip industry peers, which have been hurt by soft demand for personal computers and data center servers used for general-purpose tasks. Intel said in late July that second-quarter revenue fell 15 percent, though the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Revenue at Advanced Micro Devices fell 18 percent in the same period.
Some analysts believe that spending on A.I.-specific hardware, such as Nvidia's chips and systems that use them, is drawing money away from spending on other data center infrastructure. IDC, a market research firm, estimates that cloud services will increase their spending on server systems for A.I. by 68 percent over the next five years.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
Demand is particularly heavy for the H100, a new GPU made by Nvidia for A.I. applications, which began shipping in September. Large and small companies have been scrambling to find supplies of the chips, which are fabricated in an advanced production process and require equally sophisticated packaging that combines GPUs with special memory chips.
Nvidia's ability to increase deliveries of the H100 is largely linked to actions by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which handles the packaging as well as fabricating the GPUs.
Industry executives expect the shortage of H100s to extend throughout 2024, a problem for A.I. start-ups and cloud services hoping to sell computing services that exploit the new GPUs.
Mr. Huang said the company was working diligently with its production partners to get more chips to market, including working with other companies to supplement TSMC's packaging capability. "Supply will substantially increase the rest of this year and next year," he said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry.

How Nvidia Became A.I.'s One-Stop Shop: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The most visible winner of the artificial intelligence boom achieved its dominance by becoming a one-stop shop for A.I. development, from chips to software to other services.
Naveen Rao, a neuroscientist turned tech entrepreneur, once tried to compete with Nvidia, the world's leading maker of chips tailored for artificial intelligence.
At a start-up that the semiconductor giant Intel later bought, Mr. Rao worked on chips intended to replace Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are components adapted for A.I. tasks like machine learning. But while Intel moved slowly, Nvidia swiftly upgraded its products with new A.I. features that countered what he was developing, Mr. Rao said.
After leaving Intel and leading a software start-up, MosaicML, Mr. Rao used Nvidia's chips and evaluated them against those from rivals. He found that Nvidia had differentiated itself beyond the chips by creating a large community of A.I. programmers who consistently invent using the company's technology.
"Everybody builds on Nvidia first," Mr. Rao said. "If you come out with a new piece of hardware, you're racing to catch up."
Over more than 10 years, Nvidia has built a nearly impregnable lead in producing chips that can perform complex A.I. tasks like image, facial and speech recognition, as well as generating text for chatbots like ChatGPT. The onetime industry upstart achieved that dominance by recognizing the A.I. trend early, tailoring its chips to those tasks and then developing key pieces of software that aid in A.I. development.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, has since kept raising the bar. To maintain its leading position, his company has also offered customers access to specialized computers, computing services and other tools of their emerging trade. That has turned Nvidia, for all intents and purposes, into a one-stop shop for A.I. development.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
In May, the company's status as the most visible winner of the A.I. revolution became clear when it projected a 64 percent leap in quarterly revenue, far more than Wall Street had expected. On Wednesday, Nvidia -- which has surged past $ 1 trillion in market capitalization to become the world's most valuable chip maker -- is expected to confirm those record results and provide more signals about booming A.I. demand.
"Customers will wait 18 months to buy an Nvidia system rather than buy an available, off-the-shelf chip from either a start-up or another competitor," said Daniel Newman, an analyst at Futurum Group. "It's incredible."
Mr. Huang, 60, who is known for a trademark black leather jacket, talked up A.I. for years before becoming one of the movement's best-known faces. He has publicly said computing is going through its biggest shift since IBM defined how most systems and software operate 60 years ago. Now, he said, GPUs and other special-purpose chips are replacing standard microprocessors, and A.I. chatbots are replacing complex software coding.
"The thing that we understood is that this is a reinvention of how computing is done," Mr. Huang said in an interview. "And we built everything from the ground up, from the processor all the way up to the end."
Mr. Huang helped start Nvidia in 1993 to make chips that render images in video games. While standard microprocessors excel at performing complex calculations sequentially, the company's GPUs do many simple tasks at once.
In 2006, Mr. Huang took that further. He announced software technology called CUDA, which helped program the GPUs for new tasks, turning them from single-purpose chips to more general-purpose ones that could take on other jobs in fields like physics and chemical simulations.
A big breakthrough came in 2012 when researchers used GPUs to achieve humanlike accuracy in tasks such as recognizing a cat in an image -- a precursor to recent developments like generating images from text prompts.
Nvidia responded by turning "every aspect of our company to advance this new field," Mr. Jensen recently said in a commencement speech at National Taiwan University.
The effort, which the company estimated has cost more than $ 30 billion over a decade, made Nvidia more than a component supplier. Besides collaborating with leading scientists and start-ups, the company built a team that directly participates in A.I. activities like creating and training language models.
Advance warning about what A.I. practitioners need led Nvidia to develop many layers of key software beyond CUDA. Those included hundreds of prebuilt pieces of code, called libraries, that save labor for programmers.
In hardware, Nvidia gained a reputation for consistently delivering faster chips every couple of years. In 2017, it started tweaking GPUs to handle specific A.I. calculations.
That same year, Nvidia, which typically sold chips or circuit boards for other companies' systems, also began selling complete computers to carry out A.I. tasks more efficiently. Some of its systems are now the size of supercomputers, which it assembles and operates using proprietary networking technology and thousands of GPUs. Such hardware may run weeks to train the latest A.I. models.
"This type of computing doesn't allow for you to just build a chip and customers use it," Mr. Huang said in the interview. "You've got to build the whole data center."
Last September, Nvidia announced the production of new chips named H100, which it enhanced to handle so-called transformer operations. Such calculations turned out to be the foundation for services like ChatGPT, which have prompted what Mr. Huang calls the "iPhone moment" of generative A.I.
To further extend its influence, Nvidia has also recently forged partnerships with big tech companies and invested in high-profile A.I. start-ups that use its chips. One was Inflection AI, which in June announced $ 1.3 billion in funding from Nvidia and others. The money was used to help finance the purchase of 22,000 H100 chips.
Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said that there was no obligation to use Nvidia's products but that competitors offered no viable alternative. "None of them come close," he said.
Nvidia has also directed cash and scarce H100s lately to upstart cloud services, such as CoreWeave, that allow companies to rent time on computers rather than buying their own. CoreWeave, which will operate Inflection's hardware and owns more than 45,000 Nvidia chips, raised $ 2.3 billion in debt this month to help buy more.
Given the demand for its chips, Nvidia must decide who gets how many of them. That power makes some tech executives uneasy.
"It's really important that hardware doesn't become a bottleneck for A.I. or gatekeeper for A.I.," said Clément Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face, an online repository for language models that collaborates with Nvidia and its competitors.
Some rivals said it was tough to compete with a company that sold computers, software, cloud services and trained A.I. models, as well as processors.
"Unlike any other chip company, they have been willing to openly compete with their customers," said Andrew Feldman, chief executive of Cerebras, a start-up that develops A.I. chips.
But few customers are complaining, at least publicly. Even Google, which began creating competing A.I. chips more than a decade ago, relies on Nvidia's GPUs for some of its work.
Demand for Google's own chips is "tremendous," said Amin Vahdat, a Google vice president and general manager of compute infrastructure. But, he added, "we work really closely with Nvidia."
Nvidia doesn't discuss prices or chip allocation policies, but industry executives and analysts said each H100 costs $ 15,000 to more than $ 40,000, depending on packaging and other factors -- roughly two to three times more than the predecessor A100 chip.
Pricing "is one place where Nvidia has left a lot of room for other folks to compete," said David Brown, a vice president at Amazon's cloud unit, arguing that its own A.I. chips are a bargain compared with the Nvidia chips it also uses.
Mr. Huang said his chips' greater performance saved customers money. "If you can reduce the time of training to half on a $ 5 billion data center, the savings is more than the cost of all of the chips," he said. "We are the lowest-cost solution in the world."
He has also started promoting a new product, Grace Hopper, which combines GPUs with internally developed microprocessors, countering chips that rivals say use much less energy for running A.I. services.
Still, more competition seems inevitable. One of the most promising entrants in the race is a GPU sold by Advanced Micro Devices, said Mr. Rao, whose start-up was recently purchased by the data and A.I. company DataBricks.
"No matter how anybody wants to say it's all done, it's not all done," Lisa Su, AMD's chief executive, said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street weakened on Wednesday to worsen what has already been a messy August.
The S&P 500 fell 33.53, or 0.8 percent, to 4,404.33, following the previous day's tumble of 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 180.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 34,765.74, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 156.42, or 1.1 percent, to 13,474.63.
Increased pressure came from the bond market, where yields have recently neared their highest levels since the severe recession of 2007-09 caused interest rates to collapse. Yields climbed more following the afternoon release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.
The minutes suggested that Fed officials were unsure about their next move, after catapulting the main interest rate to its highest level in more than two decades. Hopes had been rising among investors that last month's rate increase by the Fed would prove to be its last for now.
High rates work to grind down inflation by bluntly slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. The Fed's minutes showed that officials still don not think the job on inflation is done but that they also acknowledge the risk of going too far and torpedoing the economy. They said they would make upcoming decisions based on what data reports about inflation and the economy tell them.
Some analysts took the minutes as a suggestion that another rate hike is possible, while others said it shows the Fed is likely done with its increases.
"Ultimately there were no major surprises in the minutes, as the Fed is expected to remain data dependent when determining the path of monetary policy through the end of the year," said Sam Millette, fixed-income strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.
Big technology stocks and other investments seen as vulnerable to higher rates were some of the day's heaviest weights on indexes. Tesla fell 3.2 percent. Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, dropped 2.5 percent, and Amazon fell 1.9 percent.
Wall Street has generally been retrenching this month because of several concerns that include worries that the torrid gains made this year through July were overdone and that interest rates may stay high for longer.
A surprisingly strong report on sales at U.S. retailers helped cause Tuesday's slide in stocks, as it suggested that upward pressure on inflation still exists. While strong economic reports calm long-held worries about a possible recession, they could also end up keeping rates higher for longer.
Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. industrial production had improved by more than economists had expected last month. Home builders also broke ground on more homes.
Treasury yields have been generally climbing as reports paint a picture of a still-solid economy. That weighs on stocks because when safe bonds are paying more in interest, investors feel less pressure to pay high prices for stocks and other risky investments.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.26 percent, from 4.22 percent late Tuesday. The yield is close to where it was when the 2007-09 recession sent interest rates crashing. The 10-year yield helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security, which takes inflation into account, is at its highest level since 2009, according to Tradeweb.
On Wall Street, Intel stock fell 3.6 percent after it agreed to call off its $ 5.4 billion buyout of the Israeli chip maker Tower Semiconductor. The deal faced resistance from Chinese regulators.
Agilent Technologies fell 3.4 percent despite reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecasts for upcoming results, including revenue for the full year, fell short of expectations. It pointed to a challenging economy, particularly in China.

China Scuttles Intel's $5.4 Billion Chip Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Intel calls off its planned acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli chip maker, after waiting in vain for 18 months for a review by Chinese regulators.
China has effectively scuttled a $ 5.4 billion deal by Intel, the Silicon Valley semiconductor giant, in the latest sign of the frayed business ties between China and the United States.
Intel, which has long had operations in China, said Wednesday that it had "mutually agreed" to terminate a planned merger with Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli chip manufacturer. The announcement came after China's antitrust regulators failed to rule on the transaction before a deadline set by the companies.
The failure of Intel to complete the acquisition of Tower could send a further chill through American companies with deep ties in China, where it is becoming increasingly difficult to do business amid tensions between the two countries.
The planned merger, announced in February 2022, passed an antitrust review in the United States and several other geographies. But it ran into a lengthy delay in China, where regulators review mergers of companies that earn a certain amount of revenue in the country.
Technology is the prime battlefield in the tense economic relations between China and the United States.
Beijing is deeply upset by an American-led set of international restrictions on the sale to China of the most advanced computer chips, which have military applications, and of the factory equipment to make such chips. Those restrictions were put in place in October. In a separate action, President Biden last week ordered a ban on certain new investments in sensitive Chinese technology.
China has condemned the moves as an effort by Washington to throttle its tech development and slow its economic growth.
Despite the raw tensions between the countries, their economies remain highly interconnected, dependent on one another's supply chains, technology and investment money.
For Intel, China is both a major marketplace and place of business: In 2022, the company employed more than 12,000 people there, and made more than $ 17 billion in revenue, about 27 percent of its global total. It started doing business in China in the mid-1980s, with operations that include assembling and testing chips manufactured elsewhere.
Intel, which is struggling to regain a lead in chip production technology, hoped the merger with Tower would help accelerate a shift to become a major manufacturer for other designers of chips. Intel has previously mainly used its factories to produce chips it both designs and sells.
Tower, which has an office in Shanghai, was founded in 1993 and operates a relatively small chip manufacturing service compared with giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel will pay Tower $ 353 million for failing to close the deal, according to a statement by Intel.
Intel's inability to get the merger approved in China underlines what could become an increasingly hard choice for multinationals: They may need to choose between having operations in China or carrying out mergers and acquisitions around the globe. Such concerns could produce a further chill on foreign investment in China, which has already plunged this year because of geopolitical concerns.
The Chinese government agency that decides whether to approve global mergers, the State Administration for Market Regulation, is now "in an uncomfortable spotlight as a proxy for China's commitment to market access for foreign investors," said Han Shen Lin, the China country director for The Asia Group, an advisory firm in Washington.
Before the agency was established in 2018, global mergers were reviewed in China mainly by a unit of the Ministry of Commerce, which is dominated by civil servants with extensive international experience and contact with foreign businesses and governments.
The State Administration for Market Regulation, by contrast, is categorized within the Chinese bureaucracy as primarily a domestic agency, and its officials have shunned most contact with foreign governments, embassies or businesses.
Patrick Gelsinger, who became Intel's chief executive in early 2021, has pushed to add what the industry calls chip foundry services, in part to attract U.S. government subsidies under legislation passed a year ago. He recently traveled to China to help get the Tower deal approved.
"We continue to drive forward on all facets of our strategy," Mr. Gelsinger said in a statement on Wednesday.
Intel's fabrication plants, or fabs, tend to specialize in advanced production processes used to make microprocessors and other digital chips. Tower, by contrast, is best-known for older technology that produces analog chips, which are used for jobs like amplifying signals and managing power in cellphones and other products.
The company now owns two fabs in Israel, two in the United States, three in Japan and is participating in a joint manufacturing venture in Italy.

Can a Chip Hub Grow In Indiana's Heartland?: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over the past 14 months, Indiana began converting 10,000 acres of corn and bean fields into an innovation park. State leaders met with the chief executives of semiconductor giants in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And they hosted top Biden administration officials to show off a $ 100 million expansion of chip research and development facilities at a local university.
The actions were driven by one main goal: to turn Indiana into a microchip manufacturing and research hub, almost from scratch.
"We've never done anything at this scale," said Brad Chambers, who was Indiana's commerce secretary in charge of economic development. "It's a multibillion-dollar commitment by the state to be ready for the transitions that are happening in our global economy."
Indiana's moves are a test of the Biden administration's efforts to stimulate regional economies through the $ 52 billion CHIPS and Science Act, a landmark package of funding that is planned to begin going out the door in the next few months. The program is intended to bolster domestic manufacturing and research of semiconductors, which act as the brains of computers and other products and have become central to the U.S. battle with China for tech primacy.
The Biden administration has promised that the CHIPS Act will seed high-paying tech jobs and start-ups even in places with little foundation in the tech industry. In a speech in May last year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees the chips program, said she was looking at how the program would help "different places in the heartland of America."
She added, "I think we will really unleash an unbelievable torrent of entrepreneurship and capital opportunity."
That makes Indiana a prime case study for whether the administration's efforts will pan out. Unlike Arizona and Texas, which have long had chip-making plants, Indiana has little experience with the complicated manufacturing processes underlying the components, beyond electric vehicle battery manufacturing and some defense technology projects that involve semiconductors.
Indiana now wants to catch up to other places that have landed big chip manufacturing plants. The push is supported by Senator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, who was a co-author on the CHIPS Act and has been a leading voice on increasing funds for tech hubs. Companies and universities in Indiana have applied for multiple CHIPS Act grants, with the aim of winning awards not only for chip manufacturing but also for research and development.
Some economists said the Biden administration's goals of turning farmland into advanced chip factories might be overly ambitious. It took decades for Silicon Valley and the Boston tech corridor to thrive. Those regions succeeded because of their strong academic research universities, big anchor companies, skilled workers and investors.
Many other areas don't have that combination of assets. Indiana has for decades faced a brain drain among some of its more educated young people who flock to larger cities for work, according to the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. Some industrial policy proponents see the investments as a way to reverse that exodus, as well as a broader trend toward deindustrialization that hollowed out communities in the Rust Belt.
But it's unclear whether the program can achieve such ambitious goals -- or whether the Biden administration will judge it to be more effective to spread out investments around the country or concentrate them in a few key hubs.
"Many pieces have to come together," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He added that the federal government's plan to initially put $ 500 million into tech hubs was too small and estimated it would take $ 100 billion in government aid to create 10 sustainable tech hubs.
Indiana does have some advantages. The state has ample land and water -- which are necessary for large chip factories that use water to cool equipment and rinse silicon wafers -- and it has relatively stable weather for the highly sensitive production process. It also has Purdue University, with an engineering school that has promised to turn out the technicians and researchers needed for chip production.
Yet the state faces stiff competition. In January 2022, Indiana lost a bidding war to Ohio over plans by Intel, the big U.S. chip-maker, to build two factories valued at $ 20 billion.
"We learned a lot of lessons," Mr. Chambers said about the failure. The biggest, he said, was to have a more attractive package of land, infrastructure and work force programs ready to offer big chip companies.
A year later, Indiana won a $ 1.8 billion investment from SkyWater, a Minneapolis-based chip-maker, to build a factory with 750 jobs adjacent to Purdue's campus.
State leaders acknowledge that any tech transformation could take years, especially if there is no anchor plant by even larger chip manufacturers such as TSMC, the world's biggest maker of cutting-edge chips.
Mr. Young said he and other state leaders were in talks with big chip makers for a contract that would compare to the $ 20 billion that Intel committed to Ohio. But "all net new job creation in my lifetime has been created by new firms and young firms," he said.
Indiana's chip-making metamorphosis is now centered on a tech park, LEAP Innovation District, in the town of Lebanon near Interstate 65, which connects Indianapolis and Purdue in West Lafayette. The town is surrounded by 15 square miles of corn and bean farms.
The park began taking shape along with the CHIPS Act. In 2019, Mr. Young was a co-author of the Endless Frontier Act with Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York and then the Senate minority leader. The bill was the precursor to the CHIPS Act.
As the bill wound through Congress, Mr. Young was in regular contact with Eric Holcomb, Indiana's governor, and Mitch Daniels, then Purdue's president, on details of the proposal. Mr. Young said Indiana's manufacturing roots would be its asset, if the state's factory sector could transition to making advanced chips.
"I realized that Indiana and, more broadly, the heartland stood to disproportionately benefit from the investments that we would be making," he said in an interview last month.
Mr. Holcomb and Mr. Chambers then created a plan for a tech manufacturing park. Within months, they began buying corn and bean farms in Lebanon for what became the LEAP Innovation District.
In May 2022, Mr. Holcomb unveiled LEAP and began installing new water and power lines and a new road there. Mr. Holcomb, Mr. Chambers and Mr. Young also traveled to more than a dozen countries to meet with the executives of chip companies like SK Hynix and TSMC. They offered cheap rent in the LEAP district, tax incentives, access to labs and researchers at Purdue, and training programs at the local Ivy Tech Community College.
Some of the work paid off. When Indiana beat out four other states for SkyWater's $ 1.8 billion chip facility, the company said it was impressed by the coordination between state leaders and Purdue's new president, Mung Chiang, who launched the nation's first semiconductor degree programs to nurture workers for chip makers.
In September, Mr. Chiang invited Ms. Raimondo and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to tour Purdue's clean rooms for chip research and to see plans for a $ 100 million expansion of semiconductor research and development, including 50 new faculty to work on advanced chip science.
"I think you have all the ingredients," Ms. Raimondo said in a discussion with Mr. Holcomb and Mr. Chiang during the visit.
Indiana officials now await word on how much CHIPS Act funding they may get. Some early results from the LEAP district initiative offer a mixed picture of where things might go.

In May 2022, the park landed its first tenant -- Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, not a chip maker.

Using Clout, Schumer Aims to Funnel Chip Funds to New York: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Senate majority leader helped deliver billions of dollars in federal funding for semiconductors. Now he's pushing for his state to reap benefits.
In a darkened hotel ballroom in San Jose, Calif., last November, the most powerful players in the semiconductor industry received a familiar sales pitch.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, appeared by video message to urge the industry titans at the Semiconductor Industry Association's annual awards dinner to work together to strengthen American manufacturing of a critical technology -- and to invest more in his home state, New York.
"I ask that more of the industry consider investing in the Empire State, and if you do, you'll find no greater champion in your corner than me, the Senate majority leader," Mr. Schumer said, to cheers and laughs of recognition from a crowd accustomed to the senator's solicitations.
Amid growing fears about China's dominance of technology and America's loss of competitiveness, Mr. Schumer helped rally Congress last year to push through the biggest industrial policy programs the United States had seen in a generation. The Biden administration is now preparing to invest tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. semiconductor industry in an effort to boost chip manufacturing across the country and lessen U.S. reliance on foreign factories.
If Mr. Schumer gets his way, a substantial part of that funding will flow to New York.
In his encounters with chip executives, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and President Biden himself, Mr. Schumer has openly and aggressively drawn on his political capital as majority leader to try to channel investment to his home state. During the months when Congress was debating whether to approve that funding, industry executives who set foot in Mr. Schumer's office or spoke to him on the flip phone he carries in his breast pocket were asked when, not if, they would invest in New York.
Mr. Schumer, a longtime China critic, primarily views the investments as critical to reducing America's reliance on Beijing for a technology that powers everything from cars and dishwashers to missiles and fighter jets. Most chip production has moved to Asia in recent decades, leaving the U.S. economy highly vulnerable to shortages, as became apparent during the pandemic.
But he also saw the opportunity to fulfill a more personal goal: securing investment that could revive the factory towns of his state, which had been hollowed out through decades of competition with China. The move would also augment his local political support, attract donations from chip companies to fill Democratic coffers and cement his legacy as a proponent of upstate New York.
"I cared about upstate, and I cared about competition with China," Mr. Schumer said in an interview in Albany in June. "When I drafted the legislation, I did things with New York companies in mind."
Senate majority leaders and other legislators have long used their clout to drive federal funds back home. But Mr. Schumer is capitalizing on his position at an opportune moment, as the United States prepares to invest nearly $ 53 billion in the sector, including $ 11 billion for chip research and $ 39 billion in manufacturing grants.
Still, some critics have cautioned that economic and strategic factors, not political influence, must determine the investment decisions that could shape the U.S. economy for decades to come.
If the proposed investments are realized, New York could become one of the country's busiest hubs for chip production. Chip makers like GlobalFoundries, IBM, Onsemi and Wolfspeed are applying for funds to build or expand facilities there. Micron Technology, a memory chip maker, is proposing to invest up to $ 100 billion near Syracuse over the next two decades to build what would be the largest high-tech chips facility proposed in the United States, employing up to 9,000 people.
Mr. Schumer is also pushing for New York to play a leading role in semiconductor research, as the headquarters of a new federal chip research organization.
Competition for federal funding is expected to be fierce. By late June, the Commerce Department -- which will dole out the funds -- had received nearly 400 statements of interest from companies that intended to apply for money.
"I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money," Ms. Raimondo said in February.
New York has already faced some setbacks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Intel, makers of the most cutting-edge types of logic chips, passed over the state in recent years in favor of Arizona, Texas and Ohio, where they are now building large facilities that could absorb a significant portion of government funding.
Chip industry executives say practical factors, like the cost of electricity, land and capital, the availability of workers and the proximity of their suppliers, weigh heaviest in their decisions about where to invest.
But the pressure from Mr. Schumer -- and from other influential lawmakers, university presidents and company executives who helped secure the funding -- raises questions about the role powerful political figures will play in the next chapter of American industrial policy.
"I think there is and ought to be a lot of skepticism about political players having a major say in decision making over where these funds are spent," said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University and the author of "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
"If you want effective industrial policy, you have to keep it as far away as possible from pork barrel politics," he said.
The Commerce Department has been hiring experts in finance and semiconductors to review company applications, and it has set up a selection committee to choose the board for the new research center, called the National Semiconductor Technology Center. The department appears to be trying to avoid any undue influence or favoritism.
"Our awards will be entirely dependent upon the strength of applications and which projects will advance U.S. economic and national security interests," the Commerce Department said in a statement.
Mr. Schumer insists that New York will win federal dollars on its own merits, but he is also explicit about the benefit his position brings. In June, as he walked the sunlit halls of the Albany NanoTech Complex, a long-running chip research and educational facility, Mr. Schumer said he "did not close out a single discussion" with a semiconductor company without encouraging it to invest in New York.
New York has five main advantages, he told executives: Skilled workers, stemming from New York's history of manufacturing. Cheap and plentiful water. Cheap hydropower. Shovel-ready sites for companies to build on.
"And fifth, they had the majority leader," he said.
In a yellow-lit clean room behind Mr. Schumer, workers in white protective suits were tending to hundreds of millions of dollars of advanced machinery. On tracks overhead, mechanized metal pails whizzed by carrying silicon wafers, each roughly the size of a record, to and from the machines, where they would be imprinted with layers of intricate circuitry.
Mr. Schumer paused to peer over his reading glasses at a smooth, white box the size of a mobile home: an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, made by the Dutch firm ASML, arguably the most advanced piece of machinery ever developed.
Albany NanoTech is the only public research facility in the United States with such a machine. The facility is applying for federal funding to build a new clean room in an adjacent parking lot, and it hopes to become home to part of the government's new research center.
"This is the perfect place," Mr. Schumer said. "When we wrote the CHIPS and Science bill to set up a National Semiconductor Technology Center, I had Albany in mind. And I'm pushing to get it."
Mr. Schumer said he had personally made that case to a parade of administration officials he brought through the state. That included Mr. Biden, who was pitched on New York's potential as the two men rode in a motorcade to hear Micron's investment announcement last October.
By his telling, Mr. Schumer's efforts on behalf of upstate New York are a personal mission, stemming in part from an early challenge from a political opponent who told voters that they would never see Mr. Schumer, a Brooklyn native, west of the Hudson River. As he watched companies like General Motors, General Electric and Carrier shutter their New York facilities, he said, he vowed to do something to stop the flow of young people out of the state.
Mr. Schumer had also been one of Congress's earliest China hawks, particularly on the issue of Chinese currency manipulation. During a workout in 2019 in the Senate gym, he began forming a plan with Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, to bolster the U.S. economy by dedicating over $ 100 billion to technology research.
It took two years -- and an aggressive, coordinated lobbying effort between government and industry -- to amass the support and momentum to turn that bill into law. Mr. Schumer and other key Republican and Democratic lawmakers enlisted company executives, university presidents and state officials to talk publicly about the importance of the funding, and put pressure on reluctant members of Congress.
Mr. Schumer also worked closely with Ms. Raimondo to push the bill forward. He called her frequently as obstacles arose, including during Sunday Mass and her daughter's 18th birthday party, she said in an interview in July 2022.
As the bill progressed, the prospect of funding for new U.S. factories touched off an elaborate game of courtship among legislators, state officials and companies.
The number of chip lobbyists in Washington multiplied. Companies like GlobalFoundries and Intel, which stood to benefit enormously from the legislation, hosted or attended fund-raisers and virtual events for Mr. Schumer in the months before the CHIPS Act was passed. From the beginning of 2021 through June 2023, political action committees linked with Mr. Schumer received more than $ 350,000 in donations from executives at chip companies and their suppliers, including $ 5,000 from Intel's chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, data from the Federal Election Commission shows.
New York played host to a series of chip companies considering potential investments, particularly for the plot that Micron now plans to build on. TSMC looked at the site in 2019 before it chose Arizona, and Intel considered the same location but ultimately chose Ohio.
Micron was ready to write off New York because the state did not have a big enough site, Ryan McMahon, the local county executive, said. To win the final bid, the county spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring land, including buying out a street of homeowners, and running gas and electricity to the site, he said.
"If Schumer didn't introduce us, it's one of those things you wonder if it ever would have happened," Mr. McMahon, a Republican, said.
Mr. Schumer, along with other proponents, secured an investment tax credit in the chips legislation that Micron saw as key to making the economics of the project work. And at the urging of Gov. Kathy Hochul, state lawmakers passed their own chips subsidy bill to complement the federal one, approving up to $ 500 million a year in tax abatements to chip manufacturers.
Micron has said it plans to start construction next year and complete the first $ 20 billion phase of the factory by 2030. New York State has promised to give Micron $ 5.5 billion in tax credits over the life of the project if the company meets certain employment targets.
As the biggest maker of memory chips with headquarters in the United States, Micron is seen as a likely candidate for a federal grant. But other developments have thrown the project into question: Micron has recently become the subject of a crackdown in China that could cost the company an eighth of its global revenue, potentially undercutting its ability to make ambitious investments.
The deal has also been met with skepticism from local government watchdogs, who fear that Micron will become the latest firm to be offered taxpayer subsidies but fail to deliver the promised economic impact.
"It might be good geostrategic policy for the United States," said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a watchdog focused on the New York government. "But for New York, it's an incredibly low return on the investment of subsidy dollars."
For both Mr. Schumer and Governor Hochul, the Micron investment became a centerpiece of their electoral strategy last fall. With Republicans on their way to the best statewide showing in two decades, both Democrats packaged clips of themselves with Micron's chief executive into TV ads that blanketed parts of the state otherwise wary of Democrats' economic agenda.
"Transformational for upstate New York, transformational for America," Mr. Schumer said in one.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TSMC, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, said it would invest $ 3.8 billion in a joint project with three European industrial firms.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said on Tuesday that it would team up with three European technology firms to build a chip-making facility in eastern Germany as part of efforts to further diversify its production locations.
TSMC, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, said it would invest 3.5 billion euros ( $ 3.8 billion) and own 70 percent of the joint venture, in Dresden. The three other companies -- Robert Bosch and Infineon Technologies, both based in Germany, and NXP Semiconductors of the Netherlands -- will each control 10 percent.
The combined private and public investment, "including strong support from the European Union and German government," is expected to total €10 billion, the company said.
The plant would be TSMC's first location in Europe, and it represents a win for Germany, which has been seeking out manufacturers of microchips, the tiny devices essential for the country's large automotive industry and for building countless other devices.
"This investment in Dresden demonstrates TSMC's commitment to serving our customers' strategic capacity and technology needs," C.C. Wei, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. Construction would begin next year, with chip production expected to begin in 2027.
The semiconductors produced in Dresden will be not the company's latest technology but older generations of its chips, which the auto industry prefers. TSMC said the facility would produce up to 40,000 wafers a month, each of which can hold hundreds of microchips.
Germany is spending billions of euros to attract chipmakers. For the TSMC project, the government has pledged €5 billion, the German financial daily Handelsblatt reported. The government's economy ministry did not respond to a request for information on the amount.
Intel, the Silicon Valley chip-making giant, will receive €10 billion in state subsidies to build a plant in Germany. The government pledged hundreds of millions more to attract Wolfspeed, a North Carolina-based maker of silicon carbide chips.
The financial incentives are necessary, some say, because Germany is plagued by some of the highest energy prices in Europe and a byzantine bureaucracy that has caused many industries to reconsider investments in the country, despite its strong automotive sector.
Another obstacle could be finding enough skilled employees. Many German manufacturers say they are facing a dire lack of qualified workers, especially in the southern and eastern regions, including Saxony.
Last year Saxony recorded more than 25,600 job openings for which there were no qualified applicants, especially in electronics, computer science and software development.
Attracting qualified workers from other countries could be especially difficult, because the state of Saxony is home to a large and vocal far-right faction that has helped to cement anti-immigrant sentiment. According to the Else-Frenkel-Brunswik-Institute, which has been monitoring Germans' attitudes about democracy since 2002, nearly half of people surveyed in the eastern regions last year believed that foreigners were coming to Germany only to take advantage of the social welfare system.
Germany passed a law in June that would make it easier for companies to attract qualified foreigners to come work in the country. The law will take effect in November.
The facility in Dresden, which TSMC will operate, will be the company's fourth outside Taiwan, with construction already underway on two factories in Arizona and one in Japan.
But the Arizona plants have faced setbacks, and the company has deployed hundreds of Taiwanese technicians to expedite the process. Last month, TSMC delayed the expected start date by a year, to 2025. Internal tensions over cultural differences have also surfaced between TSMC and American workers.
On Tuesday, regional leaders in Germany hailed the latest news from the company. "Welcome to Silicon Saxony, TSMC," said Michael Kretschmer, the governor of Saxony. He said the announcement was the result of "several years of discussions and negotiations carried out in a spirit of trust."

Chip Maker Keeps Roots In Taiwan: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is manufacturing the world's most advanced microchips, conducts business on the island of Taiwan, dead center in one of the most geopolitically volatile places on the planet.
That makes people in Washington very nervous. TSMC dominates the semiconductor industry; it's a company that the United States can't do without, 80 miles off the coast of China.
The U.S. government has appropriated tens of billions of dollars to strengthen America's own semiconductor sector and help fund TSMC's nascent operations in the United States, far from China, which has never renounced the use of force to absorb Taiwan.
But TSMC has invested billions of its own over nearly four decades growing deep roots in Taiwan. There, it employs a small army of engineers, research and development scientists, technicians and production workers in the exquisitely complex task of producing chips, etching electronic pathways smaller than a cell on plates of silicon.
It would be exceedingly difficult to replicate what TSMC has built in Taiwan, said Mark Liu, chairman of TSMC. Developing and producing the company's most cutting-edge chips at a rapid pace requires a huge effort, he said, as many as 3,000 research scientists for one generation of the technology.
"We cannot put it anyplace else," he said.
TSMC has embarked on a global expansion, with two factories under construction in the United States and one in Japan, as well as a possible facility in Germany. It's part of the company's strategy to address the calls by U.S. officials to reduce America's reliance on chips made in Taiwan.
That makes the 68-year-old Mr. Liu, who holds a doctoral degree in electronic engineering and computer science, as much a diplomat as a scientist and an executive. He joined TSMC 30 years ago after stints at Intel and Bell Labs, rose through the ranks and today runs the $ 500 billion company with its chief executive and vice chairman, C.C. Wei.
In late June, when he spoke to The New York Times at TSMC's offices in the northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu, he had just returned from a trip to the United States, which he said he visits roughly every three months.
"We have a pretty good relationship across Congress, the Commerce Department, the White House. I think they know us," he said.
It's a bit of an understatement. Initial efforts to court TSMC and bring its production facilities to the United States led to the creation of the CHIPS and Science Act, a program to expand the U.S. semiconductor industry. So complete is TSMC's lead in the industry that there is no obvious second option for all it does. Any clash over Taiwan -- where the vast majority of its manufacturing happens -- would stop the flow of the TSMC microchips, putting a deep freeze on the technology industry and, in turn, the global economy.
As befits a company obsessed with protecting its hard-won technological lead, TSMC's offices feel more like a secret government research facility than a Silicon Valley campus.
Next to turnstiles where workers swipe their badges, a sign notes that five people have been fired since 2010 for breaking the company's strict internal security rules. One offense included improperly changing the subject line of an email in a reply. Outside phones are banned. Although policies have recently loosened up, employees tell stories of eating lunch in the parking lot so they can access their personal phones.
Windowless buildings the size of aircraft hangars operate 24 hours a day to produce microchips, the tiny brains inside smartphones, airplanes, supercomputers and just about anything else electronic.
Political leaders in the United States and its allies in trade battles with China have pushed TSMC to build production facilities outside Taiwan. And China has tried hard to compete with TSMC, using everything from hacks and intellectual property theft to hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.
As the United States has sought to hinder China's advances in semiconductor technology, TSMC has been caught in the middle. In 2020, TSMC cut off orders to the Chinese tech powerhouse Huawei, which was TSMC's second-largest customer at the time. Mr. Liu said TSMC, because it is reliant on American technology, had no choice.
"It's understandable, but support or not, we have no say," he said.
Mr. Liu rejected the idea of the "silicon shield": that Taiwan's chip-making prowess deters military action by China and brings support from the United States. Both need Taiwan's chips.
"China will not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors. China will not not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors," he said. "It is really up to the U.S. and China: How do they maintain the status quo, which both sides want?"
TSMC has made a $ 40 billion investment in Arizona to build two factories to produce chips that are one or two generations behind its most advanced ones. The company is expected to submit its application for CHIPS Act subsidies this month, Mr. Liu said.
The Arizona plants have been slow going, and the company has deployed hundreds of Taiwanese technicians to expedite the process. Last month it pushed back the expected start date by a year to 2025, and it has faced high costs and managerial challenges. Internal tensions over cultural differences have surfaced between TSMC and American workers.
And doubts loom over whether American companies will be willing to pay the likely premium required for chips made in Arizona, where TSMC's construction costs alone could be at least four times higher than they are in Taiwan. Mr. Liu said he had told the U.S. government that it needed to offer American companies incentives, beyond the $ 52 billion in subsidies in the CHIPS Act, to buy American-made chips.
"Otherwise, it will be limited," he said. "It will come to limits pretty quickly. So that is on the table. But I don't think we have a solution yet." The Commerce Department, in charge of handling CHIPS Act incentives, declined to comment on specific companies.
In 2018, Mr. Liu said, the Commerce Department under President Donald J. Trump urged the company to invest in the United States. And several TSMC clients privately approached Mr. Liu at an industry conference and expressed the need for it to establish a U.S. manufacturing presence. Mr. Liu sensed the landscape was shifting.
"I thought maybe it's time for TSMC to go a little bit global, because I know our technology is leading today, but what about in the future?" he said.
Before long, the Trump administration's State Department, citing national security grounds, started courting TSMC, emphasizing the role of advanced chips in military gear like F-35 fighter jets. Keith Krach, under secretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, arranged a phone call between Mr. Liu, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Mr. Liu recalled that Mr. Krach said TSMC was needed to help "catalyze" the American semiconductor industry.
"That for me is also important because the U.S. is where 65 percent of our customers reside," Mr. Liu said. "They have different needs, and we also have opportunities."

A Chip Titan Can No Longer Stay Offstage In a Tech War: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a wood-paneled office overlooking Taipei and the jungle-covered mountains that surround the Taiwanese capital, Morris Chang recently pulled out an old book stamped with technicolor patterns.
It was titled "Introduction to VLSI Systems," a graduate-level textbook describing the intricacies of computer chip design. Mr. Chang, 92, held it up with reverence.
"I want to show you the date of this book, 1980," he said. The timing was important, he added, as it was "the earliest piece" in a puzzle that came together for him -- altering not only his career but also the course of the global electronics industry.
The insight that Mr. Chang gained from the textbook was deceptively simple: the idea that microchips, which act as the brains of computers, could be designed in one place but manufactured somewhere else. The notion went against the semiconductor industry's standard practice at the time.
So at the age of 54, when many people begin thinking more about retirement, Mr. Chang instead put himself on a path to turn his insight into a reality. The engineer left his adopted country, the United States, and moved to Taiwan where he founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. The company does not design chips, but it has become the world's biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge microprocessors for customers including Apple and Nvidia.
Today, the company that partially exists because of a textbook is a $ 500 billion juggernaut that has put the most advanced chips in iPhones, cars, supercomputers and fighter jets. So critical are its airplane-hangar-size chip factories, called fabs, that the United States, Japan and Europe have courted TSMC to build them in their neck of the woods. Over the past decade, China has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to recreate what TSMC has done.
Mr. Chang's unlikely entrepreneurial journey helped Taiwan become an economic giant, restructured the way the electronics industry worked and ultimately charted a new geopolitical reality in which a linchpin of global economic growth lies in one of the world's most volatile spots.
That has thrust Mr. Chang, and the company he created, into the spotlight. And at the twilight of his career, a man who has preferred to remain in the shadows reflected on what he has built and what it means to no longer be able to stay under the radar.
"It doesn't make me feel particularly good," said Mr. Chang, who retired in 2018 but still appears at TSMC events. "I would rather stay relatively unknown."
Over a recent three-hour discussion in his office, Mr. Chang made it clear that he identifies as American -- he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1962 -- at a time when the company he founded is at the center of a technological Cold War between the United States and China. Even as the rivalry for tech leadership intensifies, he does not give China much of a chance for semiconductor supremacy.
"We control all the choke points," Mr. Chang said, referring collectively to the United States and its chip-making allies such as the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. "China can't really do anything if we want to choke them."
More than a dozen people familiar with Mr. Chang, many of whom knew him as a colleague at TSMC, said he built the company -- and outmaneuvered giants like Samsung and Intel -- by being meticulous, stubborn, trusting his best people and, crucially, having boundless ambition and making daring moves when justified. When TSMC stumbled after the 2008 financial crisis, he returned as chief executive at age 77 to take over again.
"He's probably the only person left in the chip industry who was present at the creation of the industry itself," said Chris Miller, the author of the book "Chip War" and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. "That he's not only still in the industry but at the center and top of it is extraordinary."
To understand the tech industry's future, it is crucial to understand the world through Mr. Chang's eyes and how he made that initial bet when others didn't. And unlike today's tech moguls -- such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have publicly considered a cage fight -- Mr. Chang has shown more restraint. If competition between the global tech giants is a series of high-stakes poker games, he is the quiet man who runs the casino.
Almost an automaker
Mr. Chang was born in 1931 in a China on the brink of war. Before the age of 18, he lived in six cities, changed schools 10 times, experienced bombings in Guangzhou and Chongqing, and crossed the front lines as his family fled Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II.
When he made it to Hong Kong in 1948 with his family, who by then were trying to get away from the Chinese Communist Party's advancing army, there was no going back.
"My old world crumbled as the mainland changed its color, and a new world was yet to be established," he wrote in his autobiography, which was published in 1998.
In 1949, Mr. Chang moved to the United States, attending Harvard before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. In 1955, when he twice failed a qualifying exam for a doctoral degree at M.I.T., he decided to test out the job market.
"Many years later, I considered failing to be admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Ph.D. program as the greatest stroke of luck in my life!" he wrote in his autobiography.
Two of the best offers arrived from Ford Motor Company and Sylvania, a lesser-known electronics firm. Ford offered Mr. Chang $ 479 a month for a job at its research and development center in Detroit. Though charmed by the company's recruiters, Mr. Chang was surprised to find the offer was $ 1 less than the $ 480 a month that Sylvania offered.
When he called Ford to ask for a matching offer, the recruiter, who had previously been kind, turned hostile and told him he would not get a cent more. Mr. Chang took the engineering job with Sylvania. There, he learned about transistors, the microchip's most basic component.
"That was the start of my semiconductor career," he said. "In retrospect, it was a damn good thing."
Three years at Sylvania opened doors and cemented Mr. Chang's passion for semiconductors. But Sylvania struggled, teaching him a lesson that would inform how he later ran TSMC.
"From the beginning, the semiconductor industry has been a fast-paced and unforgiving industry," Mr. Chang wrote of Sylvania's eventual collapse in his autobiography. "Once you fall behind, catching up becomes considerably difficult."
In 1958, he jumped to a buzzy new semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. The Dallas company was "youthful and energetic," with many employees working over 50 hours a week and sleeping overnight in the office. Four years later, Mr. Chang became an American, an identity he considers primary.
"Ever since I fled Communist China and went to the United States and became naturalized in 1962, my identity has always been American, and nothing else," he said.
Mr. Chang became a pillar of Texas Instruments' then world-beating semiconductor business. Breakthroughs were constant. In the 1970s, the firm produced a chip that could synthesize the human voice, which led to the famed Speak & Spell toy, a hand-held device that helped children with spelling and pronunciation.
"It's just like Camelot, but it was not a long period of time," he said.
In the late 1970s, Texas Instruments turned its focus to the burgeoning market for calculators, digital watches and home computers. Mr. Chang, then in charge of the semiconductor side, realized his career there was approaching a "dead end."
It was time for something different.
Putting the puzzle pieces together
If the first puzzle piece that led to TSMC's creation was the textbook, the second was an experience that Mr. Chang had toward the end of his time at Texas Instruments.
In the early 1980s, Texas Instruments opened a chip factory in Japan. Three months after the production line began churning out chips, the plant's "yield" was double that of the company's factories in Texas. Yield is a key statistic that refers to how many usable chips emerge from production.
Mr. Chang was dispatched to Japan to solve the yield mystery. The key was the staff, he found, with turnover surprisingly low among well-qualified employees.
But try as it might, Texas Instruments could not find the same caliber of technicians in the United States. At one U.S. plant, the top candidate for a supervisor job had a degree in French literature and no engineering background. The future of advanced manufacturing appeared to be in Asia.
In 1984, Mr. Chang joined General Instrument, another chip firm, where a third puzzle piece fell into place. He met an entrepreneur who later started a company that would only design chips without also making them, which was then uncommon. He spotted a trend that would prove to have staying power: Today most semiconductor companies design chips and outsource manufacturing.
This final piece coincided with Taiwan's transition from a labor-intensive and heavy industry economy to a high-tech one. When Taiwanese officials set their sights on developing the semiconductor industry, they asked Mr. Chang, whose reputation as a chip expert was established, to lead an institute for supercharging innovation.
So in 1985, Mr. Chang, then 54, left the United States for a place he knew only from several visits to a Texas Instruments factory.
"I certainly had no plan to spend nearly so much time in Taiwan," he said. "I thought I was going back in maybe just a few years, and I really had no plan to set up TSMC, to set up any company in Taiwan."
Within weeks of Mr. Chang's arrival, Li Kwoh-ting, a government official who became known as the godfather of Taiwan's tech development, asked him to make the state-led chip project commercially viable.
When Mr. Chang assessed Taiwan's strengths and weaknesses, he sensed an opening. "I concluded that Taiwan was a lot more similar to Japan than the U.S.," he said, referring to his experience with the Texas Instruments' factory in Japan.
In 1987, Mr. Chang founded TSMC. The business model was clear in his head: TSMC would make chips for other companies and not design them. That meant it just had to win over those inside the industry and then focus on what it could do best -- manufacturing.
From the get-go, Mr. Chang had plans for TSMC to tap into a global market. He introduced professional management systems, which were uncommon in Taiwan, at the company. To foster an international environment, internal communications were in English.
His vision proved prophetic. As semiconductors became more complex and expensive to produce, only a few firms could even afford to try. Making chips involves hundreds of steps that pull on advanced lasers and chemical manipulations to create tiny pathways for electronic signals that do the most basic calculations for a computer. Costs were astronomical.
Over the years, Mr. Chang kept going as others dropped out. If TSMC could attract enough customers, leveraging economies of scale, it had a chance to take out the kings: Intel and Samsung.
In 1997, Mr. Chang recruited a new head of research of development, Chiang Shang-yi. He told Mr. Chiang to benchmark TSMC against the industry leader, Intel.
"Our goal is to be No. 1, barring none," Mr. Chang said.
Mr. Chiang was surprised. "To be No. 1, you have to spend three times as much as your next competitor," he replied, implying that being in the lead would be too lofty and costly a goal.
"It may be three times, but I do want to spend enough so that we become No. 1," Mr. Chang said. And he was prepared to be patient, even after stepping down as TSMC's chief executive in 2005 and staying on as the company's chairman.
Closing the Apple contract
In April 2009, angry TSMC employees -- many who had recently been let go by the company -- set up a protest camp at a leafy playground in Taipei's quiet residential neighborhood of Dazhi. They were down the street from Mr. Chang's upscale apartment building.
As dark fell, the protesters rolled out sleeping bags next to a slide and jungle gym, covering themselves with a large sign that read "TSMC lies lies lies." Throughout its more than two-decade history, TSMC had never laid off employees. Yet after the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Chang's successor, Rick Tsai, began letting employees go.
Mr. Chang, then 77, decided he could no longer stay on the sidelines. He took back his job, rehired the talent Mr. Tsai had let go and more than doubled TSMC's spending.
Coming at a tough time for the industry, the move was not appreciated by investors. Elizabeth Sun, TSMC's former head of investor relations, recalled her reaction to the news: "When I heard it, I felt like banging my head against a wall."
But the bet paid off. In 2010, Mr. Chang got the call that would turbocharge TSMC's growth and clinch its lead over Samsung and Intel. Jeff Williams, a senior vice president at Apple, reached out through Mr. Chang's wife, Sophie Chang, who is a relative of Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, Apple's largest assembler.
The call led to a Sunday dinner with all four of them, which turned into negotiations the next day. Apple had worked with Samsung to produce the microchip it designed for the iPhone, but it was looking for a new partner, partly because Samsung had become a major smartphone competitor. TSMC, which does not compete with its customers, was in pole position for the contract.
The discussions stretched on for months. "It was very complicated -- the contract itself," Mr. Chang said. "It was the first time we ran into this kind of thing."
At one point, Apple announced a two-month pause in talks. Mr. Chang heard Intel might have intervened.
Worried, Mr. Chang flew to San Francisco to meet Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, who reassured him. In a 2013 interview, Paul Otellini, then Intel's chief executive, said he had turned down the chance to make the chips for the iPhone because Apple would not pay enough.
Mr. Chang would not make the same mistake. Apple demanded better terms and lower prices than others, but he understood the contract's scale would help TSMC rocket past competitors. That was a lesson he learned from Bill Bain, who founded the consulting firm Bain & Company, back at Texas Instruments.
Mr. Bain, then a consultant for Boston Consulting Group, had worked in an office next to Mr. Chang for almost two years. He had analyzed Texas Instruments' production and sales numbers and argued that the more the company produced, the better it would perform.
When the deal with Apple was complete, Mr. Chang borrowed $ 7 billion to build the capacity for making millions of chips for the iPhone.
In the ensuing years, Apple briefly turned to Samsung for iPhone chip production again, but TSMC became its primary chip maker. Apple is now TSMC's largest client, accounting for about 20 percent of revenue.
Mr. Chang remains cautious about what he says about TSMC's customers even now. After beginning a story about Apple at his office, he wondered whether he had said too much.
"I don't think I have exceeded Apple's limits of what to tell you," he said.
In a statement, Mr. Williams, now Apple's chief operating officer, said Mr. Chang had "pushed the semiconductor industry to new frontiers."
In 2018, Mr. Chang, at 86 years old, retired again. By then, TSMC had succeeded where others lagged, mass producing chips with electronic pathways the size of a DNA double helix. That gave Mr. Chang confidence that he had achieved a key tenet for TSMC: technological leadership.
Spurring the A.I. revolution
Among the awards and photos with world leaders that stud the walls of Mr. Chang's Taipei office, one is a framed comic portraying his close relationship with Jensen Huang, a founder of the chip firm Nvidia.
If Apple turbocharged TSMC, it was Mr. Chang who helped make Nvidia the world's most important designer of artificial intelligence chips. The cartoon tells the story. In the mid-1990s, when Nvidia was a start-up, Mr. Huang sent a letter to Mr. Chang asking if TSMC would make its chips. After a call with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chang agreed.
"I liked him," Mr. Chang said of Mr. Huang.
By taking that chance, Mr. Chang helped spur the A.I. revolution in the United States. With TSMC's manufacturing, Nvidia became the world's most important A.I. chip designer. Breakthroughs like generative A.I. rely on huge numbers of Nvidia chips to find patterns in vast amounts of data.
In a 2018 speech at Mr. Chang's retirement gathering, Mr. Huang said Nvidia -- now worth $ 1 trillion -- would not exist without TSMC. An inscription on the comic, which Mr. Huang gave to Mr. Chang, reads: "Your career is a masterpiece -- a Beethoven's Ninth Symphony."
For Mr. Chang, the final notes of that masterpiece have not yet been played. He is healthy for a nonagenarian, though he can no longer smoke a pipe -- once his trademark in photos -- after he had stents put into his heart a few years ago.
At his office, he still keeps a Bloomberg terminal. He also makes regular public appearances around Taiwan to discuss global politics and the economy. Like many, he worries about a potential conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan, though he believes the chance of such a confrontation is low.
"The chance of China invading Taiwan, amphibious warfare and all that stuff, I think that's a very, very low probability," he said. "A blockade of some kind, I think I still put it as low probability, but it's still a chance and I want to avoid that."
Mr. Chang said he was not worried about U.S. policies that have cut off Chinese firms from access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology.
"I think it's still OK," he said, though he noted U.S. companies would lose business and China would find ways to fight back.
As the conversation wound down, Mr. Chang said he had some regrets that he could not be in the driver's seat as TSMC faces geopolitical challenges. But he said the timing of his retirement in 2018 made sense, driven by technology and not politics.
"I was literally sure that we had achieved technology leadership," he said of that time. "I don't think we'll lose it."

TAIPEI, Taiwan — In a wood-paneled office overlooking Taipei and the jungle-covered mountains that surround the Taiwanese capital, Morris Chang recently pulled out an old book stamped with technicolor patterns.
It was titled “Introduction to VLSI Systems,” a graduate-level textbook describing the intricacies of computer chip design. Chang, 92, held it up with reverence.
“I want to show you the date of this book, 1980,” he said. The timing was important, he added, as it was “the earliest piece” in a puzzle that came together for him — altering not only his career but the course of the global electronics industry.
The insight that Chang gained from the textbook was deceptively simple: the idea that microchips, which act as the brains of computers, could be designed in one place but manufactured somewhere else. The notion went against the semiconductor industry’s standard practice at the time.
So at the age of 54, when many people begin thinking more about retirement, Chang instead put himself on a path to turn his insight into a reality. The engineer left his adopted country, the United States, and moved to Taiwan where he founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. The company does not design chips, but it has become the world’s biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge microprocessors for customers including Apple and Nvidia.
Today, the company that partially exists because of a textbook is a $500 billion juggernaut that has put the most-advanced chips in iPhones, cars, supercomputers and fighter jets. So critical are its airplane-hangar-size chip factories, called fabs, that the United States, Japan and Europe have courted TSMC to build them in their neck of the woods. Over the past decade, China has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to re-create what TSMC has done.
Chang’s unlikely entrepreneurial journey helped Taiwan become an economic giant, restructured the way the electronics industry worked and ultimately charted a new geopolitical reality in which a linchpin of global economic growth lies in one of the world’s most volatile spots.
That has thrust Chang, and the company he created, into the spotlight. And at the twilight of his career, a man who has preferred to remain in the shadows reflected on what he has built and what it means to no longer be able to stay under the radar.
“It doesn’t make me feel particularly good,” said Chang, who retired in 2018 but still appears at TSMC events. “I would rather stay relatively unknown.”
Over a recent three-hour discussion in his office, Chang made it clear that he identifies as American — he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1962 — at a time when the company he founded is at the center of a technological cold war between the United States and China. Even as the rivalry for tech leadership intensifies, he does not give China much of a chance for semiconductor supremacy.
“We control all the chokepoints,” Chang said, referring collectively to the United States and its chipmaking allies such as the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. “China can’t really do anything if we want to choke them.”
More than a dozen people familiar with Chang, many of whom knew him as a colleague at TSMC, said he built the company — and outmaneuvered giants such as Samsung and Intel — by being meticulous, stubborn, trusting his best people and, crucially, having boundless ambition and making daring moves when justified. When TSMC stumbled after the 2008 financial crisis, he returned as CEO at age 77 to take over again.
“He’s probably the only person left in the chip industry who was present at the creation of the industry itself,” said Chris Miller, author of the book “Chip War” and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “That he’s not only still in the industry but at the center and top of it is extraordinary.”
To understand the tech industry’s future, it is crucial to understand the world through Chang’s eyes and how he made that initial bet when others didn’t. And unlike today’s tech moguls — such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have publicly considered a cage fight — Chang has shown more restraint. If competition between the global tech giants is a series of high-stakes poker games, he is the quiet man who runs the casino.
Almost an automaker
Chang was born in 1931 in a China on the brink of war. Before the age of 18, he lived in six cities, changed schools 10 times, experienced bombings in Guangzhou and Chongqing, and crossed the front lines as his family fled Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II.
When he made it to Hong Kong in 1948 with his family, who by then were trying to get away from the Chinese Communist Party’s advancing army, there was no going back.
“My old world crumbled as the mainland changed its color, and a new world was yet to be established,” he wrote in his autobiography, which was published in 1998.
In 1949, Chang moved to the United States, attending Harvard before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. In 1955, when he twice failed a qualifying exam for a doctoral degree at MIT, he decided to test out the job market.
“Many years later, I considered failing to be admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Ph.D. program as the greatest stroke of luck in my life!” he wrote in his autobiography.
Two of the best offers arrived from Ford Motor Co. and Sylvania, a lesser-known electronics firm. Ford offered Chang $479 a month for a job at its research and development center in Detroit. Though charmed by the company’s recruiters, Chang was surprised to find the offer was $1 less than the $480 a month that Sylvania offered.
When he called Ford to ask for a matching offer, the recruiter, who had previously been kind, turned hostile and told him he would not get a cent more. Chang took the engineering job with Sylvania. There, he learned about transistors, the microchip’s most basic component.
“That was the start of my semiconductor career,” he said. “In retrospect, it was a damn good thing.”
Three years at Sylvania opened doors and cemented Chang’s passion for semiconductors. But Sylvania struggled, teaching him a lesson that would inform how he later ran TSMC.
“From the beginning, the semiconductor industry has been a fast-paced and unforgiving industry,” Chang wrote of Sylvania’s eventual collapse in his autobiography. “Once you fall behind, catching up becomes considerably difficult.”
In 1958, he jumped to a buzzy new semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. The Dallas company was “youthful and energetic,” with many employees working more than 50 hours a week and sleeping overnight in the office. Four years later, Chang became an American, an identity he considers primary.
“Ever since I fled Communist China and went to the United States and became naturalized in 1962, my identity has always been American, and nothing else,” he said.
Chang became a pillar of Texas Instruments’ then-world-beating semiconductor business. Breakthroughs were constant. In the 1970s, the firm produced a chip that could synthesize the human voice, which led to the famed Speak & Spell toy, a hand-held device that helped children with spelling and pronunciation.
“It’s just like Camelot, but it was not a long period of time,” he said.
In the late 1970s, Texas Instruments turned its focus to the burgeoning market for calculators, digital watches and home computers. Chang, then in charge of the semiconductor side, realized his career there was approaching a “dead end.”
It was time for something different.
Putting the puzzle pieces together
If the first puzzle piece that led to TSMC’s creation was the textbook, the second was an experience that Chang had toward the end of his time at Texas Instruments.
In the early 1980s, Texas Instruments opened a chip factory in Japan. Three months after the production line began churning out chips, the plant’s “yield” was double that of the company’s factories in Texas. Yield is a key statistic that refers to how many usable chips emerge from production.
Chang was dispatched to Japan to solve the yield mystery. The key was the staff, he found, with turnover surprisingly low among well-qualified employees.
But try as it might, Texas Instruments could not find the same caliber of technicians in the United States. At one U.S. plant, the top candidate for a supervisor job had a degree in French literature and no engineering background. The future of advanced manufacturing appeared to be in Asia.
In 1984, Chang joined General Instrument, another chip firm, where a third puzzle piece fell into place. He met an entrepreneur who later started a company that would only design chips without also making them, which was then uncommon. He spotted a trend that would prove to have staying power: Today, most semiconductor companies design chips and outsource manufacturing.
This final piece coincided with Taiwan’s transition from a labor-intensive and heavy industry economy to a high-tech one. When Taiwanese officials set their sights on developing the semiconductor industry, they asked Chang, whose reputation as a chip expert was established, to lead an institute for supercharging innovation.
So, in 1985, Chang, then 54, left the United States for a place he knew only from several visits to a Texas Instruments factory.
“I certainly had no plan to spend nearly so much time in Taiwan,” he said. “I thought I was going back in maybe just a few years, and I really had no plan to set up TSMC, to set up any company in Taiwan.”
Within weeks of Chang’s arrival, Li Kwoh-ting, a government official who became known as the godfather of Taiwan’s tech development, asked him to make the state-led chip project commercially viable.
When Chang assessed Taiwan’s strengths and weaknesses, he sensed an opening. “I concluded that Taiwan was a lot more similar to Japan than the U.S.,” he said, referring to his experience with the Texas Instruments’ factory in Japan.
In 1987, Chang founded TSMC. The business model was clear in his head: TSMC would make chips for other companies and not design them. That meant it just had to win over those inside the industry and then focus on what it could do best — manufacturing.
From the get-go, Chang had plans for TSMC to tap into a global market. He introduced professional management systems, which were uncommon in Taiwan, at the company. To foster an international environment, internal communications were in English.
His vision proved prophetic. As semiconductors became more complex and expensive to produce, only a few firms could even afford to try. Making chips involves hundreds of steps that pull on advanced lasers and chemical manipulations to create tiny pathways for electronic signals that do the most basic calculations for a computer. Costs were astronomical.
Over the years, Chang kept going as others dropped out. If TSMC could attract enough customers, leveraging economies of scale, it had a chance to take out the kings: Intel and Samsung.
In 1997, Chang recruited a new head of research of development, Chiang Shang-yi. He told Chiang to benchmark TSMC against the industry leader, Intel.
“Our goal is to be No. 1, barring none,” Chang said.
Chiang was surprised. “To be No. 1, you have to spend three times as much as your next competitor,” he replied, implying that being in the lead would be too lofty and costly a goal.
“It may be three times, but I do want to spend enough so that we become No. 1,” Chang said. And he was prepared to be patient, even after stepping down as TSMC’s CEO in 2005 and staying on as the company’s chair.
Closing the Apple contract
In April 2009, angry TSMC employees — many who had recently been let go by the company — set up a protest camp at a leafy playground in Taipei’s quiet residential neighborhood of Dazhi. They were down the street from Chang’s upscale apartment building.
As dark fell, the protesters rolled out sleeping bags next to a slide and jungle gym, covering themselves with a large sign that read “TSMC lies lies lies.” Throughout its more than two-decade history, TSMC had never laid off employees. Yet, after the 2008 financial crisis, Chang’s successor, Rick Tsai, began letting employees go.
Chang, then 77, decided he could no longer stay on the sidelines. He took back his job, rehired the talent Tsai had let go and more than doubled TSMC’s spending.

Profit Reports Fuel a Wall Street Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's rally got back on track Friday following more encouraging profit reports and the latest signal that inflation is loosening its chokehold on the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to its highest close in more than 15 months. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 176 points, or 0.5 percent after breaking a 13-day winning streak the day before. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.9 percent as Big Tech stocks led the market.
Stocks have been rising recently on hopes high inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to stop hiking interest rates. That in turn could allow the economy to continue growing and avoid a long-predicted recession. The S&P 500 closed out its third straight winning week and its ninth in the last 11.
A report on Friday bolstered those hopes, saying the inflation measure the Fed prefers to use slowed last month by a touch more than expected. Perhaps just as importantly, data also showed that total compensation for workers rose less than expected during the spring. While that's discouraging for workers looking for bigger raises, investors see it adding less upward pressure on inflation.
The hope among traders is that the slowdown in inflation means the Federal Reserve's hike to interest rates on Wednesday will be the final one of this cycle. The federal funds rate has leaped to a level between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, up from virtually zero early last year. High interest rates work to lower inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Critics, though, say the stock market's rally may have gone too far, too fast. The full effects of the Fed's rate hikes have yet to make their way fully through the system. Other parts of the economy could still crack under the pressure, like the three U.S. bank failures this spring that shook confidence. Plus, inflation remains above the Fed's target level, and the central bank could have to keep the brakes on the economy a while to get it down to target.
"Don't underestimate central bank commitment to 2 percent inflation," Bank of America economists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
Still, hopes for a halt to rate hikes helped technology stocks and others seen as big beneficiaries from easier rates to rally and lead the market Friday.
Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose at least 1.4 percent and were the three strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.
Companies also continued to deliver stronger profits for the spring than analysts expected. Roughly halfway through the earnings season, more companies than usual are topping profit forecasts, according to FactSet.
Intel rose 6.6 percent after reporting a profit for the latest quarter, when analysts were expecting a loss.
Food giant Mondelez International climbed 3.7 percent after reporting stronger results for the spring than expected. The company behind Oreo and Ritz also raised its forecasts for financial results for the full year.
On the losing end was Exxon Mobil. It fell 1.2 percent and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. It reported weaker profit for the spring than expected, though its revenue topped forecasts.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points to 4,582.23. The Dow added 176.57 to 35,459.29, and the Nasdaq jumped 265.55 to 14,316.66.
In stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 percent after the Bank of Japan made moves that could allow longer-term interest rates to rise. Stocks rose in China and were modestly higher across Europe.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.95 percent from 4.00 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.

Full text: The new supercomputer, made by the Silicon Valley start-up Cerebras, was unveiled as the A.I. boom drives demand for chips and computing power.
Inside a cavernous room this week in a one-story building in Santa Clara, Calif., six-and-a-half-foot-tall machines whirred behind white cabinets. The machines made up a new supercomputer that had become operational just last month.
The supercomputer, which was unveiled on Thursday by Cerebras, a Silicon Valley start-up, was built with the company's specialized chips, which are designed to power artificial intelligence products. The chips stand out for their size -- like that of a dinner plate, or 56 times as large as a chip commonly used for A.I. Each Cerebras chip packs the computing power of hundreds of traditional chips.
Cerebras said it had built the supercomputer for G42, an A.I. company. G42 said it planned to use the supercomputer to create and power A.I. products for the Middle East.
"What we're showing here is that there is an opportunity to build a very large, dedicated A.I. supercomputer," said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras. He added that his start-up wanted "to show the world that this work can be done faster, it can be done with less energy, it can be done for lower cost."
Demand for computing power and A.I. chips has skyrocketed this year, fueled by a worldwide A.I. boom. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Google, as well as myriad start-ups, have rushed to roll out A.I. products in recent months after the A.I.-powered ChatGPT chatbot went viral for the eerily humanlike prose it could generate.
But making A.I. products typically requires significant amounts of computing power and specialized chips, leading to a ferocious hunt for more of those technologies. In May, Nvidia, the leading maker of chips used to power A.I. systems, said appetite for its products -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- was so strong that its quarterly sales would be more than 50 percent above Wall Street estimates. The forecast sent Nvidia's market value soaring above $ 1 trillion.
"For the first time, we're seeing a huge jump in the computer requirements" because of A.I. technologies, said Ronen Dar, a founder of Run:AI, a start-up in Tel Aviv that helps companies develop A.I. models. That has "created a huge demand" for specialized chips, he added, and companies have "rushed to secure access" to them.
To get their hands on enough A.I. chips, some of the biggest tech companies -- including Google, Amazon, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel -- have developed their own alternatives. Start-ups such as Cerebras, Graphcore, Groq and SambaNova have also joined the race, aiming to break into the market that Nvidia has dominated.
Chips are set to play such a key role in A.I. that they could change the balance of power among tech companies and even nations. The Biden administration, for one, has recently weighed restrictions on the sale of A.I. chips to China, with some American officials saying China's A.I. abilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing's military and security apparatus.
A.I. supercomputers have been built before, including by Nvidia. But it's rare for start-ups to create them.
Cerebras, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was founded in 2016 by Mr. Feldman and four other engineers, with the goal of building hardware that speeds up A.I. development. Over the years, the company has raised $ 740 million, including from Sam Altman, who leads the A.I. lab OpenAI, and venture capital firms such as Benchmark. Cerebras is valued at $ 4.1 billion.
Because the chips that are typically used to power A.I. are small -- often the size of a postage stamp -- it takes hundreds or even thousands of them to process a complicated A.I. model. In 2019, Cerebras took the wraps off what it claimed was the largest computer chip ever built, and Mr. Feldman has said its chips can train A.I. systems between 100 and 1,000 times as fast as existing hardware.
G42, the Abu Dhabi company, started working with Cerebras in 2021. It used a Cerebras system in April to train an Arabic version of ChatGPT.
In May, G42 asked Cerebras to build a network of supercomputers in different parts of the world. Talal Al Kaissi, the chief executive of G42 Cloud, a subsidiary of G42, said the cutting-edge technology would allow his company to make chatbots and to use A.I. to analyze genomic and preventive care data.
But the demand for GPUs was so high that it was hard to obtain enough to build a supercomputer. Cerebras's technology was both available and cost-effective, Mr. Al Kaissi said. So Cerebras used its chips to build the supercomputer for G42 in just 10 days, Mr. Feldman said.
"The time scale was reduced tremendously," Mr. Al Kaissi said.
Over the next year, Cerebras said, it plans to build two more supercomputers for G42 -- one in Texas and one in North Carolina -- and, after that, six more distributed across the world. It is calling this network Condor Galaxy.
Start-ups are nonetheless likely to find it difficult to compete against Nvidia, said Chris Manning, a computer scientist at Stanford whose research focuses on A.I. That's because people who build A.I. models are accustomed to using software that works on Nvidia's A.I. chips, he said.
Other start-ups have also tried entering the A.I. chips market, yet many have "effectively failed," Dr. Manning said.
But Mr. Feldman said he was hopeful. Many A.I. businesses do not want to be locked in only with Nvidia, he said, and there is global demand for other powerful chips like those from Cerebras.
"We hope this moves A.I. forward," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TALLINN, Estonia -- Vladimir Putin has compared himself to the czar Peter the Great. But to travel through Eastern Europe is to see how much he has instead caused Russian influence to shrink.
I've been on a road trip through Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- and it's clear that Putin has managed to unite nearly everyone against Russia. Even Russian speakers who often used to feel loyalty to Moscow are now fund-raising for Ukraine.
One of my first memories is of a trip to Poland in the 1960s to visit my grandparents (Kristof is short for Krzysztofowicz). What I remember is that Communist Poland seemed endlessly bleak and depressing. Later, when I began to travel around Eastern Europe as a law student and aspiring journalist, my main impression was that in the Communist bloc you didn't need color film.
Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who was in Vilnius for the NATO summit, told me that when he first visited the country in 1979, he had the same impression: "It looked like everything had been whitewashed with gray paint. It was drab and lifeless." Flash forward, and today these countries are almost unrecognizable: vibrant, colorful and far wealthier than Russia. Poland has become a sophisticated manufacturing base for Europe, and Intel just announced that it would build a $ 4.6 billion chip plant near Wroclaw.
"Poland has been able to serve as a model for countries to the east," Mark Brzezinski, the American ambassador to Poland, told me. And Russia has been a model of a different kind.
"Putin's actions since February 2022 have proven the thesis that Russia under Putin is interested in leadership by terror and authoritarianism," Brzezinski added. "For other countries of the former Soviet bloc, if they ever were wobbly about joining the West, they certainly have had a clarifying experience."
The improvements in the Baltics have been as pronounced as those in Poland. Estonia is now a jewel of Europe, the global model of a high-tech and prosperous "e-state." It has nurtured countless high-tech start-ups, including Skype, and as I walked through Tallinn, the capital, I shared a sidewalk with a robot delivering a takeout dinner to a nearby home.
In contrast, Russia and the places that have remained in its orbit like Belarus and Transnistria remain dismal and oppressive. A glimpse of that side of the chasm: One of the world's bravest journalists, Elena Milashina, who has reported on human rights in Russia, was attacked recently in Chechnya; thugs beat her, shaved her head, poured dye on her and left her with a brain injury.
Putin claims to be a champion of the rights of Russian speakers, whose families often moved to neighboring nations when they were all under Soviet rule. And historically many were allied with Moscow and had grievances against the post-Communist pro-Western governments. Now Putin has upended that. His invasion and behavior embarrasses many Russian speakers and makes them rethink their allegiance.
In Lviv, Ukraine, Oleksandra Kabanova told me that she and her husband are native Russian speakers who always spoke to each other in Russian. But after her husband joined the Ukrainian Army last year to fight the Russian invaders, they switched to Ukrainian, even if she sometimes struggles to find the right word.
"It was way too toxic to continue speaking Russian," she said.
Putin's invasion paradoxically strengthened the Baltic countries, which until last year faced fundamental challenges. Each had a seemingly indigestible Russian minority, plus NATO's real-life commitment to protect these countries was uncertain -- especially during the presidency of Donald Trump. (A nightmare for leaders in the region is that Trump is re-elected in 2024, possibly wrecking NATO, cutting off aid to Ukraine and rescuing Putin from himself.)
Putin also revived NATO. It has added Finland and is moving to include Sweden, and there is renewed commitment to Article 5, which would lead all NATO countries to rush in to fight off any Russian incursion. As for the Russian speakers, they are finally being digested.
"The majority of our Russian-speaking people are with us," Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, told me. "They clearly see that life here is so much better than life in Russia."
The mood in the Baltics is reflected by a huge poster in Riga, Latvia, showing Putin's face as that of a skull-like monster.
The fundamental truth is that Putin has weakened Russia. It appears to be in a long-term economic and demographic decline that Putin has accelerated. Russia's only claim to relevance is its nuclear arsenal; as a saying goes, it is "Burkina Faso with nukes."
Driving through the countries that Moscow once ruled, through societies now united against him, I'm ready to bet that Putin will not be remembered as a modern Peter the Great. Rather, he will go down in history as the leader who broke his country: Vladimir the Lilliputian.

Fireworks Have a Splashy New Competitor This 4th of July: Drone Shows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The light displays are quieter, safer and better for the environment.
Like many in the fireworks industry, Stephen Vitale is in the family business. He runs a fifth-generation company, Pyrotecnico, in New Castle, Pa. In October, he struck a surprising alliance with Nova Sky Stories, the drone company that Kimbal Musk acquired from Intel.
Increasingly, drones are lighting up skybound entertainment shows. Flocks of flying robots have created magical illusions everywhere from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to the coronation of King Charles III this spring. And the global drone light show market, which was virtually nonexistent a decade ago, was valued at about $ 1 billion in 2021, according to Allied Market Research.
Drone shows are in some ways the newer, hipper brand of fireworks. And they're quieter, safer and better for the environment.
Fireworks providers like Vitale face a tough decision: Invest in the expensive equipment and regulatory clearance required to get into the drone business, or believe that demand for fireworks will remain steady even as a new type of competition skyrockets.
Change is coming. Fireworks providers bring in most of their revenue around the Fourth of July. And some of the organizers of those events are shifting to drones. Places like Salt Lake City and Boulder, Colo., plan to use them instead of fireworks for Independence Day celebrations this year, citing the reduced risk of forest fires and pollution.
But not everyone is convinced the light shows will suffice as a replacement. Galveston, Texas, is reverting to fireworks after using drones in 2022. And Reddit pages about the drawbacks of drone shows bemoan the fact that drones don't evoke the booming sounds that fireworks do.
"Drones are much more sophisticated," said Chris Hopkins, who co-owns Celebration Fireworks and Star Flight Drone Shows. "They just don't have the same visceral reaction."
Pivoting is a big investment. Hopkins invested in drones last year, eager to take advantage of the creative liberties they offered. "In the past, I could have hinted at the Demogorgon," he told DealBook, referring to a monster in the Netflix show "Stranger Things." "Now I can have the Demogorgon."
It was an expensive gambit: Drones cost more than $ 1,500 each, and he soon learned that a good show required at least 75. Then there was the hassle of filling out a nearly 200-page application to the Federal Aviation Administration for regulatory clearance and finding people skilled at flying the devices.
Some companies are sticking with fireworks. "I know there are some companies that are doing that -- I guess our philosophy is we're going to do what we do best," Heather Gobet of Western Display, a fourth-generation fireworks company in Oregon, told DealBook.
Gobet, who bought the business from her parents about eight years ago, has decided that dealing with the expertise, certifications and expense of acquiring drones is prohibitive. Instead, she will team up with companies that offer drone shows when customers demand them.
Besides, she has other challenges to worry about: The industry is grappling with supply chain snarls, labor shortages, an aging generation of pyrotechnic experts and costly compliance.
There's hope for industry harmony. Drones can be used for advertising in a way that fireworks cannot -- say, by displaying a corporate logo above a busy road. Many shows, like a Democratic celebration of the 2020 presidential election result, feature both drones and fireworks.
But growing competition is opening up opportunities, said Rick Boss, who runs Sky Elements, a nearly three-year-old drone show company. Larger traditional fireworks companies are looking to expand or go into new realms like drones, while smaller fireworks businesses are struggling.
"There are companies that are shrinking, maybe even stepping out of it -- and so that creates opportunity," he said. "It's a good time to be aggressive." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Bidenomics 2.0. President Biden sought to reboot the messaging on his economic record, as his poll ratings have been stuck in doldrums despite seemingly good data: 13 million new jobs, unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic Americans at record lows and a new industrial policy to drive green investment. Inflation is a big reason, with Americans still feeling the sting of rising prices. But the Biden team believes it also needs to do a better job of salesmanship.
Ryan Reynolds and RedBird put the pedal to the metal. The Canadian actor teamed up with the private equity firm to lead a 200 million-euro ( $ 218 million) investment in Alpine, the Formula 1 team owned by Renault. The group also included the actors Michael B. Jordan and Rob McElhenney, Reynolds's partner in owning the Welsh soccer club Wrexham A.F.C., which has become a media phenomenon thanks to the Hulu series about the team.
The Supreme Court has a big week. The court made a series of major decisions: It struck down affirmative action at universities; it backed a business that refused to provide services to a same-sex couple despite a state law that forbids discrimination against gay people; and it rejected Biden's proposal to cancel at least some student debt, imposing new restrictions on presidential power.
Weekend wins. As people's schedules changed during the pandemic, consumer spending shifted away from weekdays to weekends, according to The Economist. The reasons: Fewer workers are going to the office and going out after work, and many restaurants, bars and clubs shut for good during lockdowns.
The never-ending Aperol spritz summer
For many Americans, summer holiday weekends mean cold beverages at cookouts. Beer is the stereotypical go-to choice, but sales by volume have been declining. What has become more dominant? For many, an Italian cocktail called the Aperol spritz.
Over more than a decade, the drink, with its signature bright orange hue and slightly bitter bite, has outlasted countless rival drinks of the summer and pandemic lockdowns. Its enduring success is a testament to how clever marketing and adroit navigating of trends turned an obscure Italian aperitivo into a staple for urban millennials.
A primer on Aperol. Created in 1919, the beverage had largely been confined to northern Italy until 2003, when Campari Group bought Aperol and began to roll out a meticulous marketing campaign. The company quickly homed in on the spritz -- a simple cocktail with an easy-to-remember recipe of three parts sparkling wine, two parts Aperol and one part club soda -- as the vehicle.
Those efforts have paid off handsomely for Campari. Aperol accounted for 21 percent of the company's €2.7 billion ( $ 2.9 billion) in revenue last year, and grew 28 percent globally and nearly 50 percent in the United States alone.
Experts chalk up its success to a number of factors, beyond wall-to-wall marketing:
The rise of low-alcohol cocktails. After decades of what Spiros Malandrakis of the research firm Euromonitor called "high-energy" going-out drinking (read: shots), Aperol is a relatively lightweight 11 percent alcohol by volume.
The ease of making it. "It's a very forgiving cocktail," even for home bartenders, said Julie Reiner, a co-owner of the New York cocktail bars Milady's and Leyenda.
Aperol's inherent attractiveness on social media. "The orange hue looks so good in Instagram feeds," Malandrakis said -- and its association with European glamour is reinforced by the likes of its prominence in HBO's "The White Lotus."
Aperol's success stands out in the fad-driven cocktails industry. Remember when hard seltzers like White Claw were the talk of the town? Or how Dirty Shirleys were last summer's must-have drink? Those concoctions may have faded, but Aperol's appeal has not: Campari said sales in the first quarter were up 33 percent from a year earlier.
That has led to a surge in sales of bitters more generally. The category sold 487.8 million liters' worth last year, according to Euromonitor, up 30 percent from 2012.
The Aperol spritz's popularity has helped turn an entire range of cocktails -- many of which follow the blueprint of the original drink but substitute in other ingredients -- into must-haves at bars.
"For a brunch menu, you've got to have a spritz," Reiner said. "It's a category that's just growing, because people like it." (When she reopened Milady's last fall, she created two cocktails: a martini riff and a take on an Aperol spritz that uses ruby-colored sparkling Lambrusco instead of Prosecco.)
Aperol is likely to have legs for some time. "I don't see it going anywhere for three to five years at least," Malandrakis said, while noting that tastes will eventually change.
Campari continues to have high hopes for its best seller as well: In February, Robert Kunze-Concewitz, the company's C.E.O., told analysts, "We're only at the very beginning of a very long Aperol runway."
Which BBQ ingredient is an inflation anomaly?
Ingredients for your Fourth of July cookout are more expensive this year. While inflation has come down from its 2022 heights of about 9 percent, prices remain high: On average, prices for grilling favorites are about 31 percent higher than they were four years ago, according to the "BBQ index," a report by Rabobank's market research unit, RaboResearch. But there is one exception. Which of these items costs about as much as it did in 2020?
Ground beef
Burger buns
Lettuce
Potato chips
Beer
Tomato
Find the answer below.
Thanks for reading! We are taking a break for the holiday. We'll see you on July 5.
We'd like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.
Quiz answer: It's the tomato. The U.S. market has seen a surge in tomato imports, particularly those grown in Mexico, said Almuhanad Melhim, an analyst who focuses on fresh produce at the RaboResearch. That has brought down prices.
The item with the highest price increase? Burger buns, whose prices were sent soaring by an increase in wheat prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, and remain high.

U.S. May Cut China's Path To A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Reports that the White House may clamp down on sales of semiconductors that power artificial intelligence capabilities sent tech stocks diving.
The Biden administration is weighing additional curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, including restricting the sale of high-end chips used to power artificial intelligence, according to five people familiar with the deliberations.
The curbs would clamp down on the sales to China of advanced chips made by companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are needed for the data centers that power artificial intelligence.
Biden officials have said that China's artificial intelligence capabilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing's military and security apparatus. Among the concerns is the use of A.I. in guiding weapons, carrying out cyber warfare and powering facial recognition systems used to track dissidents and minorities.
But such curbs would be a blow to semiconductor manufacturers, including those in the United States, who still generate much of their revenue in China.
The deliberations were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Nvidia's shares closed down 1.8 percent on Wednesday after reports of the potential export crackdown. The company has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the enthusiasm over artificial intelligence, with its share price surging by roughly 180 percent this year.
Such additional restrictions, if adopted, would not have an immediate impact on Nvidia's financial results, Colette Kress, the chief financial officer of Nvidia, said Wednesday at an event hosted by an investment firm. But over the long term, they "will result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets," she said. She added that China typically generates 20 percent to 25 percent of the company's data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable A.I.
The stock prices of chip companies Qualcomm and Intel fell less than 2 percent on Wednesday while AMD nudged 0.2 percent lower.
Intel declined to comment, as did the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls. AMD did not respond to a request for comment.
Curbing the sale of high-end chips would be the latest step in the Biden administration's campaign to starve China of advanced technology that is needed to power everything from self-driving cars to robotics.
Last October, the administration issued sweeping restrictions on the types of advanced semiconductors and chip making machinery that could be sent to China. The rules were applied across the industry, but they had particularly strong consequences for Nvidia. The company, an industry leader, was barred from selling China its top-line A100 and H100 chips -- which are adept at running the many processes required to build artificial intelligence -- unless it first obtained a special license.
In response to those restrictions, Nvidia began offering the downgraded A800 and H800 chips in China last year.
The additional restrictions under consideration, which would come as part of the process of finalizing those earlier rules, would also bar sales of Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips, and similar advanced chips from competitors like AMD and Intel, unless those companies obtained a license from the Commerce Department to continue shipping to the country.
The deliberations have touched off an intense lobbying battle, with Intel and Nvidia working to prevent further curbs on their business.
Chip companies say cutting them off from a major market like China will substantially eat into their revenues and reduce their ability to spend on research and innovation of new chips. In an interview with The Financial Times last month, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, warned that the U.S. tech industry was at risk of "enormous damage" if it were to be cut off from trading with China.
The Biden administration has also been internally debating where to draw the line on chip sales to China. Their goal is to limit technological capacity that could aid the Chinese military in guiding weapons, developing autonomous drones, carrying out cyber warfare and powering surveillance systems, while minimizing the impact such rules would have on private companies.
The measure, which would come as the United States is also considering expanded curbs on U.S. investment in Chinese technology firms, is also likely to ruffle the Chinese government. Biden officials have been working in recent weeks to improve bilateral relations after a fallout with Beijing this year, after a Chinese surveillance balloon flew over the United States.
Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, traveled to Beijing this month to meet with his counterparts, and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen is also expected to travel to China soon.
During a Wednesday appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Blinken said that China's concern that the U.S. sought to slow its economic growth was "a lengthy part of the conversation that we just had in Beijing."
Chinese officials, he said, believe the U.S. seeks "to hold them back, globally, and economically." But he disputed that notion.
"How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?" he asked, citing China's expanding nuclear weapons program, its development of hypersonic missiles and its use of artificial intelligence "potentially for repressive purposes."
"If they were in our shoes, they would do exactly the same thing," he said, adding that the U.S. was imposing "very targeted, very narrowly defined controls."
Nvidia's valuation had soared in light of the recent boom in generative artificial intelligence services, which can produce complex written answers to questions and images based on a single prompt. Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, which makes the chatbot ChatGPT, to generate results in its Bing search engine while Google has built a competing chatbot called Bard.
As companies race to incorporate the technology into their products, it has increased demand for chips like Nvidia's that can handle that the complex computing tasks. That momentum has helped to push Nvidia's market capitalization past $ 1 trillion, making the company the world's sixth largest by value.
Nvidia said in an August filing that $ 400 million in revenue from "potential sales to China" could be subject to U.S. export restrictions, including sales of the A100, if "customers do not want to purchase the company's alternative product offerings" or the government failed to grant licenses to allow the company to continue to sell the chip inside China.
Since the restrictions were imposed, Chinese chip makers have been trying to overhaul their supply chains and develop domestic sources of advanced chips, but China's capabilities to produce the most advanced chips remains many years behind that of the United States.
Dan Wang, a visiting scholar at Yale Law School, said that the impact of advanced chip restrictions on Chinese tech companies was uncertain.
"Most of their business needs are driven by less advanced chips, as fewer of them are playing on the fringes of the most advanced A.I.," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Daniel Rodriguez, whom the judge called a "one-man army of hate," received one of the stiffest sentences so far in the Justice Department's investigation of the Capitol riot.
A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced a rioter who savagely assaulted an officer defending the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to more than 12 years in prison, calling him a "one-man army of hate" whose severe punishment might act as a deterrent to future acts of political violence.
The 151-month sentence, handed down at a two-and-a-half-hour hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, was one of the stiffest so far in the Justice Department's sprawling investigation of the Capitol attack. It stemmed from one of the most wrenching episodes of the day, an assault on a District of Columbia police officer with a Taser-like weapon that left him unconscious and unable to return to his duties.
The defendant, Daniel Rodriguez, 40, who had previously admitted to driving from California to Washington to do armed battle on behalf of former President Donald J. Trump, expressed some regret for his actions as he asked the judge for leniency. But after receiving his sentence, Mr. Rodriguez smiled and let out a defiant shout of "Trump won!" before being led out of the room by federal marshals.
The judge, Amy Berman Jackson, rejected defense arguments that Mr. Rodriguez was the product of a difficult upbringing and that he had been a mostly law-abiding retail and warehouse worker before he became radicalized by what she called Mr. Trump's "irresponsible and knowingly false claims that the election was stolen."
Judge Jackson, her voice rising with disgust as she documented his actions in detail, said she was sympathetic to Mr. Rodriguez's claim that his extended absence has been harmful to his ailing mother, but she cast the stiff sentence as serving a higher purpose of safeguarding democracy from the continuing threats.
"The shadow of tyranny has not gone away," said Judge Jackson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama.
Patriotism, she told Mr. Rodriguez, "is loyalty to your country, not to a single head of state."
Few among the more than 1,000 people who have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack were as violent as Mr. Rodriguez, a single, fatherless man who, according to his lawyer, "idolized" Mr. Trump and his MAGA movement.
Over the course of nearly two hours at the Capitol on Jan. 6, prosecutors say, Mr. Rodriguez sprayed a fire extinguisher at the police, shoved at officers with a wooden pole, took part in a "heave ho" effort to break police lines and eventually assaulted Officer Michael Fanone of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington -- who had rushed to the scene when he heard law enforcement calls for help -- by hitting him twice in the neck with an electroshock device in a crowd outside the building.
Even then, prosecutors say, Mr. Rodriguez kept going. He entered the Capitol and sought to rile up other rioters, they said, and tried to smash a window with a pole-like object he found inside. He also ransacked offices, the government says, and instructed others in the mob to go through drawers to "look for intel."
When Mr. Rodriguez finally left the Capitol grounds, prosecutors say, he sent a text message to a group chat he had created called Patriots 45 MAGA Gang, showing a gallows with the Capitol in the background. The text of the message read, "No Democrats found unfortunately."
"These people are zealots," Mr. Fanone, who attended the hearing, said afterward. "They need to be held accountable."
In court papers filed before the sentencing, Mr. Rodriguez's lawyers wrote that their client was one of millions duped by the former president, who "doubled down on his lies and falsely declared that he had won."
Mr. Rodriguez, who grew up without a father and never completed high school, was one of those people. He "deeply respected and idolized Trump," the lawyers wrote, adding, "He saw the former president as the father he wished he had."
But Mr. Rodriguez did little to help his own cause in the courtroom. He veered from that script during a rambling 25-minute statement in which he seemed to cast the period leading up to the attack on the Capitol in nostalgic terms -- a time when he bonded with fellow Trump supporters, practiced military drills by playing paintball and smoked marijuana, in his retelling.
"I did what I thought was right at the time," he said.
Judge Jackson, in passing sentence, was not swayed. She said she was particularly confounded by one thing Mr. Rodriguez had just said -- that he had armed himself in anticipation of a fight with law enforcement, to participate in a demonstration intended to safeguard the police under a "Blue Lives Matter" banner.
"Today was not the best day to say you had to be armed and ready because police don't always do the right thing," she said, as one of his lawyers slumped in her seat.
Prosecutors say that Mr. Rodriguez set up Patriots 45 MAGA Gang on Telegram in the fall of 2020. But after the election -- and Mr. Trump's repeated lies about the outcome being marred by fraud -- the group chat became "a breeding ground" for "plans for violence against the seat of the federal government."
Those plans crystallized, prosecutors said, after Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter on Dec. 19, 2020, summoning his supporters to Washington for a "wild" protest on Jan. 6.
After the Tweet was posted, Mr. Rodriguez urged others in the chat to rent an R.V. and drive to Washington instead of flying so that they could bring weapons. He also encouraged chat members, prosecutors said, to arm themselves with knives, bear spray, even ax handles.
"There will be blood," he wrote in the chat on the night before the Capitol attack. "Welcome to the revolution."
Edward Badalian, Mr. Rodriguez's co-defendant and fellow group chat member, was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding in April after a bench trial in front of Judge Jackson. Mr. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to similar charges and assault in February.
Mr. Fanone, who has left the police force and was conspicuous in the courtroom in his cowboy boots and neck tattoos, watched impassively as the prosecution played video from his body camera showing him losing consciousness, being dragged to safety and asking, faintly, if officers had repelled the attackers.
But he could not sit still when Mr. Rodriguez began his long statement, and bolted from the courtroom around the time the defendant described his fellow attackers as "a group of misfits" who bonded over "smoking weed" together.
"We are all a lot dumber for just having lived through that," Mr. Fanone said in the corridor.

Who Was Out to Get This Man?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Kyle Roche was a rising star in the field of cryptocurrency law -- until his career imploded. Who orchestrated his downfall?
When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. At just 34 years old, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented Bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Mr. Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a new business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush townhouse in Mayfair.
That evening, Mr. Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Mr. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London's fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Mr. Roche says, he felt groggy. He couldn't remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Mr. Villavicencio's business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn't think he'd had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Mr. Roche couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Mr. Roche's world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Mr. Villavicencio and Mr. Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Mr. Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Mr. Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars' worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a "brother."
In other clips, Mr. Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs' interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs' competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as "idiots."
After he got over his initial shock, Mr. Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been "illegally obtained" and "spliced out of context," and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world's most used "stablecoin."
Within days, Mr. Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he says, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Mr. Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Mr. Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Mr. Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Mr. Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of Bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Mr. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $ 100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Mr. Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing Bitcoin's virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
"That was the first moment I thought, 'Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,"' he said.
By then, Mr. Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a Bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to be Bitcoin's enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Kleiman wanted to sue Dr. Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of Bitcoin they supposedly mined together in Bitcoin's early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Dr. Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to Bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Dr. Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of Bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Mr. Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Dr. Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve Bitcoin's great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity. Mr. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Mr. Roche met a new client, who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client's behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $ 7.5 million with Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Mr. Roche set up shop in a co-working space in Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Mr. Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Mr. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto start-ups rode Bitcoin's growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn't seem to be doing anything about it, so Mr. Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers' conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the S.E.C. in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Mr. Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Mr. Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain -- a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP -- would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity's primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92 percent -- a collapse that Mr. Roche's lawsuit attributed to "massive" selling by Mr. Williams and other insiders. (Mr. Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Mr. Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Mr. Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn co-working space where Mr. Roche initially worked. Mr. Roche agreed to do legal work for Dr. Sirer's company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren't uncommon in the tech industry. Mr. Roche's former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Mr. Boies's reputation, but to Mr. Roche he remained a role model.
When Mr. Roche reached his deal with Dr. Sirer in September 2019, he says, there was no guarantee that Dr. Sirer's project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Dr. Sirer's blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $ 100, making Mr. Roche a multimillionaire.
Mr. Roche's compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner's share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Mr. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Dr. Wright.
In the end, the trial didn't resolve whether Dr. Wright had really invented Bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $ 100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $ 43 million in interest.) Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $ 10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Mr. Roche turned to a project he and Dr. Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Mr. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Mr. Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Mr. Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Mr. Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Mr. Roche's new project. Mr. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Mr. Roche agreed to fly to London at the men's expense the next month.
They met at Mr. Ager-Hanssen's townhouse office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Mr. Roche's forehead -- "I didn't think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me" -- and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Mr. Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Mr. Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Mr. Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Mr. Ager-Hanssen coaxed Mr. Roche into saying he had been granted 1 percent of the supply of Avalanche's AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $ 100 million. (Mr. Roche says he exaggerated the 1 percent figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80 percent of their value.)
Mr. Ager-Hanssen then asked Mr. Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
"They haven't been sued yet, and there's a reason for that," said the baby-faced Mr. Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
"Brilliant," Mr. Ager-Hanssen replied. "Good answer."
Mr. Roche later elaborated. "I deal with making sure that the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. have other magnets to go after," he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, "Litigation can be a tool" to attack competition. "It's a fantastic tool."
That night, when Mr. Roche got to Jean-Georges, he says, he found Mr. Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Mr. Roche recalls Mr. Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Mr. Roche says the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Mr. Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Mr. Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Mr. Roche replies, "No, they have me do that on behalf of the class," suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs' behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche never saw Mr. Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Mr. Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Mr. Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Mr. Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Mr. Roche's biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs' competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He says he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Dr. Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Dr. Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs' general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as "scurrilous."
To insulate his law firm, Mr. Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Mr. Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn't be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
'Someone That Doesn't Exist'
A week after the videos surfaced, Mr. Roche got another jolt: A friend of one of his colleagues reported that he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Mr. Roche's life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Mr. Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Mr. Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative's name.
While Mr. Roche's career imploded, Mr. Ager-Hanssen called for Mr. Roche's disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Mr. Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Mr. Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Mr. Roche and his former firm.
To Mr. Roche, the implication was clear: Mr. Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Mr. Ager-Hanssen denied that. "This was not an operation run by me at all," he said. "It was run by someone else." He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Mr. Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn't at Jean-Georges that night. Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn't reveal the person's identity.
Mr. Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Mr. Roche were unsuccessful.
Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he didn't know Mr. Villavicencio's whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Mr. Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. "Of course, it's someone that doesn't exist," he said.
But Mr. Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the C.I.A., MI6 and Mossad.
But if Mr. Ager-Hanssen did set Mr. Roche up, who hired him to do it -- and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Mr. Roche's downfall.
First in line were Dr. Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. And after the videos came out, Mr. Ager-Hanssen became chief executive of nChain, a company that Mr. Ayre funds and that employs Dr. Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Ayre acknowledged that he and Dr. Wright were "pleased" when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Mr. Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Mr. Ager-Hanssen: Mr. Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman's biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Mr. Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Mr. Williams wrote on Twitter that he was "coming for" his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of "the honest crypto community," it posted two reports that aligned with Mr. Williams's interests. The first espoused a complicated theory about the ICP token crash that Mr. Williams had previously floated on Twitter.
The second attacked The Times for an article it had published about the crash. Mr. Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it "Gobsmacking." The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Mr. Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued The Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Mr. Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks' third exposé. After they were published, Mr. Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs' counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Mr. Roche's comments demonstrated "a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system."
In court filings opposing the motion, Mr. Roche's former firm accused Mr. Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Mr. Williams for the rumored death threats against Mr. Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesman for Dfinity and Mr. Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Mr. Williams said, "We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves."
Mr. Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $ 12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Mr. Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Mr. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.
But Mr. Roche's videotaped remarks continue to dog him and his former firm. Last month, the judge overseeing the pump-and-dump case granted Mr. Williams's motion and disqualified Freedman Normand Friedland as plaintiffs' counsel.
The judge cited Mr. Freedman's continuing friendship with Mr. Roche -- and the fact that they together control a cryptocurrency wallet holding more than a million AVAX tokens. He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by "extreme animosity" toward Mr. Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Mr. Roche's view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. Just 34, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush town house in Mayfair.
That evening, Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London’s fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Roche said, he felt groggy. He couldn’t remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Villavicencio’s business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn’t think he’d had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Roche couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Roche’s world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Villavicencio and Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars’ worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a “brother.”
In other clips, Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs’ interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs’ competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as “idiots.”
After he got over his initial shock, Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been “illegally obtained” and “spliced out of context,” and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world’s most used “stablecoin.”
Within days, Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he said, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo, New York. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing bitcoin’s virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
“That was the first moment I thought, ‘Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,’” he said.
By then, Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Kleiman wanted to sue Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of bitcoin they supposedly mined together in bitcoin’s early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve bitcoin’s great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Roche met a new client who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client’s behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $7.5 million with Roche and Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Roche set up shop in a coworking space in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto startups rode bitcoin’s growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn’t seem to be doing anything about it, so Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class-action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers’ conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the SEC in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain — a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP — would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity’s primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92% — a collapse that Roche’s lawsuit attributed to “massive” selling by Williams and other insiders. (Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn coworking space where Roche initially worked. Roche agreed to do legal work for Sirer’s company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren’t uncommon in the tech industry. Roche’s former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Boies’ reputation, but to Roche he remained a role model.
When Roche reached his deal with Sirer in September 2019, he said, there was no guarantee that Sirer’s project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Sirer’s blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $100, making Roche a multimillionaire.
Roche’s compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner’s share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Wright.
In the end, the trial didn’t resolve whether Wright had really invented bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $43 million in interest.) Roche and Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Roche turned to a project he and Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Roche’s new project. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Roche agreed to fly to London at the men’s expense the next month.
They met at Ager-Hanssen’s town house office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Roche’s forehead — “I didn’t think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me” — and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Ager-Hanssen coaxed Roche into saying he had been granted 1% of the supply of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $100 million. (Roche says he exaggerated the 1% figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80% of their value.)
Ager-Hanssen then asked Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
“They haven’t been sued yet, and there’s a reason for that,” said the baby-faced Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
“Brilliant,” Ager-Hanssen replied. “Good answer.”
Roche later elaborated. “I deal with making sure that the SEC and the CFTC have other magnets to go after,” he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, “Litigation can be a tool” to attack competition. “It’s a fantastic tool.”
That night, when Roche got to Jean-Georges, he said, he found Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Roche recalls Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Roche said the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Roche replies, “No, they have me do that on behalf of the class,” suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs’ behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Roche never saw Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Roche’s biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs’ competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He said he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs’ general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as “scurrilous.”
To insulate his law firm, Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn’t be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
‘Someone That Doesn’t Exist’
A week after the videos surfaced, Roche got another jolt: A friend of a colleague said he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Roche’s life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative’s name.
While Roche’s career imploded, Ager-Hanssen called for Roche’s disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Roche and his former firm.
To Roche, the implication was clear: Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Ager-Hanssen denied that. “This was not an operation run by me at all,” he said. “It was run by someone else.” He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn’t at Jean-Georges that night. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn’t reveal the person’s identity.
Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Roche were unsuccessful.
Ager-Hanssen said he didn’t know Villavicencio’s whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. “Of course, it’s someone that doesn’t exist,” he said.
But Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the CIA, MI6 and Mossad.
But if Ager-Hanssen did set up Roche, who hired him to do it — and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Roche’s downfall.
First in line were Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Wright. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. After the videos came out, Ager-Hanssen became CEO of nChain, a company that Ayre funds and that employs Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokesperson, Ayre acknowledged that he and Wright were “pleased” when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Ager-Hanssen: Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman’s biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Williams wrote on Twitter that he was “coming for” his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of “the honest crypto community,” it posted two reports that aligned with Williams’ interests.

Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it “Gobsmacking.” The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued the Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks’ third exposé. After they were published, Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs’ counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Roche’s comments demonstrated “a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system.”
In court filings opposing the motion, Roche’s former firm accused Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Williams for the rumored death threats against Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesperson for Dfinity and Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Williams said, “We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves.”
Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.

He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by “extreme animosity” toward Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Roche’s view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

Arizona's Boom Towns Ponder Growth Amid a Water Shortage: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The state announced new limits to construction because of water shortages, changing the course of development.
As the mayor of an old farming town bursting with new homes, factories and warehouses, Eric Orsborn spends his days thinking about water. The lifeblood for this growth is billions of gallons of water pumped from the ground, and his city, Buckeye, Ariz., is thirsty for more as builders push deeper into the desert fringes of Phoenix.
But last week, Arizona announced it would limit some future home construction in Buckeye and other places because of a shortfall in groundwater. The worried calls started pouring in to Mr. Orsborn.
"I have neighbors who come up to me and say, 'What are you doing? Are we running out of water?"' Mr. Orsborn said. "It put our community on edge, thinking, 'What is going on here and do I need to move?"'
No, he tells them. Breathe.
The upheaval was caused by a new state study that found groundwater supplies in the Phoenix area were about 4 percent short of what is needed for planned growth over the next 100 years. That may feel like a far-off horizon, but it is enough of a change to force the state to rethink its future in the near and long terms.
Now, there areurgent questions about how Arizona should be using its increasingly precious water -- for water-guzzling alfalfa and lettuce farms or thirsty new computer chip and battery factories and coffee-creamer manufacturing? For new sprawl or more development inside cities? Could the Phoenix suburbs keep up their frenzied pace of growth? Should they?
"No, we're not out of business," said Grady Gammage, a former president of the Central Arizona Project, an aqueduct system that carries Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson. "This may slow growth somewhat. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing."
Arizona has some of the strictest groundwater laws in the country in more regulated areas like Phoenix. For decades, the state has required new developments to show they have a 100-year supply of water before they can sell lots or break ground.
The projected shortfall means that developers in Phoenix's fast-growing outskirts can no longer get state approval to build new subdivisions that rely on groundwater wells, meaning they have to get water from somewhere else.
But there are limited sources of new water at a moment when cities and developers across Arizona and other fast-growing Western states are competing for every spare drop. Experts said that could drive up housing costs that have already increased by 51 percent over the past four years, according to Zillow, and sap Arizona's appeal as an affordable destination for businesses and new residents.
"It'll change the way development looks," Mr. Gammage said. "Higher density, less turf, fewer swimming pools."
Ever since news of the groundwater shortage sent shock waves across the Phoenix area, mayors, developers and business groups have been trying to reassure jittery investors, homeowners and potential new businesses that Arizona still has water, even as the threats of climate change and the shriveling Colorado River begin to reorder its future.
Gov. Katie Hobbs, who has made Arizona's water supply a focus of her first months in office, said the groundwater decision would not derail any projects that have already been approved and would have little effect on development in most big cities around the Phoenix area. Even on the edge of the suburbs, the state said there was also a supply of 80,000 lots with permission to build that can keep moving forward.
But to some residents around Buckeye, regularly ranked as one of the 10 fastest-growing cities in the country, it felt like an overdrawn account finally coming due -- the start of a thirstier new era where the rapidly expanding Phoenix area cannot keep growing by spilling endlessly into the Sonoran desert.
"I worry all the time," said Trudy Hann, 71, who moved to Buckeye in 1980, when the population was just 3,400. Today, it has more than 110,000 residents, and city officials say they envision 1.5 million people living there -- enough to rival the current size of Phoenix.
On Saturday afternoon, Ms. Hann and her family huddled under an umbrella in a subdivision of Spanish-tiled homes bordering an unbroken expanse of desert, watching her grandson play flag football on a grassy field fed by treated wastewater.
Inocente Cayetano moved from Goodyear, Ariz., to Buckeye, just 15 miles west, shortly before the pandemic because it was cheap, without a concern about water. He said a starter home cost $ 100,000 less in Buckeye than it did just one town closer to Phoenix, allowing him to invest his savings in a mobile coffee trailer. The business took off, and he just broke ground on building a storefront location in one of Buckeye's fancier master-planned communities.
"It's a little gold mine," he said.
He trusts the city will have enough water to brew his coffee and fill his faucets.
Buckeye's affordability has attracted growing numbers of Black and Latino families from California, the Midwest and other corners of Arizona over the past 20 years. Today, the city has a higher percentage of Latino residents than Arizona as a whole.
On the far western reaches of the city, the realities of limited groundwater will soon start coming into focus. There, just west of the jagged White Tank Mountains, earth movers had cleared away creosote bushes to make way for the first homes of a new development called Teravalis, which aspires to build 100,000 homes and 55 million square feet of commercial space.
The development, which is owned by the Howard Hughes Corporation, has gotten approval from state water authorities to build 7,000 homes. But now, the developers of Teravalis and several other projects in the deserts of western Buckeye will have to find other sources of water to get permits to build the rest of the project.
The limits mean that cities on the outer edges of Maricopa County, home to 4.5 million people, must redouble their hunt for new sources of water. They are seeking it through conservation, recycling wastewater, expanding reservoirs or even pumping in treated seawater from Mexico.
Mr. Orsborn, Buckeye's mayor, said the city was in the final stages of buying $ 80 million worth of water from landowners in a rugged mountain basin about 40 miles to the west. That will add enough water to serve about 18,000 households every year for the next century. But, in all, Buckeye officials estimate they will need about 30 times that amount a year.
"It's going to be incredibly expensive," Mr. Orsborn said.
Buckeye is also exploring a range of ideas: new wastewater treatment plants; capturing brackish water near a bend in the Gila River that is currently pumped away; teaming up with other cities to expand a reservoir in the mountains northeast of Phoenix by building a higher dam.
Ultimately, Buckeye's goal is to convince Arizona it has enough sources of water to merit a coveted state "designation" -- what one water-users group calls the "platinum standard" for water supplies in the desert.
Phoenix and most other major cities around Maricopa County have already received these designations from the state, meaning they can continue to grow despite the halt in groundwater-based development.
"Anybody who has complained about urban sprawl, lack of transportation -- those issues are all going to be helped by this change," said Benjamin Ruddell, a professor at Northern Arizona University who studies water use. "It's not the worst thing in the world unless you're a land speculator looking to turn desert into housing."
Land buyers like Anita Verma-Lallian are still bullish on the future of development on the edges of Phoenix. She said undeveloped land with a confirmed water supply has been in greater demand since the state's announcement. Developers are looking for other uses for land without those now-halted state water certificates. Ms. Verma-Lallian said she was working to convert a 2,000-acre parcel once slated for homes into sites for factories or warehouses that are not legally required to show a 100-year water supply the same way subdivisions are.
Intel and a Taiwanese semiconductor company are building new chip plants around Phoenix. In Buckeye, work is underway on a new lithium-ion battery factory.
"There's a lot of that happening," said Ms. Verma-Lallian. "There'll be a lot more industrial development on land that was intended for residential."

BUCKEYE, Ariz. — As the mayor of an old farming town bursting with new homes, factories and warehouses, Eric Orsborn spends his days thinking about water. The lifeblood for this growth is billions of gallons of water pumped from the ground, and his city, Buckeye, Arizona, is thirsty for more as builders push deeper into the desert fringes of Phoenix.
But last week, Arizona announced it would limit some future home construction in Buckeye and other places because of a shortfall in groundwater. The worried calls started pouring in to Orsborn.
“I have neighbors who come up to me and say, ‘What are you doing? Are we running out of water?’” Orsborn said. “It put our community on edge, thinking, ‘What is going on here and do I need to move?’”
No, he tells them. Breathe.
The upheaval was caused by a new state study that found groundwater supplies in the Phoenix area were about 4% short of what is needed for planned growth over the next 100 years. That may feel like a far-off horizon, but it is enough of a change to force the state to rethink its future in the near and long terms.
Now, there are urgent questions about how Arizona should be using its increasingly precious water — for water-guzzling alfalfa and lettuce farms or thirsty new computer chip and battery factories and coffee-creamer manufacturing? For new sprawl or more development inside cities? Could the Phoenix suburbs keep up their frenzied pace of growth? Should they?
“No, we’re not out of business,” said Grady Gammage, a former president of the Central Arizona Project, an aqueduct system that carries Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson. “This may slow growth somewhat. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing.”
Arizona has some of the strictest groundwater laws in the country in more regulated areas such as Phoenix. For decades, the state has required new developments to show they have a 100-year supply of water before they can sell lots or break ground.
The projected shortfall means that developers in Phoenix’s fast-growing outskirts can no longer get state approval to build new subdivisions that rely on groundwater wells, meaning they have to get water from somewhere else.
But there are limited sources of new water at a moment when cities and developers across Arizona and other fast-growing Western states are competing for every spare drop. Experts said that could drive up housing costs that have already increased by 51% over the past four years, according to Zillow, and sap Arizona’s appeal as an affordable destination for businesses and new residents.
“It’ll change the way development looks,” Gammage said. “Higher density, less turf, fewer swimming pools.”
Ever since news of the groundwater shortage sent shock waves across the Phoenix area, mayors, developers and business groups have been trying to reassure jittery investors, homeowners and potential new businesses that Arizona still has water, even as the threats of climate change and the shriveling Colorado River begin to reorder its future.
Gov. Katie Hobbs, who has made Arizona’s water supply a focus of her first months in office, said the groundwater decision would not derail any projects that have already been approved and would have little effect on development in most big cities around the Phoenix area. Even on the edge of the suburbs, the state said there was also a supply of 80,000 lots with permission to build that can keep moving forward.

Focus on Cuts Threatens Plan to Aid Chip Sector: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A deal to limit government spending in exchange for suspending the debt ceiling has further fueled concerns that the law's ambitious goals could be harder to achieve.
A renewed focus on the need to rein in federal spending has raised concerns about whether a bipartisan law that dedicates billions to advancing scientific research as well as revitalizing the American semiconductor industry will receive all of its promised funding.
President Biden and House Republican leaders have reached an agreement in principle to limit federal spending over the next two years in exchange for suspending the debt ceiling and averting the risk of an economic catastrophe.
But some lawmakers and other proponents of the bipartisan law, the CHIPS and Science Act, have grown worried that limits on government spending could undercut the legislation's ambitious goals of bolstering the nation's scientific edge and countering China's technological rise.
The debt ceiling deal cuts so-called nondefense discretionary funding -- which includes scientific research -- for the 2024 fiscal year. It also limits all discretionary spending to 1 percent growth in 2025, which is effectively a budget cut since that is likely to be slower than the rate of inflation.
Concerns about whether the CHIPS Act would receive its promised funding were growing even before the debt limit showdown. Lawmakers have already fallen short in appropriating the full amount of funding authorized by the legislation.
Most of the focus has been on the $ 52 billion the law provided to ramp up semiconductor manufacturing and research in the United States. That money is not expected to be at risk because it has already been appropriated. But the legislation also authorized about $ 170 billion for a number of key initiatives to boost research and development, which has to be approved by lawmakers each year through a separate appropriations process. As a result, the remaining portion of funding could be subject to cuts or shortfalls in the coming years.
Funding levels for various government agencies that were intended to receive more robust increases have already fallen short by billions of dollars. In the 2023 fiscal year, about $ 9.87 billion was appropriated for the National Science Foundation, down from the $ 11.9 billion authorized by the CHIPS Act. About $ 8.1 billion was approved for the Energy Department's Office of Science, down from $ 8.9 billion in authorized funds.
The total funding for research agencies was nearly $ 3 billion short of authorized levels this year, according to a recent Brookings Institution analysis.
Mr. Biden has underscored the increased funding for research and development in the package, promising that it would ensure the United States "leads the world in the industries of the future."
"This bill is about more than chips -- it's about science as well," Mr. Biden said after Congress passed the bill last year.
Agency leaders have been urging congressional appropriators to approve the full amount of funding to help achieve those goals. Sethuraman Panchanathan, the director of the National Science Foundation, said the money would help the nation lead in industries that were listed as key focus areas in the law, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology.
"We have to make sure that the science portion is funded fully," Mr. Panchanathan said.
Additional funding could allow the agency to invest more in a new department that aims to accelerate breakthroughs in key technologies, in part by creating pathways for researchers and start-ups to move their ideas from labs to the market. It could also help the agency expand A.I. research and training programs aimed at building up the nation's STEM work force, which agency officials said were critical since the country is facing a shortage of workers to build semiconductors.
With additional money, the Energy Department's Office of Science could invest more in upgrading infrastructure at its laboratories and advancing basic scientific research that underpins clean energy technologies, such as those that more efficiently capture carbon from the atmosphere and other waste streams.
The Commerce Department's $ 10 billion effort to invest in areas with the potential to "become globally competitive" through the creation of at least 20 "technology and innovation hubs" across the country has received only 5 percent of funding so far. The five-year program, overseen by the department's Economic Development Administration, aims to revitalize regions by creating jobs and strengthening the capacity to manufacture and deploy critical technologies.
Alejandra Castillo, a top Commerce official, called the $ 500 million in appropriated funds a "down payment" to lay the foundation of the program.
"With additional appropriations, E.D.A. can enable more tech hubs regions and invest in complementary projects that could alter the trajectory of job creation, innovation in key technologies and the scaling of industries of the future," Ms. Castillo said in a statement.
Lawmakers from both parties have urged congressional appropriators to fully fund the law's initiatives, although some acknowledged that could be even more challenging with limits on spending.
Representative Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican and the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said that he had been "very frustrated with how the funding of science has gone" in the United States in recent years and that he was "a little tense waiting to see" how much government funding would be available over the next few years.
"I'll be out there hustling to make sure that science and research get their fair share," Mr. Lucas said, adding that he understood that congressional appropriators had to work with constraints.
Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley, said lawmakers should be "putting more urgency" into the law's funding. He argued that failing to fully fund the efforts would hurt the country's ability to lead in manufacturing and cutting-edge technology developments.
"A bill is fine, but without the money, it doesn't mean anything," Mr. Khanna said. "To make America a manufacturing superpower, we have to have advances in technology. Technology has to be the driver of that because it requires massive increases in productivity."
Some have argued that the United States could fall behind other countries that have also pledged to increase investments in scientific research and technological developments, such as China.
"These folks are saying we want to not cede the future to China," said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House science committee. "If you don't do adequate investments in science, that's exactly what they're doing."
Matt Hourihan, an author of the Brookings analysis and the associate director of research and development and advanced industry at the Federation of American Scientists, said the programs losing out on funding were vital to enhancing the country's competitiveness, since they could help the United States make new discoveries that could "translate into commercial products" and be manufactured domestically. He added that the nation was "rapidly falling away from the original vision" of the law.
"Others, including China, are making similar investments in a lot of these technology areas," Mr. Hourihan said. "If we aren't investing to compete and achieve global leadership in these various fields of science and technology, then others will."
At the end of last year, a bipartisan group of senators, led by Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, sent a letter to congressional appropriators urging them to fully fund the law, which the group said would help scale up the nation's highly skilled work force and strengthen American innovation.
The senators noted that funding for previously passed pieces of legislation meant to expand the nation's investments in scientific research and development had also fallen short by billions of dollars, which they said prohibited government agencies from fully delivering on their potential and led to increased supply chain vulnerabilities. Key research agencies would have received about $ 77 billion in additional funding if Congress had followed the path of funding authorized by the America COMPETES Act of 2007, according to a 2022 analysis from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The senators argued that Congress must avoid the same pitfalls by fully funding the CHIPS Act.
"The strong focus on semiconductors is welcome, but the bill aspires to commence more substantial investment in a bunch of other technologies as well," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and an author of the Brookings analysis. "That depends on funding the 'and science' part of the bill better."

Faux Thriller Is, in a Way, a Triumph: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Liza Béar's deadpan anti-thriller returns to the Museum of Modern Art for a limited engagement.
A young Moroccan woman slips into Washington, D.C., hoping to provide a journalist with intel on the United States' clandestine involvement in a war for the contested Western Sahara. Once there, she crosses paths with two clownish compatriots looking to purchase a Washington safe house for the king of Morocco.
Shot in 1984, unreleased until 1990, and revived decades later in the Museum of Modern Art's annual restoration series "To Save and Project," Liza Béar's deadpan anti-thriller, "Force of Circumstance," returns to MoMA for a limited engagement.
A triumph of low-budget production design, the movie opens in a North African shantytown, impeccably realized in a vacant East Village lot. Thanks to the film composer Mader's evocative score and ambient sound that Béar recorded in Casablanca, the scene, which introduces the young courier Mouallem (Boris Major), has a hyperreal authenticity.
Cut to Washington, Mouallem peers through a taxi window as the Watergate complex whizzes past. This strange landscape, through which she is shadowed by the royal envoy (Eric Mitchell) and his bodyguard (Filip Pagowski), takes another form when her hotel room TV broadcasts -- what else?--"Casablanca."
"Force of Circumstance" can't sustain this suavely contrived mixture of dis- and reorientation. Still, Béar's spectacle of downtown artists playing spy vs. spy in an assortment of Washington locations -- a descendant of Louis Feuillade's World War I serials in which fantastic crimes were staged on the streets of Paris -- transcends the soggy plot, created in collaboration with the East Village writer Craig Gholson.
Mysteries proliferate and evaporate like puddles after summer rain. The envoy and the bodyguard wander through Georgetown searching for a colonial mansion. Mouallem, always wearing a new outfit, is never far away, hoping to contact the feisty journalist Katrina (Jessica Stutchbury), who is having an affair with Hans (Tom Wright), the dissolute rich boy looking to unload his ancestral home.
Béar, a central figure in New York's 1980s art world, has said that her film was inspired by the Casablanca bread riots in 1981. The movie is dated less by its historical references than by its green-character-displaying computer screens and a cast seemingly culled from a Club 57 theme party: Major (a member of Squat Theater); a pre-Hollywood Steve Buscemi; the musician Evan Lurie; the scene-maker Glenn O'Brien; the performance artist Rockets Redglare; and the filmmaker Eric Mitchell, who cast both Stutchbury and Wright in his own downtown movies. Capped with a fez, speaking some sort of French patois, Mitchell brings his own campy aura to the movie, including the portentous punchline: "Choice is a Western concept."
The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin, who had little sympathy for the film, wrote that "the avidity with which Ms. Béar, absorbs and mimics big-budget clichés is a lot more impressive than the way those clichés have been used." Indeed, "Force of Circumstance," which appropriates a title used by both W. Somerset Maugham and Simone de Beauvoir, is more an art object than a conventional movie, even ending with a screen full of actual documents, as a conceptual piece from the early '70s might.
This faux "thriller" has a sustained look, an intriguing cast, an entertaining attitude and a propulsive score. Its main flaw is the script -- which, given the current Writers Guild of America strike, makes it all the more timely.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Strengthened by billions of federal dollars, semiconductor companies plan to create thousands of jobs. But officials say there might not be enough people to fill them.
Maxon Wille, an 18-year-old in Surprise, Ariz., was driving toward Interstate 17 last year when he noticed a massive construction site: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company at work on its new factory in Phoenix.
A few weeks later, as he was watching YouTube, an advertisement popped up for a local community college's 10-day program that trains people to become semiconductor technicians. He graduated from the course this month and now hopes to work at the plant once it opens.
"I can see this being the next big thing," Mr. Wille said.
Semiconductor manufacturers say they will need to attract more workers like Mr. Wille to staff the plants that are being built across the United States. America is on the cusp of a semiconductor manufacturing boom, strengthened by billions of dollars that the federal government is funneling into the sector. President Biden had said the funding will create thousands of well-paying jobs, but one question looms large: Will there be enough workers to fill them?
"My biggest fear is investing in all this infrastructure and not having the people to work there," said Shari Liss, the executive director of the SEMI Foundation, a nonprofit arm of SEMI, an association that represents electronics manufacturing companies. "The impact could be really substantial if we don't figure out how to create excitement and interest in this industry."
Lawmakers passed the 2022 CHIPS Act with lofty ambitions to remake the United States into a semiconductor powerhouse, in part to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations for the tiny chips that power everything from dishwashers to computers to cars. The law included $ 39 billion to fund the construction of new and expanded semiconductor facilities, and manufacturers that want a slice of the subsidies have already announced expansions across the country.
More than 50 new facility projects have been announced since the CHIPS Act was introduced, and private companies have pledged more than $ 210 billion in investments, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
But that investment has run headfirst into the tightest labor market in years, with employers across the country struggling to find workers. Semiconductor manufacturers have long found it difficult to hire workers because of a lack of awareness of the industry and too few students entering relevant academic fields. Company officials say they expect it to become even more difficult to hire for a range of critical positions, including the construction workers building the plants, the technicians operating equipment and engineers designing chips.
The U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of about 70,000 to 90,000 workers over the next few years, according to a Deloitte report. McKinsey has also projected a shortfall of about 300,000 engineers and 90,000 skilled technicians in the United States by 2030.
Semiconductor manufacturers have struggled to hire more employees, in part because, officials say, there are not enough skilled workers and they have to compete with big technology firms for engineers. Many students who graduate with advanced engineering degrees in the United States were born abroad, and immigration rules make it challenging to obtain visas to work in the country.
Ronnie Chatterji, the White House's CHIPS implementation coordinator, said that filling the new jobs would be a big challenge, but that he felt confident Americans would want them as they became more aware of the industry's domestic expansion.
"While it hasn't been the sexiest job opportunity for folks compared to some of the other things that they're graduating with, it also hasn't been on the radar," Mr. Chatterji said. He added that America would be less "prosperous" if companies could increase output but lacked the employees to do so.
In an effort to meet the labor demand, the Biden administration said this month that it would create five initial "work force hubs" in cities like Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, to help train more women, people of color and other underrepresented workers in industries like semiconductor manufacturing.
Administration and company officials have also pushed for changes to better retain foreign-born STEM graduates, but immigration remains a controversial topic in Washington, and few are optimistic about reforms.
Some industry leaders are looking to technology as an antidote, since automation and artificial intelligence can amplify the output of a single engineer, but companies are mostly putting their faith into training programs. Federal officials have backed that effort and pointed out that funding in the CHIPS Act could be used for work force development.
Intel, which announced plans to spend $ 20 billion on two new chip factories in Arizona and more than $ 20 billion on a new chip manufacturing complex in Ohio, has invested millions in partnerships with community colleges and universities to train technicians and expand relevant curriculum.
Gabriela Cruz Thompson, the director of university research collaboration at Intel Labs, said the company anticipated creating 6,700 jobs over the next five to 10 years. About 70 percent would be for technicians who typically have a two-year degree or certificate.
She said that the industry had faced staffing challenges for years, and that she was concerned about the number of "available and talented skilled workers" who could fill all of the new Intel positions.
"I am confident," she said. "But am I fully certain, 100 percent? No."
Micron, which pledged as much as $ 100 billion over the next two decades or more to build a huge chip factory complex in New York, has also deployed new work force programs, including ones that train veterans and teach middle and high school students about STEM careers through "chip camps."
Bo Machayo, the director of U.S. federal affairs at Micron, said the company anticipated needing roughly 9,000 employees after its full build-out in the region.
"We understand that it's a challenge, but we also look at it as an opportunity," he said.
To be considered for the federal subsidies, manufacturers must submit applications to the Commerce Department that include detailed plans about how they will recruit and retain workers. Firms requesting more than $ 150 million are expected to provide affordable, high-quality child care.
"We don't think that a company can just post a bunch of jobs online and hope that the right work force shows up," said Kevin Gallagher, a senior adviser to the commerce secretary.
The lack of interest in the industry has been evident at academic institutions. Karl Hirschman, the director of microelectronic engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said the university was "nowhere close" to the maximum enrollment for its microelectronic engineering degree program, which sets up students for semiconductor-related careers. Enrollment averages about 20 new undergraduates each year, compared with more than 200 for the university's mechanical engineering program.
Although students graduating with more popular engineering degrees could work in the semiconductor industry, Mr. Hirschman said, many of them are more aware of and attracted to tech firms like Google and Facebook.
"We do not have enough students to fill the need," he said. "It's only going to get more challenging."
Community colleges, universities and school districts are creating or expanding programs to attract more students to the industry.
In Maricopa County, Ariz., three community colleges have teamed up with Intel to offer a "quick start" program to prepare students to become entry-level technicians in just 10 days. During the four-hour classes, students learn the basics of how chips are made, practice using hand tools and try on the head-to-toe gowns that technicians wear.
More than 680 students have enrolled in the program since it began in July, said Leah Palmer, the executive director of the Arizona Advanced Manufacturing Institute at Mesa Community College. The program is free for in-state students who complete it and pass a certification test.
In Oregon last year, the Hillsboro School District started a two-year advanced manufacturing apprenticeship program that allows 16- to 18-year-old students to earn high school credit and be paid to work on the manufacturing floors of companies in the semiconductor industry. Five students are participating, and officials hope to add at least three more to the next cohort, said Claudia Rizo, the district's youth apprenticeship project manager.
"Our hope is that students would have a job offer with the companies if they decide to stay full time, but also be open to the possibility of pursuing postsecondary education through college or university," Ms. Rizo said.
Universities are also expanding undergraduate and graduate engineering programs. Purdue started a semiconductor degree program last year, and Syracuse, which has worked with Micron and 20 other institutions to enhance related curriculum, plans to increase its engineering enrollment 50 percent over the next three to five years.
At Onondaga Community College, near Micron's build-out in New York, officials will offer a new two-year degree and one-year certificate in electromechanical technology starting this fall. The programs were already underway before Micron's announcement to build the chip factory complex but would help students gain the qualifications needed to work there, said Timothy Stedman, the college's dean of natural and applied sciences.
Although he felt optimistic, he said interest could be lower than officials hoped. Enrollment in the college's electrical and mechanical technology programs has noticeably declined from two decades ago because more students have started to view four-year college degrees as the default path.
"We're starting to see the pendulum swing a little bit as people have realized that these are well-paying jobs," Mr. Stedman said. "But I think there still needs to be a fair amount of work done."

A.I. Spurs An Industry To Detect It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a dozen companies have popped up to offer services aimed at identifying whether photos, text and videos are made by humans or machines.
Andrey Doronichev was alarmed last year when he saw a video on social media that appeared to show the president of Ukraine surrendering to Russia.
The video was quickly debunked as a synthetically generated deepfake, but to Mr. Doronichev, it was a worrying portent. This year, his fears crept closer to reality, as companies began competing to enhance and release artificial intelligence technology despite the havoc it could cause.
Generative A.I. is now available to anyone, and it's increasingly capable of fooling people with text, audio, images and videos that seem to be conceived and captured by humans. The risk of societal gullibility has set off concerns about disinformation, job loss, discrimination, privacy and broad dystopia.
For entrepreneurs like Mr. Doronichev, it has also become a business opportunity. More than a dozen companies now offer tools to identify whether something was made with artificial intelligence, with names like Sensity AI (deepfake detection), Fictitious.AI (plagiarism detection) and Originality.AI (also plagiarism).
Mr. Doronichev, a Russian native, founded a company in San Francisco, Optic, to help identify synthetic or spoofed material -- to be, in his words, "an airport X-ray machine for digital content."
In March, it unveiled a website where users can check images to see if they were made by actual photographs or artificial intelligence. It is working on other services to verify video and audio.
"Content authenticity is going to become a major problem for society as a whole," said Mr. Doronichev, who was an investor for a face-swapping app called Reface. "We're entering the age of cheap fakes." Since it doesn't cost much to produce fake content, he said, it can be done at scale.
The overall generative A.I. market is expected to exceed $ 109 billion by 2030, growing 35.6 percent a year on average until then, according to the market research firm Grand View Research. Businesses focused on detecting the technology are a growing part of the industry.
Months after being created by a Princeton University student, GPTZero claims that more than a million people have used its program to suss out computer-generated text. Reality Defender was one of 414 companies chosen from 17,000 applications to be funded by the start-up accelerator Y Combinator this winter.
Copyleaks raised $ 7.75 million last year in part to expand its anti-plagiarism services for schools and universities to detect artificial intelligence in students' work. Sentinel, whose founders specialized in cybersecurity and information warfare for the British Royal Navy and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, closed a $ 1.5 million seed round in 2020 that was backed in part by one of Skype's founding engineers to help protect democracies against deepfakes and other malicious synthetic media.
Major tech companies are also involved: Intel's FakeCatcher claims to be able to identify deepfake videos with 96 percent accuracy, in part by analyzing pixels for subtle signs of blood flow in human faces.
Within the federal government, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency plans to spend nearly $ 30 million this year to run Semantic Forensics, a program that develops algorithms to automatically detect deepfakes and determine whether they are malicious.
Even OpenAI, which turbocharged the A.I. boom when it released its ChatGPT tool late last year, is working on detection services. The company, based in San Francisco, debuted a free tool in January to help distinguish between text composed by a human and text written by artificial intelligence.
OpenAI stressed that while the tool was an improvement on past iterations, it was still "not fully reliable." The tool correctly identified 26 percent of artificially generated text but falsely flagged 9 percent of text from humans as computer generated.
The OpenAI tool is burdened with common flaws in detection programs: It struggles with short texts and writing that is not in English. In educational settings, plagiarism-detection tools such as TurnItIn have been accused of inaccurately classifying essays written by students as being generated by chatbots.
Detection tools inherently lag behind the generative technology they are trying to detect. By the time a defense system is able to recognize the work of a new chatbot or image generator, like Google Bard or Midjourney, developers are already coming up with a new iteration that can evade that defense. The situation has been described as an arms race or a virus-antivirus relationship where one begets the other, over and over.
"When Midjourney releases Midjourney 5, my starter gun goes off, and I start working to catch up -- and while I'm doing that, they're working on Midjourney 6," said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics and is also involved in the A.I. detection industry. "It's an inherently adversarial game where as I work on the detector, somebody is building a better mousetrap, a better synthesizer."
Despite the constant catch-up, many companies have seen demand for A.I. detection from schools and educators, said Joshua Tucker, a professor of politics at New York University and a co-director of its Center for Social Media and Politics. He questioned whether a similar market would emerge ahead of the 2024 election.
"Will we see a sort of parallel wing of these companies developing to help protect political candidates so they can know when they're being sort of targeted by these kinds of things," he said.
Experts said that synthetically generated video was still fairly clunky and easy to identify, but that audio cloning and image-crafting were both highly advanced. Separating real from fake will require digital forensics tactics such as reverse image searches and IP address tracking.
Available detection programs are being tested with examples that are "very different than going into the wild, where images that have been making the rounds and have gotten modified and cropped and downsized and transcoded and annotated and God knows what else has happened to them," Mr. Farid said.
"That laundering of content makes this a hard task," he added.
The Content Authenticity Initiative, a consortium of 1,000 companies and organizations, is one group trying to make generative technology obvious from the outset. (It's led by Adobe, with members such as The New York Times and artificial intelligence players like Stability A.I.) Rather than piece together the origin of an image or a video later in its life cycle, the group is trying to establish standards that will apply traceable credentials to digital work upon creation.
Adobe said last week that its generative technology Firefly would be integrated into Google Bard, where it will attach "nutrition labels" to the content it produces, including the date an image was made and the digital tools used to create it.
Jeff Sakasegawa, the trust and safety architect at Persona, a company that helps verify consumer identity, said the challenges raised by artificial intelligence had only begun.
"The wave is building momentum," he said. "It's heading toward the shore. I don't think it's crashed yet."

Full text: For more than 50 years, designers of computer chips mainly used one tactic to boost performance: They shrank electronic components to pack more power onto each piece of silicon.
Then more than a decade ago, engineers at the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices began toying with a radical idea. Instead of designing one big microprocessor with vast numbers of tiny transistors, they conceived of creating one from smaller chips that would be packaged tightly together to work like one electronic brain.
The concept, sometimes called chiplets, caught on in a big way, with AMD, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, IBM and Intel introducing such products. Chiplets rapidly gained traction because smaller chips are cheaper to make, while bundles of them can top the performance of any single slice of silicon.
The strategy, based on advanced packaging technology, has since become an essential tool to enabling progress in semiconductors. And it represents one of the biggest shifts in years for an industry that drives innovations in fields like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and military hardware.
"Packaging is where the action is going to be," said Subramanian Iyer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, who helped pioneer the chiplet concept. "It's happening because there is actually no other way."
The catch is that such packaging, like making chips themselves, is overwhelmingly dominated by companies in Asia. Although the United States accounts for around 12 percent of global semiconductor production, American companies provide just 3 percent of chip packaging, according to IPC, a trade association.
That issue has now landed chiplets in the middle of U.S. industrial policymaking. The CHIPS Act, a $ 52 billion subsidy package that passed last summer, was seen as President Biden's move to reinvigorate domestic chip making by providing money to build more sophisticated factories called "fabs." But part of it was also aimed at stoking advanced packaging factories in the United States to capture more of that essential process.
"As chips get smaller, the way you arrange the chips, which is packaging, is more and more important and we need it done in America," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, said in a speech at Georgetown University in February.
The Commerce Department is now accepting applications for manufacturing grants from the CHIPS Act, including for chip packaging factories. It is also allocating funding to a research program specifically on advanced packaging.
Some chip packaging companies are moving quickly for the funding. One is Integra Technologies in Wichita, Kan., which announced plans for a $ 1.8 billion expansion there but said that was contingent on receiving federal subsidies. Amkor Technology, an Arizona packaging service that has most of its operations in Asia, also said it was talking to customers and government officials about a U.S. production presence.
Packaging chips together isn't a new concept and chiplets are just the latest iteration of that idea, using technological advances that help cram the chips closer together -- either side by side or stacked on top of one another -- along with faster electrical connections between them.
"What is unique about chiplets is the way they are connected electrically," said Richard Otte, the chief executive of Promex Industries, a chip packaging service in Santa Clara, Calif.
Chips can't do anything without a way to connect them with other components, which means they need to be placed in some kind of package that can carry electrical signals. That process starts after factories complete the initial phase of manufacturing, which may create hundreds of chips on a silicon wafer. Once that wafer is sliced apart, individual chips are typically bonded to a key base layer called a substrate, which can conduct electrical signals.
That combination is then coated in protective plastic, forming a package that can be plugged into a circuit board that is essential for connecting to other components in a system.
These processes originally required lots of manual labor, leading Silicon Valley companies to shift packaging to lower-wage countries in Asia more than 50 years ago. Most chips are typically flown to packaging services in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China.
Since then, packaging advances have gained importance because of the diminishing returns from Moore's Law, the shorthand expression for chip miniaturization that for decades drove progress in Silicon Valley. It is named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, whose 1965 paper described how rapidly companies had doubled the number of transistors on a typical chip, which improved performance at a lower cost.
But these days, smaller transistors are not necessarily cheaper, partly because building factories for leading-edge chips can cost $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion. Big, complex chips also are costly to design and tend to have more manufacturing defects, even as companies in fields like generative A.I. want more transistors than can currently be packed onto the biggest chips manufacturing machines allow.
"The natural response to that is putting more things in a package," said Anirudh Devgan, chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, whose software is used to design conventional chips as well as chiplet-style products.
Synopsys, a rival, said it was tracking more than 140 customer projects based on packaging multiple chips together. As much as 80 percent of microprocessors will use chiplet-style designs by 2027, according to the market research firm Yole Group.
Today, companies typically design all the chiplets in a package along with their own connection technology. But industry groups are working on technical standards so companies can more easily assemble products from chiplets that come from different makers.
The new technology is mostly used now for extreme performance. Intel recently introduced a processor called Ponte Vecchio with 47 chiplets that will be used in a powerful supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, which is near Chicago.
In January, AMD disclosed plans for an unusual product, the MI300, that combines chiplets for standard calculations with others designed for computer graphics, along with a large pool of memory chips. That processor, intended to power another advanced supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has 146 billion transistors, compared with tens of billions for most advanced conventional chips.
Sam Naffziger, an AMD senior vice president, said it wasn't a slam-dunk for the company to bet its chip business for server computers on chiplets. Packaging complexities were a major hurdle, he said, which were eventually overcome with help from an undisclosed partner.
But chiplets have paid off for AMD. The company has sold more than 12 million chips based on the idea since 2017, according to Mercury Research, and has become a major player in microprocessors that power the web.
Packaging services still need others to supply the substrates that chiplets require to connect to circuit boards and one another. One company driving the chiplet boom is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which already makes chips for AMD and hundreds of others and offers an advanced silicon-based substrate called an interposer.
Intel has been developing similar technology, as well as enhancing less-expensive conventional plastic substrates in an approach favored by some such as the Silicon Valley start-up Eliyan. Intel has also been developing new packaging prototypes under a Pentagon program and hopes to win CHIPs Act support for a new pilot packaging plant.
But the United States has no major makers of those substrates, which are primarily produced in Asia and evolved from technologies used in manufacturing circuit boards. Many U.S. companies have also left that business, another worry that industry groups hope will spur federal funding to help board suppliers start making substrates.
In March, Mr. Biden issued a determination that advanced packaging and domestic circuit board production were essential for national security, and announced $ 50 million in Defense Production Act funding for American and Canadian companies in those fields.
Even with such subsidies, assembling all the elements required to reduce U.S. dependence on Asian companies "is a huge challenge," said Andreas Olofsson, who ran a Defense Department research effort in the field before founding a packaging start-up called Zero ASIC. "You don't have suppliers. You don't have a work force. You don't have equipment. You have to sort of start from scratch."

A Company That Is Crucial To the Security of an Island Faces a Shortage of Engineers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan's world-dominating microchip sector was built by TSMC's skilled employees. But a demographic crisis, demanding work culture and flagging interest threaten its lead.
Engineers like Royale Lee, 31, are one reason Taiwan is the world's biggest contract producer of the microchips that power almost all electronics.
When a computer virus paralyzed machinery at his employer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Mr. Lee pulled a 48-hour shift to help fix the problem. For years he responded to phone calls day and night. But in late 2021, after five years of sacrifices, he had come to fear the ring of his phone. His annual compensation of $ 105,000, an envied sum in Taiwan, was not enough for him to stick around.
Over the past decade, TSMC, as the company is known, has built a wide lead over rivals like Intel and Samsung in the race to make the smallest -- and fastest -- microchips. Largely because of the ingenuity of its engineers, TSMC has become one of the most geopolitically important firms in the world.
Today, many at the top of Taiwan's semiconductor industry fear the tiny island territory will not be able to sustain the growing demand for a new generation of engineers. A shrinking population, demanding work culture and an abundance of competing tech jobs have meant workers have become ever more scarce.
The stakes are enormous. Some military strategists argue that TSMC's dominance in microchips provides Taiwan a guarantee against an invasion by China -- in part because the United States would need to defend such an important piece of its supply chain.
Taiwan's talent crisis is intertwined with TSMC's success. The company's employee count has grown almost 70 percent over the past decade, while Taiwan's birthrate has plummeted by half. Start-ups in promising fields like artificial intelligence are luring top engineers. In recruiting, TSMC must compete with internet companies like Google and foreign semiconductor companies like ASML of the Netherlands, which generally offer better work-life balance and perks like free food.
TSMC's leaders have defended the company's famously tough work culture, which has helped it grow into a $ 440 billion behemoth with 73,000 employees. Morris Chang, the founder, recently defended the military discipline he expected -- spouses, he said, would just fall back asleep when TSMC called employees to work in the middle of the night. But in recent years, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu has repeatedly acknowledged that the largest challenge facing Taiwan's semiconductor industry is its shortage of talent.
Taiwan's largest job search platform, 104 Job Bank, had over 33,000 listings for chip industry jobs as of August. Last year, Taiwan's chip sector employed about 326,000 people, according to the government-affiliated Industrial Technology Research Institute.
TSMC has been forced to adjust its recruitment strategies. It has broadened hiring channels and increased its base salary for master's graduates, who can now expect to receive an average annual compensation of up to $ 65,000. It begins recruiting Taiwanese graduate students in September, well ahead of the conventional job-hunting season of March, and has even begun to cultivate high schoolers with online classes about the basics of semiconductors.
"Many companies are struggling to find suitable candidates," said Burn Lin, a former vice president at TSMC and the current dean of National Tsing Hua University's College of Semiconductor Research.
"Now when searching for talent, they are not very picky," Mr. Lin said. "You don't necessarily have to study electrical engineering or computer science."
The college Mr. Lin heads is one of four specialized semiconductor schools that were established by the Taiwanese government in 2021 in response to calls for action by industry players like Mr. Liu and Tsai Ming-kai, chairman of the chip design firm MediaTek.
"In cultivating semiconductor talent, we are racing against time," Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's president, said at the unveiling of Mr. Lin's semiconductor college.
The challenges facing Taiwan's chip industry come amid a global crunch. In China, where officials have sought to lure Taiwanese engineers to build up its fledgling chip industry, the state-backed Chinese Academy of Sciences has fretted about a "serious shortage" of qualified workers. By one estimate, China's microchip industry was short 200,000 people.
In the United States, government efforts to use billions of dollars in subsidies to attract semiconductor plants have spurred Intel, Samsung, TSMC and others to announce plans for new plants. But surveys of executives showed talent shortages remain a problem.
At TSMC, the recruitment gap back home has added urgency to its efforts to build factories, and train workers, outside Taiwan. Unlike most major hardware companies, which long ago spread research and production across the world, TSMC has built the vast majority of its chip manufacturing plants, known as fabs, in Taiwan. The clustering of its best employees and suppliers as well as most cutting-edge plants has helped it over the years, but the company needs to start looking beyond Taiwan, according to Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih.
"If I were TSMC I'd get serious about finding other places where I can get that talent," he said.
Making semiconductors requires skilled and disciplined employees and it is part of the reason TSMC excels at it, said Wu Chih-I, director of the TSMC-National Taiwan University Joint Research Center.
Mr. Wu, who worked as an engineer at Intel early in his career, said tech workers today are more interested in jobs that fit their interests, rather than just pursuing a paycheck as his generation was.‌ ‌
"If you don't have significant financial pressure, you might choose a less demanding job, even if it means passing up the high salary and promising future of a semiconductor career."
Mr. Lee, the former TSMC employee, said younger Taiwanese are less willing to endure the grueling experience of working in a fab.
"It's no longer as glorious as it used to be," said Mr. Lee, who now works as a web developer for an American firm.
Jason Chin, senior vice president of 104 Job Bank, said TSMC and other chip companies will never stop the turnover without improving working conditions.
That applies not just to workers like Mr. Lee who face the grueling job of keeping plants running, but also critical researchers who think up new ways to make chips ever faster.
Frank Lin, 30, is one such TSMC researcher who left because he found the work tedious and unfulfilling. His role as product engineer and chip designer was not as high pressure as others at the company, but he nonetheless struggled, craving more meaning and a sense of accomplishment. Even though he had a master's degree from one of Taiwan's most prestigious universities, he was given scant responsibility and assigned rote daily tasks.
"Though the amount of money I make continues to increase, is this all there is to life?" he remembered thinking often at work when sitting in a sunlit office pantry. After fewer than three years at the company, he struck out on his own as an independent financial adviser. He hasn't looked back. "People want to work for themselves. There are so many possibilities in the outside world right now," he said.

Guns and Plots Filled the Chats Of an Airman: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A review of more than 9,500 messages obtained by The New York Times offers important clues about the mind-set of a young airman implicated in a vast leak of government secrets.
Jack Teixeira, the Air National Guardsman implicated in a vast leak of classified documents, was fixated on weapons, mass shootings, shadowy conspiracy theories -- and proving he was in the right, and in the know.
Even as he relished the respectability and access to intelligence he gained through his military service and top secret clearance, he seethed with contempt about the government, accusing the United States of a host of secret, nefarious activities: making biological and chemical weapons in Ukrainian labs, creating the Islamic State, even orchestrating mass shootings.
"The FBI and other 3 letter agencies contact these unhinged mentally ill kids and convince them to do mass shootings," Airman Teixeira, 21, wrote in an online chat group, sharing a debunked conspiracy theory after a gunman killed three people at a mall in Indiana last summer.
In messages posted on Discord, a social media platform popular among gamers, Airman Teixeira claimed that the 20-year-old gunman behind the rampage at Greenwood Park Mall was one of many mass shooters groomed by the American government as part of a secret plot "to make people vote for" gun control.
The posts are part of a huge trove of previously unreported chat logs obtained by The New York Times. The Discord server, exclusively reviewed by The Times, is one of at least two in which Airman Teixeira shared U.S. intelligence on Ukrainian readiness, battlefield commands from the Kremlin and secret arms shipments by American allies, along with reports of internal friction on all sides. The airman, who was charged with two counts related to the unauthorized handling of classified materials, could face 25 years in prison for his involvement in the leak.
The new messages from Airman Teixeira, more than 9,500 in all, leave many questions unanswered about his motivations, but they fill in substantial gaps left by court filings and offer important clues about his mind-set. He seems to have seen himself, in a sense, as the author of an insider newsletter founded to educate his online friends -- not a whistle-blower plotting a grand exposé of government secrets.
"As of now Ukraine has ordered the US biolabs it still has to destroy all of the dangerous pathogens they hold," he wrote in March last year. "We got a comm interception from high ranking commanders stating that Russia was going to start trying to take them."
The messages bristle with bravado and contradictions, none more baffling than his concurrent admiration and suspicion of government, especially for the "3 letter agencies," such as the C.I.A. and F.B.I., which he believed were engaged in myriad plots.
"Isis was an org started by turkey, israel and the US," he wrote in July. "They needed to destabilize the middle east some how and all had enemies...how do you do that? make a terror org and fund the shit out of it."
Still, Airman Teixeira appeared to take pride in working at a secure facility on a military base on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, that he called "the box," and he loved using jargon that signaled his top secret clearance. So frequent were his leaks of intelligence gathered by government agencies that his Discord friends called him "intel man" and "3 letter man," and he seemed to revel in their approval.
And while he adopted the role of a neutral war analyst with his Discord group -- meticulously ferreting out casualty numbers and tank losses -- he frequently parroted pro-Russian reports he found on the popular messaging app Telegram, and consistently minimized Moscow's setbacks.
Airman Teixeira started posting messages on the server on the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and group members were intensely curious about the intelligence he provided.
The server has about 600 members from at least 25 countries, according to their online profiles, and remained active as recently as last week.
Many of Airman Teixeira's messages were deleted from the server shortly before his arrest in April, including photographs of top secret intelligence documents. But his thousands of posts dating back to 2021 that remained provide a granular view of the airman in his own words.
It is hard to pin down Airman Teixeira's ideology from his messages. Many are consistent with someone who is right of center, but he accuses Republicans of funding "terrorist organizations" and starting "20 year long wars."
"Both parties," he wrote in July, "drink the same blood," adding that "both have called drone strikes on hospitals lol." (The airman did not point to specific incidents in making his assertion.)
His politics seem to be dominated by his vehement opposition to firearms restrictions -- criticizing former Presidents Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump for passing various gun control measures.
Federal prosecutors, in an 18-page memo calling for Airman Teixeira's indefinite detention, cited his arsenal and "troubling" history of violent remarks and racial threats dating back to high school. The filing also included excerpts from social media chats from 2022 and 2023. In one, prosecutors say, Airman Teixeira expressed a desire to kill a "ton of people" and cull the "weak minded." In another, he described an "assassination van" that could be used to cruise around killing people.
A representative for Airman Teixeira's family declined to comment, and his court-appointed lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
The posts might be the hyperbolic utterances of a young man immersed in first-person shooter and war-themed video games, and the materials reviewed by The Times do not explicitly indicate that he was planning acts of violence.
But in chat logs analyzed by The Times, the airman posted multiple videos of himself firing various rifles. In one target practice session in February, he shot a Soviet-designed semiautomatic rifle from the bed of a truck. Days before, according to the prosecutors' filing, he solicited advice about firing an AR-style rifle "out of an suv" in "a crowded urban or suburban environment."
Posts reviewed by The Times indicate that Airman Teixeira claimed to have at least 16 firearms over two years. The airman posted about six new guns in February and March alone, suggesting he was acquiring weapons shortly before his arrest.
One Discord user who frequently communicated with Airman Teixeira told The Times in text messages that the airman claimed to have been stockpiling weapons and military gear. The user, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the airman had discussed various ambitions, including plotting to confront protesters during the 2024 presidential campaign, hog hunting in rural New England and modifying vehicles that could be outfitted with weapons.
The user was not certain if Airman Teixeira intended to carry out any of the plans.
His messages show a clear fascination with mass shootings, and at times, he adopted the same sense of detachment that he exhibited in posts about the war in Ukraine, focusing more on gear than on the human toll of their use.
"I think analyzing mass shootings is cool. And fun," he wrote on Sept. 5, 2022, during an exchange about similarities between shooters in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo.
In October, when another user posted a video of a police officer being fatally shot during a traffic stop, Airman Teixeira responded, "one of my favorite shooting vids." He was not interested in the circumstances of the shooting, saying he was trying to examine the firearms used in the encounter.
In a series of posts last summer, Airman Teixeira said the cost and sophistication of firearm kits used by gunmen in mass shootings suggested they had been supplied by the government. He also claimed he had received tips from co-workers in intelligence who had advance knowledge of mass shootings. On one Sunday in June, for example, he wrote: "theres going to be another shooting this wednesday. possible smaller one on monday."
Several members of the chat group also echoed this conspiracy theory and put stock in Airman Teixeira's predictions, none of which came true.
From his long trail of posts, Airman Teixeira seemed to relish showing his friends on Discord that he was privy to materials unavailable to the general public.
On Feb. 24, 2022, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, members of the group were ribbing the airman, saying he had shared old open-source material anyone might pull from Twitter. The next night, he gave his first glimpse of insider access.
"Saw a pentagon report saying that ⅓rd of the force is being used to invade," he wrote.
It failed to impress. On Feb. 26, he was more overt. "I have a little more than open source info," he noted in a message about Russian thermobaric rocket launchers. "Perks of being in a USAF intel unit." By Feb. 27, his friends were showing him more respect -- and he rewarded them by posting a report on Russia's naval landing near Mariupol, saying that he had received the information from a work colleague whom he called his "intel homie."
As the leaks earned him cachet in the group chat, he grew bolder, posting transcripts of portions of intelligence documents, even as he delighted in making predictions based on inside information about the conflict.
Airman Teixeira often used his phone to write his intelligence updates from the base. In one 550-word message in March last year, Airman Teixeira detailed war casualties, a Ukrainian strike on a Russian ammunition depot and Turkey's decision not to send S-400 air defense systems to Ukraine, among other things.
"Whew that was a lot to type" on a phone, he wrote.
His posts indicate he was aware his leaks could lead to serious punishment. When one member asked in March last year, "can you post any document regarding the losses or are they sekrit," the airman replied, "If I want to go to jail for the rest of my life yeah."
One Discord user, who asked to be identified by his username, the Mighty Dink, said on Facebook Messenger that he had warned the airman of the repercussions of sharing sensitive information: "a few of us said be careful," he wrote, "but you cant help those that don't want to be helped."
Another person, who goes by the username Zhyopnik and who is a college student in Minnesota majoring in Russian and Eastern European studies, said that he had worried where the leaked documents would end up, "especially when you're posting in servers with international communities."
Ultimately, however, Airman Teixeira seemed to assume that the members of an online chat group would do something he was unwilling to do: keep a secret.
In March, when the documents he leaked started to circulate beyond his Discord chat groups, Airman Teixeira announced he would no longer be posting his intelligence updates on Ukraine, citing not the dangers but the burdens of his second job.
"Basically I don't want to cover the war anymore, it burned me out a lot," he wrote on March 19, less than a month before his arrest.
He added a caveat.
He would still field information requests through direct messaging.

Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman implicated in a vast leak of classified documents, was fixated on weapons, mass shootings, shadowy conspiracy theories — and proving he was in the right, and in the know.
Even as he relished the respectability and access to intelligence he gained through his military service and top secret clearance, he seethed with contempt about the government, accusing the United States of a host of secret, nefarious activities: making biological and chemical weapons in Ukrainian labs, creating the Islamic State group, even orchestrating mass shootings.
“The FBI and other 3 letter agencies contact these unhinged mentally ill kids and convince them to do mass shootings,” Teixeira, 21, wrote in an online chat group, sharing a debunked conspiracy theory after a gunman killed three people at a mall in Indiana last summer.
In messages posted on Discord, a social media platform popular among gamers, Teixeira claimed that the 20-year-old gunman behind the rampage at Greenwood Park Mall was one of many mass shooters groomed by the U.S. government as part of a secret plot “to make people vote for” gun control.
The posts are part of a huge trove of previously unreported chat logs obtained by The New York Times. The Discord server, exclusively reviewed by the Times, is one of at least two in which Teixeira shared U.S. intelligence on Ukrainian readiness, battlefield commands from the Kremlin and secret arms shipments by U.S. allies, along with reports of internal friction on all sides. Teixeira, who was charged with two counts related to the unauthorized handling of classified materials, could face 25 years in prison for his involvement in the leak.
The new messages from Teixeira, more than 9,500 in all, leave many questions unanswered about his motivations, but they fill in substantial gaps left by court filings and offer important clues about his mindset. He seems to have seen himself, in a sense, as the author of an insider newsletter founded to educate his online friends — not a whistleblower plotting a grand expose of government secrets.
“As of now Ukraine has ordered the US biolabs it still has to destroy all of the dangerous pathogens they hold,” he wrote in March last year. “We got a comm interception from high ranking commanders stating that Russia was going to start trying to take them.”
The messages bristle with bravado and contradictions, none more baffling than his concurrent admiration and suspicion of government, especially for the “3 letter agencies,” such as the CIA and FBI, which he believed were engaged in myriad plots.
“Isis was an org started by turkey, israel and the US,” he wrote in July. “They needed to destabilize the middle east some how and all had enemies … how do you do that? make a terror org and fund the shit out of it.”
Still, Teixeira appeared to take pride in working at a secure facility on a military base on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, that he called “the box,” and he loved using jargon that signaled his top secret clearance. So frequent were his leaks of intelligence gathered by government agencies that his Discord friends called him “intel man” and “3 letter man,” and he seemed to revel in their approval.

Federal prosecutors, in an 18-page memo calling for Teixeira’s indefinite detention, cited his arsenal and “troubling" history of violent remarks and racial threats dating back to high school. The filing also included excerpts from social media chats from 2022 and 2023.

McDonald's Groups FinedFor Child Labor Violations
Two 10-year-olds are among 300 children who worked at McDonald's restaurants illegally, a Labor Department investigation of franchisees in Kentucky found.
Agency investigators found the 10-year-olds received little or no pay at a McDonald's in Louisville, the Labor Department said. The three franchisees were fined $ 212,000 in total.
One of them, Louisville's Bauer Food L.L.C., which operates 10 McDonald's locations, employed 24 minors under the age of 16 to work more hours than legally permitted, the agency said. Among those were two 10-year-old children. The agency said the children sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m., but were not paid.
The franchise owner-operator, Sean Bauer, said the two 10-year-olds were visiting their parent, a night manager, and weren't employees.
The Walton, Ky.-based Archways Richwood L.L.C. and Louisville-based Bell Restaurant Group I L.L.C. were also fined. ASSOCIATED PRESS

French Authority RejectsRestoring Retirement Age
France's top constitutional body rejected on Wednesday an effort by opposition lawmakers to undo a law to raise the retirement age to 64, deeming that a proposal did not meet the needed criteria. The law was pushed by President Emmanuel Macron, right.
It was the second time that the Constitutional Council has rejected the plan to restore the retirement age to 62, notably via a possible referendum or new bill. Had it passed muster, the process called for would be long and wouldn't stop Mr. Macron's unpopular law from taking effect.
Opposition lawmakers, mainly from the left, sought a complex process to reject the law, which was enacted last month.
The Constitutional Council's role was to assess whether the opposition's request meets the legal conditions for a potential referendum. Had it been accepted, supporters would have had nine months to collect signatures from at least 4.8 million, or 10 percent, of French voters. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google Plans to Add2 Data Centers in Ohio
Google plans to build two more data centers in Ohio to help power its artificial intelligence technology and other tools, the company and state officials announced Wednesday.
With one data center already up and running near Columbus, the two new locations will bring Google's total investment in Ohio to more than $ 2 billion, officials said.
Ohio is seeing a wave of big investments by the technology industry.
Intel is building a $ 20 billion chip factory just east of Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea are building a $ 3.5 billion battery plant between Columbus and Cincinnati that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub.
The area around Columbus also is home to data centers operated by Facebook and Amazon.
The two new Google data centers will be built in Columbus and Lancaster. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Wall Street Ends April on a Positive Note: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-ends-april-on-positive-note/docview/2807257697/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out a winning April with gains Friday after more companies said their profits at the start of the year weren't as bad as expected.
The S&P 500 rose 34.13, or 0.8 percent, to 4,169.48. Despite some sharp swings this week, it still clinched a second straight winning month. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 272.00, or 0.8 percent, to 34,098.16, and the Nasdaq composite gained 84.35, or 0.7 percent, to 12,226.58.
Exxon Mobil did some of the market's heavier lifting after it rose 1.3 percent. It reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast.
Intel gained 4 percent after reporting a milder loss than expected and stronger revenue for the latest quarter. Mondelez International, the food giant behind Oreo and Ritz, rose 3.9 percent after topping Wall Street's estimates. It also raised its forecast for revenue and earnings over the full year.
They helped to offset a 4 percent drop for Amazon, which weighed heavily on the market despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to a slowdown in revenue growth at its AWS cloud computing business.
Snap tumbled 17 percent after its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of forecasts. Pinterest also fell sharply, down 15.7 percent, despite reporting stronger results than expected. Analysts pointed to its growth forecast for the current quarter, which looked more tepid than some expected.
Wall Street has focused heavily on what C.E.O.s are saying about their upcoming trends given how much uncertainty is ahead about where the economy and interest rates are heading. The economy is slowing under the weight of much higher interest rates meant to get high inflation under control.
The majority of companies so far this reporting season have beaten expectations, highlighted by Big Tech behemoths this past week like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. They have an outsized effect on market indexes because of their massive size.
Recent economic reports have kept expectations in place on Wall Street for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again at its next meeting next week.
A report on Friday said the inflation measure that the Fed prefers to use came in close to expectations for March, but it remains well above the target.
Compensation for workers also rose more during the first three months of the year than economists expected. While that's welcome news for workers trying to keep up with still-rising prices at registers, the Fed fears that could help make high inflation more entrenched.
"Bottom line, inflation is still above target, and the Fed is poised to raise interest rates again next week -- and leave them at high levels for quite a while," said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
High rates combat inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. That has many investors preparing for a possible recession to hit sometime this year.
The Fed has raised its key overnight interest rate to its highest level since 2007, up from its record low, following a barrage of hikes since early last year. Together, they've already slowed the economy's growth down to an estimated 1.1 percent annual rate at the start of this year.
They've also caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking global markets last month. Investors are hunting for other weak links, and the spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank.
Its stock roughly halved on Tuesday after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers have yanked. First Republic tumbled again Friday and is down 97.1 percent for the year so far.

Full text: Prosecutors accused Jack Teixeira of trying to cover up his actions and described a possible propensity toward violence.
WASHINGTON -- Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of posting classified documents online, repeatedly tried to obstruct federal investigators and has a "troubling" history of making racist and violent remarks, Justice Department lawyers said in a court filing late Wednesday.
In an 18-page memo, released before a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday in a Massachusetts federal court, the department's lawyers argued that Airman Teixeira needed to be detained indefinitely because he posed a "serious flight risk" and might still have information that would be of "tremendous value to hostile nation states."
Airman Teixeira tapped into vast reservoirs of sensitive information, an amount that "far exceeds what has been publicly disclosed" so far, they wrote.
Prosecutors pointedly questioned Airman Teixeira's overall state of mind, disclosing that he was suspended from high school in 2018 for alarming comments about the use of Molotov cocktails and other weapons, and trawled the internet for information about mass shootings. He engaged in "regular discussions about violence and murder" on the same social media platform, Discord, that he used to post classified information, the filing said, and he surrounded his bed at his parents' house with firearms and tactical gear.
Airman Teixeira was also prone to making "racial threats," prosecutors said.
This behavior -- so disturbing it was flagged by local police when he applied for a firearms identification card -- is certain to raise new questions about how Airman Teixeira obtained a top-secret security clearance that gave him access to some of the country's most sensitive intelligence reports.
Mr. Teixeira's court-appointed lawyers dismissed the claim that he would be in a flight risk, and proposed that he be released on a $ 20,000 bond to his family's custody, in a response filed several hours before the hearing.
The episode in high school took place during his sophomore year and was never repeated, they said. The lawyers also played down the idea that he would have an opportunity to turn information over to the United States' enemies.
The government provided "little more than speculation that a foreign adversary will seduce Mr. Teixeira and orchestrate his clandestine escape from the United States," they wrote.
His legal team also offered a fleeting first glimpse at possible defense arguments, claiming that the government has not offered proof Mr. Teixeira ever intended for the information posted to a private social media server "to be widely disseminated."
Mr. Teixeira's lawyers described him as compliant -- and said he sat on the porch reading a Bible as he waited to be arrested -- but the government painted a starkly different picture.
In arguing for his confinement, prosecutors described a panicked effort by Airman Teixeira to cover up his actions as law enforcement closed in, including telling a member of a chat group to "delete all messages," and instructing a user to stonewall investigators.
He also tried to destroy evidence, prosecutors said. The filing includes a series of photos of electronic equipment, including a tablet and an Xbox console, that he hurriedly smashed, then tossed in a dumpster near his home in North Dighton, Mass., before his arrest this month. A witness told the government that he threw his phone out the window of his truck as he was driving.
"These efforts appeared calculated to delay or prevent the government from gaining a full understanding of the seriousness and scale of his conduct," the department wrote. "Any promise by the defendant to stay home or to refrain from compounding the harm that he has already caused is worth no more than his broken promises to protect classified national defense information."
Airman Teixeira was arrested on April 13, and charged with two separate counts related to the unauthorized handling of classified materials. The government has yet to seek an indictment before a grand jury, although prosecutors said in their filing on Wednesday that he could face 25 years -- "and potentially far more" -- in prison if convicted.
In a preliminary complaint unsealed after he was taken into custody, Airman Teixeira was accused of abusing his top secret clearance with an intelligence unit on Cape Cod to post documents bearing restrictive classification markings to a 50-member chat group on Discord.
Shortly before signing off in March, Airman Teixeira told a member of the small group he "was very happy" to share intelligence very few people get to see and solicited requests for information they wanted him to post, prosecutors said late Wednesday.
The material, some obtained through keyword searches of government files, was eventually distributed more widely. The trove of documents made public revealed the access Western intelligence agencies have to internal Kremlin deliberations, while baring concerns of the strained U.S.-led alliance trying to contain Russian aggression without prompting a wider conflict.
Last week, The New York Times reported that Airman Teixeira, who worked as a computer network specialist, had been sharing sensitive information far earlier than previously known and to a much larger group. According to online posts reviewed by The Times, he had begun doing so in February 2022, within 48 hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to a chat group of about 600 members.
The filing provided little insight into what prompted Airman Teixeira to leak internal U.S. intelligence assessments, but it cast his actions, which had previously been seen as mainly motivated by his desire to show off to younger friends online, in a somewhat darker light.
Investigators found a small arsenal in his bedroom at the house he shared with his mother and stepfather. Inside a gun locker two feet from his bed, law enforcement officials found multiple weapons, including handguns, bolt-action rifles, shotguns, an AK-style high-capacity weapon and a gas mask. F.B.I. special agents also found ammunition, tactical pouches and what appeared to be a silencer-style accessory in his desk drawer.
Mr. Teixeira's lawyers said his love of the military, and its hardware, impelled him to join the Air Force.
Prosecutors also made public a series of social media posts from 2022 and 2023 in which Airman Teixeira expressed his desire to kill a "ton of people" and cull the "weak minded," and described what he called an "assassination van" that would cruise around killing people in a "crowded urban or suburban environment."
How Airman Teixeira obtained the documents that he is accused of posting online has been a critical question for investigators. They believe he used administrator privileges connected to his role as an information technology specialist to retrieve the documents. In his posts, Airman Teixeira said his job gave him access to material that others could not see. "The job I have lets me get privilege's above most intel guys," he wrote.
Airman Teixeira had been scheduled for a detention hearing in federal court in Boston earlier this month. But his lawyer, Brendan Kelley, requested more time to address the government's arguments, and the magistrate judge, David H. Hennessy, quickly agreed.
The next major step is likely to be the filing of a grand jury indictment, which would include a much more detailed narrative of the allegations against Airman Teixeira, including a more specific accounting of the charges he will face.
Worcester, a city 50 miles west of Boston, is where Judge Hennessy's courtroom is based. But the case will eventually be assigned to a federal judge in Boston, assuming it is not moved out of Massachusetts entirely, which remains a possibility, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Officials at the Justice Department have considered asking that the case be moved to the Eastern District of Virginia, because its jurisdiction includes the Pentagon, and its lawyers have extensive experience in investigating such cases.
But it is not clear that the federal judges in Massachusetts, where Airman Teixeira lived and worked, will be willing to do so, and the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Rachael S. Rollins, a Biden appointee, believes her office is capable of handling the matter, people familiar with the situation said.

As Sales Slump, Gap Cuts 1,800 Corporate Jobs
The Gap is laying off 1,800 corporate workers, roughly three time the number of headquarters jobs it cut last fall, as the struggling chain cuts costs in a bid to become more nimble. The layoffs a follow similar cuts at large U.S. corporations this year, including Amazon and McDonald's, with white collar workers taking the brunt of the head count reductions as economy slows. In a regulatory filing Thursday, the San Francisco-based chain, which also owns Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta, said employees in its San Francisco and New York offices, as well as upper field positions like regional store managers, will be affected. Last September, Gap slashed 500 corporate jobs. Gap's executive chairman, Bob Martin, said the layoffs would lead to $ 300 million in annualized savings. The layoffs should be completed by the end of July, the regulatory filing said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Unilever Raising PricesTo Offset Higher Costs
Despite some signs inflationary pressures are easing, Unilever warned on Thursday of big increases in the prices of dairy, soybean oil, cocoa and sugar in the first half of this year --potentially bad news for fans of its Ben & Jerry's Half Baked ice cream. Unilever, which is passing on about three-quarters of its expenses to consumers, said its profit margins had fallen more than two percentage points as it battles cost inflation that started with the pandemic and worsened with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather. On Thursday, Unilever said it had raised prices by 10.7 percent in the first quarter. "It's principally around the costs of labor, logistics and energy and what our suppliers see in their own production bases," said Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever's finance chief. The worst drought in six decades in Argentina has taken a steep toll on soy farming, while Unilever buys high-end cream from the United States for some of its products. REUTERS
EARNINGS
Intel's Forecast Signals Recovering Chip Market
Intel forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, a sign that chip demand was recovering after a downturn wrought by excess supply and a postpandemic slump in the personal computer market. A fall of about 30 percent in firstquarter global personal computer shipments has made some chip industry experts hopeful that a build-up of inventory has cleared out, paving the way for fresh orders. The company forecast secondquarter adjusted revenue in the range of about $ 11.5 billion and $ 12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting revenue of $ 11.75 billion. Intel has also ramped up shipments of its most powerful data center chip, Sapphire Rapids, whose more than one-year delay had allowed its rival Advanced Micro Devices and the ARMbased server CPU makers to take market share from the company.

Airman Accused of Leak Has a ‘Troubling’ History

WASHINGTON — Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified documents, tried to obstruct federal investigators and has a “troubling” history of racist and violent remarks, according to a Justice Department filing that offered the clearest picture to date of his motives.
In an 18-page filing released before a hearing Thursday in a Massachusetts federal court, the department’s lawyers argued that Teixeira needed to be detained indefinitely because he posed a “serious flight risk” and might still have information that would be of “tremendous value to hostile nation states.”
He tapped into vast reservoirs of sensitive information, an amount that “far exceeds what has been publicly disclosed” so far, they added.
On Thursday, a judge ruled that Teixeira would remain in custody while he considered evidence that raised serious questions about the military’s decision to grant him a high-level security clearance — and a request by Teixeira’s court-appointed lawyers that he be released immediately to the custody of his parents on $20,000 bond.
The new details presented by prosecutors, including photos and previously undisclosed direct messages, went beyond procedural issues to the unanswered questions at the heart of the case: Why would a young man jeopardize his future to share intelligence with online friends? And why did the military grant him wide access to its secrets?
The government’s filing offered some clues about his state of mind.
Prosecutors disclosed that he was suspended from high school in 2018 after making alarming comments about the use of Molotov cocktails and other weapons, and trawled the internet for information about mass shootings. He engaged in “regular discussions about violence and murder” on the same social media platform, Discord, that he used to post classified information, the filing said, and he surrounded his bed at his parents’ house with firearms and tactical gear.
Teixeira was also prone to making “racial threats,” prosecutors said.
This behavior — so disturbing it was flagged by local police when he applied for a firearms identification card — raised new questions about how Teixeira obtained a top-secret security clearance. And on Wednesday, the Air Force confirmed it had suspended two of the airman’s superiors, pending an investigation into their supervision of him.
Teixeira’s lawyers dismissed the government’s claim that their client represented a threat to the country, or his community.
His reference to bomb making in high school, which rattled some of his classmates, took place during his sophomore year and was never repeated, they said. In the 90-minute hearing at the federal courthouse in Worcester, Massachusetts, his lawyers also played down the idea that he would have an opportunity to turn information over to the United States’ enemies.
The government provided “little more than speculation that a foreign adversary will seduce Teixeira and orchestrate his clandestine escape from the United States,” his lawyers wrote in response to the department’s memo.
His legal team also offered a fleeting first glimpse at possible defense arguments, claiming that the government has not offered proof Teixeira ever intended for the information posted to a private social media server “to be widely disseminated.”
That did not go over well with the magistrate in the case, David Hennessy, who said he found it “a little incredible the defendant did not foresee that possibility.”
In arguing for his confinement, prosecutors described a panicked effort by Teixeira to cover up his actions as law enforcement closed in, including telling a member of a chat group to “delete all messages,” and instructing a user to stonewall investigators.
He also tried to destroy evidence, prosecutors said. Their filing included a series of photos of electronic equipment, including a tablet and an Xbox console, that he hurriedly smashed then tossed in a dumpster near his home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, before his arrest this month.

Full text: A Discord user matching the profile of Jack Teixeira distributed intelligence to a larger chat group, days after the beginning of the Ukraine war.
The Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified documents to a small group of gamers had been posting sensitive information months earlier than previously known and to a much larger chat group, according to online postings reviewed by The New York Times.
In February 2022, soon after the invasion of Ukraine, a user profile matching that of Airman Jack Teixeira began posting secret intelligence on the Russian war effort on a previously undisclosed chat group on Discord, a social media platform popular among gamers. The chat group contained about 600 members.
The case against Airman Teixeira, 21, who was arrested on April 13, pertains to the leaking of classified documents on another Discord group of about 50 members, called Thug Shaker Central. There, he began posting sensitive information in October 2022, members of the group told The Times. His job as an information technology specialist at an Air Force base in Massachusetts gave him top secret clearance.
It is not clear whether authorities are aware of the classified material posted on this additional Discord chat group.
The newly discovered information posted on the larger chat group included details about Russian and Ukrainian casualties, activities of Moscow's spy agencies and updates on aid being provided to Ukraine. The user claimed to be posting information from the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies.
The additional information raises questions about why authorities did not discover the leaks sooner, particularly since hundreds more people would have been able to see the posts.
The exposure of some of America's most closely guarded secrets has prompted criticism about how the Pentagon and intelligence agencies protect classified data, and whether there are weaknesses in both vetting people for security clearances and enforcing the mantra that access to secrets should only be given to people with a "need to know."
The Times learned about the larger chat room from a Discord user. Unlike Thug Shaker Central, the second chat room was publicly listed on a YouTube channel and was easily accessed in seconds.
A chain of digital evidence collected by The Times ties the posts containing the sensitive information to Airman Teixeira. The posts were made under a user name that The Times has previously connected to Airman Teixeira. The person leaking the information said he worked at a U.S. Air Force intelligence unit. Details in videos and photographs he posted matched images posted by family members inside the Teixeira home in North Dighton, Mass. Fellow Discord members sent the user birthday wishes on Dec. 21, the same date Airman Teixeira's sister wished him a happy birthday on Facebook. And he posted a photograph of an antique German rifle for which The Times found an online receipt in Airman Teixeira's name.
The posts reviewed by The Times appear to be detailed written accounts of the classified documents themselves, and identify which intelligence agency they are from. While it appears that the user likely posted pictures of some documents, those have since been deleted from the chat group.
Joshua Hanye, one of Airman Teixeira's attorneys from the Boston public defenders office, declined to comment about the latest revelations. Officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department also declined to comment.
It appears the first leak came less than 48 hours into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "Saw a pentagon report saying that ⅓rd of the force is being used to invade," the user wrote. Apparently eager to impress others in the group who questioned his analysis, he said: "I have a little more than open source info. Perks of being in a USAF intel unit," referring to the United States Air Force.
Some of the intelligence posted appeared to foretell battlefield developments. On March 27, 2022, he shared classified information about the Russian pullback from Kyiv, information he said he "found on an NSA site."
"Some 'big' news," he wrote. "There may be a planned withdrawal of the troops west of Kiev, as in all of them." Two days later, Russian officials announced they were pulling back from the Ukrainian capital.
Some posts began with an update on casualty numbers. He also reported on Ukraine's targeting priorities and the activities of Russian intelligence agencies. He took particular interest in posting updates of which countries were providing lethal aid to Ukraine.
At times, he appeared to be posting from the military base where he was stationed. In one conversation, he said he was about to enter an area where people with security clearance can access classified computer networks, known as a SCIF -- Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.
How Airman Teixeira obtained the documents that he is accused of posting online has been a key question for investigators. They believe he used administrator privileges connected to his information technology job to access documents. In his posts, Airman Teixeira said his job gave him access to material that others could not see. "The job I have lets me get privilege's above most intel guys," he wrote.
Airman Teixeira also claimed that he was actively combing classified computer networks for material on the Ukraine war. When one of the Discord users urged him not to abuse his access to classified intelligence, Teixeira replied: "too late."
At one point he offered to share information privately with members of the group living outside the United States. "DM me and I can tell you what I have," he wrote.
On another occasion, he wrote that he was able to access a site run by the National Security Agency, the U.S. spy agency that focuses on communications intercepted from computer networks, to look for updates on the war.
He also claimed to have access to intelligence from U.S. partners. "I usually work with GCHQ people when I'm looking at foreign countries," he told the chat group in September 2022, referring to Government Communications Headquarters, the British agency for intelligence, security and cyberaffairs.
A spokesman for the National Security Agency declined to comment, referring questions to the Justice Department. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy declined to comment as well.
Airman Teixeira continued to share more detailed information to the larger chat group until a month ago.
"I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see," he wrote on March 19, before adding, "I've decided to stop with the updates."

Full text: Documenting the damage of last month's earthquakes in Turkey.
Times graphics reporters Anjali Singhvi and Bedel Saget recently traveled to Antakya, a Turkish city badly damaged by February's earthquakes. Based on their reporting, they published an article this week that walks through the damage in Antakya's Old City, a commercial and religious hub.
The initial quakes were several weeks ago, but the damage continues to dominate life in much of Turkey and Syria. I spoke with Anjali and Bedel about what they saw in Antakya.
Ashley: What surprised you about Antakya's destruction?
Bedel: I had in my mind what the destruction would look like, but when you're driving around and seeing residential building after residential building flattened, it stops you in your tracks. We saw a building split in half -- half had collapsed and half was still standing -- and we could see an entire dining room set still present on the third floor, as though it were a dollhouse.
Anjali: We also saw so many photographs of missing people placed right outside the damaged buildings. I had assumed they were part of residents' belongings in that building, but a local journalist told me that families left photos of their loved ones around the site of the rubble so that if someone clears debris or continues the search, those photos might help identify bodies.
Times graphics reporters often use satellite imagery to reconstruct disaster sites. Why was actually being in Antakya important for this project?
Anjali: Before the trip, I had identified some areas from drone imagery of Antakya that seemed most damaged, and speculated that those areas could be good to cover. But when I was reporting on the ground, all the locals talked about an area I hadn't considered: Old City, a historic part of Antakya.
Old City was home to so many different kinds of buildings -- churches, mosques, a synagogue, restored boutique hotels, jewelry shops, silk stores, a local favorite hummus shop, just real gems. Amid the rubble, we saw government officials putting up signs on various buildings in Old City, labeling them as important cultural assets and warning people not to tamper anymore with the debris. From being there, I saw how Antakya had history in its soil, its buildings and its people. And it was Old City that really brought the community together.
Did you get the sense that residents wanted to stay as Antakya rebuilds?
Bedel: Quite a number of people left if they had the means to: Either they had family in other parts of Turkey or if they had homes elsewhere. But among those who stayed, everyone we spoke to talked about the commitment to rebuild, no matter what.
The things that made Old City a gathering spot -- the atmosphere, the aura, the embrace of different cultures -- I could feel that's what they longed for most. I spoke to a young woman, who recently graduated from medical school, who said, "It was good before, but we didn't understand before we lost our city, how important it was to us."
See what was lost in Antakya's Old City, through one street at the heart of the community.
Anjali is a reporter and a former architect whose work at The Times includes reconstructing building disasters, such as a Bronx apartment fire and Miami's Surfside condo collapse. Bedel joined The Times in 1991, and has covered hurricanes, wildfires and nine Olympic Games.

Leaked Intel Altered Little In Strategies: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some in Ukraine even welcomed the disclosures as confirming what they have been saying for months -- that its forces desperately need more weapons and munitions.
In the leaked American intelligence documents, Ukraine's predicament looks dire.
Missiles for its Soviet-era air defenses are projected to run out by May. Its position in the key city of Bakhmut is "catastrophic." Its military has taken losses of more than 120,000 dead and wounded -- less than Russia's estimated toll, but enormous for a country with less than one third of Russia's population.
Yet in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, this past week, there was little palpable alarm about the scores of pages of classified documents that have surfaced in one of the most remarkable disclosures of American secrets in the last decade. In fact, some welcomed the leak, hoping that it would emphasize what President Volodymyr Zelensky has been saying for months -- that Ukraine urgently needs more ammunition and weapons to expel the Russian forces.
"From many points of view, this leak is really useful, and good, even I can say good for Ukraine," said Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity party.
He said that unless Ukraine's Western backers rushed to provide more than what he called "incremental" support, then "everything can go to waste, because so much is at stake today."
The Pentagon intelligence updates and briefing slides that have dribbled into public view this month -- after being posted on a gaming chat server by a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman, the authorities say -- have offered new details about the state of the war. But they have not fundamentally altered the overall picture of it, according to Western analysts and policymakers.
They say the new material largely adheres to what they already knew about the war -- and won't upend how they are handling it.
"This doesn't change our stance," said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesman in Germany's Parliament for the Social Democrats, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the country's three-way coalition. "We understand that now is the time to provide armaments to Ukraine."
But as Ukraine prepares for a long-anticipated counteroffensive that could usher in a new phase of the nearly 14-month war, the documents are focusing heightened attention on Ukraine's challenges, the shortcomings in Western military aid and the uncertainty of what comes next.
Whether Ukraine's Western allies are going to be able to deliver what Kyiv needs in this crucial moment is a major open question. European officials say they are working to speed more artillery shells to Ukraine, but are acknowledging that they may not be able to reach the goal of delivering one million rounds this year.
"We can't produce much more, at least not quickly," said Ulrich Speck, a German foreign policy analyst. "Going forward, what can Europe still give? Now it's harder, a realization we don't have the ability to get things fast enough."
Some analysts noted that the intelligence does not determine how the war will actually unfold. Ukraine's allies vastly underestimated its capabilities in the past, predicting that Russian forces would overrun Kyiv in the opening days of the war. On top of that, the documents gauge conditions more than six weeks ago. Battlefield realities change fast.
But the leaked documents clearly show how heavily the war effort relies on the United States. American intelligence agencies have gotten inside Russia's military enough to give real-time warnings to Ukraine on the timing of Moscow's airstrikes, and even its specific targets. Several leaked slides show satellite imagery of the aftermath of Ukrainian airstrikes on what are described as "US-produced" targets in Russian-held territory -- new evidence that the United States is providing precise targeting data.
One of the West's biggest concerns about the leaks has been that Russia would scramble to find and seal off the sources of American intelligence. But in the week since the classified documents were posted widely on Telegram and Twitter, that fear has yet to materialize, two senior U.S. officials said: There is no indication that the Kremlin has taken steps to block the United States from penetrating Russia's security and intelligence services.
Nor is there any sign yet that Russian commanders have changed their operations on the ground in Ukraine in response to the disclosures, the two U.S. officials said.
Beyond that, Ukrainian officials, while voicing their displeasure with the leaks, have told American officials that the disclosures will not seriously impact their planned offensive because Russia already knew the broad parameters of Ukrainian vulnerabilities (like its shortages of weapons and ammunition). And the documents did not disclose precisely when, where and how the Ukrainians would carry out their counteroffensive, one senior U.S. official said.
"It's hard for me to believe this will dramatically change Ukraine's short-term plans for its counteroffensive," said Samuel Charap, a Russia analyst at the RAND Corporation. "There's been discussion in open sources about the likely direction being south. Whether it affects the timing, perhaps."
While the documents show that American spy agencies have intercepted Russian military communications, sometimes down to the details of planned Russian attacks, they offer little indication that the United States has been able to eavesdrop on the conversations of Russia's leadership.
In the documents seen by The New York Times -- which include many but not all of the hundreds of pages posted online -- information about President Vladimir V. Putin and his inner circle appears mainly as hearsay. An entry describing a sensational plot by senior Russian officials to sabotage the invasion is attributed to a Ukrainian lawmaker "who received information from an unidentified Russian source with access to Kremlin officials."
The lack of direct information about Mr. Putin could reflect the American intelligence community's challenges in collecting information on a leader who has enveloped himself in an extraordinary cocoon of secrecy. Still, the documents offer only a small window into the breadth of American intelligence collection, leaning on information gleaned from electronic intercepts rather than on the C.I.A.'s network of human sources, which the agency guards much more carefully.
In Russia, many supporters of the war have warned that the leaks could be part of a ruse. The new details on the headwinds facing Ukraine's military effort -- including projections that key stocks of air defense missiles would be fully depleted by early May -- are so extensive that some pro-Kremlin commentators have dismissed them as possible Western disinformation meant to get Russia to let its guard down.
"We would be happy if this were true," a talk-show host on Russian state television, Olga Skabeyeva, quipped in a segment about the leaks last Tuesday.
But the documents also detail the Russian military's myriad challenges and its devastating losses, offering a behind-the-scenes view into why Western officials believe that the war is likely to drag into next year. Russia's slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region "is likely heading toward a stalemate," a Feb. 22 briefing slide predicts, with high Russian combat losses and diminishing munitions stockpiles "resulting in a protracted war beyond 2023."
For some, that offers a reminder that the war is far more likely to end in some kind of negotiated settlement than with a decisive military victory for either side.
"We know that Ukraine needs to tilt the military balance in its favor to pave the way for negotiations," Mr. Schmid, the German lawmaker, said.
For the cadre of analysts around the world parsing social-media videos and commercial satellite imagery to glean information about the war, the intelligence leaks have provided new data points. But several said they saw nothing that caused them to revise their fundamental views of the war, which also point to a protracted conflict.
One independent Russian military analyst, Ruslan Leviev, said the documents matched his prior conclusions, including his view that Ukraine's challenges in mobilizing soldiers and obtaining ammunition meant the upcoming counteroffensive would not be able to deliver a decisive victory. Rob Lee, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said he had not seen anything that "changed my mind tremendously."
But he warned that the outcome of Ukraine's counteroffensive -- and the war -- rested on factors that even American intelligence agencies were hard pressed to measure, such as the morale of troops on both sides and how well they would perform.
"There's a lot about this war that we still don't know, or that we can't have certainty about," Mr. Lee said. "It's war, and you can never have perfect information."

American's So-So Outlook Sends Stocks Tumbling
Airline stocks tumbled Wednesday after American Airlines issued a lackluster outlook that amplified fears that travel demand, which has surged for the last year, could be slowing amid inflation and economic uncertainty. American said that it expected to report a small profit for the first quarter, but one that could easily be below Wall Street expectations. American indicated that demand is still about as strong as it predicted in January, but the staythe-course update came as analysts cautioned investors about a slowdown in travel bookings. Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora said this week that his bank's data showed that airline bookings have slowed since mid-March, "and we have become a bit more cautious on 2Q23 revenues." He lowered second-quarter revenue estimates for the big airlines by up to 2 percent. American said that it expected to earn between a penny and 5 cents per share for the most recent quarter.

Mercedes Sales Rise On Strength of E.V.s
Mercedes-Benz sales rose moderately in the first quarter, boosted by electric vehicles and premium cars, the German carmaker said on Wednesday. Worldwide sales increased 3 percent to 503,500 vehicles, with Europe, at 8 percent, posting the strongest growth. E.V.s were the main growth driver in the quarter, with sales almost doubling to 51,600 units. The top-end segment also demonstrated solid growth of 18 percent, reaching 91,800 for the period. Britta Seeger, a Mercedes board member, said both segments posted strong results "despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, economic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainties." Sales in the Mercedes-Benz Vans division grew 12 percent in the quarter, reaching 98,900, its best first-quarter result ever. Earlier on Wednesday, Swedish peer Volvo reported record firstquarter profits in a sign the company had begun to overcome bottlenecks and inflation that hampered the industry. REUTERS

Intel to Work With Arm On Chip Compatibility
Intel's chip contract manufacturing division will work with the British-based chip designer Arm to ensure that mobile phone chips and other products that use Arm's technology can be made in Intel's factories, Intel said on Wednesday. Once the biggest name in chips known as central processing units, Intel has seen its technological manufacturing edge blunted by rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world leader whose customers include Apple. Intel's turnaround strategy hinges in part on opening its factories to other chip companies, particularly those in mobile phones. It has said companies like Qualcomm were planning to use its factories for chip designs. Arm, owned by the Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group, plans to go public later this year. It is a major supplier of intellectual property to many chip companies. REUTERS

Full text: Can We No Longer Believe Anything We See?
Seeing has not been believing for a very long time. Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.
Now, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic -- just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?
The rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.
The advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.
On Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney's office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.
Experts fear the technology could hasten an erosion of trust in media, in government and in society. If any image can be manufactured -- and manipulated -- how can we believe anything we see?
"The tools are going to get better, they're going to get cheaper, and there will come a day when nothing you see on the internet can be believed," said Wasim Khaled, chief executive of Blackbird.AI, a company that helps clients fight disinformation.
Artificial intelligence allows virtually anyone to create complex artworks, like those now on exhibit at the Gagosian art gallery in New York, or lifelike images that blur the line between what is real and what is fiction. Plug in a text description, and the technology can produce a related image -- no special skills required.
Often, there are hints that viral images were created by a computer rather than captured in real life: The luxuriously coated pope had glasses that seemed to melt into his cheek and blurry fingers, for example. A.I. art tools also often produce nonsensical text. Here are some examples:
Rapid advancements in the technology, however, are eliminating many of those flaws. Midjourney's latest version, released last month, is able to depict realistic hands, a feat that had, conspicuously, eluded early imaging tools.
Days before Mr. Trump turned himself in to face criminal charges in New York City, images made of his "arrest" coursed around social media.They were created by Eliot Higgins, a British journalist and founder of Bellingcat, an open source investigative organization. He used Midjourney to imagine the former president's arrest, trial, imprisonment in an orange jumpsuit and escape through a sewer. He posted the images on Twitter, clearly marking them as creations. They have since been widely shared.
The images weren't meant to fool anyone. Instead, Mr. Higgins wanted to draw attention to the tool's power -- even in its infancy.
Midjourney's images, he said, were able to pass muster in facial-recognition programs that Bellingcat uses to verify identities, typically of Russians who have committed crimes or other abuses. It's not hard to imagine governments or other nefarious actors manufacturing images to harass or discredit their enemies.
At the same time, Mr. Higgins said, the tool also struggled to create convincing images with people who are not as widely photographed as Mr. Trump, such as the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, or the comedian Harry Hill, "who probably isn't known outside of the U.K. that much."
Midjourney was not amused in any case. It suspended Mr. Higgins's account without explanation after the images spread. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
The limits of generative images make them relatively easy to detect by news organizations or others attuned to the risk -- at least for now.
Still, stock photo companies, government regulators and a music industry trade group have moved to protect their content from unauthorized use, but technology's powerful ability to mimic and adapt is complicating those efforts.
Some A.I. image generators have even reproduced images -- a queasy "Twin Peaks" homage; Will Smith eating fistfuls of pasta -- with distorted versions of the watermarks used by companies like Getty Images or Shutterstock.
In February, Getty accused Stability AI of illegally copying more than 12 million Getty photos, along with captions and metadata, to train the software behind its Stable Diffusion tool. In its lawsuit, Getty argued that Stable Diffusion diluted the value of the Getty watermark by incorporating it into images that ranged "from the bizarre to the grotesque."
Getty said the "brazen theft and freeriding" was conducted "on a staggering scale." Stability AI did not respond to a request for comment.
Getty's lawsuit reflects concerns raised by many individual artists -- that A.I. companies are becoming a competitive threat by copying content they do not have permission to use.
Trademark violations have also become a concern: Artificially generated images have replicated NBC's peacock logo, though with unintelligible letters, and shown Coca-Cola's familiar curvy logo with extra O's looped into the name.
In February, the U.S. Copyright Office weighed in on artificially generated images when it evaluated the case of "Zarya of the Dawn," an 18-page comic book written by Kristina Kashtanova with art generated by Midjourney. The government administrator decided to offer copyright protection to the comic book's text, but not to its art.
"Because of the significant distance between what a user may direct Midjourney to create and the visual material Midjourney actually produces, Midjourney users lack sufficient control over generated images to be treated as the 'master mind' behind them," the office explained in its decision.
The threat to photographers is fast outpacing the development of legal protections, said Mickey H. Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association. Newsrooms will increasingly struggle to authenticate content. Social media users are ignoring labels that clearly identify images as artificially generated, choosing to believe they are real photographs, he said.
Generative A.I. could also make fake videos easier to produce. This week, a video appeared online that seemed to show Nina Schick, an author and a generative A.I. expert, explaining how the technology was creating "a world where shadows are mistaken for the real thing." Ms. Schick's face then glitched as the camera pulled back, showing a body double in her place.
The video explained that the deepfake had been created, with Ms. Schick's consent, by the Dutch company Revel.ai and Truepic, a California company that is exploring broader digital content verification.
The companies described their video, which features a stamp identifying it as computer-generated, as the "first digitally transparent deepfake." The data is cryptographically sealed into the file; tampering with the image breaks the digital signature and prevents the credentials from appearing when using trusted software.
The companies hope the badge, which will come with a fee for commercial clients, will be adopted by other content creators to help create a standard of trust involving A.I. images.
"The scale of this problem is going to accelerate so rapidly that it's going to drive consumer education very quickly," said Jeff McGregor, chief executive of Truepic.
Truepic is part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, a project set up through an alliance with companies such as Adobe, Intel and Microsoft to better trace the origins of digital media. The chip-maker Nvidia said last month that it was working with Getty to help train "responsible" A.I. models using Getty's licensed content, with royalties paid to artists.
On the same day, Adobe unveiled its own image-generating product, Firefly, which will be trained using only images that were licensed or from its own stock or no longer under copyright. Dana Rao, the company's chief trust officer, said on its website that the tool would automatically add content credentials -- "like a nutrition label for imaging" -- that identified how an image had been made. Adobe said it also planned to compensate contributors.
Last month, the model Chrissy Teigen wrote on Twitter that she had been hoodwinked by the pope's puffy jacket, adding that "no way am I surviving the future of technology."
Last week, a series of new A.I. images showed the pope, back in his usual robe, enjoying a tall glass of beer. The hands appeared mostly normal -- save for the wedding band on the pontiff's ring finger.

Chips Won't Come Cheap for Germany: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The global competition to attract semiconductor companies is expected to cost Berlin billions. Some wonder if it's a good use of money.
Intel, the Silicon Valley chip-making giant, paved the way last year when it picked the eastern German city of Magdeburg as the site for its first semiconductor factory in Europe, pledging to invest 17 billion euros (about $ 18.3 billion) -- provided that Berlin throw in nearly €7 billion in subsidies.
Wolfspeed, a North Carolina-based maker of silicon carbide chips used in electric cars, decided last month that southwestern Germany would be the perfect place for it to invest €2.5 billion to build its first European factory. Again, the agreement was contingent on hundreds of millions more from the government.
Infineon, Germany's largest chip maker, is looking to add two plants at its manufacturing site in Dresden, spending €5 billion, but it wants the government to cover about a fifth of that.
Each of the projects promises to help ease the shortages of microchips that German industries have faced since the pandemic and create thousands of jobs, fueling an ecosystem that could bolster the economy for decades. For the chip makers, Germany offers a location in the heart of Europe near many of their customers, including the country's €410 billion auto industry.
But each project is also conditional on millions, if not billions, in government subsidies. Germany and the European Union find themselves in competition with the United States and other countries seeking the security of a robust domestic chip industry. Dangling bountiful subsidies and other benefits is the price for landing these companies.
Handing out subsidies is complicated in the European Union, because Brussels strictly controls such aid to avoid distortions within its single market. The assistance for these chip makers will be financed by the national and regional governments, as well as E.U. funds to stimulate investment.
The pots of public money being lavished on these companies reflect the critical need for their tiny slivers of silicon, which are essential for an endless list of modern devices, including cars, refrigerators and military equipment.
"The shift toward electric vehicles is highly dependent on semiconductors. The shift toward renewable energy is also highly dependent on semiconductors," said Thomas Kirschstein, an expert on electronics and microchips with Roland Berger, a consulting firm. "All of the megatrends that you have in the world rely on semiconductors to produce the end product."
Right now, German companies rely on factories in Taiwan and North America for most of their microchips, a potential national security threat.
The Economy Ministry has not commented on how much it is willing to spend on individual production sites, but has already pledged billions that require approval by the European Union as part of the proposed E.U. Chips Act. National governments are still negotiating that €42 billion program, one of several existing or proposed large-scale investment funds set up to attract more technology manufacturing to the European Union's 27 countries.
But critics warn that even the enormous European pledges pale next to efforts in the United States, which has its own CHIPS Act and is offering at least $ 76 billion in grants, tax credits and other subsidies to encourage domestic chip production. Some in Germany have questioned the wisdom of lavish public spending on companies with healthy earnings, in an age of stubbornly high inflation and high interest rates.
"Why don't we let the Americans subsidize the chip production and we could just buy cheap chips from them?" asked Reint Gropp, an economist who is president of the Halle Institute for Economic Research.
Others suggest that the U.S. approach, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which encourages billions of dollars in clean-energy investment, could be a model for Europe.
"With the I.R.A., the Americans are showing the E.U. how it can be done," said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the German industrial lobby association, B.D.I.
The push to expand semiconductor production is also about Germany's race to meet the European Union's goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. That means replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy generated by chip-hungry devices, such as wind turbines.
Symbolically, the Wolfspeed facilities will be built on the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant in Saarland, a center of coal mining for hundreds of years.
"Some people speak nostalgically of the good old days," Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in announcing the project last month. "But, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the good old days are over does not mean that a good new era cannot dawn."
Part of that new era, its supporters say, will mean capitalizing on the skills of the many experienced and highly trained engineers and workers in the region. The European Union is the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China, but accounts for only about 10 percent of the global chips market. The E.U. Chips Act has a goal of bringing at least 20 percent of the world's microchip production into the bloc by the end of the decade.
Others argue that even if microchips are produced locally, they require imported raw materials. China dominates the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential to chip manufacturing.
"You know, if we really wanted to be independent of Taiwanese production, then we need to have the whole supply chain here -- not just the production but the rare earths that go into them," Mr. Gropp said.
Germany is also facing not having enough young people entering skilled jobs, especially in mechanical and automotive engineering, electrical engineering, and software development and programming -- exactly the employees needed in the microchip industry.
Plans are in the works to revamp German immigration laws to attract more talent, but that might not be soon enough.
"Firms that already exist have real trouble finding skilled labor," Mr. Gropp said. "Do we want to make that even worse and put those firms that didn't benefit from the subsidies out of business?"
The city of Magdeburg saw the situation differently. Home to a number of technology research centers and a university with a long tradition of engineering, it lost most of its heavy industry -- and those jobs -- after German reunification in 1990. The new Intel site is expected to hire about 3,000 permanent employees.
Attracting a company that draws on the skill sets in the region could help ensure the area's future, said Sandra Yvonne Stieger, deputy mayor of Magdeburg, who helped negotiate the Intel deal.
"R.&D. is the keyword, and we Europeans are really good at that," Ms. Stieger said in an interview. "We should stay focused on that advantage and not squander it."
But it appears that the billions in government subsidies promised for Intel may not be enough. Even as trucks began preparing its site for construction, Intel was seeking several more billions in government support, German media reported.
A spokeswoman for Intel, Lisa Malloy, confirmed that the company was speaking with officials in Berlin, as it contended with a jump in the cost of energy and construction materials since it signed the agreement last year. But she insisted that the project was moving ahead.
"We appreciate the constructive dialogue with the federal government to address the cost gap that exists with building in other locations and make this project globally competitive," Ms. Malloy said.
While economists question how much is too much to invest for chip production, Ms. Stieger said that in Magdeburg, the calculation was clear: "If we want to attract the kind of high-quality production that depends on such research, I believe that we have to use financial support to do so."

BERLIN — Intel, the Silicon Valley chipmaking giant, paved the way last year when it picked the eastern German city of Magdeburg as the site for its first semiconductor factory in Europe, pledging to invest 17 billion euros (about $18.3 billion) — provided that Berlin throw in nearly 7 billion euros in subsidies.
Wolfspeed, a North Carolina-based maker of silicon carbide chips used in electric cars, decided in February that southwestern Germany would be the perfect place for it to invest 2.5 billion euros to build its first European factory. Again, the agreement was contingent on hundreds of millions more from the government.
Infineon, Germany’s largest chipmaker, is looking to add two plants at its manufacturing site in Dresden, spending 5 billion euros, but it wants the government to cover about one-fifth of that.
Each of the projects promises to help ease the shortages of microchips that German industries have faced since the pandemic and create thousands of jobs, fueling an ecosystem that could bolster the economy for decades. For the chipmakers, Germany offers a location in the heart of Europe near many of their customers, including the country’s 410 billion-euro auto industry.
But each project is also conditional on millions, if not billions, in government subsidies. Germany and the European Union find themselves in competition with the United States and other countries seeking the security of a robust domestic chip industry. Dangling bountiful subsidies and other benefits is the price for landing these companies.
Handing out subsidies is complicated in the European Union, because Brussels strictly controls such aid to avoid distortions within its single market. The assistance for these chipmakers will be financed by the national and regional governments, as well as EU funds to stimulate investment.
The pots of public money being lavished on these companies reflect the critical need for their tiny slivers of silicon, which are essential for an endless list of modern devices, including cars, refrigerators and military equipment.
“The shift toward electric vehicles is highly dependent on semiconductors. The shift toward renewable energy is also highly dependent on semiconductors,” said Thomas Kirschstein, an expert on electronics and microchips with Roland Berger, a consulting firm. “All of the megatrends that you have in the world rely on semiconductors to produce the end product.”
Right now, German companies rely on factories in Taiwan and North America for most of their microchips, a potential national security threat.
The Economy Ministry has not commented on how much it is willing to spend on individual production sites, but it has already pledged billions that require approval by the European Union as part of the proposed EU Chips Act. National governments are still negotiating that 42 billion-euro program, one of several existing or proposed large-scale investment funds set up to attract more technology manufacturing to the European Union’s 27 countries.
But critics warn that even the enormous European pledges pale next to efforts in the United States, which has its own CHIPS Act and is offering at least $76 billion in grants, tax credits and other subsidies to encourage domestic chip production. Some in Germany have questioned the wisdom of lavish public spending on companies with healthy earnings, in an age of stubbornly high inflation and high interest rates.
“Why don’t we let the Americans subsidize the chip production and we could just buy cheap chips from them?” asked Reint Gropp, an economist who is president of the Halle Institute for Economic Research.
Others suggest that the U.S. approach, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which encourages billions of dollars in clean-energy investment, could be a model for Europe.
“With the IRA, the Americans are showing the EU how it can be done,” said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the German industrial lobby association, BDI.
The push to expand semiconductor production is also about Germany’s race to meet the European Union’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. That means replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy generated by chip-hungry devices, such as wind turbines.
Symbolically, the Wolfspeed facilities will be built on the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant in Saarland, a center of coal mining for hundreds of years.
“Some people speak nostalgically of the good old days,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in announcing the project in February. “But, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the good old days are over does not mean that a good new era cannot dawn.”
Part of that new era, its supporters say, will mean capitalizing on the skills of the many experienced and highly trained engineers and workers in the region. The European Union is the world’s third-largest economy, after the United States and China, but accounts for only about 10% of the global chips market. The EU Chips Act has a goal of bringing at least 20% of the world’s microchip production into the bloc by the end of the decade.
Others argue that even if microchips are produced locally, they require imported raw materials. China dominates the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential to chip manufacturing.
“You know, if we really wanted to be independent of Taiwanese production, then we need to have the whole supply chain here — not just the production but the rare earths that go into them,” Gropp said.
Germany is also facing not having enough young people entering skilled jobs, especially in mechanical and automotive engineering, electrical engineering, and software development and programming — exactly the employees needed in the microchip industry.
Plans are in the works to revamp German immigration laws to attract more talent, but that might not be soon enough.
“Firms that already exist have real trouble finding skilled labor,” Gropp said. “Do we want to make that even worse and put those firms that didn’t benefit from the subsidies out of business?”
The city of Magdeburg saw the situation differently. Home to a number of technology research centers and a university with a long tradition of engineering, it lost most of its heavy industry — and those jobs — after German reunification in 1990. The new Intel site is expected to hire about 3,000 permanent employees.
Attracting a company that draws on the skill sets in the region could help ensure the area’s future, said Sandra Yvonne Stieger, deputy mayor of Magdeburg, who helped negotiate the Intel deal.
“R&D is the keyword, and we Europeans are really good at that,” Stieger said in an interview. “We should stay focused on that advantage and not squander it.”
But it appears that the billions in government subsidies promised for Intel may not be enough. Even as trucks began preparing its site for construction, Intel was seeking several more billions in government support, German media reported.
A spokesperson for Intel, Lisa Malloy, confirmed that the company was speaking with officials in Berlin, as it contended with a jump in the cost of energy and construction materials since it signed the agreement last year. But she insisted that the project was moving ahead.
“We appreciate the constructive dialogue with the federal government to address the cost gap that exists with building in other locations and make this project globally competitive,” Malloy said.
Although economists question how much is too much to invest for chip production, Stieger said that in Magdeburg, the calculation was clear: “If we want to attract the kind of high-quality production that depends on such research, I believe that we have to use financial support to do so.”

A.I. Can't Remake the Economy Overnight: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is already having a significant impact on the economy, and its influence is expected to grow significantly in the coming years .... Overall, the effects of A.I. on the economy will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of technological advancement, government policies and the ability of workers to adapt to new technologies."
OK, who said that? Nobody, unless we're ready to start calling large language models people. What I did was ask ChatGPT to describe the economic effects of artificial intelligence; it went on at length, so that was an excerpt.
I think many of us who've played around with large language models -- which are being widely discussed under the rubric of artificial intelligence (although there's an almost metaphysical debate over whether we should call it intelligence) -- have been shocked by how much they now manage to sound like people. And it's a good bet that they or their descendants will eventually take over a significant number of tasks that are currently done by human beings.
Like previous leaps in technology, this will make the economy more productive but will also probably hurt some workers whose skills have been devalued. Although the term "Luddite" is often used to describe someone who is simply prejudiced against new technology, the original Luddites were skilled artisans who suffered real economic harm from the introduction of power looms and knitting frames.
But this time around, how large will these effects be? And how quickly will they come about? On the first question, the answer is that nobody really knows. Predictions about the economic impact of technology are notoriously unreliable. On the second, history suggests that large economic effects from A.I. will take longer to materialize than many people currently seem to expect.
Consider the effects of previous advances in computing. Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel -- which introduced the microprocessor in 1971 -- died last week. He was famous for his prediction that the number of transistors on a computer chip would double every two years -- a prediction that proved stunningly accurate for half a century. The consequences of Moore's Law are all around us, most obviously in the powerful computers, a.k.a. smartphones, that almost everyone carries around these days.
For a long time, however, the economic payoff from this awesome rise in computing power was surprisingly elusive. Here's a chart of the long-run rise in labor productivity -- output per hour in the nonfarm sector -- measured as the annual rate of growth over the previous 10 years (to smooth out some of the noise):
I'll explain some of what's in the chart in a minute. But the first thing to notice is that for at least two decades after Moore's Law kicked in, America, far from experiencing a productivity boom, suffered from a protracted productivity slowdown. The boom kicked in only during the 1990s, and even then it was a bit disappointing, as I'll also explain in a minute.
Why did a huge, prolonged surge in computing power take so long to pay off for the economy? In 1990 the economic historian Paul David published one of my favorite economics papers of all time, "The Dynamo and the Computer." It drew a parallel between the effects of information technology and those of an earlier tech revolution, the electrification of industry.
As David noted, electric motors became widely available in the 1890s. But having a technology isn't enough. You also have to figure out what to do with it.
To take full advantage of electrification, manufacturers had to rethink the design of factories. Pre-electric factories were multistory buildings with cramped working spaces, because that was necessary to make efficient use of a steam engine in the basement driving the machines through a system of shafts, gears and pulleys.
It took time to realize that having each machine driven by its own motor made it possible to have sprawling one-story factories with wide aisles allowing easy movement of materials, not to mention assembly lines. As a result, the big productivity gains from electrification didn't materialize until after World War I.
Sure enough, as David, in effect, predicted, the economic payoff from information technology finally kicked in during the 1990s, as filing cabinets and secretaries taking dictation finally gave way to cubicle farms. (What? You think technological progress is always glamorous?) The lag in this economic payoff even ended up being similar in length to the lagged payoff from electrification.
But this history still presents a few puzzles. One is why the first productivity boom from information technology (there may be another one coming, if the enthusiasm about chatbots is justified) was so short-lived; basically it lasted only around a decade.
And even while it lasted, productivity growth during the I.T. boom was no higher than it was during the generation-long boom after World War II, which was notable in the fact that it didn't seem to be driven by any radically new technology. (That's why it's marked with a question mark in the chart above.)
In 1969 the celebrated management consultant Peter Drucker published "The Age of Discontinuity," a book that correctly predicted major changes in the economy's structure, yet the book's title implies -- correctly, I think -- that the preceding period of extraordinary economic growth was actually an age of continuity, an era during which the basic outlines of the economy didn't change much, even as America became vastly richer.
Or to put it another way, the great boom from the 1940s to around 1970 seems to have been largely based on the use of technologies, like the internal combustion engine, that had been around for decades -- which should make us even more skeptical about trying to use recent technological developments to predict economic growth.
That's not to say that artificial intelligence won't have huge economic impacts. But history suggests that they won't come quickly. ChatGPT and whatever follows are probably an economic story for the 2030s, not for the next few years.
Which doesn't mean that we should ignore the implications of a possible A.I.-driven boom. Large language models in their current form shouldn't affect economic projections for next year and probably shouldn't have a large effect on economic projections for the next decade. But the longer-run prospects for economic growth do look better now than they did before computers began doing such good imitations of people.
And long-run economic projections matter, even if they're always wrong, because they underlie the long-term budget outlook, which in turn helps drive current policy in a number of areas. Not to put too fine a point on it, but anyone who predicts a radical acceleration of economic growth thanks to A.I. -- which would lead to a large rise in tax receipts -- and simultaneously predicts a future fiscal crisis unless we make drastic cuts to Medicare and Social Security isn't making much sense.

Gordon E. Moore, 94, Intel Co-Creator and Silicon Chip Soothsayer, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His prediction in the 1960s about rapid advances in computer chip technology charted a course for the age of high tech.
Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder and former chairman of Intel Corporation, the California semiconductor chip maker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, achieving the kind of industrial dominance once held by the giant American railroad or steel companies of another age, died on Friday at his home in Hawaii. He was 94.
His death was announced by Intel and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. No cause was specified.
Along with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Moore could claim credit for bringing laptop computers to hundreds of millions of people and embedding microprocessors into everything from bathroom scales, toasters and toy fire engines to cellphones, cars and jets.
Mr. Moore had wanted to be a teacher but could not get a job in education. He later called himself an "accidental entrepreneur, because he became a billionaire as a result of an initial $ 500 investment in the fledgling microchip business, which turned electronics into one of the world's largest industries.
And it was he, his colleagues said, who saw the future. In 1965, in what became known as Moore's Law, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, thus increasing the data-processing power of computers exponentially.
He added two corollaries later: The evolving technology would make computers more and more expensive to build, yet consumers would be charged less and less for them because so many would be sold. Moore's Law held up for decades.
Through a combination of Mr. Moore's brilliance, leadership, charisma and contacts, as well as that of his partner and Intel co-founder, Robert Noyce, the two assembled a group widely regarded as among the boldest and most creative technicians of the high-tech age.
This was the group that advocated the use of the thumbnail-thin chips of silicon, a highly polished, chemically treated sandy substance -- one of the most common natural resources on earth -- because of what turned out to be silicon's amazing hospitality in housing smaller and smaller electronic circuitry that could work at higher and higher speeds.
With its silicon microprocessors, the brains of a computer, Intel enabled American manufacturers in the mid-1980s to regain the lead in the vast computer data-processing field from their formidable Japanese competitors. By the '90s, Intel had placed its microprocessors in 80 percent of the computers that were being made worldwide, becoming the most successful semiconductor company in history.
Much of this happened under Mr. Moore's watch. He was chief executive from 1975 to 1987, when Andrew Grove succeeded him, and remained chairman until 1997.
As his wealth grew, Mr. Moore also became a major figure in philanthropy. In 2001, he and his wife created the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation with a donation of 175 million Intel shares. In 2001, they donated $ 600 million to the California Institute of Technology, the largest single gift to an institution of higher learning at the time. The foundation's assets currently exceed $ 8 billion, and it has given away more than $ 5 billion since its founding.
In interviews, Mr. Moore was characteristically humble about his achievements, particularly the technical advances that Moore's Law made possible.
"What I could see was that semiconductor devices were the way electronics were going to become cheap. That was the message I was trying to get across," he told the journalist Michael Malone in 2000. "It turned out to be an amazingly precise prediction -- a lot more precise than I ever imagined it would be."
Not only was Mr. Moore predicting that electronics would become much cheaper over time, as the industry shifted away from discrete transistors and tubes to silicon microchips; over the years his prediction proved so reliable that technology firms based their product strategy on the assumption that Moore's Law would hold.
"Any business doing rational multiyear planning had to assume this rate of change or else get steamrolled," said Harry Saal, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and friend of Mr. Moore's, said: "That's his legacy. It's not Intel. It's not the Moore Foundation. It's that phrase: Moore's Law."
Gordon Earl Moore was born on Jan. 3, 1929, in San Francisco. He grew up in Pescadero, a small coastal town south of San Francisco, where his father, Walter, was deputy sheriff and the family of his mother, Florence Almira (Williamson) Moore, ran the general store.
Mr. Moore enrolled at San Jose State College (now San José State University), where he met Betty Whitaker, a journalism student. They married in 1950. That same year, he completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in chemistry. In 1954, he received his doctorate, also in chemistry, from Caltech.
One of the first jobs he applied for was as a manager with Dow Chemical. "They sent me to a psychologist to see how this would fit," Mr. Moore wrote in Engineering & Science magazine in 1994. "The psychologist said I was OK technically but I'd never manage anything."
So Mr. Moore took a position with the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Then, looking for a way back to California, he interviewed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. He was offered a job, he wrote, "but I decided I didn't want to take spectra of exploding nuclear bombs, so I turned it down."
Instead, in 1956, Mr. Moore joined William Shockley, a co-inventor of the transistor, to work at a West Coast division of Bell Laboratories, a start-up unit whose aim was to make a cheap silicon transistor.
But the company, Shockley Semiconductor, foundered under Dr. Shockley, who had no experience running a company. In 1957, Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce joined a group of defectors who came to be known as "the traitorous eight." With each putting in $ 500, along with $ 1.3 million in backing from the aircraft pioneer Sherman Fairchild, the eight men left to form the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, which became a pioneer in manufacturing integrated circuits.
Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce decided in 1968 to form their own company, focusing on semiconductor memory. They wrote what Mr. Moore described as a "very general" business plan.
"It said we were going to work with silicon," he said in 1994, "and make interesting products."
Their vague proposal notwithstanding, they had no trouble finding financial backing.
With $ 2.5 million in capital (the equivalent of about $ 22 million today), Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce called their start-up Integrated Electronics Corporation, a name they later shortened to Intel. The third employee was Mr. Grove, a young Hungarian immigrant who had worked under Mr. Moore at Fairchild.
After some indecision around what technology to focus on, the three men settled on a new version of MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) technology called silicon-gate MOS. To interconnect multiple transistors on a single piece of silicon, they deposited aluminum wires on top, creating an integrated circuit.
"Fortunately, very much by luck, we had hit on a technology that had just the right degree of difficulty for a successful start-up," Mr. Moore wrote. "This was how Intel began."
In the early 1970s, Intel's 4000 series "computer on a chip" began the revolution in personal computers -- although Intel itself missed the opportunity to manufacture a PC, for which Mr. Moore partly blamed his own shortsightedness.
"Long before Apple, one of our engineers came to me with the suggestion that Intel ought to build a computer for the home," he recalled. "And I asked him, 'What the heck would anyone want a computer for in his home?"'
Still, he saw the future. In 1963, while at Fairchild as director of research and development, Mr. Moore contributed a chapter to a book that described what was to become the precursor to his eponymous law, without the explicit numerical prediction. Two years later, he published an article in Electronics, a widely circulated trade magazine, titled "Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits."
"The article presented the same argument as the book chapter, with the addition of this explicitly numerical prediction," said David Brock, a co-author of "Moore's Law: The Life of Gordon Moore, Silicon Valley's Quiet Revolutionary" (2015).
There is little evidence that many people read the article when it was published, Mr. Brock said.
"He kept giving talks with these charts and plots, and people started using his slides and reproducing his graphs," Mr. Brock said. "Then people saw the phenomenon happen. Silicon microchips got more complex, and their cost went down."
In the 1960s, when Mr. Moore began in electronics, a single silicon transistor sold for $ 150. Later, $ 10 would buy more than 100 million transistors. Mr. Moore once wrote that if cars advanced as quickly as computers, "they would get 100,000 miles to the gallon and it would be cheaper to buy a Rolls-Royce than park it. (Cars would also be a half an inch long.)"
Mr. Moore's survivors include his wife; two sons, Kenneth and Steven; and four grandchildren.
In 2014, Forbes estimated Mr. Moore's net worth at $ 7 billion. Yet he remained unprepossessing throughout his life, preferring tattered shirts and khakis to tailored suits. He shopped at Costco and kept a collection of fly lures and fishing reels on his office desk.
Moore's Law is bound to reach its end, as engineers encounter some basic physical limits, as well as the extreme cost of building factories to achieve the next level of miniaturization. And in recent years, the pace of miniaturization has slowed.
Mr. Moore himself commented from time to time on the inevitable end of Moore's Law. "It can't continue forever," he said in a 2005 interview with Techworld magazine. "The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens."
Holcomb B. Noble, a former science editor for The Times, died in 2017.

Over a run of three stunt-laden films, John Wick has dispatched his enemies with rifles, pistols, swords and knives, as well as an assortment of things that just happen to be nearby. On one occasion, he took out several foes by slamming into them with his '69 Ford Mustang; on another, he beat a man to death with a library book. And then there was that time Wick slaughtered three men in a bar with a pencil, a feat that his fellow killers can't seem to stop talking about. Wherever Wick goes, folks die.
So why does John Wick, that most lethal of assassins, have so many friends?
In a clear break from the tradition of cinematic lone-wolf assassins with few if any pals -- Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name; Chow Yun-fat in a series of John Woo films -- Wick seems to have dozens. Everybody knows him, from beat cops and mechanics to club bouncers and hotel concierges.
"Wick has so many friends in this world because, at the end of the day, he's inherently a good man," the screenwriter Michael Finch explained. "And he's Keanu, so it's very hard to dislike him."
That would be Keanu Reeves, who has played the franchise's titular hero since the first Wick film in 2014. Now considered one of the greatest action films ever made, "John Wick" started a nearly $ 600 million franchise that has been praised for its imaginatively over-the-top action sequences. And over the years, Wick's friend circle has only grown.
"John Wick: Chapter 4," the latest installment of the series directed by Chad Stahelski, premieres Friday, and features even more of Wick's chums. The franchise has always drawn top talent for its supporting cast, like Halle Berry, Laurence Fishburne and Willem Dafoe, and this sequel is no different. Joining this time around are the martial arts film veterans Hiroyuki Sanada ("The Last Samurai," "Ring"), playing a close friend from Wick's distant past, and Donnie Yen ("Hero," the "Ip Man" series), starring as a blind swordsman enlisted to kill Wick.
"We spent three movies showing how lethal John is," the producer Basil Iwanyk said. "So we thought to ourselves, we've got to give him a nemesis that you believe he can't beat."
For newcomers to the franchise, the setup is simple: Wick is a former assassin who has managed to get out of the business, only to be drawn back in by the rash actions of one very stupid guy who kills his dog, the last gift from his recently deceased wife, and steals his car. Wick comes out of retirement to murder the man, and thus our story, and the franchise, begins.
Before long, we meet an ever-growing series of pals (present and former), acquaintances and longtime associates. In the first minutes of the original film, we meet Marcus, an old friend played by Dafoe. Not long after, a police officer, Jimmy (Thomas Sadoski), stops by because Wick's neighbors are complaining that he's been murdering people too loudly. "Evenin,' John," Jimmy greets him. Soon after, yet another friend, Charlie (David Patrick Kelly), comes to cart away all the corpses and mop up the blood. "Good to see you, John," he says, doffing his cap.
On a purely practical level, Wick's many friends exist to infuse some humanity into this otherwise fearsome killer of men. "The action sequences are phenomenal," said Caitlin G. Watt, the co-editor of "The Worlds of John Wick: The Year's Work at the Continental Hotel," an ambitious collection of academic essays. "But if you don't like John Wick or sympathize with him, the movies don't work."
The plethora of friends also provides a nod to the long and harrowing career Wick had before we first met him, including the legendary "impossible task" that allowed Wick to retire and burnished his reputation as the fearsome Baba Yaga. "Chad and Keanu created a character whose life you simply drop into," Finch said. "You don't know anything about what happened. We still don't know what the impossible task was."
It's largely through these friends that we learn about the very complex world Wick inhabits: its communication systems, rules of etiquette, international chain of deluxe hotels (the Continental, preferred lodging for the world's most discriminating assassins), and currency. You certainly aren't going to learn much about this through our taciturn hero, whose most impactful lines generally run only a few syllables long: "I'm going to need a gun," for instance, or "Yeah."
To be fair, nobody wants a chatty Wick. "These action films about mythological, larger-than-life characters die when you ask your lead to be expositional," Finch said.
Watt, who has written about the franchise's ties to Russian folklore, tales of knights in exile and the idea of the "monstrous hero," agreed. "You don't go to John Wick for the dialogue," she said, adding that no one expects it "to be like a Noël Coward play. But the dialogue does a lot of work in establishing these characters, their relationships and this very strange world where all of this takes place."
As for just how many true friends Wick has: "I think there are Continentals in most major cities, so there are probably roads that lead to John wherever he goes," the producer Erica Lee said. "I don't think he's the guy who has a surprise 60th birthday and there's a room full of people. But he does have a select handful of trusted people he can call out to."
Beginning with the first film, the creators pulled from their own circle of friends to cast Wick's. Stahelski met Kelly when both were working on "The Crow," the 1994 superhero film. "I was a new stunt guy and he was in the cast, and he took time to talk to me," Stahelski said. "So when I needed a Charlie, he was in my head." A similar thing happened with Randall Duk Kim, the doctor who patches up Wick's wounds -- Stahelski had worked with him on "The Matrix Reloaded."
The franchise's Manhattan setting also played a role in casting. "We were so below the radar, just an independent movie that didn't even have distribution," Iwanyk said of the first film. "But we shot in New York City, and there are so many actors there. That's how we got John Leguizamo, Bridget Moynahan, Lance Reddick," who died March 17 at age 60 but played Charon, concierge of the New York Continental, owned by Winston (Ian McShane), in all four chapters.
When the characters -- and the film -- hit, the creators kept many of them on for the sequels. Others soon followed. "When we were talking about '2,' someone said, wouldn't it be cool if we got Laurence Fishburne, so it would be like Neo and Morpheus?" Lee said of the actor who plays the Bowery King in three of the installments. Berry, who played Sofia Al-Azwar in "3," asked Stahelski for a part before a script was even written.
In this latest installment, friendship again plays a major role. Old friends return to protect Wick, or hunt him.
But just how, when and why Wick befriended all of these people is still largely a mystery, even to the creators. For the most part, histories for the characters, even for Wick himself, were created on the fly, if at all. "We never wanted to get into John's back story," Iwanyk said. "You know these people have a shared experience with John, and you know it was something intense and often violent, but you don't know what it is specifically."
Even so, the stories wouldn't work without these characters. A John Wick movie sans friends? "I wouldn't know how to tell that story," Finch said. "There would not be a successful franchise without a Winston, without a Charon, without a Bowery King."
John Wick's Friend Circle
Being friends with John Wick isn't easy. Over the years, people who have helped out Wick have been sliced seven times with a sword (Laurence Fishburne); smothered and shot in the head (Clarke Peters); tortured, then killed (Willem Dafoe); and asked to resign from their places of business (Ian McShane). There are friends whom Wick has shot at (Claudia Gerini), and others who have fired on Wick (McShane, Halle Berry). There are still others who want to be pals with Wick (Shamier Anderson, Mark Dacascos), but they've been hired to assassinate him, which tends to sour things in Wickworld, but often not for long.
With all the bullets flying, who can keep track? Here's a quick primer to a handful of Wick's friends.
WINSTON (IAN MCSHANE) He is the owner of the New York Continental, a swanky hotel for assassins. The establishment's primary rule: absolutely no killing on the premises. When Wick does, it puts him at odds with Winston and the High Table, the shadowy crime council that oversees the world's Continentals. "Winston is empathetic toward John's quest, but I think he's always trying to guide him toward his better instincts and away from danger," the screenwriter Shay Hatten said.
CHARON (LANCE REDDICK) The trusty, resourceful concierge of the New York Continental, Charon gets arms and ammo for Wick, fights alongside him and even breaks hotel rules by taking care of his (second) dog when the assassin is away. Even so, Charon doesn't seem all that broken up when Winston shoots Wick in the chest at the end of the third installment. "Charon is an inherently decent man," Finch said. "But even the nicest guy in the series has an edge to him."
THE DOCTOR (RANDALL DUK KIM) Called upon to patch up Wick's wounds, the Doctor takes a bullet for Wick -- two, in fact, from Wick's own gun, to cover up the fact that he is helping Wick against the direct rules of the High Table. "We excuse a lot of what John does because people like the Doctor, who are inherently OK and decent, seem to respond positively to him," Finch said.
THE DIRECTOR (ANJELICA HUSTON) The leader of the Ruska Roma, another crime organization, the Director was a maternal figure to the orphan Wick. For helping him escape punishment in "3," the Director's hands are ritually skewered by the High Table. "I wouldn't call them friends, at this point," Lee said. "I think she's probably annoyed at John."
THE BOWERY KING (LAURENCE FISHBURNE) As the self-anointed sovereign over a network of seeming panhandlers and vagrants who act as his eyes and ears, the Bowery King is an invaluable source of intel for Wick, as well as a major supplier for Wick's other needs. "The Bowery King is an anarchist," Lee said. "So when John had to go off grid, he was there to help him get guns, supplies and bulletproof suits."

Readers responded at nytimes.com to Drew Schwartz's article last Sunday about Radio Man, a fixture on New York film sets who collects, and sells, autographs. Comments were edited. Many years ago, my father, on a business trip, went into the Dallas Airport men's room. A young soldier walked in, and my father asked him, "Aren't you Elvis Presley?" The soldier said, "Yes, sir," and my father asked him for his autograph for his "daughter, who loves you." The soldier said, "I'd be happy to oblige, sir." From that day, my father became a rabid Elvis fan, because Elvis called him sir. This is common among Southern boys, but my father was a New Yorker, and was rarely called that at home. I kept the autograph for many years, until it was stolen from me.

Having seen Radio Man (minus his radio when I saw him) after two or three Broadway shows, it is dispiriting to hear an account of how his middleman did not even have change for him to buy a tea. It seems that his celebrity friends might set up a better way for him to sell his signed photos, so he is not getting royally ripped off. Maybe Radio Man doesn't care, but his friends should.

I adored the Beatles. My neighbor, an F.B.I. agent, was given an assignment to protect them at the Ed Sullivan Theater in 1964. I asked if he could get me an autograph. He said he would try. His daughter who was my age didn't care about them. He did get the autographs, but his daughter pitched a fit when he said he was giving them to me. He did give them to her, and as far as I could tell, she didn't care about them. At least I tried.

I walk past a fancy hotel every day on my way to and from work. Every time there's an N.B.A. game in town, there's a throng of people standing outside to get basketballs signed, and you can tell that most of them are resellers and not fans. I couldn't put my finger on why I found this so off-putting for a long time. I eventually realized that this whole industry is basically organized panhandling, with graphers asking strangers to give them something of great value and offering nothing in return. I think that's why the actors must like Radio: He treats them like human beings and not living A.T.M.s, and he clearly treasures each interaction rather than viewing them all as one-way transactions.

I have had the privilege to work in the industry for many years, both in New York and in Los Angeles. I remember moving back to New York after many years on the West Coast ... and was assisting a very-well-known director. This person, like many others, always welcomed Radio Man to set and I got to meet him. It was just one of those moments that showed me why making movies in New York is so special. And that is why I still do.
Becca, New York
I have known Radio Man for nearly all of the 34 years I have worked in the movie and TV business. He's always polite, asking for a little intel on what's happening on the set. When I worked on "30 Rock," he got a speaking part as "Les Moon Vest," a guy who wears a vest festooned with moons who steals shrimp from a wedding reception buffet.
Chris S, New York
Back in the late 1980s, I worked at 655 Third Avenue, the home of WNEW at the time, and Radio was frequently sitting outside the doors. I assumed he was a music fan and was amused when I later saw him in "The Fisher King" and "30 Rock." Sorry to read that some had negative encounters with him. For me, he's one of those sine qua non New York characters.

Gordon E. Moore, Intel Co-Creator and Silicon Chip Soothsayer, Dies at 94

Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder and former chairman of Intel Corp., the California semiconductor chipmaker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, achieving the kind of industrial dominance once held by giant American railroad or steel companies of another age, died Friday at his home in Hawaii. He was 94.
His death was announced by Intel and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. No cause was specified.
Along with a handful of colleagues, Moore could claim credit for bringing laptop computers to hundreds of millions of people and embedding microprocessors into everything from bathroom scales, toasters and toy fire engines to cellphones, cars and jets.
Moore had wanted to be a teacher but could not get a job in education. He later called himself an “accidental entrepreneur,” because he became a billionaire as a result of an initial $500 investment in the fledgling microchip business, which turned electronics into one of the world’s largest industries.
And it was he, his colleagues said, who saw the future. In 1965, in what became known as Moore’s Law, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, thus increasing the data-processing power of computers exponentially.
He added two corollaries later: The evolving technology would make computers more and more expensive to build, yet consumers would be charged less and less for them because so many would be sold. Moore’s Law held up for decades.
Through a combination of Moore’s brilliance, leadership, charisma and contacts, as well as that of his partner and Intel co-founder, Robert Noyce, the two assembled a group widely regarded as among the boldest and most creative technicians of the high-tech age.
This was the group that advocated the use of the thumbnail-thin chips of silicon, a highly polished, chemically treated sandy substance — one of the most common natural resources on Earth — because of what turned out to be silicon’s amazing hospitality in housing smaller and smaller electronic circuitry that could work at higher and higher speeds.
With its silicon microprocessors, the brains of a computer, Intel enabled American manufacturers in the mid-1980s to regain the lead in the vast computer data-processing field from their formidable Japanese competitors. By the ’90s, Intel had placed its microprocessors in 80% of the computers that were being made worldwide, becoming the most successful semiconductor company in history.
Much of this happened under Moore’s watch. He was CEO from 1975 to 1987, when Andrew Grove succeeded him, and remained chairman until 1997.
As his wealth grew, Moore also became a major figure in philanthropy. In 2001, he and his wife created the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation with a donation of 175 million Intel shares. In 2001, they donated $600 million to the California Institute of Technology, the largest single gift to an institution of higher learning at the time. The foundation’s assets currently exceed $8 billion and it has given away more than $5 billion since its founding.
In interviews, Moore was characteristically humble about his achievements, particularly the technical advances that Moore’s Law made possible.
“What I could see was that semiconductor devices were the way electronics were going to become cheap. That was the message I was trying to get across,” he told journalist Michael Malone in 2000. “It turned out to be an amazingly precise prediction — a lot more precise than I ever imagined it would be.”
Not only was Moore predicting that electronics would become much cheaper over time, as the industry shifted away from discrete transistors and tubes to silicon microchips, but over the years his prediction proved so reliable that technology firms based their product strategy on the assumption that Moore’s Law would hold.
“Any business doing rational multiyear planning had to assume this rate of change or else get steamrolled,” said Harry Saal, a longtime Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and friend of Moore’s, said: “That’s his legacy. It’s not Intel. It’s not the Moore Foundation. It’s that phrase: Moore’s Law.”
Gordon Earl Moore was born on Jan. 3, 1929, in San Francisco. He grew up in Pescadero, a small coastal town south of San Francisco, where his father, Walter H. Moore, was deputy sheriff and the family of his mother, Florence Almira (Williamson) Moore, ran the general store.
Moore enrolled at San Jose State College (now San Jose State University), where he met Betty Whitaker, a journalism student. They married in 1950. That year, he completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in chemistry. In 1954, he received his doctorate, also in chemistry, from Caltech.
One of the first jobs he applied for was as a manager with Dow Chemical. “They sent me to a psychologist to see how this would fit,” Moore wrote in Engineering & Science magazine in 1994. “The psychologist said I was OK technically but I’d never manage anything.”
So Moore took a position with the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Then, looking for a way back to California, he interviewed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, California. He was offered a job, he wrote, “but I decided I didn’t want to take spectra of exploding nuclear bombs, so I turned it down.”
Instead, in 1956, Moore joined William Shockley, a co-inventor of the transistor, to work at a West Coast division of Bell Laboratories, a startup unit whose aim was to make a cheap silicon transistor.
But the company, Shockley Semiconductor, foundered under Shockley, who had no experience running a company. In 1957, Moore and Noyce joined a group of defectors who came to be known as “the traitorous eight.” With each putting in $500, along with $1.3 million in backing from aircraft pioneer Sherman Fairchild, the eight men left to form the Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., which became a pioneer in manufacturing integrated circuits.
Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, Moore and Noyce decided in 1968 to form their own company, focusing on semiconductor memory. They wrote what Moore described as a “very general” business plan.
“It said we were going to work with silicon … and make interesting products,” he said in an interview in 1994.
Their vague proposal notwithstanding, they had no trouble finding financial backing.
With $2.5 million in capital (the equivalent of about $22 million today), Moore and Noyce called their startup Integrated Electronics Corp., and later shortened it to Intel. The third employee was Grove, a young Hungarian immigrant who had worked under Moore at Fairchild.
After some indecision around what technology to focus on, the three men settled on a new version of MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) technology called silicon-gate MOS. To interconnect multiple transistors on a single piece of silicon, they deposited aluminum wires on top, creating an integrated circuit.
“Fortunately, very much by luck, we had hit on a technology that had just the right degree of difficulty for a successful startup,” Moore wrote in 1994. “This was how Intel began.”
In the early 1970s, Intel’s 4000 series “computer on a chip” began the revolution in personal computers, although Intel itself missed the opportunity to manufacture a PC, which Moore blamed partly on his own shortsightedness.
“Long before Apple, one of our engineers came to me with the suggestion that Intel ought to build a computer for the home,” he wrote. “And I asked him, ‘What the heck would anyone want a computer for in his home?”
Still, he saw the future. In 1963, while at Fairchild as director of research and development, Moore contributed a chapter to a book that described what was to become the precursor to his eponymous law, without the explicit numerical prediction. Two years later, he published an article in Electronics, a widely circulated trade magazine, titled “Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits.”
“The article presented the same argument as the book chapter, with the addition of this explicitly numerical prediction,” said David Brock, a co-author of “Moore’s Law: The Life of Gordon Moore, Silicon Valley’s Quiet Revolutionary” (2015).
There is little evidence that many people read the article when it was published, Brock said.
“He kept giving talks with these charts and plots, and people started using his slides and reproducing his graphs,” Brock said. “Then people saw the phenomenon happen. Silicon microchips got more complex, and their cost went down.”
In the 1960s, when Moore began in electronics, a single silicon transistor sold for $150. Later, $10 would buy more than 100 million transistors. Moore once wrote that if cars advanced as quickly as computers, “they would get 100,000 miles to the gallon and it would be cheaper to buy a Rolls-Royce than park it. (Cars would also be a half an inch long.)”
Moore’s survivors include his wife; two sons, Kenneth and Steven; and four grandchildren.
In 2014, Forbes estimated Moore’s net worth at $7 billion. Yet he remained unprepossessing throughout his life, preferring tattered shirts and khakis to tailored suits. He shopped at Costco and kept a collection of fly lures and fishing reels on his office desk.
Moore’s Law is bound to reach its end, as engineers encounter some basic physical limits, as well as the extreme cost of building factories to achieve the next level of miniaturization. And in recent years, the pace of miniaturization has slowed.
Moore himself commented from time to time on the inevitable end of Moore’s Law. “It can’t continue forever,” he said in a 2005 interview with Techworld magazine. “The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens.”

Full text: On a blustery February evening in Midtown Manhattan, opposite an unmarked side entrance to the Ed Sullivan Theater, a crowd of more than 60 people stood crushed against a row of steel barricades. They all knew that at any moment, Harrison Ford would arrive for an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." They elbowed and cursed one another, jockeying for position, each clutching a sheaf of photographs for Mr. Ford to sign.
They weren't fans -- not most of them, anyway. They were "graphers," who make a living by hounding celebrities for autographs and selling them to the highest bidder. For many of them, graphing is a full-time job. Some have been at it for decades. They can flip a single signature for anywhere from $ 25 to more than $ 1,000, depending on a star's cachet and how frequently they sign. A Harrison Ford autograph, for example, retails for about $ 750.
At 5:30 on the dot, a black Escalade pulled to a stop in front of the theater. The rear door swung open, and the pack of graphers across the street broke into a frenzy. "Harrison!" they hollered. "Harrison, please!"
Slumped near a dumpster by the stage door, a disheveled man with a mane of gray hair and a wild beard let out a grunt. He clambered to his feet, reached into a grocery bag and pulled out an overstuffed FedEx mailer, inscribed in large, looping cursive with a note. "Thank you, Harrison," it read. "Love, Radio Man." He staggered past the theater's security team and approached the Escalade.
"Harrison!" the man called as Mr. Ford climbed out of the back seat. "How are ya?"
Mr. Ford grinned. "Radio," he said warmly. They shook hands. Fifty feet away, the graphers behind the barricades bellowed in a desperate chorus.
"Listen, I've got some photos for you," the man said, handing Mr. Ford the package.
"Sure, sure," Mr. Ford said, accepting it. They made small talk. Mr. Ford asked after the man's health, and the man asked after Helen Mirren, Mr. Ford's co-star on the "Yellowstone" spinoff "1923."
"Good to see you, Radio," Mr. Ford said. He slipped into the theater without acknowledging the graphers screaming his name. They would have to wait until he had finished his interview.

There are at least 150 professional graphers in New York City, according to Justin Steffman, the founder of the autograph authentication company AutographCOA. And right now, they are working at full tilt. All winter long, celebrities have been flocking to New York to campaign for projects up for various film and television awards, culminating in the Oscars. For graphers, collecting signatures during awards season is like fishing at a trout farm.
The rest of the year is by no means slow. Stars are always cycling in and out of Broadway theaters, concert venues, luxe hotels, film shoots and, most reliably, morning shows like "The View" and late-night shows like Mr. Colbert's. Their constant presence has made New York the graphing capital of the United States, topping even Los Angeles, whose sprawl, closed sets and tight security make life more challenging for graphers.
"It's got to be a billion-dollar industry," Mr. Steffman said. "It's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger."
There are at least 500 full-time graphers around the world, Mr. Steffman said, and thousands more who graph on a regular basis.
But none of them do it quite like Radio Man.
Radio Man -- legally known as Craig Castaldo, though no one ever calls him that -- has been graphing in New York since the early 1990s. Over the years, he has managed to charm a small army of celebrities into accepting his hefty packages of photographs, which they sign and return to him. Where most graphers would be lucky to get more than one signature from a star at a time, Radio Man regularly nabs dozens, sometimes hundreds. He considers the A-listers who sign for him his personal friends.
After his exchange with Mr. Ford, Radio Man made his way to the Park Hyatt to pick up a package that Sarah Michelle Gellar had left for him at reception. It was adorned with a heart in black Sharpie, along with a handwritten note: "Only for you, Radio." Inside were 43 signed photographs of Ms. Gellar.
"It's amazing how they take to me, these actors," Radio Man said. "A bum! I don't understand it."
Radio Man, 72, lives just above the poverty line, in a basement apartment in Yonkers he rents for $ 900 a month. He commutes into the city each morning on his bicycle, a 13-mile journey that takes him about two hours. He said he survives exclusively on food he gathers from free pantries and movie sets.
Though he could make a small fortune selling his autographs directly to collectors, his grasp of the necessary tools -- photo databases, printers, the internet -- is tenuous at best. Instead, like most graphers, he peddles his merchandise to a dealer, who in turn hawks it at a significant markup on eBay and other, more obscure autograph marketplaces.
Leaning against a wall outside the Park Hyatt, Radio Man pulled out his phone and made a call. A few minutes later, a silver sedan pulled up to the hotel. A tall, middle-aged man with close-cropped hair and a manicured beard stepped out of the car and into the frigid night. Radio Man handed him the package of signed photographs from Ms. Gellar, and the man accepted them without a word. He hurried back to the warmth of his car, leaving Radio Man alone next to his bicycle.
"Hey," Radio Man called out to him. "You got six bucks so I could get a tea or something?"
"I don't have any cash on me," the man said. He ducked into the car and drove away.
The man, Radio Man's de facto handler, supplies him with his FedEx mailers of photographs. Once Radio Man gets them signed, the handler sends them to a dealer based in Florida, who is rumored among graphers to be a millionaire. All told, the autographs Radio Man received from Ms. Gellar are worth approximately $ 6,000. He was paid about $ 300 for them.
"Let them make all the money they want," Radio Man said. "I don't care. As long as I get to see my friends."
By "friends," he meant the celebrities who have taken an unlikely shine to him since he stumbled into their world more than 30 years ago.
As Radio Man tells it, he made his first famous friend when he was homeless. One winter day in 1990, he was walking through Central Park when he encountered a man dressed in rags, whom he took for "a bum like me," he said. He offered the man a beer. "Do you know who I am?" the man asked.
It was Robin Williams. He was shooting "The Fisher King," Terry Gilliam's 1991 film in which Mr. Williams plays a vagabond searching for the Holy Grail.
"You're doing this all wrong," Radio Man told him. "You're not acting the way a bum should be."
He introduced the actor to life on the street, showing him "where to go and what to do." Mr. Williams patterned his performance in "The Fisher King," which earned him an Oscar nomination, after Radio Man. Or so Radio Man claims.
In exchange for his guidance, the movie's producers gave Radio Man $ 200 and a case of beer. They also cast him as an extra. From then on, he made a habit of hanging around film sets in New York, where he helped himself to food from craft-services stations and scored low-paying parts as a background actor. Graphing was an easy way to make money.
"I've been getting movies ever since," Radio Man said. "Here and there, playing my role: bum, homeless guy, guy on a bicycle with a radio."
But that's just one version of the story Radio Man tells about his origins.
Another version involves running a newspaper stand in the 1970s and being cast as an extra in "The In-Laws," starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Another involves sharing a beer with Bruce Willis on the set of "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Yet another involves showing up to shoots with a boombox around his neck and playing it at full volume until someone paid him to leave, a racket that supposedly earned him his nickname. ("A cop was there and he said to me: 'Hey, radio guy! Hey, radio person! Hey, radio man! Can you turn that down, please?' And that's how I became Radio Man.")
Whatever he may claim about his past, this much is true: Radio Man is a fixture on film sets in New York. He has appeared as an extra in dozens of movies, including "Ransom," "Zoolander," "The Departed" and "The Irishman." He has a preternatural knowledge of actors' whereabouts and shooting schedules. And he has forged something like a friendship with some of the biggest names in Hollywood.
On a January night in Chinatown, Radio Man sauntered around the set of "Wolves," a forthcoming movie starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, as if he were its executive producer. He weaved through packs of stagehands, chatting amiably with anyone who crossed his path. During a break in shooting, he shuffled over to Mr. Clooney, who was sitting in a director's chair. "Clooney!" he shouted, followed by an expletive-laden insult.
"There it is," Mr. Clooney said.
"You know where you're going tomorrow?"
"I don't know where I'm going tomorrow," Mr. Clooney said.
"Under the Manhattan Bridge."
"See, this is what I'm talking about," Mr. Clooney said, as the production crew standing around him laughed. "You don't need a call sheet. Radio Man is the call sheet."
Mr. Clooney first met Radio Man in 1996, on the set of "One Fine Day" in Manhattan. The actor has "never not seen him" during a trip to New York since, he said.
"Radio's everywhere," Mr. Clooney said. "Every hotel you show up at, Radio will be standing out in front of it going, 'De Niro's over at this, and Cate Blanchett's over here staying at the Carlyle.' He's got all the intel."
Radio Man endeared himself to Mr. Clooney, the actor said, after rescuing his wife, Amal Clooney, from a throng of paparazzi that had swarmed her on Fifth Avenue. Radio Man blocked them with his bicycle, hailed a cab and steered Ms. Clooney inside, securing her escape.
"He's a great guy," Mr. Clooney said. "He's a lovable mess, which we all are."
About six years ago, Mr. Clooney got together with a few other actors and flew Radio Man out to L.A. They sent him to the Oscars. He wore a tuxedo. He walked the red carpet. He sat in the audience. He brought a date.
A few nights after bumping into Radio Man in Chinatown, Mr. Clooney poked his head out of a white trailer parked on East Broadway and peered down the street. "Radio!" he yelled.
Radio Man ambled over. Mr. Clooney strode toward him holding a large bag, trailed by a pack of photographers.
"Here you go, Radio," he said, dropping the bag on the sidewalk with a thunk. "This thing weighs a ton, by the way."
Radio Man reached inside and pulled out two bulging FedEx mailers. They contained 185 signed photographs of Mr. Clooney, worth approximately $ 18,000.
Mr. Clooney said that Radio Man is the only grapher he will take a package from. But he signs for all of them.
"Every one of these guys who come over for autographs, it's a business for them," he said. "You try to help them out when you can."
There is at least one other grapher in New York capable of exchanging packages with celebrities: Giovanni Arnold, 38, who has been graphing in the city since 1999. He calls himself "Black Radio Man."
"There isn't really an elite group of graphers who are getting packages," Mr. Steffman said. "There's Gio, and there's Radio Man."
On a Saturday afternoon in January, Mr. Arnold sat in a dark bar in the East Village indexing several large bags of autographed memorabilia he had just received from Daniel Radcliffe, who was starring in a production of "Merrily We Roll Along" at the New York Theater Workshop a few blocks away.
He laid out his haul on a grimy, beer-stained table, examining each item -- cheaply printed photos, plastic Harry Potter eyeglasses, Gryffindor neckties -- for Mr. Radcliffe's signature. He counted 95 autographs in all, whose total value he pegged at $ 10,000. "I'm hype right now," he said. "He really blessed me."
Mr. Arnold celebrated with a Guinness. He took a sip from his pint glass and shook his head, pondering a question that has long puzzled him: Why would anyone pay for an autograph?
"My job baffles me," he said. "Personally, I wouldn't buy an autograph. It would be of more sentimental value if I got the autograph myself, but if someone else got it, it's just weird."
Mr. Arnold has taken a different approach to the business of graphing than most of his peers. He sells his own merchandise on eBay, as well as directly to private collectors, which has allowed him to accrue a level of wealth few graphers seem to enjoy.
He documents his day-to-day life hunting for autographs on Instagram under the handle @gtvreality, where you might find him giving Lady Gaga a ride on his bicycle, holding hands with Ben Affleck or shouting his catchphrase -- "Stay Black!" -- at Bob Dylan. He hopes to turn GTV Reality into a full-fledged brand and to monetize his content, though at 5,000 followers, he hasn't quite figured out how to do so.
"I'm trying to move in a different direction," he said. "Everyone and their mama's an autograph-getter now."
Ultimately, Mr. Arnold wants to find a way out of the memorabilia industry. He doesn't derive the same kind of joy that Radio Man does from chasing down celebrities, and he isn't willing to dedicate his life to it.
"I'm good at what I do," Mr. Arnold said. "But he's another level."
Back on the set of "Wolves," Radio Man cruised the streets of Chinatown looking for the director, Jon Watts. He was hoping there might be a scene he could sneak into. But the cameras were already rolling, and Mr. Watts was occupied.
Radio Man returned to his usual post outside Mr. Clooney's trailer. It was closing in on midnight. He was standing near his bicycle and sipping a hot tea, killing time until the next break in filming, when he was approached by someone he didn't recognize.
"Radio," the man said. He held up an 8-by-10-inch photograph, taped to a sheet of hardboard, of Radio Man. "Do you mind signing real quick?"
"What do you want me to say?" Radio Man asked. "Just, Radio Man?"
"Yeah," the man said. "Radio Man."
Radio Man signed the photograph in big, sloppy cursive. The man thanked him and walked away. It was hard to say if he was a grapher or just a fan.

NEW YORK — On a blustery February evening in midtown Manhattan, opposite an unmarked side entrance to the Ed Sullivan Theater, a crowd of more than 60 people stood crushed against a row of steel barricades. They all knew that at any moment, Harrison Ford would arrive for an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” They elbowed and cursed one another, jockeying for position, each clutching a sheaf of photographs for Ford to sign.
They weren’t fans — not most of them, anyway. They were “graphers,” who make a living by hounding celebrities for autographs and selling them to the highest bidder. For many of them, graphing is a full-time job. Some have been at it for decades. They can flip a single signature for anywhere from $25 to more than $1,000, depending on a star’s cachet and how frequently they sign. A Harrison Ford autograph, for example, retails for about $750.
At 5:30 on the dot, a black Escalade pulled to a stop in front of the theater. The rear door swung open, and the pack of graphers across the street broke into a frenzy. “Harrison!” they hollered. “Harrison, please!”
Slumped near a dumpster by the stage door, a disheveled man with a mane of gray hair and a wild beard let out a grunt. He clambered to his feet, reached into a grocery bag and pulled out an overstuffed FedEx mailer, inscribed in large, looping cursive with a note. “Thank you, Harrison,” it read. “Love, Radio Man.” He staggered past the theater’s security team and approached the Escalade.
“Harrison!” the man called as Ford climbed out of the back seat. “How are ya?”
Ford grinned. “Radio,” he said warmly. They shook hands. Fifty feet away, the graphers behind the barricades bellowed in a desperate chorus.
“Listen, I’ve got some photos for you,” the man said, handing Ford the package.
“Sure, sure,” Ford said, accepting it. They made small talk. Ford asked after the man’s health, and the man asked after Helen Mirren, Ford’s co-star on the “Yellowstone” spinoff “1923.”
“Good to see you, Radio,” Ford said. He slipped into the theater without acknowledging the graphers screaming his name. They would have to wait until he had finished his interview.
There are at least 150 professional graphers in New York City, according to Justin Steffman, founder of the autograph authentication company AutographCOA. And right now, they are working at full tilt. All winter long, celebrities have been flocking to New York to campaign for projects up for various film and television awards, culminating in the Oscars. For graphers, collecting signatures during awards season is like fishing at a trout farm.
The rest of the year is by no means slow. Stars are always cycling in and out of Broadway theaters, concert venues, luxe hotels, film shoots and, most reliably, morning shows like “The View” and late-night shows like Colbert’s. Their constant presence has made New York the graphing capital of the United States, topping even Los Angeles, whose sprawl, closed sets and tight security make life more challenging for graphers.
“It’s got to be a billion-dollar industry,” Steffman said. “It’s gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.”

Full text: Key industries -- including some that the White House is backing through other policies -- are lobbying to water down the first major new rules in a generation on chemicals that pose risks to humans.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is preparing to impose some of the first new rules in a generation to restrict or ban an array of toxic chemicals that are widely used in manufacturing, presenting the White House with tough choices between its economic agenda and public health.
Many of the substances in question are important to industries that President Biden has backed through other policies intended to bolster global competitiveness and national security, such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.
Corporations are framing the decisions about new regulations for an initial group of toxic chemicals as putting at risk the administration's drive to nurture the American economy of the future. Environmental and public health groups are stressing the need to focus on protecting workers and communities from substances known to carry health risks, such as cancer, liver and kidney damage and infertility.
A major lobbying clash is already underway. Chip makers, the burgeoning electric vehicle industry and other companies, including military contractors, are pressuring the administration to water down the new rules, saying the repercussions of a ban or new restrictions could be crippling.
"If the national security batteries do not perform as designed, then missiles don't fire, fighter jets crash, and satellites go dark," Aaron Rice, the director of environmental health and safety at EaglePicher Technologies, a Missouri-based battery manufacturer, wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency objecting to expected restrictions on two chemicals the company uses.
Boeing, Cummins, Ford, General Motors, General Electric and dozens of other companies have intervened with the E.P.A. directly or through trade associations to pre-emptively ask for exemptions.
The corporate lobbying has provoked an equally intense response from public health advocates, who argue that the chemicals in question have caused dozens of deaths or thousands of illnesses, particularly affecting Black and Latino communities near industrial zones in Texas, Louisiana and other states.
The E.P.A., the public health experts argue, can protect public health, combat climate change and promote other new technologies by pushing industry to switch to safer chemicals. The claims of disruption to economic growth, public health advocates say, are just scare tactics.
"There is nothing industry won't say to preserve their right to poison workers and consumers to make a buck," said Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has been pushing the E.P.A. to move ahead with the rules.
At issue initially are 10 chemicals that the E.P.A. has identified as among the most toxic threats. The agency has completed evaluations on nine of them, with the first three of these proposed chemical rules already undergoing review at the White House. Four others are expected by the end of the year.
The E.P.A. has hinted where it is headed with the new rules, issuing a series of so-called chemical exposure limits that detail how much workers can safely inhale without an increased risk of cancer, liver disease or other ailments -- extremely complex calculations based on decades of studies examining human and animal exposures to the toxins.
The proposed levels in many cases are many times lower than current workplace standards, which are decades old, generating predictions by chemical industry players of enormous impact on existing operations at manufacturing and processing plants.
Both sides are deluging the White House with their arguments.
The effort at the E.P.A. is being overseen by Michal Ilana Freedhoff, a chemist who spent more than two decades as a staff member in Congress working with Democrats who wanted to strengthen the government's powers to regulate toxic chemicals.
The rail accident last month in East Palestine, Ohio, which released toxic substances made with some of the same chemicals now being examined for safety, has focused additional attention on the threat, Ms. Freedhoff said. But the risks from toxic chemicals are present in areas across the United States on a daily basis, particularly for families who live close to factories that manufacture or use them.
"It is literally a matter of life and death for people all across America," Ms. Freedhoff, the head of the E.P.A.'s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters.
The pace of progress on toxic chemical regulation in the United States has been extraordinarily slow, even by the glacial standards of Washington's bureaucracy.
Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976, giving the E.P.A. the power to regulate toxic chemicals. But by 1991, key parts of the law were invalidated by a federal appeals court ruling after industry manufacturers challenged an effort to ban asbestos, a known carcinogen.
For the next 25 years, the United States effectively had no operative toxic chemical law. It was not until 2016 that Congress expanded the E.P.A.'s powers to fill the federal policy vacuum.
Given the decades of regulatory inaction, officials at the E.P.A. acknowledge that there are thousands of chemicals in the United States that have never been properly evaluated for the risk they present based on the specific ways they are used.
As a starting point, the agency identified 83 of the most toxic threats: chemicals that are "known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity." It then narrowed that list in 2016 to 10 of these chemicals as the initial focus of the regulatory process.
But more delays followed. When President Donald J. Trump took office in 2017 -- and hired several chemical industry executives to help oversee the revised law -- the E.P.A. revised the way it defined "risk evaluation," bowing to chemical industry lobbying but generating protests from longtime agency employees and lawsuits from public health advocates.
When Mr. Biden came into office two years ago, the pendulum swung back. The E.P.A. moved to define more broadly how it would consider toxic chemical hazards, calling the restrictions that the Trump administration had imposed evidence of how "political interference sometimes compromised the integrity of our science."
The E.P.A. is now evaluating not just contamination in manufacturing plants but also threats to the public at large, through contaminated air or water or at landfills.
The agency also assumes that workers do not always wear respirators or other protective equipment based on a concern that some employers do not mandate these basic safety measures, a decision that has provoked intense protests from chemical companies and industrial users. Workers are already protected, companies say, or the chemicals are used in closed-loop systems where the workers are not exposed at all -- except if there is an accident.
Ms. Freedhoff said the E.P.A. had an obligation to protect both workers and the public. She said she was still haunted by the deaths of children who drank contaminated drinking water in North Carolina and Massachusetts decades ago.
The chemical implicated in the drinking water contamination, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, can cause sudden death or kidney cancer if a person is exposed to high levels and other neurological harm even at lower exposures over a long period.
Yet the E.P.A.'s recently completed risk-evaluation studies found that as much as 250 million pounds of TCE are still produced in the United States annually to make refrigerants and remove grease from metal parts. It is also used in carpet cleaners, laundry spot removers and even hoof polish for horses.
Based on the new Biden-era risk evaluation, TCE presents an "unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment" in 52 of the 54 known ways it is used as an industrial and consumer product, the E.P.A. determined. That also includes the way in which it is disposed.
"That is locked into my whole moral compass," Ms. Freedhoff said, referring to TCE, which the E.P.A. toxic chemical program has not regulated in the more than three decades since the government first listed it as a probable carcinogen. "We have to take on TCE. That rule has to be done. It has to be protective."
The agency's risk assessments for seven other chemicals -- 1-bromopropane, carbon tetrachloride, C.I. Pigment Violet 29, cyclic aliphatic bromide cluster, methylene chloride, n-methylpyrrolidone, perchloroethylene -- reached similar conclusions of widespread "unreasonable risks," as did one completed during the Trump administration for asbestos.
The toxic chemical law requires the E.P.A. to move immediately to issue regulations to eliminate unreasonable risks by picking from a range of options such as banning the chemical, prohibiting certain types of uses and requiring special health precautions.
The E.P.A. has imposed air pollution restrictions on some of these same chemicals, but manufacturing plants often have mishaps that result in releases despite the rules. Public health advocates and some state health officials have pressed the E.P.A. to consider the cumulative impact of exposures to different chemicals in certain communities near clusters of manufacturing plants.
"All sources of exposure must be considered," said a letter sent by environmental officials from California, New York, Oregon and Washington State.
The revised law gives the E.P.A. the power to grant exemptions to chemical regulations if a ban or restriction "would significantly disrupt the national economy, national security or critical infrastructure," a process that may simply mean companies have more time to phase in a less toxic replacement.
This language has generated a flood of exemption requests, including from a coalition of companies that manufacture lithium batteries used in cellphones and electric vehicles. The batteries use n-methylpyrrolidone, or NMP, which the E.P.A. concluded increases the risk of miscarriages and male infertility.
"It is critical for E.P.A. to recognize that there is no substitute for NMP in our manufacturing processes," the battery-industry trade association wrote in a letter to the agency before requesting an exemption, arguing that it had ways to safely use the chemical. "The federal government should be taking steps to promote -- not impede -- the growth of our rechargeable battery technology in the United States."
The Semiconductor Industry Association, whose members include Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung and most of the other major global chip manufacturers, has sent letters to the E.P.A., challenging its assumption that the way the companies use NMP presents a risk to its employees.
Several other industry players pointed out to the E.P.A. that chemicals it could soon impose limits on are essential to manufacture new air conditioning refrigerants that do not deplete the ozone layer or contribute to climate change.
The American Chemistry Council, the country's largest trade association representing the $ 800 billion-a-year chemical industry, has hosted over 100 virtual and in-person meetings for members of Congress and their staff to try to persuade them to more closely oversee the E.P.A.'s actions. Those events included a reception last month on Capitol Hill for newly elected members of Congress, mostly Republicans.
"They've heard from us, they've heard from other stakeholders that work with the E.P.A.," said Ross Eisenberg, the chief lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, which spent nearly $ 20 million on lobbying last year, the most in its history.
House Republicans, following these appeals, introduced a bill last month that would require the E.P.A. to more broadly weigh "economic, societal" costs before it could reject the use of a new chemical.
Corporate executives and lobbyists have also pressed White House officials to intervene. Executives from Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance -- whose members make TCE and other chemicals -- predicted at a White House meeting in December that there would be dire economic consequences if the E.P.A. moved ahead with tougher workplace inhalation limits.
Companies have also made clear that they intend to sue to try to block the rules once they are imposed.
"Such levels, if mandated, would eliminate U.S. manufacturing of tires, paper, many plastics and many other important products," said a statement presented on behalf of a trade association and Olin Corporation, a major chemical manufacturer.
The new rules, Ms. Freedhoff conceded, would mean higher costs in some cases. But she said she was also convinced that the United States could make progress on combating climate change and expanding major industries like semiconductor manufacturing while still reducing health threats.
"We have to change the way industry does things in order to protect human beings," she said. "Right now, the human beings are assuming the cost."

Full text: Ryan J. Haddad's gracefully layered play about the lives of disabled people blasts away condescension and replaces it with comprehension.
Near the start of "Dark Disabled Stories," the playwright-performer Ryan J. Haddad's richly provocative new show at the Public Theater, he tells a funny, sexy anecdote about a hookup at a gay bar that didn't go the way he'd hoped.
Haddad has cerebral palsy and uses a walker. In the story, he finds himself stranded without it -- a plot twist that caused his audience, the other night, to breathe a soft sound of sympathy. Haddad must have been expecting this, because his reaction is right there in the script. He invites anyone who regards him as "sad or pitiable" to leave.
"I am not here to be pitied and I am not a victim," he says. "Is that clear?" Then, with startling sternness, an unscripted repetition: "Is that clear?"
Quite. But one other thing needs to be made clear immediately, which is that Haddad is an actor and writer of extraordinary charm. Disarmingly witty, immensely likable, he is not about to spend his show lecturing you.
He will make you laugh, though. And with his director, Jordan Fein, and fellow actors, Dickie Hearts and Alejandra Ospina, he will change the way you think about disability -- and prompt you to think of accessibility as something that can deepen a dramatic experience when it's built into the architecture of the piece.
The autobiographical stories here -- set on buses, or on Grindr dates, or on the pitted streets of New York -- are calibrated to blast away condescension and replace it with something closer to comprehension. Partly, they're about how arduous it can be to navigate a world that's oblivious to your comfort and safety, because it wasn't built with your kind of body in mind. But these stories are also about the body as an instrument of pleasure, a vessel of longing, a means of communication.
Presented by the Public and the Bushwick Starr, "Dark Disabled Stories" is a highly theatrical, gracefully layered model of inventive inclusivity. Haddad and Hearts, a Deaf actor who radiates charisma, play parallel versions of a character called Ryan. Haddad speaks the lines; Hearts signs them. (The director of artistic sign language is Andrew Morrill.) The written dialogue is projected, attractively, on the upstage wall.
Ospina spends most of the show just offstage, periodically speaking audio description that is anything but intrusive. When she says that the set is not merely "very, very pink" but in fact "Benjamin Moore's Island Sunset pink," this is valuable intel for us all. (Set and costume design are by dots, lighting by Oona Curley, sound by Kathy Ruvuna, video by Kameron Neal.)
Ospina also briefly takes the stage in her wheelchair to tell her own dark story, about what it's like to be trapped in a subway station with the elevators out. It's not the only tale that might make you wish, urgently, that the M.T.A. would send a delegation to see this play.
"Dark Disabled Stories" is in the Public's most accessible theater, the Shiva on the first floor. Yet masks are required at only a few performances each week -- the Public's default policy.
So on your seat before mask-optional performances, alongside your playbill, you'll find a complimentary mask and a kindly worded note. "'Dark Disabled Stories' is a show grounded in disability cultural values. In disability culture, the community practices collective care to protect each other," it says, asking that you mask up. The night I went, most people did.
The note is signed, "Thanks from the company of 'Dark Disabled Stories."' But should the company have had to make that request? Among the takeaways from the play is how enervating it can be to have to plead constantly for access and understanding. A blanket mask requirement for this show would have been a reasonable accommodation.

NEW YORK — Near the start of “Dark Disabled Stories,” playwright-performer Ryan J. Haddad’s richly provocative new show at the Public Theater, he tells a funny, sexy anecdote about a hookup at a gay bar that didn’t go the way he’d hoped.
Haddad has cerebral palsy and uses a walker. In the story, he finds himself stranded without it — a plot twist that caused his audience, the other night, to breathe a soft sound of sympathy. Haddad must have been expecting this, because his reaction is right there in the script. He invites anyone who regards him as “sad or pitiable” to leave.
“I am not here to be pitied and I am not a victim,” he says. “Is that clear?” Then, with startling sternness, an unscripted repetition: “ Is that clear ?”
Quite. But one other thing needs to be made clear immediately, which is that Haddad is an actor and writer of extraordinary charm. Disarmingly witty, immensely likable, he is not about to spend his show lecturing you.
He will make you laugh, though. And with his director, Jordan Fein, and fellow actors, Dickie Hearts and Alejandra Ospina, he will change the way you think about disability — and prompt you to think of accessibility as something that can deepen a dramatic experience when it’s built into the architecture of the piece.
The autobiographical stories here — set on buses, or on Grindr dates, or on the pitted streets of New York — are calibrated to blast away condescension and replace it with something closer to comprehension. Partly, they’re about how arduous it can be to navigate a world that’s oblivious to your comfort and safety, because it wasn’t built with your kind of body in mind. But these stories are also about the body as an instrument of pleasure, a vessel of longing, a means of communication.
Presented by the Public and the Bushwick Starr, “Dark Disabled Stories” is a highly theatrical, gracefully layered model of inventive inclusivity. Haddad and Hearts, a Deaf actor who radiates charisma, play parallel versions of a character called Ryan. Haddad speaks the lines; Hearts signs them. (The director of artistic sign language is Andrew Morrill.) The written dialogue is projected, attractively, on the upstage wall.
Ospina spends most of the show just offstage, periodically speaking audio description that is anything but intrusive. When she says that the set is not merely “very, very pink” but in fact “Benjamin Moore’s Island Sunset pink,” this is valuable intel for us all. (Set and costume design are by dots, lighting by Oona Curley, sound by Kathy Ruvuna, video by Kameron Neal.)
Ospina also briefly takes the stage in her wheelchair to tell her own dark story, about what it’s like to be trapped in a subway station with the elevators out. It’s not the only tale that might make you wish, urgently, that the MTA would send a delegation to see this play.
“Dark Disabled Stories” is in the Public’s most accessible theater, the Shiva on the first floor. Yet masks are required at only a few performances each week — the Public’s default policy.
So on your seat before mask-optional performances, alongside your playbill, you’ll find a complimentary mask and a kindly worded note. “‘Dark Disabled Stories’ is a show grounded in disability cultural values. In disability culture, the community practices collective care to protect each other,” it says, asking that you mask up. The night I went, most people did.
The note is signed, “Thanks from the company of ‘Dark Disabled Stories.’” But should the company have had to make that request? Among the takeaways from the play is how enervating it can be to have to plead constantly for access and understanding. A blanket mask requirement for this show would have been a reasonable accommodation.

The CHIPS Act Is About More Than Just Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A sprawling new program for the semiconductor industry is foremost about national security, but it will try to advance other priorities as well.
The Biden administration unveiled rules Tuesday for its "Chips for America" program to build up semiconductor research and manufacturing in the United States, beginning a new rush toward federal funding in the sector.
The Commerce Department has $ 50 billion to hand out in the form of direct funding, federal loans and loan guarantees. It is one of the largest federal investments in a single industry in decades and highlights deepening concern in Washington about America's dependence on foreign chips.
Given the huge cost of building highly advanced semiconductor facilities, the funding could go fast, and competition for the money has been intense.
Here's a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, what it aims to do and how it will work.
Funding chip production and research
The largest portion of the money-- $ 39 billion -- will go to fund the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities. Another $ 11 billion will be distributed later this year to support research into new chip technologies.
The bulk of the manufacturing money is likely to go to a few companies that produce the world's most advanced semiconductors -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung Electronics, Micron Technology and, perhaps in the future, Intel -- to help them build U.S. facilities.
Some will go to makers of older chips that are still essential for cars, appliances and weapons, as well as suppliers of raw materials for the industry and companies that package the chips into their final products.
While some critics have questioned the wisdom of giving grants to a profitable industry, semiconductor executives argue that they have little incentive to invest in the United States, given the higher costs of workers and running a factory.
The administration does not plan to fund entire projects: Biden administration officials say they plan to offer grants of between 5 to 15 percent of a company's capital expenditures for a project, with funding not expected to exceed 35 percent of the cost. Companies can also apply for a tax credit reimbursing them for 25 percent of project construction.
Limiting foreign dependence
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, describes the program as foremost a national security initiative.
While the United States is still a leader in designing chips, most manufacturing has been sent offshore. Today, more than 90 percent of the most technologically advanced chips, which are critical for the U.S. military and the economy, are produced in Taiwan. That has prompted concerns about the supply's vulnerability, given China's aggression toward Taiwan and the potential for a military invasion of the island.
At the same time, China has increased its market share in less advanced chips that are still critical for cars, electronics and other products. The United States manufactures 12 percent of chips, though none of the world's most advanced.
Chip shortages during the pandemic forced factories to halt work and brought home in a tangible way how vulnerable the supply chain is to disruption. Workers at Ford Motor factories in Michigan and Indiana worked a full week just three times last year because of a chips shortage, Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University last week. That helped create a car shortage and raise the price of cars, stoking inflation.
The Commerce Department says the program will also provide the Department of Defense and the national security community with a domestic source of the world's most advanced chips.
Building chip hubs
According to Ms. Raimondo, the goal is to build at least two U.S. manufacturing clusters to produce the most advanced types of logic chips, as well as facilities for other kinds of chips, and complex supply networks to support them.
Commerce officials have declined to speculate where these facilities might be, saying they must review applications. But chip makers have already announced billions of dollars in plans for new investments around the United States.
TSMC, which produces most of the world's leading-edge chips, has been busy expanding in Arizona, while No. 2 Samsung is growing in Texas. Micron, which makes advanced memory chips, has announced big expansion plans in New York. And Intel, a U.S. technology giant that is investing heavily to try to capture a technological edge, has broken ground on a "megasite" in Ohio.
Ms. Raimondo has said the vision is to restore the United States to a position of leadership in semiconductor technology, to the point where every major global chip company wants to have both research and manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Still, there is skepticism about how much the program can do. One 2020 study, for example, found that a $ 50 billion investment in the industry would increase U.S. market share only to 14 percent.
Protecting taxpayer funds
The stakes are high for the Biden administration to prove this foray into industrial policy can work. Critics have argued that the federal government may not be the best judge of winners and losers. If the administration gets it wrong, it could face intense criticism.
The Commerce Department said it would look closely at companies that applied for funding, to try to ensure that they were not being given more taxpayer dollars than they needed.
In a decision that may irk some companies, the department said projects receiving grants would be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government, to ensure that companies gave accurate financial projections and didn't exaggerate costs to get bigger awards.
The Commerce Department also said it would dole out funding over time as companies hit project milestones, and give preference to those that pledged to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company's share price.
Companies are also barred from making new, high-tech investments in China or other "countries of concern" for at least a decade, to try to ensure that taxpayer money does not go to fund new operations in China.
But analysts said it remained to be seen how difficult it would be to enforce these provisions. Company finances can be opaque, and when a company saves a dollar in the United States, it may then choose to invest it elsewhere.
Helping workers by attaching big strings
The program also includes some ambitious and unusual requirements aimed at benefiting the people who will staff semiconductor facilities.
For one, the department will require companies seeking awards of $ 150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for plant construction workers and operators. This could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost or directly subsidizing workers' care costs. Ms. Raimondo has said child care will draw more people into the work force, when many businesses are struggling in a tight labor market.
Applicants are also required to detail their engagement with labor unions, schools and work force education programs, with preference given to projects that benefit communities and workers.
Other provisions will encourage companies, universities and other parties to offer more training for workers, both in advanced sciences and in skills like welding. The department said it would give preference to projects for which state and local governments were providing incentives with "spillover" benefits for communities, like work force training, education investment or infrastructure construction.
This is part of the Biden administration's "worker-centered" approach to economic policy, which seeks to use the might of the federal government to benefit workers. But some critics say it could put the program's goal of building the most advanced semiconductor factories at risk, if it adds excessive costs to new projects.

Biden's Rules Aim to Shape U.S. Business: [National Desk]

Full text: The administration says the conditions it has attached to $ 40 billion in new subsidies will help U.S. semiconductor makers compete globally. Some economists disagree.
WASHINGTON -- President Biden's plan to plow billions of dollars into semiconductor manufacturing represents a sharp turn in American economic policy, one aimed at countering China by building up a single, critical industry. But Mr. Biden is going even further. He is using the money to change how corporations behave.
If semiconductor manufacturers want a piece of the nearly $ 40 billion in aid that Mr. Biden's administration began the process of handing out on Tuesday, they will need to provide child care for employees, run their plants on low-emission sources of energy, pay union wages for construction workers, shun stock buybacks and potentially share certain profits with the government.
That decision is a bet on the power of the federal government to transform private industry. But it is also a distinct break from how the United States has traditionally engaged with corporate America. The president is essentially incorporating disparate policy objectives into a big spending bill that was sold as an effort to shore up a supply of semiconductors critical for the economy and national security.
The approach could amplify the effects of the CHIPS Act and other economic bills Mr. Biden has signed into law over the past two years, by accomplishing multiple goals at the same time. Administration officials say the money and the guidelines will drive American industry toward Mr. Biden's vision of an economy with more U.S. production, better conditions for workers and fewer of the fossil fuel emissions driving climate change.
But in testing the limits of a new industrial policy, the strategy may also carry significant risks. Some economists, even some who favor robust federal spending to bolster strategic industries, say Mr. Biden is in danger of drowning his core economic goals.
"Everyone acknowledges what we are trying to do here, in trying to make a larger, more globally competitive U.S. semiconductor industry, is a difficult challenge," said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist for the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank in Washington. "We're making that challenge much harder by trying to accomplish another dozen unrelated things at once.
"Advocates of industrial policy should worry that not only is this going to fail, but it's going to discredit industrial policy for a generation," Mr. Ozimek said.
Biden officials say that they are not asking companies to do anything outside their own commercial interests and that the steps they are taking are not meant to be punitive. They are emboldened by the amount of money they have to hand out and confident that companies will accept it with the conditions they have attached. If anything, those officials essentially say, they are not unduly burdening businesses; they are helping them do what is necessary to attract workers and avoid wasting federal dollars.
In an interview, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo repeatedly cast the lack of access to child care as an economic issue and a key contributor to the labor shortages that American manufacturers frequently complain they are experiencing. Entrenched bias against working women has prevented corporations and the government from addressing that issue, she said, in ways that have hurt companies.
"I am kind of requiring them to pay attention to this because I know this is what they need to be successful," Ms. Raimondo said.
Ms. Raimondo has described the financial rules for companies that take federal funds as a way to ensure taxpayer dollars are not wasted. Requiring companies to share some unexpected upside profits with the government will encourage companies to be accurate and honest with their financial projections, so the department can send dollars where they are needed most. The limitations on stock buybacks will prevent taxpayer dollars from going to enrich company shareholders and chief executives, administration officials say.
But after reviewing the rules, industry lobbyists and some economists said they worried companies would be forced to siphon money away from the new law's central objectives. Several complained that administration officials had not coupled the CHIPS funding announcements with efforts to shrink, not expand, environmental regulations and other government rules covering construction projects.
"We should be focused on removing regulatory barriers -- particularly in the permitting space -- and we have to be careful about adding ancillary new requirements that only increase cost and delay bringing production online," said Neil Bradley, an executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a heavyweight business organization in Washington.
And some congressional Republicans accused the administration of undermining the intent of the law by trying to force liberal priorities on companies competing for subsidies.
Representative Frank D. Lucas of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, said the administration had been "adamant" that the United States needed to incentivize chip production, or else companies would choose to build in other countries that offered more attractive policies.
"That's why it's troubling that now that the administration has the $ 52 billion in funds they requested," Mr. Lucas said, "they're focusing less on the urgent need for chip production and more on attempting to impose their labor agenda on this critical industry."
For some foreign chip makers, investing in the United States is already provoking concerns about high costs and managerial challenges. And other countries have also continued to subsidize their own chip facilities aggressively, providing a potentially attractive alternative to investing in the United States.
Economists largely agree that both the scale and practices of Mr. Biden's industrial policy are signs of how dramatically the thinking about the government's role in the economy has changed in Washington.
A core reason for that shift is what has happened in East Asia, particularly China, where governments have made frequent use of state subsidies to shore up industries and capture global market share. Since American researchers invented the integrated circuit in the 1950s, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Israel and other locations have invested heavily in chips, helping to push production out of the United States.
The U.S. share of global chips manufacturing has now dwindled to just 12 percent. American companies still design many of the world's most cutting-edge chips; they just manufacture them offshore.
Shortages of chips and other critical products in the pandemic helped underscore how reliant the country is on foreign factories. More broadly, U.S. dependence on China for key products like electric vehicles, solar panels, steel and rare earth metals has helped to turn the tide in Washington toward a more interventionist economic policy and dampened concerns about government interference in markets.
Both political parties are now broadly aligned behind the use of industrial policy to counter China's economic dominance. Members of the Trump and Biden administrations, and Democratic and Republican lawmakers, helped create the CHIPS and Science Act, which Congress passed last summer by significant margins.
The bill included several strict provisions for companies that receive subsidies, including a ban on using government funding for stock buybacks and dividends and a 10-year restriction on making investments in cutting-edge chip facilities in China. The bill also encouraged companies to offer work force training initiatives and team up with unions and educational institutions.
The Biden administration appears confident that the $ 52 billion carrot it is offering to chip makers, suppliers and research facilities is a big enough incentive for companies to overpower any corporate complaints about the administration's efforts to influence their behavior. Officials note that some chip makers already comply with some of the requirements in other locations: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is building a new facility in Arizona, provides child care at several of its plants in Taiwan. Chip makers operating in other countries, China for example, may have to go to great lengths to support government initiatives or national security objectives.
Chief executives have privately grumbled about the restrictions, but most continue to publicly praise the program. Most major semiconductor makers have already broken ground on expensive new U.S. facilities. Since early 2020, companies have pledged nearly $ 200 billion for U.S. chip manufacturing projects, many in anticipation of the funding.
One of those companies, Intel, said in a release on Tuesday that the CHIPS guidelines released by the Commerce Department were "an important step for American semiconductor companies to be globally competitive and will help to restore balance in the global chip making industry." The Semiconductor Industry Association said it was "carefully reviewing" the rules but welcomed the Commerce Department's steps to set the program in motion.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former trade official and labor economist who has advocated industrial policy, said he was sympathetic to the Biden administration's goals of maximizing the program's benefit to the public, rather than company shareholders.
"The policy is aimed at ensuring the security and increasing the well-being of all Americans," he said. "It is not meant to be a special gift to the semiconductor companies."

CEOs have privately grumbled about the restrictions, but most continue to publicly praise the program. Most major semiconductor makers have already broken ground on expensive new U.S. facilities. Since early 2020, companies have pledged nearly $200 billion for U.S. chip manufacturing projects, many in anticipation of the funding.
One of those companies, Intel, said in a release Tuesday that the CHIPS guidelines released by the Commerce Department were “an important step for American semiconductor companies to be globally competitive and will help to restore balance in the global chip making industry.” The Semiconductor Industry Association said it was “carefully reviewing” the rules but welcomed the Commerce Department’s steps to set the program in motion.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former trade official and labor economist who has advocated industrial policy, said he was sympathetic to the Biden administration’s goals of maximizing the program’s benefit to the public, rather than company shareholders.
“The policy is aimed at ensuring the security and increasing the well-being of all Americans,” he said. “It is not meant to be a special gift to the semiconductor companies.”

The Biden administration unveiled rules Tuesday for its “Chips for America” program to build up semiconductor research and manufacturing in the United States, beginning a new rush toward federal funding in the sector.
The Commerce Department has $50 billion to hand out in the form of direct funding, federal loans and loan guarantees. It is one of the largest federal investments in a single industry in decades and highlights deepening concern in Washington about America’s dependence on foreign chips.
Given the huge cost of building highly advanced semiconductor facilities, the funding could go fast, and competition for the money has been intense.
Here’s a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, what it aims to do and how it will work.
Funding Chip Production and Research
The largest portion of the money— $39 billion — will go to fund the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities. Another $11 billion will be distributed later this year to support research into new chip technologies.
The bulk of the manufacturing money is likely to go to a few companies that produce the world’s most advanced semiconductors — including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics, Micron Technology and, perhaps in the future, Intel — to help them build U.S. facilities.
Some will go to makers of older chips that are still essential for cars, appliances and weapons, as well as suppliers of raw materials for the industry and companies that package the chips into their final products.
While some critics have questioned the wisdom of giving grants to a profitable industry, semiconductor executives argue that they have little incentive to invest in the United States, given the higher costs of workers and running a factory.
The administration does not plan to fund entire projects. Biden administration officials say they plan to offer grants of between 5% to 15% of a company’s capital expenditures for a project, with funding not expected to exceed 35% of the cost. Companies can also apply for a tax credit reimbursing them for 25% of project construction.
Limiting Foreign Dependence
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, describes the program as foremost a national security initiative.
While the United States is still a leader in designing chips, most manufacturing has been sent offshore. Today, more than 90% of the most technologically advanced chips, which are critical for the U.S. military and the economy, are produced in Taiwan. That has prompted concerns about the supply’s vulnerability, given China’s aggression toward Taiwan and the potential for a military invasion of the island.
At the same time, China has increased its market share in less advanced chips that are still critical for cars, electronics and other products. The United States manufactures 12% of chips, though none of the world’s most advanced.
Chip shortages during the pandemic forced factories to halt work and brought home in a tangible way how vulnerable the supply chain is to disruption. Workers at Ford Motor factories in Michigan and Indiana worked a full week just three times last year because of a chips shortage, Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University last week. That helped create a car shortage and raise the price of cars, stoking inflation.
The Commerce Department says the program will also provide the Department of Defense and the national security community with a domestic source of the world’s most advanced chips.
Building Chip Hubs
According to Raimondo, the goal is to build at least two U.S. manufacturing clusters to produce the most advanced types of logic chips, as well as facilities for other kinds of chips, and complex supply networks to support them.
Commerce officials have declined to speculate where these facilities might be, saying they must review applications. But chipmakers have already announced billions of dollars in plans for new investments around the United States.
TSMC, which produces most of the world’s leading-edge chips, has been busy expanding in Arizona, while No. 2 Samsung is growing in Texas. Micron, which makes advanced memory chips, has announced big expansion plans in New York. And Intel, a U.S. technology giant that is investing heavily to try to capture a technological edge, has broken ground on a “megasite” in Ohio.
Raimondo has said the vision is to restore the United States to a position of leadership in semiconductor technology, to the point where every major global chip company wants to have both research and manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Still, there is skepticism about how much the program can do. One 2020 study, for example, found that a $50 billion investment in the industry would increase U.S. market share only to 14%.
Protecting Taxpayer Funds
The stakes are high for the Biden administration to prove this foray into industrial policy can work. Critics have argued that the federal government may not be the best judge of winners and losers. If the administration gets it wrong, it could face intense criticism.
The Commerce Department said it would look closely at companies that applied for funding, to try to ensure that they were not being given more taxpayer dollars than they needed.
In a decision that may irk some companies, the department said projects receiving grants would be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government, to ensure that companies gave accurate financial projections and didn’t exaggerate costs to get bigger awards.
The Commerce Department also said it would dole out funding over time as companies hit project milestones, and give preference to those that pledged to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company’s share price.
Companies are also barred from making new, high-tech investments in China or other “countries of concern” for at least a decade, to try to ensure that taxpayer money does not go to fund new operations in China.
But analysts said it remained to be seen how difficult it would be to enforce these provisions. Company finances can be opaque, and when a company saves a dollar in the United States, it may then choose to invest it elsewhere.
Helping Workers by Attaching Big Strings
The program also includes some ambitious and unusual requirements aimed at benefiting the people who will staff semiconductor facilities.
For one, the department will require companies seeking awards of $150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for plant construction workers and operators. This could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost or directly subsidizing workers’ care costs. Raimondo has said child care will draw more people into the workforce, when many businesses are struggling in a tight labor market.
Applicants are also required to detail their engagement with labor unions, schools and workforce education programs, with preference given to projects that benefit communities and workers.
Other provisions will encourage companies, universities and other parties to offer more training for workers, both in advanced sciences and in skills like welding. The department said it would give preference to projects for which state and local governments were providing incentives with “spillover” benefits for communities, like workforce training, education investment or infrastructure construction.
This is part of the Biden administration’s “worker-centered” approach to economic policy, which seeks to use the might of the federal government to benefit workers. But some critics say it could put the program’s goal of building the most advanced semiconductor factories at risk, if it adds excessive costs to new projects.

To Tap Federal Funds, Chipmakers Will Need to Provide Child Care

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration plans to leverage the federal government’s expansive investment in the semiconductor industry to make progress on another goal: affordable child care.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will announce that any semiconductor manufacturer seeking a slice of nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies will need to essentially guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for workers who build or operate a plant.
Last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed the CHIPS Act, which devoted $39 billion to directly boost U.S. semiconductor factories as part of $52 billion in subsidies for the industry, in hopes of making the nation less reliant on foreign suppliers for critical chips that power computers, video games, cars and more.
Companies that receive the subsidies to build new plants will be able to use some of the government money to meet the new child care requirement. They could do that in a number of ways, in consultation with Commerce officials who will set basic guidelines but not dictate how companies ensure workers have access to care they can afford.
That could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost for workers, directly subsidizing workers’ care costs or other, similar steps that would ensure workers have access to care for their children.
U.S. employers, including manufacturers, are increasingly raising concerns that a lack of access to affordable child care is blocking millions of Americans from looking for work, particularly women. President Joe Biden pushed Congress to address those concerns over the past two years, proposing hundreds of billions of dollars for new child care programs, but he was unable to corral support from even a majority of Senate Democrats.
But Biden did convince lawmakers to approve a range of new spending programs seeking to boost U.S. manufacturing. Now, Commerce is trying to utilize a centerpiece of those efforts, which aims to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, to make at least a small dent in his large goals for the so-called care economy.
It joins a growing list of administration efforts to expand the reach of Biden’s economic policies beyond their primary intent. For instance, administration officials have attached stringent labor standards and “Buy America” provisions to money from a bipartisan infrastructure law. The child care requirement will be flexible for chipmakers, but it will almost certainly divert some subsidy dollars that are meant to expand factory capacity and create jobs.
The Commerce Department is expected to release its application Tuesday, allowing companies to begin making a case for federal subsidies that the industry lobbied hard to secure from Congress.
The prospect of accessing those funds has already enticed domestic and foreign-owned chipmakers to announce billions of dollars in plans for new investments in Arizona, central New York and elsewhere.
But even as they ramp up investments, companies are complaining of difficulties in finding workers to build and operate manufacturing facilities.
The United States’ child care industry has not fully rebounded from the pandemic recession. It is still about 58,000 workers, or 5 percentage points, short of its pre-pandemic peak, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by the Center for the Study of Childcare Employment at the University of California-Berkeley.
Shortly before the pandemic, the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington surveyed 35 states and found more than 11 million children had a potential need for child care — yet fewer than 8 million slots were available.
That shortage is particularly acute in some of the areas where manufacturers are set to begin building new chip plants spurred by the new legislation. Commerce Department officials calculate that in the Syracuse, New York, area, where Micron announced a $100 billion chipmaking investment last year after Biden signed the new law, the need for slots in child care facilities is nearly three times the size of the actual care capacity in the region.
In Phoenix, where semiconductor manufacturing is booming, child care costs consume about 18% of a typical construction or manufacturing worker’s salary. That share is higher than the national average.
Gina Raimondo, the Commerce secretary, said in an interview that the child care requirements should help companies cope with a tight labor market by making it easier for them to attract and retain caregivers who have been kept from working by difficulties finding care for their children.
In a speech last week, Raimondo called efforts to attract more women to the workforce “a simple question of math” for industries complaining of labor shortages. “We need chip manufacturers, construction companies and unions to work with us toward the national goal of hiring and training another million women in construction over the next decade to meet the demand not just in chips, but other industries and infrastructure projects as well,” she said.
Only about 3 in 10 U.S. manufacturing workers are women. Raimondo said the CHIPS Act would fail if the administration did not help companies change those numbers, by bringing in women who have children.
“You will not be successful unless you find a way to attract, train, put to work and retain women, and you won’t do that without child care,” Raimondo said in an interview.
The Commerce requirement would represent a relatively small step toward Biden’s much larger, and as-yet unfulfilled, child care ambitions.
Biden unveiled a $4 trillion economic agenda in the months after he took office. It was split into two parts. One focused on physical investments: repairing bridges and water pipes, laying broadband cable, spurring a shift to low-emission sources of energy and catalyzing new manufacturing capacity to compete on a global stage. It was a source of repeated legislative success for the president, who signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill and a climate, health and tax bill that passed with only Democratic votes.
But Biden failed to persuade centrist holdouts in his party, like Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to back most of the provisions in the second half of his agenda. Those were largely the president’s plans to invest in people: federally guaranteed paid leave; subsidized care for children, the disabled and older Americans; universal prekindergarten; free community college for all, and more.
The lopsided nature of Biden’s success threatens to exacerbate existing gender disparities in the economy. Some economists warn they could hinder future economic growth. Many of Biden’s people-focused programs were deliberately aimed at boosting female participation in the workforce.
It could be years before Democrats have another opportunity to pass those programs. Republicans won control of the House of Representatives last fall and roundly oppose Biden on new spending proposals and the tax increases on corporations and high earners that he has called for to cover that spending. Progressive groups and liberal lawmakers largely concede there is little chance of a child care bill making its way to Biden’s desk before the 2024 election.
When it became clear last year that sweeping plans to expand and subsidize child care would not make it into the climate, health and tax bill that marked the culmination of Biden’s economic efforts in Congress, Raimondo gathered aides around a conference table. She told them, she said, that “if Congress wasn’t going to do what they should have done, we’re going to do it in implementation” of the bills that did pass.
Some U.S. manufacturers have already turned to on-site care facilities to help meet workers needs. Automaker Toyota has provided 24-hour care at a factory in Kentucky since 1993 and one in Indiana since 2004.
Chad Moutray, director of the Center for Manufacturing Research at the Manufacturing Institute, which is affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers, wrote in a report late last year that child care availability is part of the reason women do not seek more jobs in manufacturing.
“Women represent a sizable talent pool that manufacturers cannot ignore,” he wrote. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

U.S. Funding Drives Rivals In Chip Wars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Semiconductor companies, which united to get the CHIPS Act approved, have set off a lobbying frenzy as they argue for more cash than their competitors.
WASHINGTON -- In early January, a New York public relations firm sent an email warning about what it characterized as a threat to the federal government's program to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The message, received by The New York Times, accused Intel, the Silicon Valley chip titan, of angling to win subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act for new factories in Ohio and Arizona that would sit empty. Intel had said in a recent earnings call that it would build out its facilities with the expensive machinery needed to make semiconductors when demand for its chips increased.
The question, the email said, was whether officials would give funding to companies that outfitted their factories from the jump "or if they will give the majority of CHIPS funding to companies like Intel."
The firm declined to name its client. But it has done work in the past for Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's longtime rival, which has raised similar concerns about whether federal funding should go to companies that plan to build empty shells. A spokesman for AMD said it had not reviewed the email or approved the public relations firm's efforts to lobby for or against any specific company receiving funding.
"We fully support the CHIPS and Science Act and the efforts of the Biden administration to boost domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing," the spokesman said.
Rival semiconductor suppliers and their customers pulled together last year as they lobbied Congress to help shore up U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce vulnerabilities in the crucial supply chain. The push led lawmakers to approve the CHIPS Act, including $ 52 billion in subsidies to companies and research institutions as well as $ 24 billion or more in tax credits -- one of the biggest infusions into a single industry in decades.
But that unity is beginning to crack. As the Biden administration prepares to begin handing out the money, chief executives, lobbyists and lawmakers have begun jostling to make their case for funding, in public and behind closed doors.
In meetings with government officials and in a public filing, Intel has called into question how much taxpayer money should go to its competitors that have offshore headquarters, arguing that American innovations and other intellectual property could be funneled out of the country.
"Our I.P. is here, and that's not insignificant," said Allen Thompson, Intel's vice president of U.S. government relations. "We are the U.S. champion."
States, cities and universities have also gotten into the act, hoping to lure subsidies and jobs expected to be generated by manufacturing sites and new research and development.
Purveyors of chips, their suppliers and the trade associations that represent them together spent $ 59 million on lobbying last year, according to tracking from OpenSecrets, up from $ 46 million in 2021 and $ 36 million in 2020, as they tried to ensure that Congress approved their funding.
Some of those activities have now shifted to making sure companies snag the biggest portion.
"Everybody wants their piece of the pie," said Willy Shih, a management professor at Harvard Business School who follows semiconductor issues. He said it wasn't surprising that companies would be raising tough questions about competitors, which could be helpful for the Commerce Department in setting policies.
"We haven't done something of this scale in the U.S. in a long time," he said. "There is a lot at stake."
How the Biden administration distributes the funding in coming months could shape the future of an industry that is increasingly seen as a driver of both economic prosperity and national security. It may also influence how vulnerable the United States remains to foreign threats -- particularly the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where more than 90 percent of the world's advanced chips are made.
Since American researchers invented the integrated circuit in the late 1950s, the U.S. manufacturing share has dwindled to around 12 percent. Most American chip companies, including AMD, focus on designing cutting-edge products while outsourcing the costly manufacturing to overseas foundries, most of which are in Asia.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company developed the foundry concept in the 1980s and dominates that market, followed by Samsung Electronics. Intel, which both designs and makes its own chips, fell behind TSMC and Samsung in manufacturing technology but has vowed to catch up and build its own foundry business to make chips for customers.
The industry's concentration has left it particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. During the pandemic, shortages of lower-end "legacy" chips that are used in cars forced automakers to repeatedly close factories, sending prices soaring.
The CHIPS Act aims to rectify some of these shortcomings by allocating $ 39 billion in grants for new or expanded U.S. factories. The Commerce Department has indicated that about two-thirds of the money will be steered toward makers of leading-edge semiconductors, a category that includes TSMC, Samsung and Intel. All three companies have already broken ground on major expansions of their U.S. facilities.
The remaining third is expected to go toward legacy chips, which are heavily used in cars, appliances and military equipment.
Another $ 11 billion of funding is expected to go toward building a handful of chip research centers around the country. Government and academic institutions in Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Florida and Ohio have filed documents describing why they should be considered for funding. Even tiny Guam has raised its hand.
One challenge for the Commerce Department will be to distribute the money widely enough across the nation to create several thriving "ecosystems" that can bring together raw materials, research and manufacturing capacity, but not undermine the effort by spreading it too thinly. With dozens of companies, universities and other players interested in snagging a share, the funding could go fast.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters on Wednesday that the goal was to create "at least two" new clusters of manufacturing capacity for leading-edge chips, in addition to facilities producing other kinds of semiconductors. Each cluster would employ thousands of workers and support a web of businesses supplying the raw materials and services they need.
"We have very clear national security goals, which we must achieve," Ms. Raimondo said, noting that not every chip maker will get what it wants. "I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money, and the reality is the return on our investment here is the achievement of our national security goal. Period."
The competition has intensified as the Biden administration prepares to release the ground rules for applications next week. The grants, which can range up to $ 3 billion or more per project, could start going out this spring.
Executives say huge spending by governments in South Korea, Taiwan, China and elsewhere has helped shape the chip industry globally. And the current U.S. policy push could again alter the market, by giving some companies advantages that allow them to edge out competitors.
Most chip companies, in publicly discussing the subsidies, have stressed the common goal of bolstering U.S. production. But clear differences among them have emerged. Many are outlined in the more than 200 filings that companies, organizations, universities and others submitted to the Commerce Department last March.
Beyond extolling the merits of their own manufacturing plans, some applicants made the case that rival projects deserved less funding or should face strict limits on how they operated, though few companies mentioned their competitors by name.
Intel, along with other U.S.-based firms like GlobalFoundries and SkyWater Technology, expressed concerns about foreign-owned companies, including whether their U.S. factories could continue operating in the event of a crisis in their home country.
Intel has argued that foreign investment is welcome, but that its longtime concentration of chip design, research and manufacturing in the United States meant that it should get special consideration.
But competitors argue that investing heavily in Intel could be a risky bet for the U.S. government, and some Biden administration officials have questioned whether Intel can follow through on its plans to catch up to its competitors technologically. The company has suffered from a severe drop in sales and announced on Wednesday that it would cut its stock dividend.
U.S. officials have also stressed the need to support a U.S. expansion by TSMC, in part because it produces leading-edge chips crucial to the military.
TSMC, which has broken ground on a $ 40 billion investment in two advanced factories in Arizona, countered in its filing that "preferential treatment based on the location of a company's headquarters" would not be an effective or efficient use of U.S. money. AMD, one of TSMC's largest customers, has advocated its U.S. expansion.
AMD and Intel, both based in Santa Clara, Calif., have competed fiercely for the market for microprocessor chips.
In its filing in March, AMD expressed concerns about whether certain unnamed competitors had proved that they could operate effectively as a foundry and make leading-edge chips. Intel has struggled on both counts. And AMD highlighted the risk that grant recipients would not immediately spend that money to outfit their factories with equipment.
"Any facility receiving federal assistance must be operational upon completion of construction," AMD wrote. "A facility that sits idle or is held in reserve for demand increases should immediately forfeit any federal funds."
Mr. Thompson of Intel declined to comment on the email. But he defended the "smart capital" strategy articulated by Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, which has stressed building factory shells and then investing to equip them in accordance with market demand.
Intel is continuing to follow that strategy with construction projects in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, to ensure that its new facilities are built out "in alignment with the market," Mr. Thompson said. But Intel has no intention of using the government money for "basically just building shells," he said. "The goal is to ensure that we have the capacity to support our customers."

WASHINGTON — In early January, a New York public relations firm sent an email warning about what it characterized as a threat to the federal government’s program to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The message, received by The New York Times, accused Intel, the Silicon Valley chip titan, of angling to win subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act for new factories in Ohio and Arizona that would sit empty. Intel had said in a recent earnings call that it would build out its facilities with the expensive machinery needed to make semiconductors when demand for its chips increased.
The question, the email said, was whether officials would give funding to companies that outfitted their factories from the jump “or if they will give the majority of CHIPS funding to companies like Intel.”
The firm declined to name its client. But it has done work in the past for Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s longtime rival, which has raised similar concerns about whether federal funding should go to companies that plan to build empty shells. A spokesperson for AMD said it had not reviewed the email or approved the public relations firm’s efforts to lobby for or against any specific company receiving funding.
“We fully support the CHIPS and Science Act and the efforts of the Biden administration to boost domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing,” the spokesperson said.
Rival semiconductor suppliers and their customers pulled together last year as they lobbied Congress to help shore up U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce vulnerabilities in the crucial supply chain. The push led lawmakers to approve the CHIPS Act, including $52 billion in subsidies to companies and research institutions as well as $24 billion or more in tax credits — one of the biggest infusions into a single industry in decades.
But that unity is beginning to crack. As the Biden administration prepares to begin handing out the money, CEOs, lobbyists and lawmakers have begun jostling to make their case for funding, in public and behind closed doors.
In meetings with government officials and in a public filing, Intel has called into question how much taxpayer money should go to its competitors that have offshore headquarters, arguing that U.S. innovations and other intellectual property could be funneled out of the country.
“Our IP is here, and that’s not insignificant,” said Allen Thompson, Intel’s vice president of U.S. government relations. “We are the U.S. champion.”
States, cities and universities have also gotten into the act, hoping to lure subsidies and jobs expected to be generated by manufacturing sites and new research and development.
Purveyors of chips, their suppliers and the trade associations that represent them together spent $59 million on lobbying last year, according to tracking from OpenSecrets, up from $46 million in 2021 and $36 million in 2020, as they tried to ensure that Congress approved their funding.
Some of those activities have now shifted to making sure companies snag the biggest portion.
“Everybody wants their piece of the pie,” said Willy Shih, a management professor at Harvard Business School who follows semiconductor issues. He said it wasn’t surprising that companies would be raising tough questions about competitors, which could be helpful for the Commerce Department in setting policies.
“We haven’t done something of this scale in the U.S. in a long time,” he said. “There is a lot at stake.”
How the Biden administration distributes the funding in coming months could shape the future of an industry that is increasingly seen as a driver of both economic prosperity and national security. It may also influence how vulnerable the United States remains to foreign threats — particularly, the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where more than 90% of the world’s advanced chips are made.
Since American researchers invented the integrated circuit in the late 1950s, the U.S. manufacturing share has dwindled to around 12%. Most U.S. chip companies, including AMD, focus on designing cutting-edge products while outsourcing the costly manufacturing to overseas foundries, most of which are in Asia.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. developed the foundry concept in the 1980s and dominates that market, followed by Samsung Electronics. Intel, which both designs and makes its own chips, fell behind TSMC and Samsung in manufacturing technology but has vowed to catch up and build its own foundry business to make chips for customers.
The industry’s concentration has left it particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. During the pandemic, shortages of lower-end “legacy” chips that are used in cars forced automakers to repeatedly close factories, sending prices soaring.
The CHIPS Act aims to rectify some of these shortcomings by allocating $39 billion in grants for new or expanded U.S. factories. The Commerce Department has indicated that about two-thirds of the money will be steered toward makers of leading-edge semiconductors, a category that includes TSMC, Samsung and Intel. All three companies have already broken ground on major expansions of their U.S. facilities.
The remaining third is expected to go toward legacy chips, which are heavily used in cars, appliances and military equipment.
Another $11 billion of funding is expected to go toward building a handful of chip research centers around the country. Government and academic institutions in Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Florida and Ohio have filed documents describing why they should be considered for funding. Even tiny Guam has raised its hand.
One challenge for the Commerce Department will be to distribute the money widely enough across the nation to create several thriving “ecosystems” that can bring together raw materials, research and manufacturing capacity but not undermine the effort by spreading it too thinly. With dozens of companies, universities and other players interested in snagging a share, the funding could go fast.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters Wednesday that the goal was to create “at least two” new clusters of manufacturing capacity for leading-edge chips, in addition to facilities producing other kinds of semiconductors. Each cluster would employ thousands of workers and support a web of businesses supplying the raw materials and services they need.
“We have very clear national security goals, which we must achieve,” Raimondo said, noting that not every chipmaker will get what it wants. “I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money, and the reality is, the return on our investment here is the achievement of our national security goal. Period.”
The competition has intensified as the Biden administration prepares to release the ground rules for applications next week. The grants, which can range up to $3 billion or more per project, could start going out this spring.
Executives say huge spending by governments in South Korea, Taiwan, China and elsewhere has helped shape the chip industry globally. And the current U.S. policy push could again alter the market, by giving some companies advantages that allow them to edge out competitors.
Most chip companies, in publicly discussing the subsidies, have stressed the common goal of bolstering U.S. production. But clear differences among them have emerged. Many are outlined in the more than 200 filings that companies, organizations, universities and others submitted to the Commerce Department last March.
Beyond extolling the merits of their own manufacturing plans, some applicants made the case that rival projects deserved less funding or should face strict limits on how they operated, though few companies mentioned their competitors by name.
Intel, along with other U.S.-based firms like GlobalFoundries and SkyWater Technology, expressed concerns about foreign-owned companies, including whether their U.S. factories could continue operating in the event of a crisis in their home country.
Intel has argued that foreign investment is welcome but that its longtime concentration of chip design, research and manufacturing in the United States meant that it should get special consideration.
But competitors argue that investing heavily in Intel could be a risky bet for the U.S. government, and some Biden administration officials have questioned whether Intel can follow through on its plans to catch up to its competitors technologically. The company has suffered from a severe drop in sales and announced Wednesday that it would cut its stock dividend.
U.S. officials have also stressed the need to support a U.S. expansion by TSMC, in part because it produces leading-edge chips crucial to the military.
TSMC, which has broken ground on a $40 billion investment in two advanced factories in Arizona, countered in its filing that “preferential treatment based on the location of a company’s headquarters” would not be an effective or efficient use of U.S. money. AMD, one of TSMC’s largest customers, has advocated its U.S. expansion.
AMD and Intel, both based in Santa Clara, California, have competed fiercely for the market for microprocessor chips.
In its filing in March, AMD expressed concerns about whether certain unnamed competitors had proved that they could operate effectively as a foundry and make leading-edge chips. Intel has struggled on both counts. And AMD highlighted the risk that grant recipients would not immediately spend that money to outfit their factories with equipment.
“Any facility receiving federal assistance must be operational upon completion of construction,” AMD wrote. “A facility that sits idle or is held in reserve for demand increases should immediately forfeit any federal funds.”
Thompson of Intel declined to comment on the email. But he defended the “smart capital” strategy articulated by Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s CEO, which has stressed building factory shells and then investing to equip them in accordance with market demand.
Intel is continuing to follow that strategy with construction projects in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio to ensure that its new facilities are built out “in alignment with the market,” Thompson said. But Intel has no intention of using the government money for “basically just building shells,” he said. “The goal is to ensure that we have the capacity to support our customers.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Arizona Leads Race Chasing $52 Billion In Microchip Support: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The state has become a hub for chip makers including Intel and TSMC, as the government prepares to release a gusher of funds for the strategic industry.
In recent weeks, Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, has talked with Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, spent time with the president of Arizona State University and appeared at a conference with the mayor of Phoenix.
Their discussions centered on one main topic: chips.
Ms. Raimondo is in charge of handing out $ 52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research under the CHIPS Act, a funding package intended to expand domestic production of the foundational technology, which acts as the brains of computers. The legislation, which passed in August, is a prime piece of President Biden's industrial policy and part of a push to ensure America's economic and technology leadership over China.
Arizona wants to make sure it is in position for a portion of that once-in-a-generation gusher of federal funding, for which the Commerce Department is expected to begin taking applications within days. As a result, Arizona officials have inundated Ms. Raimondo to promote the state's growing chip industry and talked with the chief executives of giant chip companies such as Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Arizona, which is vying for subsidies along with Texas, New York and Ohio, may have a head start on the action. The state has been home to semiconductor makers since the 1940s and has 115 chip-related companies, whereas there is one major manufacturer in Ohio.
Arizona has also led the nation in chip investments since 2020, with the announcements of two new chip-making plants by TSMC and two additional factories from Intel that will cost a combined $ 60 billion. State leaders had helped persuade the companies to open the facilities by offering big tax breaks and water and other infrastructure grants. They also promised to expand technical and engineering education in the state.
State officials and chip companies also acted as a lobbying bloc in Washington. They helped shape the CHIPS Act to include federal tax credits, subsidies, and research and work force grants. TSMC expanded its lobbying staff to 19 people from two in two years, and Intel spent more than $ 7 million in lobbying efforts last year, the most it had spent in two decades. Arizona State University spent $ 502,000 on lobbying last year, also the most in two decades.
"It has been an intentional and an all-hands-on-deck effort," said Sandra Watson, president of the Arizona Commerce Authority, a nonprofit economic development organization that has helped lead state efforts to attract chip companies and push for the CHIPS Act.
The Commerce Department is expected to soon begin handing out $ 39 billion in subsidies to semiconductor makers, later opening the process to companies, universities and others to apply for $ 13.2 billion in research and work force development subsidies. The CHIPS Act also provides an investment tax credit for up to 25 percent of a manufacturer's capital expenditure costs.
Ms. Raimondo has described the process as a "race" among states. "Every governor, every state legislature, every president of public universities in every state ought to be now putting their plan of attack together," she said in August during a visit to Arizona State University's tech research and development center. "This is going to be a competitive process."
The Commerce Department declined to comment.
Arizona's history with chip manufacturing stretches back to 1949, when the telecom hardware and services provider Motorola opened a lab in Phoenix that later developed transistors. In 1980, Intel built a semiconductor plant in Chandler, a suburb southeast of Phoenix, drawn by the state's low property taxes, relative proximity to its Silicon Valley headquarters and stable geology. (Earthquakes are rare in Arizona.)
During President Donald J. Trump's administration, he pushed an "America First" policy agenda. That opened an opportunity for Doug Ducey, a Republican who was then Arizona's governor, and other state officials to transform their economy into a tech hub.
In 2017, Mr. Ducey and other Arizona officials traveled to Taiwan to meet with executives of TSMC, the world's biggest maker of leading-edge chips. They promoted the state's low taxes, its business-friendly regulatory environment and Arizona State University's engineering school of more than 30,000 students.
Mr. Ducey, who was close to Mr. Trump, also had calls with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on financial incentives to expand domestic production of chips.
"My job is to sell Arizona," Mr. Ducey said. "In this case, it was to sell Arizona to TSMC but also to the administration."
In 2019, Mr. Ducey helped set up calls between the cabinet secretaries and TSMC's executives to lock in a deal to open manufacturing plants in Arizona. The state promised tax credits and other financial incentives to help offset costs for the company to move production to the United States from Taiwan.
In May 2020, TSMC announced plans to build a $ 12 billion factory in Phoenix. Later that year, the city provided TSMC with $ 200 million in infrastructure incentives, including water lines, sewage and roads. One traffic light would cost the city $ 500,000.
"TSMC appreciates the support from our dedicated partners on the state, local and federal levels," said Rick Cassidy, the chief executive of TSMC Arizona, adding that the CHIPS Act funds will enable the company and its suppliers to expand "for years to come."
In early 2021, Pat Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, announced a sweeping strategy to increase U.S. production of chips. States began soliciting the company. Arizona officials highlighted their long relationship with Intel and perks, such as the state's low property and business taxes.
Intel soon announced a $ 20 billion expansion in Chandler, with two additional factories that would bring 3,000 new jobs to the state. Chandler also approved $ 30 million in water and road improvements for the new plants.
"The Arizona government has been a great collaborator," said Bruce Andrews, Intel's chief government affairs officer. "By investing in semiconductors early, they created an ecosystem that has had a jobs multiplier effect and massive economic benefits."
But some of the tax breaks have rankled Arizona residents, who say the moves have hurt funding for public schools. The state ranks 47th in per-student spending. "We need to bring business to our state, but we need to look at balance," said Beth Lewis, the executive director of Save Our Schools in Arizona. "Corporations are choosing not to settle in Arizona because of our devastated public education system."
Arizona pressed ahead with pushing Congress to create legislation for chip subsidies. In March 2021, Senator Kelly joined Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, the authors of legislation that would become the CHIPS Act, in a call with the new Biden administration to push for the White House's support of funding.
Mr. Kelly, an early sponsor of the CHIPS Act, became a chief negotiator on the legislation in Congress. He negotiated the inclusion of a four-year 25 percent investment tax credit in the bill, including a provision that ensured Intel and TSMC would get the tax credits even though their Arizona factory projects were announced before the bill would go into effect.
Mr. Kelly also helped the president of Arizona State University, Michael Crow, lobby for the inclusion of more than $ 13 billion in grants for research and development and work force training. And Mr. Kelly and state leaders hosted administration officials at events to showcase the state's semiconductor efforts as part of the White House's manufacturing strategy.
"We have the potential to lead the nation in microchip production," Mr. Kelly said in a statement. "I was honored to lead this effort, and now I'm working to maximize it for Arizona"
Mr. Ducey, who left office when his term ended in January, pushed for more tech-friendly policies, including an income-tax cut. He also said he would use $ 100 million that the state had received from federal Covid grants to attract more chip companies and help them apply for funds provided by the CHIPS Act.

In December, TSMC announced a second factory that would bring its total investment in Arizona to $ 40 billion. Mr. Biden and Ms. Raimondo traveled to Phoenix to speak at the announcement, with Mr. Kelly accompanying them on Air Force One.
Arizona officials continue to pitch semiconductor companies to open factories in the state.
This month, Ms. Watson hosted more than 20 chief executives of chip companies at the Super Bowl in Glendale. Katie Hobbs, Arizona's new governor and a Democrat, and Mr. Kelly heralded how the state could benefit from the CHIPS Act.
"There's a robust pipeline," Ms. Watson said.

Assessing the Biden Record as His Economic Team Transitions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Leonhardt, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Biden's economic team turns over, we look at its successes and failures over the first two years.
President Biden's economic team is turning over. Brian Deese, the top adviser in the West Wing, left his job this week, and Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will soon return to her faculty post at Princeton.
I want to use the transition to think about Biden's biggest economic successes and failures so far, as well as some big uncertainties. As part of that exercise, I sat down with Deese to conduct an exit interview, and you'll read quotes from it below.
In the interest of accountability, let's start with what I see as the administration's biggest disappointments.
Two failures
Inflation. After decades of low inflation, Biden and his team erred on the side of a large Covid stimulus plan in 2021. They were more worried about the economy being too weak, as it has been for much of the 21st century, than being so strong that prices spiked. They were at least partly wrong.
The chart below captures the administration's mistake -- but also its somewhat limited consequences. Inflation in the U.S. was initially higher than in similar countries, but only modestly so and not anymore. That pattern suggests that the Biden bill did aggravate inflation, but the stimulus wasn't the biggest problem.
The bigger problems were the supply chain disruptions caused by Covid and the energy price increases caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
When I gave Deese a chance either to defend the size of the stimulus plan or acknowledge that it was too big, he did neither and simply said, "It was the right thing to do."
The "care economy." Biden came into office calling for universal pre-K, paid family leave and an expansion of elder care. But he could not rally enough congressional support despite the policies' popularity in polls. The failure seems to stem partly from the administration's lack of focus on the so-called care economy: It was one item on a long list of Biden's priorities.
Barack Obama was able to pass an expansion of health care partly because he made clear that the bill was his top priority. A future administration may need to do the same to make the care economy a reality. It's also an area that would benefit from more policy design work by outside experts, Deese said.
One policy that Biden did pass was a large expansion of the child tax credit, and it led to a sharp decline in child poverty. Nevertheless, Congress let the expansion expire. A lesson: For a policy to become too popular to end, it probably needs to exist for several years.
Three successes
The Covid recovery. Deese named "a strong and equitable economic recovery" as Biden's top economic accomplishment. The unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 1969, and wage increases have been larger for lower-income workers than higher earners. Black unemployment often takes more than four years to recover from a recession, Deese said. This time, it took two years.
The stimulus plan deserves criticism for aggravating inflation, but it also some credit for the vigorous recovery.
Investment. Biden can't claim any one victory as large as Obamacare, but the scope of his legislation is impressive. It includes bills to reduce medical costs; rebuild bridges, highways and other infrastructure; and expand broadband internet service, public transportation and the nation's semiconductor sector.
"In terms of magnitude, you have to go back to the '50s and early '60s to find a similar approach," Deese said, referring to infrastructure. He is particularly hopeful, he said, that those investments will spark investments by private companies. Already, Intel and Micron are planning semiconductor factories in response.
Climate. Close readers may have noticed that the above list of investments left off one category: clean energy. I think it is important enough to highlight. Given the extreme costs and dangers of climate change, Biden's investments to accelerate the transition away from greenhouse gases may end up being the most important part of his economic legacy.
A few uncertainties
Antitrust. Along with a strong recovery and a surge of investment, Deese named Biden's focus on competition and antitrust as one of his three biggest economic accomplishments. The competition policy includes a new skepticism toward mergers; a crackdown on "junk fees"; and the approval of over-the-counter hearing aids. "It's been decades or more since you've had a president who was this forward leaning," Deese said.
That's true and significant. Even so, it remains unclear whether Biden's policies will lead to a meaningful reduction in corporate concentration.
Collective bargaining. Biden vowed to be the most pro-union president in history. But like other recent Democratic presidents, he failed to pass a bill that would make it easier for workers to join unions. Still, Deese argues that Biden's full-throated support for organized labor has contributed to a renewed understanding of the benefits of unions.
We'll see: Public approval of unions is at a 50-year high, but the share of workers belonging to one declined again last year.
Red tape. Some supporters of Biden's investment program worry that it will prove disappointing because major construction projects are so expensive and bureaucratically fraught in the U.S. (A recent Ezra Klein Show described the problem in detail.) Deese insists that the White House is working on solutions. "We can do things differently," he said.
Related: You can read the transcript of my conversation with Deese. He has been replaced by Lael Brainard, a former Federal Reserve official, while Biden will nominate Jared Bernstein, one of Rouse's deputies, to replace her.

Full text: Employee doubts are rising about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's $ 40 billion investment in an Arizona factory.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest maker of advanced computer chips, is upgrading and expanding a new factory in Arizona that promises to help move the United States toward a more self-reliant technological future.
But to some at the company, the $ 40 billion project is something else: a bad business decision.
Internal doubts are mounting at the Taiwanese chip maker over its U.S. factory, according to interviews with 11 TSMC employees, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Many of the workers said the project could distract from the research and development focus that had long helped TSMC outmaneuver rivals. Some added that they were hesitant to move to the United States because of potential culture clashes.
Their concerns underline TSMC's tricky position. As the biggest maker of chips that power everything from phones to cars to missiles, the company is strategically important with highly coveted technical know-how. But caught in a deepening battle between the United States and China over technological leadership, TSMC has tried to hedge its bets -- only to find that its actions are creating new kinds of tensions.
Its factory expansion in the northern outskirts of Phoenix is meant to bring advanced microchip production closer to the United States and away from any potential standoff with China. Yet the effort has stoked internal apprehension, with high costs and managerial challenges showing how difficult it is to transplant one of the most complicated manufacturing processes known to man halfway across the world.
The pressure for the Arizona factory to succeed is immense. Failure would mean a setback for U.S. efforts to cultivate the advanced chip manufacturing that mostly moved to Asia decades ago. And TSMC would have spent billions on a plant that did not produce enough viable chips to make it worth the effort.
"TSMC's investment in the U.S. from a business perspective makes no sense at all," said Kirk Yang, chairman of the private equity firm Kirkland Capital and a former tech analyst, citing lofty costs. He added that TSMC might have been forced to set up a factory in the United States because of political considerations, but "so far, the Phoenix project has yielded very little benefit for TSMC or Taiwan."
The Arizona project is TSMC's first major concession to rising global concerns in recent years about the geopolitics of chip production, driven partly by fears over China's hostile posture to Taiwan and over a chip shortage.
The chip giant, which has long had almost all its factories in Taiwan, is now also building a facility in Japan. European policymakers have rolled out plans to attract a TSMC factory, and the company is in the final stages of making a decision about that plant, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Nina Kao, a TSMC spokeswoman, did not directly address the internal concerns over the Arizona investment. But in an email, she said the decision on the U.S. factory location had been based on various factors, including customer demand, market opportunity and the chance to tap global talent.
Ms. Kao added that TSMC was strengthening its training to integrate overseas talent into its corporate culture. The company will "actively listen and provide change where needed," she said.
TSMC announced the Arizona factory in May 2020, initially pledging $ 12 billion toward it. In December, the company increased that to $ 40 billion, with plans to upgrade the factory with more advanced -- though not the most advanced -- chip-making technology. The plant is expected to begin producing microchips by 2024, and the company said it would later add a second factory to the site.
The project is challenging. In an earnings call last month, TSMC said the U.S. construction could be at least four times the cost in Taiwan, driven by labor expenses, permits, regulatory compliance and inflation. Wendell Huang, TSMC's chief financial officer, said the American investment could hurt TSMC's profitability this year.
"TSMC recognizes that there is a cost gap between fabs in Taiwan and those overseas," Ms. Kao said, using shorthand for a fabrication plant, or factory. She added that the company still anticipated robust gross margins over the long term.
TSMC also needs suppliers close by to provide the Arizona plant with raw materials, equipment and critical parts. Yet some suppliers that are trying to join it there said they were experiencing labor challenges and high costs.
Calvin Su, the president of Chang Chun Arizona, a chemical supplier that invested in its own $ 300 million factory in Casa Grande, Ariz., about an hour's drive from Phoenix, said its factory construction cost was 10 times the cost in Taiwan. The costs were fueled by an unfamiliarity with U.S. regulations and building permits, as well as an insufficient supply of production materials, he said.
Michael Yang, chairman of the CTCI Corporation, an engineering and construction contractor for the Taiwanese chip giant, said the Arizona factory's construction cost was "far beyond" his client's expectation. On top of rising inflation, the chip maker is competing with Intel -- which is also expanding in Arizona -- for skilled labor and construction equipment, he said.
"When we reported our quotation in the beginning, the client replied: 'Are you insane?' But that's just the way it is," Mr. Yang said.
Some TSMC engineers said they were concerned about how the Arizona factory would blend American and Taiwanese employees. In Taiwan, engineers work long hours and weekend shifts, joking that they "sell liver" to work for the chip manufacturer, they said. Such sacrifices may be less appealing to employees in the United States, they said.
Wayne Chiu, an engineer who left TSMC last year, said he had thought about joining the company's overseas expansion drive but lost interest after realizing he would likely have to pick up the slack for U.S. hires.
"The most difficult thing about wafer manufacturing is not technology," he said. "The most difficult thing is personnel management. Americans are the worst at this, because Americans are the most difficult to manage."
Three TSMC employees who trained American engineers said it was difficult to standardize practices among them. While Taiwanese workers unquestioningly follow what they are told to do, American employees challenged managers, questioning if there might be better methods, they said.
Some Americans struggled when assigned multiple tasks, sometimes rejecting a new assignment instead of working harder to complete everything, one TSMC engineer in Arizona said. Taiwanese workers believe that those who work in Phoenix will shoulder greater responsibilities than their American colleagues, eight employees said.
TSMC's first American investment more than two decades ago has also served as a cautionary tale.
In the late 1990s, Morris Chang, the company's founder, pushed an ambitious overseas expansion plan and created a chip-making subsidiary, WaferTech, in Washington State. Despite pledging to build multiple factories there, Mr. Chang stopped at one after "a series of ugly surprises," including high costs and a shortage of skilled labor, he said in a podcast with the Brookings Institution last year.
Mr. Chang has questioned the U.S. effort to reshape the global semiconductor supply chain, saying at a public forum in 2021 that the advantages in Taiwan underlying TSMC's success could not be replicated in the United States.
In the Brookings Institution podcast, he also argued that the $ 52 billion in U.S. government subsidies earmarked by the CHIPS Act, a federal funding package to stoke domestic production of advanced chips, would not be enough to jump-start the industry. He called it an "expensive exercise in futility."
But at TSMC's announcement of the Phoenix factory expansion in December, Mr. Chang appeared to have come around. This time, he said, the company is "far more prepared."
In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Chang said he stood by his remarks in last year's podcast and at the December event in Arizona. He declined to comment further.

As Revenue Falls, NPR
Will Cut 10% of Staff
NPR will lay off 10 percent of its staff to make up for a $ 30 million gap in its budget, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.
In an email to the staff, John Lansing, the news organization's chief executive, said the public radio network's financial outlook "has darkened considerably over recent weeks."
"At a time when we are doing some of our most ambitious and essential work, the global economy remains uncertain," Mr. Lansing wrote in the email, which was obtained by The New York Times. "As a result, the ad industry has weakened and we are grappling with a sharp decline in our revenues from corporate sponsors."
Mr. Lansing said the budget shortfall this year, once estimated to be $ 20 million, had grown to at least $ 30 million. He said NPR, a nonprofit with a work force of about 1,100 people, had already cut $ 14 million in expenses through eliminating open positions, restricting nonessential travel and suspending internship programs. But those moves, he said, are no longer enough to prevent job cuts.
A spokeswoman for NPR said at least 100 positions would be eliminated in the round of layoffs. KATIE ROBERTSON
REGULATION
F.D.A. Plans to Expand
Its Definition of Milk
Soy, oat, almond and other drinks that bill themselves as "milk" can keep using the name, according to draft federal rules released Wednesday.
Food and Drug Administration officials issued guidance that says plant-based beverages don't pretend to be from dairy animals, and that U.S. consumers aren't confused by the difference.
Dairy producers for years have called for the F.D.A. to crack down on plant-based drinks and other products that they say masquerade as animal-based foods and cloud the real meaning of "milk."
Under the draft rules, the agency recommends that beverage makers label their products clearly by the plant source of the food, such as "soy milk" or "cashew milk."
The rules also call for voluntary extra nutrition labels that note when the drinks have lower levels of nutrients than dairy milk, such as calcium, magnesium or vitamin D. They would continue to allow labels that note when plant-based drinks have higher levels. Fortified soy milk is the only plant-based food included in the dairy category of U.S. dietary guidelines because of its nutrient levels. ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Intel to Slash Dividend
After Posting Big Loss
Intel is slashing its quarterly dividend by 66 percent as the chip maker attempts to rejuvenate sales in a market that where competition is increasing as some corporations and households cut back on tech spending.
After posting a $ 664 million fourth-quarter loss last month and sticking by a pessimistic outlook from January, Intel said Wednesday that trimming its payout to shareholders would provide more flexibility as the company attempts to transform operations during a period of "macroeconomic uncertainty."
Intel Corp. is lowering its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share, a cut of almost two-thirds from the 36.5 cents it has paid since early 2022.
The dividend will be payable on June 1 to shareholders of record on May 7.
The Santa Clara, Calif., company reiterated Wednesday that it expected to post first-quarter revenue of between $ 10.5 billion and $ 11.5 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $ 11.12 billion.
Shares, down 11 percent over the last month, fell slightly to $ 25.90. ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON — In recent weeks, Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, has talked with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, spent time with the president of Arizona State University and appeared at a conference with the mayor of Phoenix.
Their discussions centered on one main topic: chips.
Raimondo is in charge of handing out $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research under the CHIPS Act, a funding package intended to expand domestic production of the foundational technology, which acts as the brains of computers. The legislation, which passed in August, is a prime piece of President Joe Biden’s industrial policy and part of a push to ensure America’s economic and technology leadership over China.
Arizona wants to make sure it is in position for a portion of that once-in-a-generation gusher of federal funding, for which the Commerce Department is expected to begin taking applications within days. As a result, Arizona officials have inundated Raimondo to promote the state’s growing chip industry and talked with the CEOs of giant chip companies such as Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Arizona, which is vying for subsidies along with Texas, New York and Ohio, may have a head start on the action. The state has been home to semiconductor makers since the 1940s and has 115 chip-related companies, whereas there is one major manufacturer in Ohio.
Arizona has also led the nation in chip investments since 2020, with the announcements of two new chipmaking plants by TSMC and two additional factories from Intel that will cost a combined $60 billion. State leaders had helped persuade the companies to open the facilities by offering big tax breaks and water and other infrastructure grants. They also promised to expand technical and engineering education in the state.
State officials and chip companies also acted as a lobbying bloc in Washington. They helped shape the CHIPS Act to include federal tax credits, subsidies, and research and workforce grants. TSMC expanded its lobbying staff to 19 people from two in two years, and Intel spent more than $7 million in lobbying efforts last year, the most it had spent in two decades. Arizona State University spent $502,000 on lobbying last year, also the most in two decades.
“It has been an intentional and an all-hands-on-deck effort,” said Sandra Watson, president of the Arizona Commerce Authority, a nonprofit economic development organization that has helped lead state efforts to attract chip companies and push for the CHIPS Act.
The Commerce Department is expected to soon begin handing out $39 billion in subsidies to semiconductor makers, later opening the process to companies, universities and others to apply for $13.2 billion in research and workforce development subsidies. The CHIPS Act also provides an investment tax credit for up to 25% of a manufacturer’s capital expenditure costs.
Raimondo has described the process as a “race” among states. “Every governor, every state legislature, every president of public universities in every state ought to be now putting their plan of attack together,” she said in August during a visit to Arizona State University’s tech research and development center. “This is going to be a competitive process.”
The Commerce Department declined to comment.
Arizona’s history with chip manufacturing stretches back to 1949, when the telecom hardware and services provider Motorola opened a lab in Phoenix that later developed transistors. In 1980, Intel built a semiconductor plant in Chandler, a suburb southeast of Phoenix, drawn by the state’s low property taxes, relative proximity to its Silicon Valley headquarters and stable geology. (Earthquakes are rare in Arizona.)
During President Donald Trump’s administration, he pushed an “America First” policy agenda. That opened an opportunity for Doug Ducey, a Republican who was then Arizona’s governor, and other state officials to transform their economy into a tech hub.
In 2017, Ducey and other Arizona officials traveled to Taiwan to meet with executives of TSMC, the world’s biggest maker of leading-edge chips. They promoted the state’s low taxes, its business-friendly regulatory environment and Arizona State University’s engineering school of more than 30,000 students.
Ducey, who was close to Trump, also had calls with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on financial incentives to expand domestic production of chips.
“My job is to sell Arizona,” Ducey said. “In this case, it was to sell Arizona to TSMC but also to the administration.”
In 2019, Ducey helped set up calls between the Cabinet secretaries and TSMC’s executives to lock in a deal to open manufacturing plants in Arizona. The state promised tax credits and other financial incentives to help offset costs for the company to move production to the United States from Taiwan.
In May 2020, TSMC announced plans to build a $12 billion factory in Phoenix. Later that year, the city provided TSMC with $200 million in infrastructure incentives, including water lines, sewage and roads. One traffic light would cost the city $500,000.
“TSMC appreciates the support from our dedicated partners on the state, local and federal levels,” said Rick Cassidy, CEO of TSMC Arizona, adding that the CHIPS Act funds will enable the company and its suppliers to expand “for years to come.”
In early 2021, Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s CEO, announced a sweeping strategy to increase U.S. production of chips. States began soliciting the company. Arizona officials highlighted their long relationship with Intel and perks, such as the state’s low property and business taxes.
Intel soon announced a $20 billion expansion in Chandler, with two additional factories that would bring 3,000 new jobs to the state. Chandler also approved $30 million in water and road improvements for the new plants.
“The Arizona government has been a great collaborator,” said Bruce Andrews, Intel’s chief government affairs officer. “By investing in semiconductors early, they created an ecosystem that has had a jobs multiplier effect and massive economic benefits.”
But some of the tax breaks have rankled Arizona residents, who say the moves have hurt funding for public schools. The state ranks 47th in per-student spending.
“We need to bring business to our state, but we need to look at balance,” said Beth Lewis, the executive director of Save Our Schools in Arizona. “Corporations are choosing not to settle in Arizona because of our devastated public education system.”
Arizona pressed ahead with pushing Congress to create legislation for chip subsidies. In March 2021, Kelly joined Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Mark Warner, D-Va., the authors of legislation that would become the CHIPS Act, in a call with the new Biden administration to push for the White House’s support of funding.
Kelly, an early sponsor of the CHIPS Act, became a chief negotiator on the legislation in Congress. He negotiated the inclusion of a four-year 25% investment tax credit in the bill, including a provision that ensured Intel and TSMC would get the tax credits even though their Arizona factory projects were announced before the bill would go into effect.
Kelly also helped the president of Arizona State University, Michael Crow, lobby for the inclusion of more than $13 billion in grants for research and development and workforce training. And Kelly and state leaders hosted administration officials at events to showcase the state’s semiconductor efforts as part of the White House’s manufacturing strategy.
“We have the potential to lead the nation in microchip production,” Kelly said in a statement. “I was honored to lead this effort, and now I’m working to maximize it for Arizona.”
Ducey, who left office when his term ended in January, pushed for more tech-friendly policies, including an income-tax cut. He also said he would use $100 million that the state had received from federal COVID grants to attract more chip companies and help them apply for funds provided by the CHIPS Act.
In December, TSMC announced a second factory that would bring its total investment in Arizona to $40 billion. Biden and Raimondo traveled to Phoenix to speak at the announcement, with Kelly accompanying them on Air Force One.
Arizona officials continue to pitch semiconductor companies to open factories in the state.
This month, Watson hosted more than 20 chief executives of chip companies at the Super Bowl in Glendale. Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s new governor and a Democrat, and Kelly heralded how the state could benefit from the CHIPS Act.
“There’s a robust pipeline,” Watson said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest maker of advanced computer chips, is upgrading and expanding a new factory in Arizona that promises to help move the United States toward a more self-reliant technological future.
But to some at the company, the $40 billion project is something else: a bad business decision.
Internal doubts are mounting at the Taiwanese chipmaker over its U.S. factory, according to interviews with 11 TSMC employees, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Many of the workers said the project could distract from the research and development focus that had long helped TSMC outmaneuver rivals. Some added that they were hesitant to move to the United States because of potential culture clashes.
Their concerns underline TSMC’s tricky position. As the biggest maker of chips that power everything from phones to cars to missiles, the company is strategically important with highly coveted technical know-how. But caught in a deepening battle between the United States and China over technological leadership, TSMC has tried to hedge its bets — only to find that its actions are creating new kinds of tensions.
Its factory expansion in the northern outskirts of Phoenix is meant to bring advanced microchip production closer to the United States and away from any potential standoff with China. Yet the effort has stoked internal apprehension, with high costs and managerial challenges showing how difficult it is to transplant one of the most complicated manufacturing processes halfway across the world.
The pressure for the Arizona factory to succeed is immense. Failure would mean a setback for U.S. efforts to cultivate the advanced chip manufacturing that mostly moved to Asia decades ago. And TSMC would have spent billions on a plant that did not produce enough viable chips to make it worth the effort.
“TSMC’s investment in the U.S. from a business perspective makes no sense at all,” said Kirk Yang, chair of the private equity firm Kirkland Capital and a former tech analyst, citing lofty costs. He added that TSMC might have been forced to set up a factory in the United States because of political considerations, but “so far, the Phoenix project has yielded very little benefit for TSMC or Taiwan.”
The Arizona project is TSMC’s first major concession to rising global concerns in recent years about the geopolitics of chip production, driven partly by fears over China’s hostile posture to Taiwan and over a chip shortage.
The chip giant, which has long had almost all its factories in Taiwan, is now also building a facility in Japan. European policymakers have rolled out plans to attract a TSMC factory, and the company is in the final stages of making a decision about that plant, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Nina Kao, a TSMC spokesperson, did not directly address the internal concerns over the Arizona investment. But in an email, she said the decision on the U.S. factory location had been based on various factors, including customer demand, market opportunity and the chance to tap global talent.
Kao added that TSMC was strengthening its training to integrate overseas talent into its corporate culture. The company will “actively listen and provide change where needed,” she said.
TSMC announced the Arizona factory in May 2020, initially pledging $12 billion toward it. In December, the company increased that to $40 billion, with plans to upgrade the factory with more advanced — though not the most advanced — chipmaking technology. The plant is expected to begin producing microchips by 2024, and the company said it would later add a second factory to the site.
The project is challenging. In an earnings call last month, TSMC said the U.S. construction could be at least four times the cost in Taiwan, driven by labor expenses, permits, regulatory compliance and inflation. Wendell Huang, TSMC’s chief financial officer, said the U.S. investment could hurt TSMC’s profitability this year.
“TSMC recognizes that there is a cost gap between fabs in Taiwan and those overseas,” Kao said, using shorthand for a fabrication plant, or factory. She added that the company still anticipated robust gross margins over the long term.
TSMC also needs suppliers close by to provide the Arizona plant with raw materials, equipment and critical parts. Yet some suppliers that are trying to join it there said they were experiencing labor challenges and high costs.
Calvin Su, the president of Chang Chun Arizona, a chemical supplier that invested in its own $300 million factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, about an hour’s drive from Phoenix, said its factory construction cost was 10 times the cost in Taiwan. The costs were fueled by an unfamiliarity with U.S. regulations and building permits, as well as an insufficient supply of production materials, he said.
Michael Yang, chair of the CTCI Corp., an engineering and construction contractor for the Taiwanese chip giant, said the Arizona factory’s construction cost was “far beyond” his client’s expectation. On top of rising inflation, the chipmaker is competing with Intel — which is also expanding in Arizona — for skilled labor and construction equipment, he said.
“When we reported our quotation in the beginning, the client replied, ‘Are you insane?’ But that’s just the way it is,” Yang said.
Some TSMC engineers said they were concerned about how the Arizona factory would blend American and Taiwanese employees. In Taiwan, engineers work long hours and weekend shifts, joking that they “sell liver” to work for the chip manufacturer, they said. Such sacrifices may be less appealing to employees in the United States, they said.
Wayne Chiu, an engineer who left TSMC last year, said he had thought about joining the company’s overseas expansion drive but lost interest after realizing he would likely have to pick up the slack for U.S. hires.
“The most difficult thing about wafer manufacturing is not technology,” he said. “The most difficult thing is personnel management. Americans are the worst at this, because Americans are the most difficult to manage.”
Three TSMC employees who trained American engineers said it was difficult to standardize practices among them. While Taiwanese workers unquestioningly follow what they are told to do, American employees challenged managers, questioning if there might be better methods, they said.
Some Americans struggled when assigned multiple tasks, sometimes rejecting a new assignment instead of working harder to complete everything, one TSMC engineer in Arizona said. Taiwanese workers believe that those who work in Phoenix will shoulder greater responsibilities than their American colleagues, eight employees said.
TSMC’s first U.S. investment more than two decades ago has also served as a cautionary tale.
In the late 1990s, Morris Chang, the company’s founder, pushed an ambitious overseas expansion plan and created a chipmaking subsidiary, WaferTech, in Washington state. Despite pledging to build multiple factories there, Chang stopped at one after “a series of ugly surprises,” including high costs and a shortage of skilled labor, he said in a podcast with the Brookings Institution last year.
Chang has questioned the U.S. effort to reshape the global semiconductor supply chain, saying at a public forum in 2021 that the advantages in Taiwan underlying TSMC’s success could not be replicated in the United States.
In the Brookings Institution podcast, he also argued that the $52 billion in U.S. government subsidies earmarked by the CHIPS Act, a federal funding package to stoke domestic production of advanced chips, would not be enough to jump-start the industry. He called it an “expensive exercise in futility.”
But at TSMC’s announcement of the Phoenix factory expansion in December, Chang appeared to have come around. This time, he said, the company is “far more prepared.”
In an email to The New York Times, Chang said he stood by his remarks in last year’s podcast and at the December event in Arizona. He declined to comment further. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Democrats Hope Big-Ticket Bills Will Bolster Their Labor Support: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. -- In the mid-1970s, when Mark Raddish wasn't more than 11 years old, his coal-mining grandfather picked him up from a mining camp and took him a thousand feet underground, to the cold darkness beneath West Virginia. There, he imparted a lesson.
"You don't want to make this your livelihood," warned his grandfather, a union miner, Mr. Raddish recalled. "These guys don't know if they're going to come home at night to see their mom or dad, to see their brothers and sisters or their little boy or girl."
He did as he was told, getting an education and landing a pipe fitters' union job for Mylan Pharmaceuticals. When that job was sent overseas, he took a leap of faith late last year and signed on as West Virginia Employee No. 2 for Sparkz, a California-based electric vehicle battery start-up. The company was enticed here, in the wooded hills outside Bridgeport, W.Va., in part by generous federal tax subsidies and in part by the United Mine Workers of America, which is recruiting out-of-work coal miners for the company's new plant in a faded industrial park.
It is no accident that this plant, rising in place of a shuttered plate-glass factory, is bringing yet another alternative-energy company to rural West Virginia. Federal money is pouring into the growing industry, with thick strings attached to reward companies that pay union wages, employ union apprentices and buy American steel, iron and components.
President Biden and the Democrats who pushed those provisions are hoping that more union members will bring more political strength for unions after decades of decline. White working-class voters, even union members, have sided with Republicans on social issues, and still tend to see the G.O.P. as their economic ally, as well.
But Republicans in Congress -- especially in the leadership and tax-writing committees -- have for years resisted Democrats' pro-union efforts, including writing legislation into the tax code and enacting broad policy measures. Republicans have argued that such measures were wasteful, inefficient and would bog down federal projects, in addition to cutting into companies' profits and adding to inflation.
"What I worry about is how fiscally irresponsible the federal government is going to have to be," said Rusty Brown, a former official in the Trump administration's Labor Department.
The Democrats finally broke the Republican blockade, in part because the rising threat of China softened Republican resistance to domestic work and supply requirements, in part because Democrats wrote the most stringent requirement themselves, and passed the pro-labor incentives through Congress with rules that overcame a Republican filibuster.
"For the first time in a long time, we're building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out," Mr. Biden declared on Wednesday at the Wisconsin Laborers' training center north of Madison, "with products made in America and with union labor."
Money is just starting to flow from the last Congress's three huge legislative victories -- a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for clean energy to combat climate change.
Tucked into all of those laws were measures to give unions the power to effectively tell employers: You must pay union-scale wages and use union apprenticeship and training programs, so you might as well hire union workers.
"I think it's a renaissance for the labor movement, especially for the building trades, to take this upswing and open our eyes," said Mike Knisley, executive secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.
This month, the most powerful incentives went into force: tax credits for clean energy and energy efficiency projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. The tax credits increase in value fivefold if federal contractors pay "prevailing wages," or wage rates generally set by unions; use "qualified" apprenticeship programs that are usually run by unions; and buy steel, iron and manufactured components that are made in the United States. Contractors that claim the credits but fail to abide by the rules face stiff fines and penalties.
The scale of those incentives was intentional: Democrats who wrote the Inflation Reduction Act made them so generous that Senate tax aides said it would be considered "fiduciary malfeasance" not to take advantage of them.
For companies like Sparkz, a 30 percent tax credit to offset the cost of investments in clean energy jumps to 40 percent if the investment lands in areas with retired coal mines or fossil-fuel power plants. Form Energy, which manufactures batteries to store power generated by alternative sources like wind and solar using iron instead of more difficult-to-find minerals, is building a plant in Weirton, W.Va, an old steel town.
If you build a clean-energy power plant on the site of a retired dirty-energy plant, you can take even more off the price of the investment.
"This is clearly saying, 'Thou shalt create jobs,"' said Sanjiv Malhotra, the chief executive of Sparkz.
Beyond the inflation act, Democrats, with help from a few Republicans, were able to add prevailing wage requirements to the semiconductor bill. And both the Energy and Transportation Departments are making clear that access to unions, payment of prevailing wages and commitments to local hiring will be big advantages for competitive bidders seeking infrastructure and highway electrification projects, though Republican governors like Joe Lombardo in Nevada are trying to block some of those requirements.
For union leaders, the federal legislation could prove to be a spectacular gift, if they can meet the demand for union workers and persuade those workers to reward the politicians who provided their jobs.
But that is a big "if." Asked whether Mr. Biden or the man instrumental in many of the tax subsidies, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, were receiving credit in an overwhelmingly Republican state, Sparkz's first two employees in the state, Mr. Raddish and Mitchell Williams, 24, shrugged.
"That's all hush-hush," Mr. Raddish said. "I don't know."
For the unions, the trajectory seems clear. Between the construction of semiconductor plants, the building of electric-vehicle charging stations and the expansion of broadband internet, leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers foresee more work than union members for at least the next decade. That means they have to step up organizing.
"We are absolutely bringing more workers into the union," said Bill Hamilton, business manager of the I.B.E.W. local that is staffing an enormous Intel semiconductor plant under construction outside Columbus, Ohio.
The leadership of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 81 in Syracuse, N.Y., is scrambling to bring in thousands of new members to satisfy the project labor agreement governing Micron's expansive chip plant under construction north of the city. Mr. Biden highlighted such accords last week as he talked up infrastructure projects in Baltimore, New York and New Jersey. He also promoted them on Wednesday in Wisconsin, where he hailed projects in Green Bay and Columbia County.
"People don't realize how much is in the pipeline right now," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is tracking the Biden administration's industrial policies. "There's a fundamental delivery challenge, but it could become a tremendous opportunity for unions."
Mr. Brown, who is now with the anti-union Freedom Foundation, noted that private-sector unions were at a low ebb, representing only about 10 percent of the private work force.
"When you're writing laws that pretty much require companies to use labor unions, that means you're discriminating against 90 percent of the population," he said.
But union leaders say they are intent on strengthening labor's power -- and rewarding its allies. Mr. Hamilton said the I.B.E.W. was including education on the labor movement and an explicit section tying politics to job creation in its revamped training programs.
"We want to get 80 percent of our membership into that education program before the next presidential election," he said.
Construction unions are targeting veterans, women and workers of color to bring into the movement.
"It goes hand in hand with what we see is going to be a big increase in our work force," said Mark Douglas, the president of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council. "We have to make sure they're educated as to how these things work, and we're very pleased with everything that's happened from Washington with the Biden administration."
That could be good news for endangered Democrats up for re-election in 2024. They include Mr. Manchin, who won tax incentives to locate plants near abandoned coal mines and closed coal-fired power plants, as well as Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who secured union-scale wage requirements in the semiconductor bill.
Not all of the new money will favor organized labor. Joseph W. Kane, another Brookings researcher, said more than three-quarters of the $ 864 billion for roads, bridges and other projects would go to state and local governments through old spending formulas with no special strings attached.
"There's a lot of D.C. happy talk where you have people seeing transformational, once-in-a-generation spending," Mr. Kane said. "The reality on the ground is very different."

G.M. Strikes a Deal for Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: GlobalFoundries will dedicate part of its semiconductor output to G.M. as the automaker offers more electric vehicles and driver-assistance systems.
General Motors has reached an agreement with a large computer chip maker to help ensure it has a steady supply of semiconductors as it ramps up production of electric vehicles and complex components that require increases in computing power.
Under the agreement, the chip maker, GlobalFoundries, agreed to set aside a portion of its manufacturing capacity exclusively to make chips for G.M.
The automaker plans to introduce more than two dozen electric vehicles around the world over the next two years. Large numbers of chips are used in internal-combustion vehicles as well.
General Motors is increasing the number of vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems that use cameras, radar and other sensors to allow hands-free driving under certain conditions.
Doug Parks, G.M.'s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, said in a statement that the company expected its need for computer chips to double over the next several years.
"The supply agreement with GlobalFoundries will help establish a strong, resilient supply of critical technology in the U.S. that will help G.M. meet this demand, while delivering new technology and features to our customers," he added.
The companies did not disclose the financial terms of their agreement.
G.M. has been working to reduce the varieties of chips it uses, and to cut the number of chips needed in each vehicle. The automaker hopes to develop single chips that can handle computation that is done by multiple chips today. Its long-term goal is to use only three classes of chips.
Several chip makers are building plants and expanding production in the United States with the help of funding from the CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law last year.
Intel has announced plans to invest $ 20 billion to build two plants in Ohio, and Micron Technology says it will spend up to $ 100 billion on semiconductor manufacturing near Syracuse, N.Y. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expanding its operations in Phoenix, at a cost of some $ 40 billion.
Based in Malta, N.Y., north of Albany, GlobalFoundries operates chip factories formerly owned by IBM, and is hoping to secure funding to support its expansion plans. In November, its chief executive, Thomas Caulfield, said GlobalFoundries wanted to increase output at a plant near Malta and another in Burlington, Vt., and to build a new production area at an existing plant in Malta.
He said the company aimed to submit its proposal to Washington early this year.
Automakers have been struggling with a computer chip shortage for the last two years and at times have had to idle plants while waiting for new supplies. In 2021, Ford Motor reached an agreement with GlobalFoundries to collaborate on designing chips to help improve its supplies.
Analysts, however, say tight supplies will linger because automobiles use relatively simple chips and semiconductor manufacturers are investing more heavily in expanding production of advanced chips that generate more profit for them. It also takes about three years to build a new chip factory and bring it into production.
Automakers are likely to struggle to build sufficient inventories of chips if E.V. sales take off, according to a recent report by Bank of America Global Research. "Shortages persist in key areas," the bank said.

U.S. Is Aiming to Curtail Tech Investments in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration is preparing new rules that would restrict U.S. dollars from flowing to China.
WASHINGTON -- Growing concerns about China's military and economic ambitions have lawmakers and the White House weighing yet another effort to restrict Beijing's access to advanced technologies that could be used in war.
This time, the U.S. government appears poised to extend its restrictions to a new area: American dollars that are used to finance the development of such technologies within Chinese borders.
For months, the Biden administration has been preparing curbs on the investments that U.S. firms can make in China, particularly in areas like advanced computing.
Those measures are now largely complete and could be issued within two months. The Treasury Department has been reaching out to other governments, including the European Union, to try to ensure that they do not rush in to provide similar financing to China after the United States cuts it off, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The voyage of a spy balloon across the United States has set off newfound fears about the national security threats posed by the Chinese government. This week, lawmakers on both sides warned the White House that if the administration did not move ahead with investment restrictions, Congress would propose its own.
At a hearing on Tuesday aimed at publicizing the security threat from China, Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, Republican of Missouri, said it was the "committee's job to examine all interconnections between the Chinese and U.S. economy, specifically connections supporting China's military and human rights abuses, and pursue options to eliminate U.S. capital flowing into those areas."
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said the United States needed to make sure that "hedge funds, private equity firms and Wall Street are not investing in ways that hurt our economy or funding the adversarial actions of the Chinese government."
Members of the Biden administration spent much of last year weighing how broadly to apply investment restrictions, with officials reaching out to business executives to get their views on the impact that such a move might have.
Details of the pending executive order remain unclear, but it is expected to require companies to report more information to the government about their planned investments in certain adversarial countries. Several people familiar with the plans said the order would most likely prohibit outright investments in some sensitive areas, like quantum computing, advanced semiconductors and certain artificial intelligence capabilities with military or surveillance applications.
U.S. officials have also increasingly been concerned about China's use of biotechnology, but several people said the administration had decided to exclude the sector, at least initially.
Supporters of investment restrictions say they would help fill in a significant hole in the economic barriers that the United States is setting up with China. The government already prohibits U.S. companies from directly selling certain advanced technologies to China, and it has long monitored the investments that Chinese companies make in the United States for potential security risks.
But the government has little control over or insight into money traveling from the United States to China, said Claire Chu, a senior China analyst at Janes, a defense intelligence firm. Support has been building for the government to take more oversight of these kinds of deals, she said.
"It's not so much a matter of whether this will happen as when," Ms. Chu said.
Some of the proposals have prompted resistance from industry groups, which argued that overly broad restrictions could overwhelm government officials in charge of oversight, creating big delays, and ricochet back on the U.S. economy, harming its competitiveness.
A broader proposal in Congress last year to review outbound investments in critical sectors including infrastructure and medicine prompted pushback from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council.
"Industry is kind of united: We don't want this," said Antonia Tzinova, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who specializes in national security reviews of investments into the United States.
The Biden administration's plan appears to be much more narrowly targeted at a few sensitive sectors. But some industry representatives remain concerned that measures that apply only to U.S. firms, and not their foreign competitors, could put American businesses at a disadvantage.
Others say that China has access to plenty of other sources of funding worldwide, and that cutting off access would prevent U.S. companies from benefiting from Chinese innovations.
"Getting the details right on outbound investment screening is easier said than done," said Rory Murphy, the vice president of government affairs for the U.S.-China Business Council. "These are technical and complicated sectors, and the details are critical."
He added that his group wanted to "help policymakers thread the needle of achieving their national security objectives while not going too broad and putting U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage."
Investment firms including Blackstone, KKR, Sequoia, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, Silver Lake, General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus all have notable exposure to China. According to tracking by Rhodium Group, a research firm with a focus on China, U.S. investors have been carrying out about 3,000 transactions per year in China, including both foreign direct investment and venture capital deals, with about 500 of those valued at more than $ 1 million.
Bill Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, an investment firm, has expressed his views about possible regulation directly with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a person familiar with the matter said.
General Atlantic says it has invested nearly $ 7 billion in China since 2000 with more than 34 portfolio companies in the country. One of its highest-profile investments there, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has found itself in the cross hairs of the debate over how to manage U.S.-Chinese financial ties.
Depending on how it is put into effect, this new tool could fundamentally alter the country's financial relationship with China, one of America's largest trading partners but also a primary geopolitical rival.
U.S. companies spent about $ 11 billion in 2022 buying or investing in Chinese companies, according to the data service firm Dealogic. While that is a small slice of the more than $ 1.5 trillion that U.S. companies invested globally that year, China deals are still considered valuable because they may provide venture firms access to innovation and, possibly, their next big win.
Venture firms, which seed earlier-stage companies, have been particularly active in the region. According to data compiled by Pitchbook, for example, the investment firm GGV Capital did 105 deals from 2021 to 2022; GSR Ventures did 95. Other notable names on the list include Tiger Global Management, which did 27 deals in the same period. Intel's venture capital firm did 17 deals in the same period, while Qualcomm's venture arm did 16.
Until very recently, the U.S. government's role was to try to expand financial ties with China. For example, greater access for American financial services firms was one major part of the trade deal that President Donald J. Trump reached with Chinese officials in 2020.
At a White House ceremony where he signed the deal into law, Mr. Trump name-checked executives from Citadel, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, some of whom had become unofficial back channels with the Chinese government during negotiations for a trade pact that could prove lucrative to their businesses.
"Steve, I know you have no interest in this deal at all," Mr. Trump said sarcastically to Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone Group, who was seated in the audience at the White House. "I'm surprised you're not actually sitting over here on the ledge of the stage."
Since that trade deal was signed, U.S. attitudes toward China have turned even more negative and suspicious. The Chinese government has embraced a system of techno-authoritarianism that has used U.S. technologies to surveil dissidents in China and abroad. It has also become clear that some private Chinese tech firms have fed into Beijing's efforts to develop military technologies, like hypersonic missiles.
The Biden administration has steadily placed more restrictions on selling advanced technology to China, expanding the initial restrictions that Mr. Trump issued against Chinese firms like Huawei.
It remains to be seen whether the administration's planned restrictions will mollify lawmakers who are calling for tough restrictions, or prompt Congress to propose more draconian measures.
Lawmakers previously considered imposing broader restrictions as part of a bill aimed at building up American semiconductor manufacturing that passed last year. But those measures were stripped out of the final legislation, partly because of how expansive they were.
In September, a group of top lawmakers sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to take action to review investments in adversarial countries like China.
In a government spending bill that President Biden signed late last year, Congress included $ 20 million for the Commerce and Treasury Departments to begin to set up teams to review such investments. It also instructed them to submit a joint report by later this month describing the potential program and the resources it would need.

Biden Aims Pitch at White Voters Without Degrees: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his State of the Union address, the president signaled the opening of a yearslong push to persuade white working-class voters to return to the Democratic fold. Winning them over on cultural issues may be more difficult.
With his call for a "blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America," President Biden on Tuesday night acknowledged rhetorically what Democrats have been preparing for two years: a fierce campaign to win back white working-class voters through the creation of hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs that do not require a college degree.
Mr. Biden's economically focused State of the Union address may have avoided the cultural appeals to the white working class that former President Donald J. Trump harnessed so effectively, the grievances encapsulated by fears of immigration, racial and gender diversity, and the sloganeering of the intellectual left. But at the speech's heart was an appeal to Congress to "finish the job" and a simple challenge. "Let's offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not," he said.
In truth, much of that path was already laid by the last Congress with the signing of a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for low-emission energy to combat climate change.
Whether or not Mr. Biden can persuade a divided Congress to act on his remaining plans, the money from those laws has just begun to flow, and a surge of hiring is coming. Many of those jobs will be in the industrial battlegrounds that Democrats either took back from Mr. Trump in 2020 or will need in 2024, when endangered senators like Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin face re-election.
But Democrats will have to match those jobs against Republican appeals aimed at white grievances.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, ordered state agencies and universities this week to stop considering racial and ethnic diversity in hiring. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is waging a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while funding the shipping of migrants from the Mexican border to Democratic cities. The Republican-led House is holding hearings blaming illegal immigrants for the smuggling of fentanyl that is ravaging blue-collar cities and towns, though most of the arrests in the fentanyl trade have involved American smugglers.
Republicans openly mocked Mr. Biden's "Finish the Job" slogan, and among working-class voters, they have public opinion on their side. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, just 36 percent of Americans without a college degree approved of Mr. Biden's job performance, compared with 53 percent of college graduates. His approval on economic issues was even worse, with just 31 percent of voters without a degree approving of his handling of the economy.
"Finish the job? On what? Fueling inflation? Opening the border? Lowering wages? Emptying our energy reserves?" asked Tommy Pigott, the rapid response coordinator at the Republican National Committee.
Without doubt, Democrats have their work cut out for them. About two-thirds of eligible voters do not have four-year college degrees, and over the last decade, Democrats have lost ground with them, especially with less educated white voters. In 2020, Mr. Biden won 61 percent of college graduates, but only 45 percent of voters without a four-year college degree -- and just 33 percent of white voters without a four-year degree.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll in September, 59 percent of white working-class voters said Republicans were the party of the working class, compared with 28 percent who chose Democrats. Sixty-eight percent of these voters said they agreed more with Republicans than Democrats on the economy, while just 25 percent picked Democrats. Beyond economics, white working-class voters sided overwhelmingly with Republicans on building a border wall, opposing gun control, stopping illegal immigration and seeing gender as immutable and determined at birth.
Democrats, caught between those sentiments on social policy and the party's core constituencies of people of color, women and the college-educated, are hoping that tangible improvements in well-being can persuade white voters without a college education to focus on their economic interests.
"Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because choices we made in the last two years," Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. "This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives."
Democratic problems with the working class are not limited to white voters. Some blue-collar Black, Latino and Asian American voters have drifted toward Republicans, and Mr. Biden rolled out a range of economic appeals aimed broadly at people who are more sensitive to high prices.
He highlighted his efforts to lower insulin costs and cited pocketbook issues recognizable to almost any consumer -- what he called "junk fees." He identified "exorbitant" bank overdraft charges; credit card late fees; "resort fees" charged by hotels; change-of-service fees by cable and internet providers; and airline "surcharges."
"Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in," Mr. Biden said. "They add up to hundreds of dollars a month."
Other Democrats are taking a similar approach. On his first full day in office, Pennsylvania's new Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, signed an executive order declaring that thousands of state jobs would no longer require a four-year college degree.
And it might work. The Pew Research Center found recently that 71 percent of voters with no degree beyond a high school diploma said the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year, higher than any other issue.
To that end, Mr. Biden spoke of "a literal field of dreams" outside Columbus, Ohio, where a huge new Intel semiconductor plant is being built that will, he said, "create 10,000 jobs," including "7,000 construction jobs" and "3,000 jobs once the factories are finished." Already, unions in Ohio are ramping up training and apprenticeship programs that are explicitly favored by the federal semiconductor legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, and reaching out to women, teenagers, veterans and other workers who have traditionally been outside the organized labor movement to prepare for the semiconductor work.
"To the extent that manufacturing is characteristic of a lot of places that will become competitors for CHIPS investment, there's implicit orientation toward significant union history," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "There are going to be significant numbers of noncollege jobs and a real opportunity for the economic inclusion of noncollege workers."
For Ohio, that Intel plant is only the beginning. Spurred by large tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Honda has announced a reworking of its Ohio plants to build electric vehicles and batteries. General Motors is retooling its plant in Toledo for electric vehicle production, and Arizona-based First Solar is dumping money into northern Ohio. In December, workers at a new E.V. battery plant outside Youngstown voted overwhelmingly to join the United Auto Workers, giving the unions a toehold in the rapidly growing battery industry.
The rebuilding of the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky to Ohio with money from the infrastructure law will employ construction workers in Cincinnati for six to 10 years. And explicit language in the federal laws mandates the payment of union-scale wages, the employment of union-trained apprentices and the purchase of American-made materials.
"We just can go on and on, but it's real, what the president has done," said Mike Knisley, executive secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, who was at the White House for the signing of the semiconductor bill. "Everybody's talked about it, Democrats and Republicans alike, but Biden delivered."
Beyond the Midwest, the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 81 in Syracuse, N.Y., is scrambling to bring in thousands of new members to work at Micron's chip plant under construction in upstate New York. Last week, Mr. Biden promoted major infrastructure projects in Baltimore, New York and New Jersey that will create tens of thousands of jobs, "every freaking one, union labor."
None of this guarantees that rank-and-file union workers -- or the 90 percent of privately employed workers who are not in a union -- will shift back to the Democrats. Mr. Biden's approval rating remains mired in the low 40s, and confidence in the economy is abysmal.
Even union workers seem to maintain skepticism. Josh Abernathy, the business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Eight in Toledo, complained bitterly that while his members had been used to build a First Solar panel fabrication plant outside the city, the contractor on the project had brought in workers from Croatia and other Eastern European countries to install and maintain the fabrication equipment, work that ultimately outpaced construction jobs.
Mr. Abernathy filed a formal protest with the Biden administration's Labor Department, saying that imported workers -- the kind of nonlocal hires the administration had vowed to stop -- were making $ 500 every two weeks and room and board.
"We had 150 electricians out there; don't get me wrong," he said. "But then we were equally matched with the installation of conveyor work when we were long gone."
Rusty Brown, who was an official with the Trump administration's Labor Department and is now with the anti-union Freedom Foundation, said the explicit requirement that federally funded infrastructure, semiconductor and clean energy projects pay union-scale wages would mean the wasting of taxpayer money.
"This is not at all the way a normal person would run a business," he said. "If somebody was mowing your lawn for $ 50 and someone else said he'd do it for $ 40, you'd do it. You just would."
But he acknowledged the power of provisions in federal legislation to mandate the employment of workers trained through "registered" apprenticeship programs -- more than half of which are run through the unions.
The Trump administration tried to encourage private industry to develop its own apprenticeship programs for workers without college degrees through regulation and exhortation but got nowhere, Mr. Brown said.
"It's something I wish companies would have taken more seriously," he said with a sigh.

For a President Who Spends His Days Confronting Russia and China, a Domestic Focus

WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address a year ago, war had broken out in Europe just days before and it appeared inevitable that Vladimir Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America’s “pacing” challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.
On Tuesday night Biden faced a changed world.
Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.
So it was especially striking that in the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America’s global role, focusing instead on his “Made in America” effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America’s closest allies and top trade partners.
History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Biden’s most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.
But it made all the more vivid Biden’s choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America’s re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.
Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.
Since the summer, Biden’s intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks — threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.
Now, Biden’s national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the COVID-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.
As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Biden was “weak” for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a “clear overreaction” and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.
These are the issues that dominate Biden’s days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.
And yet Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly Tuesday night — far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.
Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $52 billion to jump-start chip production. “We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” he said.
To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.
“The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses,” Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” said to the Marketplace radio program.
Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Biden also tried to make the case Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country — to show that “democracy works” and can outpace autocracies — he has begun to show progress. “In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,’’ he said. “Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.”
It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. “Before I came to office the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world,” he said. “Not anymore.” He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.
That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia’s aggression. “Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf War has a president pulled together this kind of alliance,” said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. “It has required a retooling of American foreign policy.”
After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.
But as Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Biden’s advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs influences voters in ways that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.

But Democrats will have to match those jobs against Republican appeals aimed at white grievances.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, ordered state agencies and universities this week to stop considering racial and ethnic diversity in hiring. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is waging a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while funding the shipping of migrants from the Mexican border to Democratic cities. The Republican-led House is holding hearings blaming immigrants lacking permanent legal status for the smuggling of fentanyl that is ravaging blue-collar cities and towns, though most of the arrests in the fentanyl trade have involved American smugglers.
Republicans openly mocked Biden’s “Finish the Job” slogan, and among working-class voters, they have public opinion with them.

Sixty-eight percent of these voters said they agreed more with Republicans than Democrats on the economy, while just 25% picked Democrats. Beyond economics, white working-class voters sided overwhelmingly with Republicans on building a border wall, opposing gun control, stopping illegal immigration and seeing gender as immutable and determined at birth.
Democrats, caught between those sentiments on social policy and the party’s core constituencies of people of color, women and the college-educated, are hoping that tangible improvements in well-being can persuade white voters without a college education to focus on their economic interests.
“Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years,” Biden said Tuesday. “This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”
Democratic problems with the working class are not limited to white voters. Some blue-collar Black, Latino and Asian American voters have drifted toward Republicans, and Biden rolled out a range of economic appeals aimed broadly at people who are more sensitive to high prices.
He highlighted his efforts to lower insulin costs and cited pocketbook issues recognizable to almost any consumer — what he called “junk fees.” He identified “exorbitant” bank overdraft charges; credit card late fees; “resort fees” charged by hotels; change-of-service fees by cable and internet providers; and airline “surcharges.”
“Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in,” Biden said. “They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.”
Other Democrats are taking a similar approach. On his first full day in office, Pennsylvania’s new Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, signed an executive order declaring that thousands of state jobs would no longer require a four-year college degree.
And it might work. The Pew Research Center found recently that 71% of voters with no degree beyond a high school diploma said the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year, higher than any other issue.
To that end, Biden spoke of “a literal field of dreams” outside Columbus, Ohio, where a huge new Intel semiconductor plant is being built that will, he said, “create 10,000 jobs,” including “7,000 construction jobs” and “3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.” Already, unions in Ohio are ramping up training and apprenticeship programs that are explicitly favored by the federal semiconductor legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, and reaching out to women, teenagers, veterans and other workers who have traditionally been outside the organized labor movement to prepare for the semiconductor work.
“To the extent that manufacturing is characteristic of a lot of places that will become competitors for CHIPS investment, there’s implicit orientation toward significant union history,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “There are going to be significant numbers of noncollege jobs and a real opportunity for the economic inclusion of noncollege workers.”
For Ohio, that Intel plant is only the beginning. Spurred by large tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Honda has announced a reworking of its Ohio plants to build electric vehicles and batteries. General Motors is retooling its plant in Toledo for electric vehicle production, and Arizona-based First Solar is dumping money into northern Ohio. In December, workers at a new EV battery plant outside Youngstown voted overwhelmingly to join the United Auto Workers, giving the unions a toehold in the rapidly growing battery industry.
The rebuilding of the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky to Ohio with money from the infrastructure law will employ construction workers in Cincinnati for six to 10 years. And explicit language in the federal laws mandates the payment of union-scale wages, the employment of union-trained apprentices and the purchase of U.S.-made materials.
“We just can go on and on, but it’s real, what the president has done,” said Mike Knisley, executive secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, who was at the White House for the signing of the semiconductor bill. “Everybody’s talked about it, Democrats and Republicans alike, but Biden delivered.”
Beyond the Midwest, the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 81 in Syracuse, New York, is scrambling to bring in thousands of new members to work at Micron’s chip plant under construction in upstate New York. Last week, Biden promoted major infrastructure projects in Baltimore, New York and New Jersey that will create tens of thousands of jobs, “every freaking one, union labor.”
None of this guarantees that rank-and-file union workers — or the 90% of privately employed workers who are not in a union — will shift back to the Democrats. Biden’s approval rating remains mired in the low 40s, and confidence in the economy is abysmal.
Even union workers seem to maintain skepticism. Josh Abernathy, the business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Eight in Toledo, complained bitterly that while his members had been used to build a First Solar panel fabrication plant outside the city, the contractor on the project had brought in workers from Croatia and other Eastern European countries to install and maintain the fabrication equipment, work that ultimately outpaced construction jobs.
Abernathy filed a formal protest with the Biden administration’s Department of Labor, saying that imported workers — the kind of nonlocal hires the administration had vowed to stop — were making $500 every two weeks and room and board.
“We had 150 electricians out there; don’t get me wrong,” he said. “But then we were equally matched with the installation of conveyor work when we were long gone.”
Rusty Brown, who was an official with the Trump administration’s Labor Department and is now with the anti-union Freedom Foundation, said the explicit requirement that federally funded infrastructure, semiconductor and clean energy projects pay union-scale wages would mean the wasting of taxpayer money.
“This is not at all the way a normal person would run a business,” he said. “If somebody was mowing your lawn for $50 and someone else said he’d do it for $40, you’d do it. You just would.”
But he acknowledged the power of provisions in federal legislation to mandate the employment of workers trained through “registered” apprenticeship programs — more than half of which are run through the unions.
The Trump administration tried to encourage private industry to develop its own apprenticeship programs for workers without college degrees through regulation and exhortation but got nowhere, Brown said.
“It’s something I wish companies would have taken more seriously,” he said with a sigh. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

With his call for a “blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America,” President Joe Biden on Tuesday night acknowledged rhetorically what Democrats have been preparing for two years: a fierce campaign to win back white working-class voters through the creation of hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs that do not require a college degree.
Biden’s economically focused State of the Union address may have avoided the cultural appeals to the white working class that former President Donald Trump harnessed so effectively, the grievances encapsulated by fears of immigration, racial and gender diversity, and the sloganeering of the intellectual left. But at the speech’s heart was an appeal to Congress to “finish the job” and a simple challenge. “Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not,” he said.
In truth, much of that path was already laid by the last Congress with the signing of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $370 billion for low-emission energy to combat climate change.
Whether or not Biden can persuade a divided Congress to act on his remaining plans, the money from those laws has just begun to flow, and a surge of hiring is coming. Many of those jobs will be in the industrial battlegrounds that Democrats either took back from Trump in 2020 or will need in 2024, when endangered senators such as Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin face reelection.
But Democrats will have to match those jobs against Republican appeals aimed at white grievances.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, ordered state agencies and universities this week to stop considering racial and ethnic diversity in hiring. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is waging a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while funding the shipping of migrants from the Mexican border to Democratic cities. The Republican-led House is holding hearings blaming immigrants lacking permanent legal status for the smuggling of fentanyl that is ravaging blue-collar cities and towns, though most of the arrests in the fentanyl trade have involved American smugglers.
Republicans openly mocked Biden’s “Finish the Job” slogan, and among working-class voters, they have public opinion on their side. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, just 36% of Americans without a college degree approved of Biden’s job performance, compared with 53% of college graduates. His approval on economic issues was even worse, with just 31% of voters without a degree approving of his handling of the economy.
“Finish the job? On what? Fueling inflation? Opening the border? Lowering wages? Emptying our energy reserves?” asked Tommy Pigott, the rapid response coordinator at the Republican National Committee.
Without doubt, Democrats have their work cut out for them. About two-thirds of eligible voters do not have four-year college degrees, and over the last decade, Democrats have lost ground with them, especially with less educated white voters. In 2020, Biden won 61% of college graduates, but only 45% of voters without a four-year college degree — and just 33% of white voters without a four-year degree.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll in September, 59% of white working-class voters said Republicans were the party of the working class, compared with 28% who chose Democrats. Sixty-eight percent of these voters said they agreed more with Republicans than Democrats on the economy, while just 25% picked Democrats.

Biden Puts the Focus on Issues at Home Despite His Victories Abroad: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Biden is proud of reshaping foreign policy to focus on superpower conflict, but knows it is jobs and energy prices that voters want to hear about.
WASHINGTON -- When President Biden delivered his State of the Union address a year ago, war had broken out in Europe just days before and it appeared inevitable that Vladimir V. Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America's "pacing" challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.
On Tuesday night Mr. Biden faced a changed world.
Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.
So it was especially striking that in the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America's global role, focusing instead on his "Made in America" effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America's closest allies and top trade partners.
History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Mr. Biden's most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.
But it made all the more vivid Mr. Biden's choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America's re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.
Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Mr. Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.
Since the summer, Mr. Biden's intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks -- threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.
Now, Mr. Biden's national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the Covid-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.
As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken postponed his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Mr. Biden was "weak" for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a "clear overreaction" and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.
These are the issues that dominate Mr. Biden's days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.
And yet Mr. Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly on Tuesday night -- far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.
Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $ 52 billion to jump-start chip production. "We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America," he said.
To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.
"The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses," Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology," said to the Marketplace radio program.
Mr. Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China -- but he never mentioned the balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: "Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did."
Mr. Biden also tried to make the case on Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country -- to show that "democracy works" and can outpace autocracies -- he has begun to show progress. "In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker," he said. "Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger."
It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. "Before I came to office the story was about how the People's Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world," he said. "Not anymore." He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Mr. Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.
That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Mr. Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia's aggression. "Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf war has a president pulled together this kind of alliance," said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. "It has required a retooling of American foreign policy."
After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Mr. Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Mr. Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.
But as George H.W. Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Mr. Biden's advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs influences voters in ways that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.

WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address a year ago, war had broken out in Europe just days before and it appeared inevitable that Vladimir Putin would quickly take control of Ukraine. China, the Pentagon kept repeating, was America’s “pacing” challenge, a long-term technological and financial competitor, but not likely to pose an imminent challenge to Taiwan or the United States.
On Tuesday night Biden faced a changed world.
Simultaneously managing an aggressive Russia and a risk-taking China may prove the greatest challenge of his next two years. And they will increasingly occupy his attention, especially now that Republican control of the House all but terminates his domestic legislative agenda.
So it was especially striking that in the president’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, he chose to spend relatively little time on America’s global role, focusing instead on his “Made in America” effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, even at the price of angering America’s closest allies and top trade partners.
History may well conclude that stitching the NATO alliance back together and unifying disparate Asian allies to face a combative Russia and an ascendant China was Biden’s most notable accomplishment, especially for a president who views himself first and foremost as a master of foreign policy.
But it made all the more vivid Biden’s choice to downplay those accomplishments, perhaps because he knows that America’s re-engagement in the world is both expensive and, at the opening of an election cycle, a tough political sell. Containing Russia and competing with China may be the work of decades, but it will add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to an already stressed budget.
Thanks to Western aid and Ukrainian resilience and ingenuity, the war now appears to have settled into a long, grinding conflict, one in which Washington and Moscow find themselves in all but direct armed conflict, arguably the tensest moment between the two superpowers since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. And the more success the Ukrainians have using American precision missiles, German-made tanks and NATO ammunition, the more likely it is that Putin will again threaten that, if necessary, he will detonate a nuclear weapon to win what he sees as an existential battle.
Since the summer, Biden’s intelligence agencies have been reassessing a China that appears far more willing to take risks — threatening Taiwan, defending disputed territory in the South China Sea and last week, sending a spy balloon to drift over the continental United States that seemed to encapsulate the problem of a surveillance state unembarrassed about its ambitions.
Now, Biden’s national security team is debating which China will be harder to handle: a confident, rising power or the one that, in recent months, seems to be stumbling, unable to manage the COVID-19 virus, and increasingly stressed as it tries to restore the spectacular economic growth that was the key to its power.
As the president discovered when the nation breathlessly followed the Chinese balloon and its mystery payload of high-tech sensors, even small incidents with Beijing can escalate rapidly. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to postpone his trip to China, the first by a State Department head in years. Republicans argued that Biden was “weak” for ordering the balloon shot down only after it has made its way across the country; Beijing accused him of a “clear overreaction” and said it reserved the right to retaliate. It was a reminder that in both countries, domestic political demands can force leaders to take a harder line, a prescription for inflaming an already tense relationship.
These are the issues that dominate Biden’s days, as he descends into the Situation Room to measure progress in the Donbas region of Ukraine, or travels to groundbreaking ceremonies for new Intel or IBM semiconductor production plants, so that the United States is less dependent on Chinese production.
And yet Biden mentioned Ukraine only briefly Tuesday night — far less than he did last year. He invited the Ukrainian ambassador to the speech and thanked her, but never referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who visited Washington only two months ago to thank a joint session of Congress for American support.
Instead, he focused on his plans to spend $52 billion to jump-start chip production. “We are going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” he said.
To give America time to catch up, he has cut off the supply of the most sophisticated semiconductor production equipment to China, and convinced Japan and the Netherlands to do the same.
“The reality is that history shows whenever powerful countries have access to advanced computing capabilities, they deploy this for intelligence and military uses,” Chris Miller, a Tufts University professor and author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” said to the Marketplace radio program.
Biden mentioned President Xi Jinping by name, repeating his contention that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Biden also tried to make the case Tuesday night that in the challenge he set for himself and the country — to show that “democracy works” and can outpace autocracies — he has begun to show progress. “In the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker,’’ he said. “Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.”
It was part of his argument that while democracy is messy, once America gets its act together, it can prevail. “Before I came to office the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world,” he said. “Not anymore.” He then went further, ad-libbing to suggest that no other world leader would want to change places with Xi, given the scope of his recent problems.
That may have been a premature declaration of victory. Yet despite his domestic focus, Biden had much to brag about Tuesday when it came to leading an international response to Russia’s aggression. “Not since George H.W. Bush gathered the allies for the Persian Gulf War has a president pulled together this kind of alliance,” said Robert Litwak, the director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has written extensively about superpower competition, especially in the nuclear arena. “It has required a retooling of American foreign policy.”
After four decades toiling in foreign policy, Biden managed to get a reluctant Germany to cut off the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that made it dependent on Russian-produced energy and pulled it out of its post-World War II reluctance to rebuild significant military power. A few weeks ago it even agreed to send Leopard tanks to help the Ukrainians break through Russian trenches, a move that would have been all but impossible to imagine the last time Biden addressed the joint session of Congress.
But as Bush learned the hard way, voters are often unimpressed by foreign policy achievements: He was defeated in 1992, only a year after his victory in the Middle East. Some of Biden’s advisers fear that history may repeat itself, noting that the cost of gas and eggs have a way of influencing voters that containing Russian and Chinese power do not.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: David Greenspan gives a wild ride of a performance in "On Set With Theda Bara," and marionettes star in Vaclav Havel's play "Audience."
The performance space at the Brick, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is already veiled in haze when the audience arrives. A long table draped in black runs down the center of the room, lit by sconces and hanging lamps, their soft glow reflected in mirrored walls at either end.
There's a ghostly, expectant feel to it all, as if we've entered an alternate plane where specters might be summoned. You wouldn't be surprised if a séance broke out. Somewhere in the middle of the swirling phantasmagoria that is the play "On Set With Theda Bara," indeed one will.
A certain channeling of spirits, though, begins as soon as the performance does. The actor David Greenspan takes his place at the head of the table, with the audience seated on either side, and becomes the glamorous silent-film star Theda Bara, or a version of her. Identity is slippery in this play, as it was for the actress, who started out as Theodosia Goodman from Ohio but was marketed by Hollywood, under her screen name, as an exoticized Arab.
Obsession with her is the gossamer string that binds Theda to the other characters in this campy, comic solo show: Detective Finale, a gay 21st-century gumshoe looking for his missing child; Ulysses, a movie-theater organist enthralled with Theda ever since one of her films aroused him to distraction at the keyboard; and Iras, Finale's genderqueer 16-year-old, who would become Theda Bara if only that were possible.
"The Theda I want to be is like -- transgressive but unproblematic, know what I mean?" Iras says. "Like minus the appropriation and stuff."
Greenspan, a virtuoso of multicharacter solo shows, gives a wild ride of a performance, fleet-footed and mercurial but capable of great stillness, too. Stalking, twirling and dancing through the space, even treading on the tabletop, he is quite something to behold, with Stacey Derosier's lighting finely calibrated to his every move. (The set is by Frank J. Oliva.)
Written by Joey Merlo, directed by Jack Serio and presented by the Exponential Festival, this play collides periods and period styles along with storytelling genres. It's part noir, part vampire tale; a vampire -- a predatory woman -- was one of Theda's most famous roles.
Like any decent vampire, Theda is undead: 138 years old, by Iras's calculation, but still looking -- Iras tells her when they meet -- just as she always did onscreen. Holed up with Ulysses, Theda watches clips from her old movies on YouTube, which she pronounces, adorably, as YouTubah.
"Things are strange here," Ulysses says, and he could easily be speaking of the play. "Reality seems to move about. You'll be in one place one minute and in another the next. And it's not only the place that moves but time as well."
In a whipsaw-changeable show that employs just a single costume (by Avery Reed) and almost zero props, it's not always clear which character is speaking -- and the protean Theda has more than one voice. That periodic smudginess is less bothersome than you'd think, though.
Only at the very end does the play turn too murky to work. Until then, Greenspan renders it entirely fascinating.
"Audience," a puppet version of an autobiographical Vaclav Havel play at La MaMa, in the East Village, has the opposite trouble: a lively finish, but a glacially paced staging whose intriguing aim is never close to realized.
Directed by Vit Horejs, who performs it with Theresa Linnihan, this production by the Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theater is set in a brewery, where a playwright works, rolling barrels. A brewmaster-informant chats him up, hoping for scraps of intel.
Two large projection screens are suspended over the playing space. (Production design is by Alan Barnes Netherton.) One screen displays live, black-and-white video from multiple cameras aimed at parts of the stage, to suggest the oppression of constant surveillance. The other shows color close-ups of the performance.
In Horejs's English translation, it's a very talky two-hander, but the marionettes (by Linnihan, Milos Kasal and Jakub "Kuba" Krejci) don't have moving facial features, which makes for unfortunately static close-ups. The acting, alas, does not captivate, so the spying never feels real enough to make the surveillance images meaningful.
There is a smart video prelude to the performance, though: a sleek newsreel (by Suzanna Halsey) that gives a quick and clever Czech history lesson to contextualize the play. Bit of a disappointment, what follows.

How the White House Handles Classified Papers: [National Desk]

Full text: Officials who have worked with Democratic and Republican presidents describe an elaborate system for classified documents but a more casual one for everyday records.
WASHINGTON -- Just hours after the F.B.I. revealed last summer why it raided the Florida home of former President Donald J. Trump, looking for classified documents, a reporter asked President Biden whether it was ever appropriate to take home top secret material.
Nearly drowned out by the roar of Marine One behind him, Mr. Biden made his own admission of sorts.
"I'm taking home with me today, today's P.D.B.," he said, referring to the highly classified President's Daily Brief, the intelligence summary prepared each morning for the occupant of the Oval Office by the nation's top spies and analysts.
Before stepping onto the helicopter, Mr. Biden explained that his home in Delaware had "a cabined-off space that is completely secure." And he noted that the P.D.B. was "locked. I have a person with me -- military with me. I read it, I lock it back up, and give it to the military."
The president's answer -- that taking documents home could be fine, "depending on the circumstance" -- was an indication of how often Mr. Biden handles classified material and sensitive documents at his Delaware home, in part because he spends nearly every weekend there.
But it also hinted at the little-known process by which such documents are supposed to be created, distributed, secured and ultimately accounted for inside the White House, where almost everyone has some kind of national security clearance.
Current and former officials who have been part of that process, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, described an elaborate National Security Council tracking system for highly sensitive documents like the P.D.B. but a more casual dissemination of the churn of classified documents that are used every day by officials from the president to junior national security aides.
Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents is under scrutiny and the subject of a Justice Department investigation led by a special counsel, just like Mr. Trump. White House officials insist that the documents discovered in Mr. Biden's Delaware home were left there inadvertently, and without the president's knowledge. And they say they have cooperated fully with investigators, while Mr. Trump fought them, even after being subpoenaed.
Last week, former Vice President Mike Pence also acknowledged that aides had discovered a handful of classified documents at his home in Indiana. The National Archives and Records Administration sent a letter to other presidents and vice presidents asking them to examine their collections as well.
But throughout the public admissions and investigations, the answer to one question has remained elusive: How could sensitive documents end up misplaced?
The N.S.C.'s "Intel Shop"
The most highly classified and sensitive materials, like the president's morning intelligence briefing, are usually created outside of the White House and deep inside the nation's spy agencies: the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency.
When they are ready to be delivered to the president, vice president or other senior official at the White House, they are usually sent through the government's classified email system, to an office inside the N.S.C. called the "intel shop."
That office is in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House and run by a handful of former intelligence officers and others with experience guarding the nation's secrets. Using special printers connected to the classified email system, the intel shop prints out the documents and assembles them into a binder, according to people familiar with the process.
Once the binder is ready, the person who intends to brief "the principal" -- shorthand for the president or vice president -- will come to the intel shop and pick it up. The aide will place the classified material in a briefcase-like bag with a zipper and a lock.
The pickup is logged by officials at the intel shop: a description of the material; who picked it up; what time it left; and the name of the person who was getting the documents.
After the briefing is completed, the aide is supposed to pack the binder in the locked bag and take it back to the intel shop, where its return would be logged and -- in most cases -- the documents would be placed into "burn bags" and later destroyed, according to several people familiar with the process.
In some cases, however, the principal elects to keep the documents for days or even weeks. In those cases, the intel shop officials are supposed to keep track of what documents are outstanding and remain in touch with the person who picked up the material so it can eventually be returned and disposed of.
Two people who worked in previous administrations, who asked for anonymity to discuss classified material, said officials in the intel shop were typically relentless about making sure the most highly classified documents were given back. Some of those documents are even numbered, to make it easier to trace classified information to a particular person.
One of the people who handled such documents in a previous administration said that a "sliver" of information is protected by the C.I.A. that is highly compartmentalized and very hard to print, and when it is printed, it is usually tracked.
If that kind of information is revealed to be part of the documents found in the homes of Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence, the former official said, it would be a breach of the classified information handling rules. It would mean, the official said, that either staff members failed in their duty to keep track of the documents or that someone was trying to willfully keep them in an unauthorized way.
Mixed-Up Meeting Notes
The rules governing the handling of classified documents have been in place at the White House for decades, according to people familiar with them, though how strictly to follow them is up to each president and his aides.
Mr. Trump was frequently more lax with classified information than his peers. In 2019, he posted a classified photo on Twitter of an accident during a rocket launch in Iran. It was later revealed he had taken a photo of the classified image from a briefing document and then posted it.
It remains unclear how classified documents found in Mr. Biden's home, and at an office he used in Washington, D.C., after leaving the vice presidency, got there. The president's lawyers have said they date from his time as vice president and senator and have suggested that boxes were inadvertently moved from his White House office when it was packed up at the end of his vice presidency.
The classified information that circulates the White House typically does not contain the government's most prized secrets. It usually relates to diplomatic or military information, sensitive law enforcement discussions or merely debates that are ongoing and would be damaging if they leaked out, according to people who have worked in previous White Houses.
Many White House officials -- and almost all members of the N.S.C. -- have clearance to handle secret materials, and most have access to the government's classified computer network with connections to the intelligence agencies and a printer, which is often used to share information with others at meetings.
Classified documents are routinely distributed before a meeting in the Situation Room or one of the numerous secure offices in the West Wing or the Eisenhower building. During the meeting, any notes scribbled on classified documents become classified as well, and in many cases must be preserved and secured.
But most of the information that is discussed and traded at such meetings every day is not managed by the intel shop, officials said. The documents are not numbered or tracked. And while most are supposed to be put in large bags to be shredded, not everything ends up there.
Several people who have participated in such meetings said officials frequently take those documents back to their offices, making it easy for them to mix with unclassified information.
"My experience would increase the likelihood that it just got mixed in with other stuff," said Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel for President Barack Obama and who recalled that people frequently handled classified material, especially during meetings with the president. "Everybody in the meeting was supposed to read them by the time they showed up."
But most of the time, Mr. Eggleston said, nobody ever came around after the meeting and said, "Where is that?"
The Weekend White House
Most presidents have traveled frequently on the weekends.
Mr. Trump spent many Saturdays and Sundays at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida or his home in Bedminster, New Jersey. Former President George W. Bush spent many weeks at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Ronald Reagan often conducted business at his home in Southern California.
But few have done so with as much regularity as Mr. Biden.
For most of the past five decades -- first as a senator, then as vice president, and now as president -- Mr. Biden has left Washington most Fridays for Wilmington, Del., returning to the nation's capital on Sunday or Monday. National security and military aides accompany Mr. Biden to Wilmington whenever he goes there, to be available for in-person briefings if necessary.
In a CBS News interview in September, Mr. Biden reacted to the discovery of classified information at Mr. Trump's house and the yearlong refusal by the former president to return information that some reports said contained highly sensitive nuclear secrets. He said his predecessor's actions made him wonder "how anyone can be that irresponsible."
But just months later, Mr. Biden's actions are being investigated as well. And while his lawyers have pledged to be far more cooperative than those representing Mr. Trump, they have so far offered little information about the documents themselves and how they got there.
"We have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation's integrity," said Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney, the day after the F.B.I. discovered more classified documents in Mr. Biden's Wilmington home after searching for almost 13 hours.
Mr. Biden has not commented on the issue since that day.

Biden’s handling of classified documents is under scrutiny and the subject of a Justice Department investigation led by a special counsel, just like Trump. White House officials insist that the documents discovered in Biden’s Delaware home were left there inadvertently, and without the president’s knowledge. And they say they have cooperated fully with investigators, while Trump fought them, even after being subpoenaed.
Last week, former Vice President Mike Pence also acknowledged that aides had discovered a handful of classified documents at his home in Indiana. The National Archives and Records Administration sent a letter to other presidents and vice presidents asking them to examine their collections as well.
But throughout the public admissions and investigations, the answer to one question has remained elusive: How could sensitive documents end up misplaced?
The NSC’s ‘Intel Shop’
The most highly classified and sensitive materials, such as the president’s morning intelligence briefing, are usually created outside of the White House and deep inside the nation’s spy agencies: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency.
When they are ready to be delivered to the president, vice president or other senior official at the White House, they are usually sent through the government’s classified email system, to an office inside the NSC called the “intel shop.”
That office is in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House and run by a handful of former intelligence officers and others with experience guarding the nation’s secrets. Using special printers connected to the classified email system, the intel shop prints out the documents and assembles them into a binder, according to people familiar with the process.
Once the binder is ready, the person who intends to brief “the principal” — shorthand for the president or vice president — will come to the intel shop and pick it up. The aide will place the classified material in a briefcase-like bag with a zipper and a lock.
The pickup is logged by officials at the intel shop: a description of the material; who picked it up; what time it left; and the name of the person getting the documents.
After the briefing is completed, the aide is supposed to pack the binder in the locked bag and take it back to the intel shop, where its return would be logged and — in most cases — the documents would be placed into “burn bags” and later destroyed, according to several people familiar with the process.
In some cases, however, the principal elects to keep the documents for days or even weeks. In those cases, intel shop officials are supposed to keep track of what documents are outstanding and remain in touch with the person who picked up the material so it can eventually be returned and disposed of.
Two people who worked in previous administrations, who asked for anonymity to discuss classified material, said officials in the intel shop were typically relentless about making sure the most highly classified documents were given back. Some of those documents are even numbered, to make it easier to trace classified information to a particular person.
One of the people who handled such documents in a previous administration said that a “sliver” of information is protected by the CIA that is highly compartmentalized and hard to print, and when it is printed, it is usually tracked.
If that kind of information is revealed to be part of the documents found in the homes of Biden, Trump or Pence, the former official said, it would be a breach of the classified information handling rules. It would mean, the official said, that either staff members failed in their duty to keep track of the documents or that someone was trying to willfully keep them in an unauthorized way.
Mixed-Up Meeting Notes
The rules governing the handling of classified documents have been in place at the White House for decades, according to people familiar with them, though how strictly to follow them is up to each president and his aides.
Trump was frequently more lax with classified information than his peers. In 2019, he posted a classified photo on Twitter of an accident during a rocket launch in Iran. It was later revealed he had taken a photo of the classified image from a briefing document and then posted it.
It remains unclear how classified documents found in Biden’s home, and at an office he used in Washington, D.C., after leaving the vice presidency, got there. The president’s lawyers have said they date from his time as vice president and senator and have suggested that boxes were inadvertently moved from his White House office when it was packed up at the end of his vice presidency.
The classified information that circulates the White House typically does not contain the government’s most prized secrets. It usually relates to diplomatic or military information, sensitive law enforcement discussions or merely debates that are ongoing and would be damaging if they leaked out, according to people who have worked in previous White Houses.
Many White House officials — and almost all members of the NSC — have clearance to handle secret materials, and most have access to the government’s classified computer network with connections to the intelligence agencies and a printer, which is often used to share information with others at meetings.
Classified documents are routinely distributed before a meeting in the Situation Room or one of the numerous secure offices in the West Wing or the Eisenhower building. During the meeting, any notes scribbled on classified documents become classified as well, and in many cases must be preserved and secured.
But most of the information discussed and traded at such meetings every day is not managed by the intel shop, officials said. The documents are not numbered or tracked. And while most are supposed to be put in large bags to be shredded, not everything ends up there.
Several people who have participated in such meetings said officials frequently take those documents back to their offices, making it easy for them to mix with unclassified information.
“My experience would increase the likelihood that it just got mixed in with other stuff,” said Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel for President Barack Obama and who recalled that people frequently handled classified material, especially during meetings with the president. “Everybody in the meeting was supposed to read them by the time they showed up.”
But most of the time, Eggleston said, nobody ever came around after the meeting and said, “Where is that?”
The Weekend White House
Most presidents have traveled frequently on the weekends.
Trump spent many Saturdays and Sundays at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida or his home in Bedminster, New Jersey. Former President George W. Bush spent many weeks at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. Ronald Reagan often conducted business at his home in Southern California.
But few have done so with as much regularity as Biden.
For most of the past five decades — first as a senator, then as vice president, and now as president — Biden has left Washington most Fridays for Wilmington, Delaware, returning to the nation’s capital on Sunday or Monday. National security and military aides accompany Biden to Wilmington whenever he goes there, to be available for in-person briefings if necessary.
In a CBS News interview in September, Biden reacted to the discovery of classified information at Trump’s house and the yearlong refusal by the former president to return information that some reports said contained highly sensitive nuclear secrets. He said his predecessor’s actions made him wonder “how anyone can be that irresponsible.”
But just months later, Biden’s actions are being investigated as well. And while his lawyers have pledged to be far more cooperative than those representing Trump, they have so far offered little information about the documents themselves and how they got there.
“We have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigation’s integrity,” said Bob Bauer, the president’s personal attorney, the day after the FBI discovered more classified documents in Biden’s Wilmington home after searching for almost 13 hours.
Biden has not commented on the issue since that day. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Solid Week Adds to January Market Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A strong week for Wall Street closed out with modest gains Friday, sending the stock market to its highest level since early December.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to clinch its third winning week in the last four and was near its highest level since the summer, before fading at the end of the day. It's rallied through January on growing belief inflation is on a steady downswing, hopefully leading to less pressure on the economy and markets.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28 points, or 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.9 percent.
Helping to lead the way was American Express, which jumped 10.5 percent despite reporting weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. It gave a forecast for earnings through 2023 that topped Wall Street's expectations and announced a planned increase to its dividend.
Another big gain for Tesla's stock also supported the market. It rose 11 percent following its stronger-than-expected profit report for the end of 2022 released earlier in the week.
They helped offset a 6.4 percent loss for Intel following a jarring warning from the chip maker. Not only did its revenue and earnings fall short of expectations last quarter, it also gave a forecast for revenue this quarter more than $ 2 billion below analysts' expectations.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 10.13 points to 4,070.56. The Dow climbed 28.67 to 33,978.08, and the Nasdaq gained 109.30 to 11,621.71.
Hasbro fell 8.1 percent after saying it "underperformed" in this past holiday shopping season and will likely report a 17 percent drop in revenue for the fourth quarter. The company will cut about 1,000 jobs to reduce costs.
So far, the job market has remained remarkably resilient despite a slowing overall economy. Almost all of the high-profile layoff announcements have been within the tech industry, which raced to expand after the pandemic sent demand for technology soaring.
Earnings reporting season is entering its heart, and companies have been offering mixed results and forecasts. That's helped lead to some big swings in markets.
Two competing big ideas have been sending Wall Street veering recently. On one hand are worries about a steep drop-off in profits and a severe recession for the economy following all the Federal Reserve's increases to interest rates last year meant to crush inflation. On the other are hopes that cooling inflation may allow the Fed to take it easier on rates.
The market is partly trying to reconcile that weak earnings and a drop in demand may be necessary for inflation to keep cooling, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.
"It's kind of like this is the medicine the economy has to take," he said.
Economic reports on Friday backed up recent data points suggesting inflation continues to moderate. The measure the Fed prefers, which doesn't count food and energy costs, was 4.4 percent higher in December than a year earlier. That was down from 4.7 percent inflation in November.
Reports also showed that income growth for Americans slowed in December, while consumer spending fell off a bit more sharply than expected.
A separate report said U.S. consumers are also downshifting their expectations for inflation in the coming year. Over the long run, the University of Michigan said inflation expectations remain roughly where they've been for most of the last 18 months.
Economists said Friday's data likely keeps the Fed on track to raise its key benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points at its meeting next week. That would be a step down from its increase of 0.50 points last month and four straight hikes of 0.75 points before that.
Smaller increases would mean less added pressure on the economy, which has already seen damage done to the housing industry and other areas because of last year's surge in rates.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which sets rates for mortgages and other important loans, held steady at 3.51 percent. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed actions, held at 4.19 percent.
Next week could be another busy one for markets, with several high-profile events on top of the Fed's announcement. The European Central Bank will give its latest decision on rates, the U.S. government will release its latest monthly check on the jobs market and more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 will report their quarterly results.
In stock markets overseas, India's Sensex fell 1.5 percent as the Adani Group was again hit by heavy selling.

Full text: In an act of official retribution for how Democrats treated Republicans when they were in the majority, the speaker barred the Californians from the panel, arguing that they were not fit to serve.
WASHINGTON -- Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday unilaterally exiled Representatives Adam B. Schiff and Eric Swalwell from the House Intelligence Committee, making good on a longstanding threat to expel the California Democrats in his first major act of partisan retribution since taking the majority.
The move was a much-anticipated tit-for-tat after Democrats, then in the majority, voted in 2021 to eject two Republicans, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona, from congressional committees for internet posts that advocated violence against their political enemies. It was also payback for the decision by Nancy Pelosi, then the House speaker, to bar Republicans who had helped former President Donald J. Trump spread the election lies that fueled the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol from sitting on the special committee investigating the riot.
Now that he is in control, Mr. McCarthy sought to punish Mr. Schiff and Mr. Swalwell, two favorite foils of Republicans who had played key roles in the two impeachments of Mr. Trump, though he denied that his decision was retaliatory. Instead, he argued that both men had displayed behavior unbecoming of the committee tasked with overseeing the nation's intelligence services.
In a letter outlining his decision to Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, Mr. McCarthy decried what he described as "the misuse" of the intelligence panel during the last four years, arguing that it had "severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions -- ultimately leaving our nation less safe." He called the dismissals of Mr. Schiff and Mr. Swalwell necessary "to maintain a standard worthy of this committee's responsibilities."
Mr. McCarthy has said that Mr. Schiff "openly lied to the American people" when he chaired the intelligence panel during Mr. Trump's presidency. In September 2019, Mr. Schiff was excoriated by Republicans for dramatically paraphrasing the contents of a telephone call in which Mr. Trump had pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, and for implying, falsely, that his committee had had no contact with a whistle-blower raising concerns about their conversation.
Earlier, in March 2019‌, ‌Republicans on the committee had demanded that Mr. Schiff step aside for having said that he had seen "more than circumstantial evidence" of collusion between Mr. Trump and the Russians in 2017. That claim had been called into question by the findings of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who had looked into the matter, which Attorney General ‌William P. Barr‌ had summarized in a letter to certain members of Congress. Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of having compromised the integrity of the panel by knowingly promoting false information.
Speaking to reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday night, Mr. Schiff countered that Mr. McCarthy was "trying to remove me from the intel committee for holding his boss at Mar-a-Lago accountable."
"It's just another body blow to the institution of Congress that he's behaving this way, but it just shows how weak he is as a speaker," he added.
Republicans have railed against Mr. Swalwell, who served as a manager in Mr. Trump's second impeachment trial, citing an Axios report that reported that Mr. Swalwell was targeted by a suspected Chinese spy as part of an influence campaign in 2014, before he served on the intelligence panel. The report said that around 2015, federal investigators alerted Mr. Swalwell to their concerns and he "cut off all ties."
"This is all about political vengeance," Mr. Swalwell said of Mr. McCarthy's action.
Because the intelligence panel is a "select" committee, the speaker has the authority to dictate who can serve, just as Ms. Pelosi was able to block Republicans appointed by Mr. McCarthy from the select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. However, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Swalwell are not expected to lose their other committee assignments.
Removing members from other committees requires a vote on the House floor. Democrats held such a vote in February of 2021 to remove Ms. Greene from the Education and Budget Committees, after social medial posts surfaced from before she was elected in which she endorsed the executions of Democrats and spread bigoted conspiracy theories. They held another vote months later to eject Mr. Gosar from his committees after he posted an animated video that depicted him killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York.
In both instances, some Republicans joined Democrats in voting to remove their colleagues from congressional panels.
Mr. McCarthy returned both Ms. Greene and Mr. Gosar to committees earlier this month, and promoted Ms. Greene to serve on two high-profile panels, Oversight and Homeland Security. Mr. Gosar also won a seat on Oversight.
Mr. McCarthy has also threatened to remove Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, from congressional committees for criticism of Israel that Republicans and some Democrats have condemned as anti-Semitic. Ms. Omar apologized in 2019 for saying that support for Israel in Washington was "all about the Benjamins baby," a comment that members of both parties denounced as a reference to an anti-Semitic trope. She was criticized again in 2021 when she made statements that appeared to compare human rights abuses by Israel with acts committed by Hamas and the Taliban, and later said she had not meant to equate them.
It was not clear whether Mr. McCarthy, who holds a razor-thin majority, had the votes to oust Ms. Omar. At least two Republicans have publicly expressed qualms about doing so.
And the Minnesota Democrat on Tuesday night told reporters at the Capitol that some Republicans had told her privately they believed such a move would be "uncalled for."
"They are trying to do whatever it is that they can within their conference to make sure there is no vote to remove me from the Foreign Affairs Committee," she added.

Full text: Last May, Sandra Rivera, a top executive at the chip giant Intel, got some alarming news.
Engineers had worked for more than five years to develop a powerful new microprocessor to carry out computing chores in data centers and were confident they had finally gotten the product right. But signs of a potentially serious technical flaw surfaced during a regular morning meeting to discuss the project.
The issue was so troublesome that Sapphire Rapids, the code name for the microprocessor, had to be delayed -- the latest in a series of setbacks for one of Intel's most important products in years.
"We were pretty dejected," said Ms. Rivera, an executive vice president in charge of Intel's data center and artificial intelligence group. "It was a painful decision."
The launch of Sapphire Rapids wound up being pushed from mid-2022 to Tuesday, nearly two years later than once expected. The lengthy development of the product -- which combines four chips in one package -- underscores some of the challenges facing a turnaround effort at Intel when the United States is trying to assert its dominance in the foundational computer technology.
Since the 1970s, Intel has been a leading player in the small slices of silicon that run most electronic devices, best known for a variety called microprocessors, which act as electronic brains in most computers. But the Silicon Valley company in recent years lost its longtime lead in manufacturing technology, which helps determine how fast chips can compute.
Patrick Gelsinger, who became Intel's chief executive in 2021, has vowed to restore its manufacturing edge and build new U.S. factories. He was a leading figure as Congress debated and passed legislation in the summer to reduce U.S. dependence on chip manufacturing in Taiwan, which China claims as its territory.
The bumpy development of Sapphire Rapids has implications for whether Intel can rebound to deliver future chips on time. That's an issue that could affect scores of computer makers and cloud service providers, not to mention the millions of consumers who tap into online services likely to be powered by Intel technology.
"What we want is a stable cadence that is predictable," said Kirk Skaugen, the executive vice president leading server sales at Lenovo, a Chinese company that is planning 25 new systems based on the new processor. "Sapphire Rapids is the start of a journey."
For Intel, the pressure is on. Along with falling demand for chips used in personal computers, the company faces stiff competition in the server chips that are its most profitable business. That issue has worried Wall Street, with Intel's market value plunging more than $ 120 billion since Mr. Gelsinger took charge.
At an online event on Tuesday to discuss Sapphire Rapids, which is named after a portion of the Colorado River, Intel customers described plans to use the processor, which they said would bring particular benefits for artificial intelligence tasks. The product, formally called the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor, was introduced along with another delayed addition to the Xeon chip family. That product, formerly code-named Ponte Vecchio, was designed to accelerate special-purpose jobs and be used alongside Sapphire Rapids in high-performance computers.
In an interview, Mr. Gelsinger said Sapphire Rapids had the makings of a hit, despite the delays. He picked Ms. Rivera in 2021 to take over the unit developing it, where she is using lessons from the experience to change how Intel designs and tests its products. He said Intel had conducted several internal reviews of what happened with Sapphire Rapids, and "we're not done."
Sapphire Rapids began in 2015, with discussions among a small group of Intel engineers. The product was the company's first attempt at a new approach in chip design. Companies now routinely pack tens of billions of tiny transistors on each piece of silicon, but competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and others had started making processors from multiple chips bundled together in plastic packages.
Intel engineers came up with a design with four chips, each one sporting 15 processor "cores" that act like individual calculators for general-purpose computing jobs. The company also decided to include extra blocks of circuitry for special tasks -- including artificial intelligence and encryption -- and to communicate with other components, such as chips that store data.
The interaction among so many elements is "very complex," said Shlomit Weiss, who jointly leads Intel's design engineering group. "Complexity usually brings problems."
The Sapphire Rapids team grappled with bugs, flaws caused by designer errors or manufacturing glitches that can cause a chip to make incorrect calculations, work slowly or stop functioning. They were also affected by delays in the product's manufacturing process.
But by December 2019, the engineers had hit a milestone called "tape-in." That's when electronic files containing a completed design move to a factory to make sample chips.
The sample chips arrived in early 2020, as Covid-19 forced lockdowns. The engineers soon got the computing cores on Sapphire Rapids communicating with one another, said Nevine Nassif, the project's chief engineer. But more work than expected remained.
One key chore was "validation," a testing process in which Intel and its customers run software on sample chips to simulate computing chores and catch bugs. Once flaws are found and fixed, designs may go back to the factory to make new test chips, which typically takes more than a month.
Repeating that process led to missed deadlines. Ms. Nassif said Sapphire Rapids was designed to counter AMD's Milan processor, which was introduced in March 2021. But it still wasn't ready by that June, when Intel announced a delay until the next year to allow more validation.
That was when Ms. Rivera stepped in. The longtime Intel executive had successfully built a business in networking products before being appointed in 2019 as chief people officer.
"We had to get our execution mojo back," Mr. Gelsinger said. "I needed somebody who was going to run to the fire and fix this business for me."
In October 2021, Ms. Rivera and a top design executive established weekly Sapphire Rapids status meetings, held each Monday at 7 a.m. Those gatherings showed steady progress in finding and fixing bugs, she said, bolstering confidence about starting production in the second quarter of 2022.
Then came the discovery of the flaw last May. Ms. Rivera would not describe it in detail but said it had affected the processor's performance. In June, she used an investor event to announce a delay of at least a quarter, which pushed Sapphire Rapids later than the launch of a competing AMD chip in November.
"We were ready to ship," Ms. Nassif said. The final delay "was just so sad given all the effort that had gone into it."
Ms. Rivera saw a series of lessons from the setbacks. One was simply that Intel packed too many innovations into Sapphire Rapids, rather than deliver a less ambitious product sooner.
She also concluded that the team should have spent more time on perfecting and testing its design using computer simulations. Finding bugs before they are in sample chips is less expensive, and would have made it possible to remove features to simplify the product, Ms. Rivera said. She has since moved to bolster Intel's simulation and validation abilities.
"We used to have a lot of this kind of muscle that we let atrophy," Ms. Rivera said. "Now we're rebuilding."
She also determined that Intel had scheduled more products than its engineers and customers could easily handle. So she streamlined that product road map, including pushing back a successor to Sapphire Rapids to 2024 from 2023.
More broadly, Ms. Rivera and other Intel executives have pushed the organization to develop better processes for documenting technical issues, and sharing that information inside and outside the company.
Some Intel customers say the communication has gotten better.
"Has everything gone well? No," said Lenovo's Mr. Skaugen, who once ran Intel's server chip business. "But we were surprised a lot less than we were in the past."

House Republicans Plan a Wide Inquiry Into F.B.I. and Security Agencies: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Republicans plan to create a special subcommittee, led by a Trump ally, with a mandate to scrutinize open criminal investigations and classified intelligence.
WASHINGTON -- Newly empowered House Republicans are preparing a wide-ranging investigation into law enforcement and national security agencies, raising the prospect of politically charged fights with the Biden administration over access to sensitive information like highly classified intelligence and the details of continuing criminal inquiries by the Justice Department.
The House plans to vote this week on a resolution to create a special Judiciary subcommittee on what it calls the "weaponization of the federal government," a topic that Republicans have signaled could include reviewing investigations into former President Donald J. Trump.
The panel would be overseen by Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, who is also poised to become the Judiciary Committee's chairman. It remains to be seen who else Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who made numerous concessions to a far-right faction of his party to win the speakership, will put on it.
In a Fox News interview on Friday evening, Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a lead negotiator for hard-right lawmakers who pushed Mr. McCarthy's team for concessions, portrayed the panel as part of the agreement they struck for their support. He said Mr. McCarthy had committed to giving the subcommittee at least as much funding and staffing as the House special committee in the last Congress that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
"So we got more resources, more specificity, more power to go after this recalcitrant Biden administration," Mr. Roy said. "That's really important."
A spokesman for Mr. Jordan did not reply to a request for comment, but both he and Mr. McCarthy have spoken for months about their desire for such an investigation and pledged to voters during the 2022 campaign to carry one out.
"We will hold the swamp accountable, from the withdrawal of Afghanistan, to the origins of Covid and to the weaponization of the F.B.I.," Mr. McCarthy said in his first remarks as speaker early Saturday. "Let me be very clear: We will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena to get the job done."
The text of the resolution establishing the subcommittee would give the panel essentially open-ended jurisdiction to scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties or to examine how any agency of the federal government has collected, analyzed and used information about Americans -- including "ongoing criminal investigations."
The Justice Department has traditionally resisted making information about open criminal investigations available to Congress, suggesting that legal and political fights over subpoenas and executive privilege are most likely looming.
Republicans are promoting Mr. Jordan's panel as a new "Church Committee," referring to a 1970s investigation by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, that uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses by presidents of both parties.
But in an environment in which Mr. Trump has been the subject of multiple criminal investigations for years -- including continuing inquiries into his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and his hoarding of sensitive documents -- Democrats predicted the new investigative subcommittee was likely to adopt a more partisan edge.
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the Church Committee had been "a serious and bipartisan attempt to reform the conduct of the intelligence community, based on hard and verifiable evidence."
By contrast, he said that "this new thing, fueled by conspiracy theories and slated to be run by the most extreme members of the MAGA caucus," was likely to be more similar to the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee of the mid-20th century.
Mr. Jordan is a staunch ally of Mr. Trump. Late last year, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee when his party was still in the minority, he oversaw a 1,000-page staff report that claimed that the F.B.I. had "spied on President Trump's campaign and ridiculed conservative Americans" and that the "rot within the F.B.I. festers in and proceeds from Washington."
The resolution appears to give him authority to subpoena the Justice Department for information about the special counsel inquiry into Mr. Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, along with other politically charged matters like an open tax investigation into President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
The text of the resolution would also grant Mr. Jordan's panel the power to receive the same highly classified information that intelligence agencies make available to their oversight committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Intelligence Committee members have access to some of the most sensitive secrets in the government, including information about covert actions, which are not shared with other lawmakers. Traditionally, House leaders tend to place on the intelligence panel members of their party they think are especially trustworthy not to disclose classified information.
While Mr. Jordan's investigative unit will be housed within the Judiciary Committee, its 13 members -- eight of whom would be Republicans -- will not be limited to lawmakers on that panel.
It is not clear, for example, whether Republican leaders would select hard-right members, such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who was stripped of her committee assignments in 2021 for making a series of violent and conspiratorial social media posts before she was elected. Mr. McCarthy has already promised her a spot on the House Oversight Committee, and she broke with other far-right members to support his speakership bid from the first ballot, as did Mr. Jordan.
Such a situation could result in lawmakers trying to scrutinize a Justice Department investigation as that inquiry potentially examines some of those same lawmakers' conduct concerning the events of Jan. 6.
In an interview on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday, Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, rejected a suggestion that he should pledge not to serve on Mr. Jordan's subcommittee because it may scrutinize the Jan. 6 investigation and as a witness in that inquiry, he had a conflict of interest. Mr. Perry, who played an important role in Mr. Trump's attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, had his cellphone seized by the F.B.I.
"Why should I be limited -- why should anybody be limited just because someone has made an accusation?" Mr. Perry said, adding: "I get accused of all kinds of things every single day, as does every member that serves in the public eye. But that doesn't stop you from doing your job. It is our duty and it is my duty."
Some Republicans also seem to see the panel as an opportunity to raise culture-war issues and promote conspiracy theories. In his interview with Fox, Mr. Roy described the subcommittee's mission as going "after the weaponization of the government, the F.B.I., the intel agencies, D.H.S., all of them that have been, you know, labeling Scott Smith a domestic terrorist."
In fact, no agency labeled Mr. Smith a domestic terrorist. Mr. Smith, whose daughter was sexually assaulted in a high school bathroom in Virginia, was arrested after he lunged at someone at a school board meeting during a tense and chaotic debate over bathroom policy for transgender students. He was convicted of disorderly conduct.
In September 2021, the National School Boards Association sent Mr. Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and threats against school officials. It included a brief reference to Mr. Smith's arrest incident amid a long list of examples, with a footnote to a news account of the meeting that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details like his daughter's assault. The letter also said acts of violence and threats against school officials could be classified as "equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes," and asked for federal help.
A few days later, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland issued a memorandum directing U.S. attorneys and the F.B.I. to convene meetings across the country with local officials to discuss "strategies for addressing threats" against school officials and teachers. His memo did not call anyone a domestic terrorist, and it specifically distinguished spirited debate, which it stressed was constitutionally protected, from acts of violence and threats.
But voices on the right have made Mr. Smith a cause célèbre, falsely telling their viewers and readers that the Biden-era Justice Department and the F.B.I. consider parents who disagree with liberal school board policies to be domestic terrorists.
The subcommittee investigation proposed by Mr. Jordan is just one of a number of inquiries House Republicans plan to approve this week.
Included in a separate rules package scheduled to come up for a vote on Monday is a wide-ranging inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic, including the origins of the virus, so-called gain-of-function research, the production of vaccines and the conduct of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden's former chief medical adviser, whom Republicans have pledged to haul before them for questioning.
Republicans are also planning to form a special committee to investigate the Chinese government's "economic, technological and security progress, and its competition with the United States."
Both the China investigation and the investigation into law enforcement are scheduled for a vote on Tuesday.

Late last year, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee when his party was still in the minority, he oversaw a 1,000-page staff report that claimed that the FBI had “spied on President Trump’s campaign and ridiculed conservative Americans” and that the “rot within the FBI festers in and proceeds from Washington.”
The resolution appears to give him authority to subpoena the Justice Department for information about the special counsel inquiry into Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, along with other politically charged matters like an open tax investigation into President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.
The text of the resolution would also grant Jordan’s panel the power to receive the same highly classified information that intelligence agencies make available to their oversight committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Intelligence Committee members have access to some of the most sensitive secrets in the government, including information about covert actions, which are not shared with other lawmakers. Traditionally, House leaders tend to place on the intelligence panel members of their party they think are especially trustworthy not to disclose classified information.
While Jordan’s investigative unit will be housed within the Judiciary Committee, its 13 members — eight of whom would be Republicans — will not be limited to lawmakers on that committee.
It is not clear, for example, whether Republican leaders would select hard-right members, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who was stripped of her committee assignments in 2021 for making a series of violent and conspiratorial social media posts before she was elected. McCarthy has already promised her a spot on the House Oversight Committee, and she broke with other far-right members to support his speakership bid from the first ballot, as did Jordan.
Such a situation could result in lawmakers trying to scrutinize a Justice Department investigation as that inquiry potentially examines some of those same lawmakers’ conduct concerning the events of Jan. 6.
In an interview on ABC’s “The Week” on Sunday, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., rejected a suggestion that he should pledge not to serve on Jordan’s subcommittee because it may scrutinize the Jan. 6 investigation and as a witness in that inquiry, he had a conflict of interest. Perry, who played an important role in Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, had his cellphone seized by the FBI.
“Why should I be limited — why should anybody be limited just because someone has made an accusation?” Perry said, adding: “I get accused of all kinds of things every single day, as does every member that serves in the public eye. But that doesn’t stop you from doing your job. It is our duty, and it is my duty.”
Some Republicans also seem to see the panel as an opportunity to raise culture-war issues and promote conspiracy theories. In his interview with Fox, Roy described the subcommittee’s mission as going “after the weaponization of the government, the FBI, the intel agencies, DHS, all of them that have been, you know, labeling Scott Smith a domestic terrorist.”
In fact, no agency labeled Smith a domestic terrorist. Smith, whose daughter was sexually assaulted in a high school bathroom in Virginia, was arrested after he lunged at someone at a school board meeting during a tense and chaotic debate over bathroom policy for transgender students. He was convicted of disorderly conduct.
In September 2021, the National School Boards Association sent Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and threats against school officials. It included a brief reference to Smith’s arrest incident amid a long list of examples, with a footnote to a news account of the meeting that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details like his daughter’s assault. The letter also said acts of violence and threats against school officials could be classified as “equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes,” and asked for federal help.
A few days later, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memorandum directing U.S. attorneys and the FBI to convene meetings across the country with local officials to discuss “strategies for addressing threats” against school officials and teachers. His memo did not call anyone a domestic terrorist, and it specifically distinguished spirited debate, which it stressed was constitutionally protected, from acts of violence and threats.
But voices on the right have made Smith a cause célèbre, falsely telling their viewers and readers that the Biden-era Justice Department and the FBI consider parents who disagree with liberal school board policies to be domestic terrorists.
The subcommittee investigation proposed by Jordan is just one of a number of inquiries House Republicans plan to approve this week.
Included in a separate rules package scheduled to come up for a vote Monday is a wide-ranging inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic, including the origins of the virus, so-called gain-of-function research, the production of vaccines and the conduct of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s former chief medical adviser, whom Republicans have pledged to haul before them for questioning.
Republicans are also planning to form a special committee to investigate the Chinese government’s “economic, technological and security progress, and its competition with the United States.”
Both the China investigation and the investigation into law enforcement are scheduled for a vote Tuesday. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In September, the chip giant Intel gathered officials at a patch of land near Columbus, Ohio, where it pledged to invest at least $ 20 billion in two new factories to make semiconductors.
A month later, Micron Technology celebrated a new manufacturing site near Syracuse, N.Y., where the chip company expected to spend $ 20 billion by the end of the decade and eventually perhaps five times that.
And in December, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company hosted a shindig in Phoenix, where it plans to triple its investment to $ 40 billion and build a second new factory to create advanced chips.
The pledges are part of an enormous ramp-up in U.S. chip-making plans over the past 18 months, the scale of which has been likened to Cold War-era investments in the space race. The boom has implications for global technological leadership and geopolitics, with the United States aiming to prevent China from becoming an advanced power in chips, the slices of silicon that have driven the creation of innovative computing devices like smartphones and virtual-reality goggles.
Today, chips are an essential part of modern life even beyond the tech industry's creations, from military gear and cars to kitchen appliances and toys.
Across the nation, more than 35 companies have pledged nearly $ 200 billion for manufacturing projects related to chips since the spring of 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group. The money is set to be spent in 16 states, including Texas, Arizona and New York on 23 new chip factories, the expansion of nine plants, and investments from companies supplying equipment and materials to the industry.
The push is one facet of an industrial policy initiative by the Biden administration, which is dangling at least $ 76 billion in grants, tax credits and other subsidies to encourage domestic chip production. Along with providing sweeping funding for infrastructure and clean energy, the efforts constitute the largest U.S. investment in manufacturing arguably since World War II, when the federal government unleashed spending on new ships, pipelines and factories to make aluminum and rubber.
"I've never seen a tsunami like this," said Daniel Armbrust, the former chief executive of Sematech, a now-defunct chip consortium formed in 1987 with the Defense Department and funding from member companies.
President Biden has staked a prominent part of his economic agenda on stimulating U.S. chip production, but his reasons go beyond the economic benefits. Much of the world's cutting-edge chips today are made in Taiwan, the island to which China claims territorial rights. That has caused fears that semiconductor supply chains may be disrupted in the event of a conflict -- and that the United States will be at a technological disadvantage.
The new U.S. production efforts may correct some of these imbalances, industry executives said -- but only up to a point.
The new chip factories would take years to build and might not be able to offer the industry's most advanced manufacturing technology when they begin operations. Companies could also delay or cancel the projects if they aren't awarded sufficient subsidies by the White House. And a severe shortage in skills may undercut the boom, as the complex factories need many more engineers than the number of students who are graduating from U.S. colleges and universities.
The bonanza of money on U.S. chip production is "not going to try or succeed in accomplishing self-sufficiency," said Chris Miller, an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and the author of a recent book on the chip industry's battles.
White House officials have argued that the chip-making investments will sharply reduce the proportion of chips needed to be purchased from abroad, improving U.S. economic security. At the TSMC event in December, Mr. Biden also highlighted the potential impact on tech companies like Apple that rely on TSMC for their chip-making needs. He said that "it could be a game changer" as more of these companies "bring more of their supply chain home."
U.S. companies led chip production for decades starting in the late 1950s. But the country's share of global production capacity gradually slid to around 12 percent from about 37 percent in 1990, as countries in Asia provided incentives to move manufacturing to those shores.
Today, Taiwan accounts for about 22 percent of total chip production and more than 90 percent of the most advanced chips made, according to industry analysts and the Semiconductor Industry Association.
The new spending is set to improve America's position. A $ 50 billion government investment is likely to prompt corporate spending that would take the U.S. share of global production to as much as 14 percent by 2030, according to a Boston Consulting Group study in 2020 that was commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association.
"It really does put us in the game for the first time in decades," said John Neuffer, the association's president, who added that the estimate may be conservative because Congress approved $ 76 billion in subsidies in a piece of legislation known as the CHIPS Act.
Still, the ramp-up is unlikely to eliminate U.S. dependence on Taiwan for the most advanced chips. Such chips are the most powerful because they pack the highest number of transistors onto each slice of silicon, and they are often held up as a sign of a nation's technological progress.
Intel long led the race to shrink the size of transistors so more could fit on a chip. That pace of miniaturization is usually described in nanometers, or billionths of a meter, with smaller numbers indicating the most cutting-edge production technology. Then, TSMC surged ahead in recent years.
But at its Phoenix site, TSMC may not import its most advanced manufacturing technology. The company initially announced that it would produce five-nanometer chips at the Phoenix factory, before saying last month that it would also make four-nanometer chips there by 2024 and build a second factory, which will open in 2026, for three-nanometer chips. It stopped short of discussing further advances.
In contrast, TSMC's factories in Taiwan at the end of 2022 began producing three-nanometer technology. By 2025, factories in Taiwan will probably start supplying Apple with two-nanometer chips, said Handel Jones, chief executive at International Business Strategies.
TSMC and Apple declined to comment.
Whether other chip companies will bring more advanced technology for cutting-edge chips to their new sites is unclear. Samsung Electronics plans to invest $ 17 billion in a new factory in Texas but has not disclosed its production technology. Intel is manufacturing chips at roughly seven nanometers, though it has said its U.S. factories will turn out three-nanometer chips by 2024 and even more advanced products soon after that.
The spending boom is also set to reduce, though not erase, U.S. reliance on Asia for other kinds of chips. Domestic factories produce only about 4 percent of the world's memory chips -- which are needed to store data in computers, smartphones and other consumer devices -- and Micron's planned investments could eventually raise that percentage.
But there are still likely to be gaps in a catchall variety of older, simpler chips, which were in such short supply over the past two years that U.S. automakers had to shut down factories and produce partly finished vehicles. TSMC is a major producer of some of these chips, but it is focusing its new investments on more profitable plants for advanced chips.
"We still have a dependency that is not being impacted in any way shape or form," said Michael Hurlston, chief executive of Synaptics, a Silicon Valley chip designer that relies heavily on TSMC's older factories in Taiwan.
The chip-making boom is expected to create a jobs bonanza of 40,000 new roles in factories and companies that supply them, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. That would add to about 277,000 U.S. semiconductor industry employees.
But it won't be easy to fill so many skilled positions. Chip factories typically need technicians to run factory machines and scientists in fields like electrical and chemical engineering. The talent shortage is one of the industry's toughest challenges, according to recent surveys of executives.
The CHIPS Act contains funding for work force development. The Commerce Department, which is overseeing the doling out of grant money from the CHIPS Act's funds, has also made it clear that organizations hoping to obtain funding should come up with plans for training and educating workers.
Intel, responding to the issue, plans to invest $ 100 million to spur training and research at universities, community colleges and other technical educators. Purdue University, which built a new semiconductor laboratory, has set a goal of graduating 1,000 engineers each year and has attracted the chip maker SkyWater Technology to build a $ 1.8 billion manufacturing plant near its Indiana campus.
Yet training may go only so far, as chip companies compete with other industries that are in dire need of workers.
"We're going to have to build a semiconductor economy that attracts people when they have a lot of other choices," Mitch Daniels, who was president of Purdue at the time, said at an event in September.
Since training efforts may take years to bear fruit, industry executives want to make it easier for highly educated foreign workers to obtain visas to work in the United States or stay after they get their degrees. Officials in Washington are aware that comments encouraging more immigration could invite political fire.
But Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, was forthright in a speech in November at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Attracting the world's best scientific minds is "an advantage that is America's to lose," she said. "And we're not going to let that happen."

Full text: I have many fears as a mother. My kindergarten-age daughter recently learned a game on the school bus called "Truth or Force." My youngest refuses to eat almost anything but Kraft Mac and Cheese. Added to the list this year, alongside outside influences and health concerns, is the possibility that my daughters could inadvertently lock me out of my digital life.
That's what happened to a mother in Colorado whose 9-year-old son used her old smartphone to stream himself naked on YouTube, and a father in San Francisco whose Google account was disabled and deleted because he took naked photos of his toddler for the doctor.
I reported on their experiences for The New York Times, and as I talked to these parents, who were stunned and bereft at the loss of their emails, photos, videos, contacts and important documents spanning decades, I realized I was similarly at risk.
I am "cloud-complacent," keeping my most important digital information not on a hard drive at home but in the huge digital basement provided via technology companies' servers. Google gives all users 15 gigabytes free, a quarter of what comes standard on an Android phone, and I have not managed to max it out in 18 years of using the company's many services.
I did fill up Apple's free 5 GB, so I now pay $ 9.99 a month for additional iCloud storage space. Meta has no max; like scrolling on Instagram, the allowed space is infinite.
If I were suddenly cut off from any of these services, the data loss would be professionally and personally devastating.
As a child of the 1980s, I used to have physical constraints on how many photos, journals, VHS tapes and notes passed in seventh grade that I could reasonably keep. But the immense expanse and relatively cheap rent of the so-called cloud has made me a data hoarder. Heading into 2023, I set out to excavate everything I was storing on every service, and find somewhere to save it that I had control over. As I grappled with all the gigabytes, my concern morphed from losing it all to figuring out what was actually worth saving.
Data Harvesting
I find nearly 100 photos from one November night 15 years ago, out with my family at a Tampa Bay Lightning game when my sisters and I were home for the holidays. We're tailgating with a mini-keg of Heineken. My dad is posing by the car, making a funny face at the ridiculousness of a parking garage party. Then, we're posing in the stadium with the hockey rink in the background, toasting with a stranger we sat next to. Had we bonded with him during an especially close third period? The metadata in the Google Photos jpg file didn't say.
The photos transported me back to a tremendously fun evening that I had all but forgotten. Yet I wondered how there could be so many photos from just one night. How do I decide which to keep and which to get rid of?
This kind of data explosion is a result of economics, said Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library based in San Francisco that saves copies of websites and digitizes books and television shows. Taking a photo used to be expensive because it involved film that needed to be developed.
"It cost a dollar every time you hit a shutter," Mr. Kahle said. "That's no longer the case so we hit the shutter all the time and keep way, way too much."
I had captured the 2007 evening in Tampa pre-smartphone on a digital Canon camera that had a relatively small memory card that I regularly emptied into Google Photos. I found more than 4,000 other photos there, along with 10 gigabytes of data from Blogger, Gmail, Google Chat and Google Search, when I requested a copy of the data in my account using a Google tool called Takeout.
I just pressed a button and a couple of days later got my data in a three-file chunk, which was great, though some of it, including all my emails, was not human-readable. Instead, it came in a form that needed to be uploaded to another service or Google account.
According to a company spokesman, 50 million people a year use Takeout to download their data from 80 different Google products, with 400 billion files exported in 2021. These people may have had plans to move to a different service, simply wanted their own copy or were preserving what they had on Google before deleting it from the company's servers.
Takeout was created in 2011 by a group of Google engineers who called themselves the Data Liberation Front. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google employee in Chicago who led the team, said he thought it was important that the company's users have an easy "off ramp" to leave Google and take their data elsewhere. But Mr. Fitzpatrick said he worried that when people store their digital belongings on a company's server, they "don't think about it or care about it."
Some of my data landlords were more accommodating than others. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram offered Takeout-like tools, while Apple had a more complicated data transfer process that involved voluminous instructions and a USB cable.
The amount of data I eventually pulled down was staggering, including more than 30,000 photos, 2,000 videos, 22,000 tweets, 57,000 emails, 15,000 pages of old Google chats and 16,000 pages of Google searches going back to 2011.
It was such an overwhelming amount of digital stuff that I wasn't surprised to see that Google had hired Marie Kondo as a spokeswoman for the paid version of its storage service -- starting at $ 1.99 per month for 100 GB. Ms. Kondo suggested better labeling and organization of emails, photos and documents to make it "easy to find the memories that spark joy."
The Missing
The trove of data brought forgotten episodes of my life back in vivid color. A blurry photo of my best friend's husband with a tiny baby strapped to his chest, standing in front of a wall-sized Beetlejuician face, made me recall a long-ago outing to a Tim Burton exhibit at a museum in Los Angeles. I don't remember what I learned about the gothic filmmaker, but I do remember my friends' horror when their weeks-old son, now 11, had a blowout and they had to beg a comically oversized diaper from a stranger.
The granularity of what was in my digital archive accentuated the parts of my life that were missing entirely: emails from college in a university-provided account that I hadn't thought to migrate; photos and videos I took on an Android phone that I backed up to an external hard drive that has since disappeared; and stories I'd written in journalism school for publications that no longer exist. They were as lost to me as the confessional journal I once left in the seatback of a plane. The idea that information, once digitized, will stick around forever is flawed.
"We often say the internet never forgets, but it does," said the web historian Ian Milligan. Companies shut down, as happened to GeoCities, an early, popular place for hosting personal websites, or a service cuts back on the amount of free storage it's offering, as when the new owner of Flickr announced in 2019 that free accounts had a limit of 1,000 photos and anything more would be deleted.
Margot Note, an archivist, said her profession thinks a lot about the accessibility of the medium on which data is stored, given the challenge of recovering videos from older formats such as DVDs, VHS tapes and reel film. Ms. Note asks the kinds of questions most of us don't: Will there be the right software or hardware to open all our digital files many years from now? With something called "bit rot" -- the degradation of a digital file over time -- the files may not be in good shape.
Individuals and institutions think that when they digitize material it will be safe, she said. "But digital files can be more fragile than physical ones."
Where to Put It
Once I assembled my data Frankenstein, I had to decide where to put it. More than a decade ago, pre-cloud complacency, I would regularly back my stuff up to a hard drive that I probably bought at Best Buy. Digital self-storage has gotten more complex as I discovered when I visited the DataHoarder subreddit. Posts there with technical advice for the best home setup were jargon-filled to the point of incomprehension for a newbie. A sample post: "Started with single bay Synology Nas and recently built a 16TB unRAID server on a xeon 1230. Very happy with result."
I felt as if I'd landed on an alien planet so I turned instead to professional archivists and tech-savvy friends. They recommended two $ 299 12-terabyte hard drives, one of which should have ample room for what I have now and what I will create in the future, and another to mirror the first, as well as a $ 249 NAS, or network-attached storage system, to connect to my home router, so I could access the files remotely and monitor the health of the drives.
Archivists regularly cited the "3-2-1 rule": three copies of everything, two copies on different cloud services and one at home. Some also said to keep yet another copy "offsite," i.e. at a relative's house or in a bank lockbox, depending on your level of paranoia. History is awash in tales of lost data, including the burning of invaluable master recordings of famous musicians in a Universal Studios fire. John Markoff, a technology journalist who writes for The Times, mined the extensive personal archives of the internet pioneer Stewart Brand for a biography. He found that even Mr. Brand, who meticulously preserved his communications, was missing several years of early emails because of the loss of back-up tapes and had hundreds of thousands of others on an old Macintosh that were a jumble of data that was largely impossible to read.
Getting all your data and figuring out how to securely store it is cumbersome, complicated and costly. There's a reason most people ignore all their stuff in the cloud.
What to Keep
I noticed a philosophical divide among the archivists I spoke with. Digital archivists were committed to keeping everything with the mentality that you never know what you might want one day, while professional archivists who worked with family and institutional collections said it was important to pare down to make an archive manageable for people who look at it in the future.
"It's often very surprising what turns out to matter," said Jeff Ubois, who is in the first camp and has organized conferences dedicated to personal archiving.
He brought up a historical example. During World War II, the British war office asked people who had taken coastal vacations to send in their postcards and photographs, an intelligence-gathering exercise to map the coastline that led to the selection of Normandy as the best place to land troops.
Mr. Ubois said it's hard to predict the future uses of what we save. Am I socking this away just for me, to reflect on my life as I age? Is it for my descendants? Is it for an artificial intelligence that will act as a memory prosthetic when I'm 90? And if so, does that A.I. really need to remember that I Googled "starbucks ice cream calorie count" one morning in January 2011?
Pre-internet, we pared down our collections to make them manageable. But now, we have metadata and advanced search techniques to sort through our lives: timestamps, geotags, object recognition. When I recently lost a close relative, I used the facial recognition feature in Apple Photos to unearth photos of him I'd forgotten I'd taken. I was glad to have them, but should I keep all the photos, even the unflattering ones?
Bob Clark, the director of archives at the Rockefeller Archive Center, said that the general rule of thumb in his profession is that less than 5 percent of the material in a collection is worth saving. He faulted the technology companies for offering too much storage space, eliminating the need for deliberating over what we keep.
"They've made it so easy that they have turned us into unintentional data hoarders," he said.
The companies try, occasionally, to play the role of memory miner, surfacing moments that they think should be meaningful, probably aiming to increase my engagement with their platform or inspire brand loyalty. But their algorithmic archivists inadvertently highlight the value of human curation.
Recently, my iPhone served me "Waterfalls over the years," which, as promised, featured a slide show with instrumental music and photos of myself and others in front of a random assortment of waterfalls. Like the British war office during World War II, the technology saw the backdrop as the star of the show.
"I don't think we can simply rely on the algorithms to help you decide what's important or not," Mr. Clark said. "There need to be points of human intervention and judgment involved."
Paring It Down
Rather than just keeping a full digital copy of everything, I decided to take the archivists' advice and pare it down somewhat, a process the professionals call appraisal. An easy place to start was the screenshots: the QR codes for flights long ago boarded, privacy agreements I had to click to use an app, emails that were best forwarded to my husband via text and a message from Words With Friends that "nutjob" was not an acceptable word.
There were some clear keepers, a selfie I took in Beijing with the artist Ai Weiwei in April 2015; a video of my eldest daughter's first steps in December 2017; and a shot of me on a camel in front of the Giza Pyramids in 2007, a photo I had purposely staged to recreate one we had on my childhood fridge of my great-grandmother in the same place doing the same thing, but with a disgruntled expression on her face.
Then there's the stuff I'm ambivalent about, like the many photos with long-ago exes, which for now I'll continue to hoard given that I'm still on good terms with them and I'm not going to fill up 12 terabytes any time soon.
There was also a lot of "data exhaust," as the security technologist Matt Mitchell calls it, a polite term for the record of my life rendered in Google searches, from a 2011 query for karaoke bars in Washington, D.C., to a more recent search for the closest Chuck E. Cheese. I will not keep those on my personal hard drive, and I may take the step of deleting them from Google's servers, which the company makes possible, because their embarrassment potential is higher than their archival value. Mr. Mitchell said super hoarders should pare down, not to make memories easier to find, but to eliminate data that could come back to bite them.
"You need to let go because you can't get hacked if there's nothing to hack," said Mr. Mitchell, the founder of CryptoHarlem, a cybersecurity education nonprofit. "It's only when you're storing too much that you run into the worst of these problems."
Inactive Accounts
Right now, it's cheap to hoard all this data in the cloud.
"The cost of storage long term continues to fall," said George Blood, who runs a business outside Philadelphia digitizing information from obsolete media, creating 10 terabytes of data per day, on average. "They may charge you more for the cost of the electricity -- spinning the disk your data is on -- than the storage itself."
Big technology companies don't often prompt people to minimize their data footprints, until, that is, they near the end of their free storage space. That's when companies force them to decide whether to move to the paid plans. There are signs, though, that the companies don't want to hold onto our data forever: Most have policies allowing them to delete accounts that are inactive for a year or more.
Aware of the potential value of data left behind by those who euphemistically go "inactive," Apple recently introduced a legacy contact feature, to designate a person who can access an Apple account after the owner's death. Google has long had a similar tool, prosaically called inactive account manager. Facebook created legacy contacts in 2015 to look after accounts that have been memorialized.
And that really is the ultimate question around personal archives: What becomes of them after we die? By keeping so much, more than we want to sort through, which is almost certainly more than anyone else wants to sort through on our behalf, we may leave behind less than previous generations because our accounts will go inactive and be deleted. Our personal clouds may grow so vast that no one will ever go through them, and all the bits and bytes could end up just blowing away.
