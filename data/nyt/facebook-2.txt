Full text: The tech industry argues that laws in Florida and Texas, prompted by conservative complaints about censorship by tech platforms, violate the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether Florida and Texas may prohibit large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express, setting the stage for a major ruling on how the First Amendment applies to powerful tech platforms.
The laws' supporters argue that the measures are needed to combat what they called Silicon Valley censorship, saying large platforms had removed posts expressing conservative views on issues like the coronavirus pandemic and claims of election fraud. In particular, they objected to the decisions of some platforms to bar President Donald J. Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Two trade groups, NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, had challenged the laws, saying the First Amendment prevents the government from telling private companies whether and how to disseminate speech.
The court's decision to hear the cases was unsurprising. In each case, both sides had urged the justices to do so, citing a clear conflict between two federal appeals courts. One ruled against the Florida law, the other in favor of the one in Texas.
The approaches of the two states were similar but not identical, Judge Andrew S. Oldham wrote in a decision upholding the Texas law. "To generalize just a bit," the Florida law "prohibits all censorship of some speakers," while the Texas law "prohibits some censorship of all speakers" when based on the views they express.
In a statement issued when he signed the Florida bill, Gov. Ron DeSantis, now a Republican presidential candidate, said the point of the law was to promote conservative viewpoints. "If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable," he said.
The Texas law applies to social media platforms with more than 50 million active monthly users, including Facebook, YouTube and X, the site formerly known as Twitter. It does not appear to reach smaller platforms that appeal to conservatives, and it does not cover sites that are devoted to news, sports, entertainment and other information that their users do not primarily generate.
The sites in question are largely barred from removing posts based on the viewpoints they express, with exceptions for the sexual exploitation of children, incitement of criminal activity and some threats of violence.
A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, last year largely upheld a preliminary injunction against Florida's law.
"Social media platforms exercise editorial judgment that is inherently expressive," Judge Kevin C. Newsom wrote for the panel. "When platforms choose to remove users or posts, deprioritize content in viewers' feeds or search results or sanction breaches of their community standards, they engage in First Amendment-protected activity."
A few months later, a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, reversed a lower court's order blocking the Texas law.
"Today we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling First Amendment right to censor what people say," Judge Oldham wrote.
He added: "The platforms are not newspapers. Their censorship is not speech."
The Supreme Court had already had an encounter with the Texas case, temporarily blocking its law last year while an appeal moved forward. The vote was 5 to 4, with an unusual coalition in dissent.
The court's three most conservative members -- Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch -- filed an opinion saying they would have left the law in place and that the issues were so novel and significant that the Supreme Court would have to consider them at some point.
"Social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate with each other and obtain news," Justice Alito wrote in the dissent. "At issue is a groundbreaking Texas law that addresses the power of dominant social media corporations to shape public discussion of the important issues of the day."
Justice Alito added that he was skeptical of the argument that the social media companies have editorial discretion protected by the First Amendment like that enjoyed by newspapers and other traditional publishers.
"It is not at all obvious," he wrote, "how our existing precedents, which predate the age of the internet, should apply to large social media companies."
Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, voted with the dissenters but did not adopt their reasoning or give reasons of her own.
The First Amendment generally prohibits government restrictions on speech based on content and viewpoint but allows private companies to say and convey what they wish.
In a recent Supreme Court brief, lawyers for Texas said the challenged law does not affect the platforms' free speech rights because "no reasonable viewer could possibly attribute what a user says to the platforms themselves." The brief added: "Given the platforms' virtually unlimited capacity to carry content, requiring them to provide users equal access regardless of viewpoint will do nothing to crowd out the platforms' own speech."
In an earlier brief, the state's lawyers wrote that "the platforms are the 21st century descendants of telegraph and telephone companies: that is, traditional common carriers." That means, they wrote, that the companies must generally accept all customers.
The Biden administration filed a brief in August urging the justices to hear the cases -- Moody v. NetChoice, No. 22-277, and NetChoice v. Paxton, No. 22-555 -- and to rule in the companies' favor.
"When a social-media platform selects, edits and arranges third-party speech for presentation to the public, it engages in activity protected by the First Amendment," Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote for the administration, adding that "the act of culling and curating the content that users see is inherently expressive, even if the speech that is collected is almost wholly provided by users."

IBM Tries Assuring Customers Generative A.I. Is a Safe Bet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company will assume the legal risk of businesses that use its A.I. systems and will publish the technology's underlying data.
There is no shortage of excitement in corporate America for the new artificial intelligence that can produce everything from business reports to computer code with humanlike fluency.
Plenty of companies are experimenting with the technology, called generative A.I., but they are worried about how confidential data will be handled, the accuracy of A.I.-generated answers and potential legal liability.
IBM on Thursday announced its campaign to ease customers' qualms. The company said it would indemnify companies against copyright or other intellectual property claims for using its generative A.I. systems. IBM will also publish its data sets -- the underlying data that is used to build or "train" the A.I. system -- which is not standard practice among commercial providers of generative A.I. technology.
The announcement is an indication that, while attention has been focused on the new A.I. technology in chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, IBM is laying its plans to tackle the market.
IBM's customers are mostly other businesses, and persuading those companies to use new A.I. products means assuring them that they won't run into legal trouble. OpenAI, for example, has already been sued by a collection of authors who accuse it of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train ChatGPT.
Over the last year, start-ups like OpenAI and other industry giants like Google and Microsoft have been much more aggressive than IBM about publicly discussing their A.I. work. Even Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this week introduced A.I. chatbots meant to sound like celebrities such as the quarterback Tom Brady and the hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg.
IBM's relatively quiet stance showed how much the tech industry had changed in the 12 years since IBM's Watson A.I. system beat top competitors on "Jeopardy!" A.I. became a centerpiece of IBM's pitch to corporate customers, but the company has been overshadowed by younger competitors in the nearly yearlong A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.
Other technology suppliers are also trying to reassure customers by assuming legal risks. Microsoft pledged this month to defend customers in any copyright suits that arise from using its A.I.-powered Copilots, which it is adding to its office productivity software and programming tools. Adobe has made a similar commitment for copyright claims against customers using Adobe Firefly, its A.I. art-generation software.
The IBM A.I. systems -- or "models," as developers call them -- are tailored for use by businesses. And the training data has been curated with companies in mind and culled from the internet, academic journals, computer code repositories, and legal and finance documents, the company said.
IBM appears to be going further than other companies in taking on risk and opening up its model-training data. But it is in step with where the business market for generative A.I. is heading, said Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analysis firm.
The big A.I.-fueled consumer services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard are closed, and people outside the companies behind them cannot usually see what data those systems are built on. That will not satisfy most corporate customers, Mr. Moorhead said.
"Businesses need to know the data inputs and get a sense of why you got the answer you did," he said. "Putting their customer or confidential data into an A.I. model is seen as high risk for a business."
IBM is positioning itself as a partner for companies that want to create their own A.I. technology, by adding their business data to IBM's open models.
The early focus of most business technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, has largely been on embedding generative A.I. to improve their existing digital tools for office productivity, supply chain management, customer service and marketing.
IBM will deploy that A.I. in its products as well, but its emphasis is helping businesses become creators, as well as customers, of generative A.I. technology.
In business, the A.I. models are large, but far smaller than needed for the big consumer chatbots, said Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president for software. The narrower focus also helps improve accuracy. "And for our market, accuracy is way more important than size," he said.
The smaller models also require far less computing firepower than the giant consumer chatbots. That, Mr. Thomas said, should open the door to wider use of generative A.I. in operations that promise an immediate impact and payoff, including customer service, automated back-office tasks and digital assistants for writing code.
In those fields, "we see a defensible return on investment at the moment," Mr. Thomas said. "The economics work."

'Ghost' Guns Found at a Day Care Site, Officials Say: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was the second discovery this month of a lethal hazard at a home-based day care program in New York City.
An East Harlem apartment functioning as a state-licensed day care site was being used by the son of the site's operator to produce 3-D-printed "ghost" guns and parts for them, officials said on Wednesday.
It was the second time this month that a lethal hazard had been found at a home-based day care in New York City. On Sept. 15, a 1-year-old boy died of suspected fentanyl poisoning at a Bronx apartment where the potent drug was discovered near nap mats and under the floor.
There are roughly 7,000 such home-based sites in the five boroughs, and the city health department inspects them on the state's behalf. Mayor Eric Adams said on Wednesday that his administration would review its inspection procedures in light of the alarming incidents.
"We are going to remain vigilant" and "stay ahead of bad people that are doing bad things in environments where our children are," Mr. Adams said at a news conference where he was joined by Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney; Edward A. Caban, the city's police commissioner; and other top police officials.
The mayor added: "Who would have thought that we must add to our list of inspections: Do we have 3-D printers that can print guns? Do we see the presence of items like fentanyl?"
Ghost guns, also known as privately made firearms, lack serial numbers and are therefore untraceable. The parts used to build them are considered components, not actual guns, and online buyers need not undergo background checks or register the weapons.
Such guns are attractive to convicted felons, minors, domestic abusers subject to protective orders and others who cannot legally buy or own guns. The growing availability of 3-D printers, which can make plastic and metal parts for guns, has helped fuel the weapons' spread.
On Tuesday, officials said, investigators executing a search warrant at the East Harlem apartment found a 3-D printer; two finished 3-D-printed guns; one nearly finished 3-D-printed assault pistol; and several other gun-making tools and components.
Karon J. Coley, 18, who lives at the apartment, was charged with several weapons-related counts as well as with acting in a manner injurious to a child. He was scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday evening. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer.
Mr. Coley's mother, April Coley, holds a license from the state's Office of Children and Family Services to operate a home-based day care out of the apartment, on the fifth floor of a building on East 117th Street, records show.
According to state rules, all household members 18 or older who live at a home where such a program operates must undergo a background check. Patrick Gallahue, a city health department spokesman, said Mr. Coley had passed a background check "within the past year."
A woman who answered at a phone number listed on state records for the day care declined to comment. She did not identify herself.
The site, operating under the name Alay's Day care, opened in February 2021 under a license set to run through February 2025, according to state inspection records. It was authorized to serve up to 12 children, age 6 weeks to 12 years, as well as an additional four school-age children.
City health inspectors found no violations at the apartment during a March 2022 visit, records show. The most recent inspection, in February, noted three violations involving paperwork related to issues like children's sleeping and feeding habits and their health status. The violations were later corrected, records show.
Photos of the day care site posted online showed a room painted green and blue and adorned with books and posters of shapes and colors. A Facebook page, last updated in January, featured a festive holiday photo of eight babies with two smiling caregivers.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the family services agency said that its "top priority" was "the health and safety of all children in child care programs" and that "we are deeply troubled by these serious allegations." She declined further comment on an active investigation.

Small Businesses Fear Ripples in Washington: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Once again, the florists, bars, gyms, cafes, dry cleaners and other small businesses that serve federal employees in the District of Columbia and its suburbs are bracing for an economic blow.
On most days, more than half of the customers at Union Station Shoe Shine in Washington's main train hub are federal employees and others heading to Capitol Hill, who stop in for a $ 10 shine.
So if the federal government were to shut down, the owner of the shop said he would inevitably see fewer customers stepping into one of his five chairs to have their boots, brogues or wingtips polished on their way to work.
"It would be catastrophic because we're still trying to recover from the pandemic," said the owner, David Kirkley. He could buy ads on Facebook or Yelp, he said.
"But there's not a lot you can do if people are not in the city," he said. "Our main business is walk-by traffic."
A shutdown could inflict serious pain on many small businesses in Washington, Maryland and Virginia, where hundreds of thousands of federal workers help power the local economy during their daily commutes. Many are watching the debate in Congress with growing frustration and a familiar sense of dread.
During a shutdown, thousands of federal workers would be furloughed or would continue to work without pay. And many would cut back on spending.
And unlike furloughed workers who will eventually receive back pay when the shutdown ends, stores that have lost business will have no such recourse. In Maryland, which is home to about 139,000 civilian federal employees, businesses like day care centers, coffee shops and retailers could feel the effects.
"It's those extras that people won't do," said Mary Kane, the president and chief executive of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce. "Maybe they won't take in their laundry or dry cleaning or go out to eat or to the local coffee shop. And there is no way that you will get that money later."
The capital's economy is fueled by commuters from the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, who leave a trail of spending during the workweek at local lunch counters and bars. If they stay home, Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers also see fewer customers.
Stacie Lee Banks, an owner of Lee's Flower and Card Shop in Washington, said fresh-cut flowers might be the first thing furloughed federal workers cut from their budgets.
"People need food, and they need housing and shelter," Ms. Banks said, "but they don't need flowers."
Mr. Henry's, a restaurant and jazz club less than a mile from the Capitol, could lose 20 to 30 percent of its business during a shutdown, said Cathy Nagy, the general manager.
"We're a small business -- that's significant," Ms. Nagy said, adding that lunch, dinner and after-work drink sales would suffer without the usual crowds from Capitol Hill. She said that Mr. Henry's, which has a happy hour from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., might offer additional specials during a shutdown.
"You just have to pivot," Ms. Nagy said, noting that Mr. Henry's survived previous shutdowns and the coronavirus pandemic. "Sometimes I'm pivoting so fast I feel like a ballerina."
Efforts to avert a shutdown have splintered over whether the associated legislation should increase aid to Ukraine or enact spending cuts, among other issues. If Congress can't reach a deal, federal funding will lapse at midnight on Saturday. The dispute has exasperated some business owners.
"Do your job. It is ridiculous," said Eddie Lofton, who owns JC Lofton Tailors, a shop near the U Street Metro station in Washington that tailors suits for many federal employees.
Mr. Lofton, whose grandfather started a Washington tailor shop and school in 1939, noted that members of Congress would still be paid during a shutdown.
"It's not going to affect them as much," he said, "and they're not thinking about the regular people."
Some who work near the Capitol expressed a sense of fatalism about the dysfunction.
After all, the United States has experienced 21 gaps in government funding since 1976. During the longest and most recent shutdown, in 2018, roughly 800,000 of the federal government's 2.1 million employees were sidelined for 34 days.
"We're used to it," said Nu Dang, who cuts hair at Capitol Barber & Stylist, a short walk from the Capitol. "Nothing can help."
Business would be "very slow" during a shutdown, Ms. Dang said, and she would pass the time watching TV and YouTube.
Nationwide, 70 percent of small-business owners said in a recent survey by Goldman Sachs that their businesses would be "negatively impacted" by a government shutdown. Of those, 67 percent said customer demand would drop because of economic uncertainty and instability.
Cycled!, a Washington cycling studio about a block from the Takoma Metro station near the Maryland border, is planning to offer free classes and discounts to furloughed employees, similar to what it did during the last shutdown.
During that closure, more people showed up to work out at first, said Shayla Cornick, the studio's owner. But as the shutdown dragged on, customers canceled memberships and sales declined.
"In this area, everyone is impacted when the government shuts down," Ms. Cornick said.
Lacey Huber, the vice president of Stone Tower Winery in Leesburg, Va., said she noticed a similar change in customer behavior during the last shutdown.
"The first few weeks of that was kind of fun," she said. "It had a lively atmosphere because everybody was off work, and we did offer some discounts. Our weekday traffic customers were much higher, but then that quickly dissipated because once that first paycheck doesn't show up, people get worried."
Caffe Amouri in Vienna, Va., which opens at 6 a.m. to capture the morning rush of government employees, might offer free drinks or other promotions, as it did during the last shutdown, said Michael Amouri, the owner. In the short term, the cafe could become busier as furloughed employees suddenly have free time on their hands.
"We do provide a place to go and to commiserate," Mr. Amouri said. "Whether it will help or not is hard to say."

Forget the Phone. Tech Pioneers Seek the Next Great Device.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: OpenAI's Sam Altman, the former Apple designer Jony Ive and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son are teaming up to develop a device that could replace the smartphone.
Since founding OpenAI in 2015, Sam Altman has spent many days thinking that the company's generative artificial-intelligence products need a new kind of device to succeed. Since leaving Apple in 2019, Jony Ive, the designer behind the iPhone, iPod and MacBook Air, has been considering what the next great computing device could be.
Now, the two men and their companies are teaming up to develop a device that would succeed the smartphone and deliver the benefits of A.I. in a new form factor, unconstrained by the rectangular screen that has been the dominant computing tool of the past decade, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
The project was described as preliminary, but Mr. Altman and Mr. Ive have developed some early concepts and sought as much as $ 1 billion in funding from SoftBank, the Japanese technology investor led by Masayoshi Son, the people said. With SoftBank's support, the two men could tap into the semiconductor expertise of Arm, the British chip design company Mr. Son bought in 2016 and recently went public.
The business structure behind the project remains unclear. Mr. Altman's company, OpenAI, is an A.I. research lab in San Francisco spanning roughly 400 researchers, engineers and support staff members, while Mr. Ive's San Francisco design firm, LoveFrom, has about three dozen industrial and software designers, as well as some engineers.
The talks have been going on for much of this year and were previously reported by The Information, a tech publication, and The Financial Times.
The partnership speaks to the way that generative A.I. is upending the status quo in Silicon Valley. Since the introduction of OpenAI's online chatbot, ChatGPT, late last year, companies have been scrambling to reinvent their businesses and tap into its power to answer questions, write emails, presentations and poetry, and even generate computer code.
Many tech executives believe the technology has the power to introduce a new paradigm in computing that they call "ambient computing." Rather than typing on smartphones and taking photographs, they imagine a future device in the form of something as simple as a pendant or glasses that can process the world in real time, using a sophisticated virtual assistant capable of fielding questions and processing images.
Mr. Altman had previously invested in a company pursuing that vision called Humane, which was founded by ex-Apple employees, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno. They plan to release their device, which they bill as a "disappearing computer," later this year.
One reason Mr. Altman may be determined to develop his own device is to avoid having OpenAI depend on Apple or Google's Android for distribution. Relying on other platforms has challenged tech giants, such as Facebook and Amazon, because Apple and Google take a cut of sales across their platform. Apple also has introduced privacy limits, which cut into advertising sales.
But the road to creating new hardware devices is littered with failure. Amazon and Facebook both tried to develop their own smartphones and abandoned their efforts after failing to gain traction.
Few in Silicon Valley have a better track record at developing devices than Mr. Ive. He was the driving force behind the company's development of the Apple Watch, the only major new device that the company has introduced since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. In 2019, Mr. Ive left the company to start LoveFrom, but he signed a multiyear contract to continue working with Apple.
Last year, Mr. Ive and Apple agreed to stop working together. In negotiating the end of their working relationship, Apple and Mr. Ive agreed that there would be no limits on the products that he could develop in the future, according to two people familiar with the matter.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Full text: The accusations reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States.
The State Department accused China on Thursday of using "deceptive and coercive methods" to shape the global information environment, by acquiring stakes in foreign newspapers and television networks, using major social media platforms to promote its views and exerting pressure on international organizations and media outlets to silence critics of Beijing.
The accusations, detailed in a report by the department's Global Engagement Center, reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States and to democratic principles around the world by promoting "digital authoritarianism."
China not only pushes its own propaganda, the report said, but exports digital surveillance tools to police information and people online. Although many of the tactics detailed are not new, the report warned that they could "lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing."
"Every country has the right and every right to tell its story to the world, but a nation's narrative should be facts, and it should rise or fall on its own merits," James P. Rubin, the coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, said at a briefing. Referring to the People's Republic of China, he went on: "By contrast, the P.R.C. advances coercive techniques and increasingly outright lies."
The report echoes a raft of recent studies detailing the growing -- and shifting -- scope of China's information campaigns. It came a day after officials disclosed in a Senate briefing that Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone.
According to the State Department's report released on Thursday, China's efforts have evolved from a primary focus on promoting or defending the country's political views on issues like Taiwan and Hong Kong to one that aims to sow disinformation to discredit the United States at home and abroad.
That has included accusations about the origins of the Covid pandemic, the new security partnership between the United States and Australia, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, disclosed last month that it had dismantled a Chinese campaign using more than 8,000 accounts, pages or groups on the two platforms, the largest inauthentic network it had found so far. Microsoft and other researchers also linked China to the spread of false claims about the causes of the deadly wildfires in Hawaii.
That campaign included images generated by artificial intelligence, a tool that the researchers, like the State Department, warn could greatly enhance China's efforts.
China's control over information internally is virtually absolute, but increasingly it is expanding its influence abroad, with its state channels broadcasting in 12 languages.
The report said that China has spent billions of dollars to build an expansive state news operation under the Central Propaganda Department and the United Front Work Department, which the report said oversees investments in foreign media aimed at Chinese diaspora communities.
The report cited investments in media organizations in the Czech Republic, Australia and Thailand, where Tencent sidestepped a law against foreign ownership to acquire Sanook, the country's most popular news site.
China has also become a leading provider in digital television services in Africa through StarTimes, a Chinese company that now reaches most of the continent's viewers.
While the department's report was based largely on public information, it included references to knowledge seemingly based on classified information.
That included "U.S. government information" about an agreement with a newspaper "in an East African country" to publish paid articles from China without disclosing the connection and the fact that until at least late 2020, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, maintained "a regularly updated internal list" of people who were blocked or restricted on the platform.
The report also detailed what it described as a fictitious author, Yi Fan, whose writings in English have appeared in publications around the world since 2015 under bylines describing him as an independent analyst.
China has also become adept at using social media platforms that the authorities banned inside the country's Great Firewall. China now operates 333 diplomatic or official media accounts on Twitter, now known as X, with nearly 65 million followers, according to the report.
Those official accounts, it added, were bolstered by networks of bots and inauthentic accounts. From June 2020 to January 2021, a single network of those accounts impersonating British citizens accounted for 44 percent of the retweets and 20 percent of the replies to posts by Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador at the time and one of the outspoken "wolf warriors" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"Although more than half of Liu's retweets during this period came from accounts that were ultimately suspended for violating Twitter's terms of service at the time," the report said, "new accounts continued to pop up to prolong this inauthentic amplification." Twitter has since dropped the labels that identified foreign government accounts.
China uses similar accounts to stifle criticism. The report noted that more than 1,000 fake accounts sought to drown out a report last year by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights organization, that detailed the undisclosed presence of Chinese police officers in 53 countries. The campaign used accounts with the same name as the organization in what appeared to be an effort to trigger Twitter's policy to de-emphasize inauthentic campaigns.
The State Department's Global Engagement Center was established in 2011 with a focus on countering terrorism and violent extremism. In 2017 Congress extended its mandate to focus on propaganda and disinformation.
The impact of China's effort can be difficult to measure, and the report suggests that the Chinese campaigns often encounter resistance in other countries. The country's Communist Party appears committed, however, to reshaping the international environment suited to its political goals.
"We have every reason to believe that will continue," said Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga, a researcher at the RAND Corporation and a co-author of a recent report on China's reliance on artificial intelligence to bolster its information operations. "They're more likely to double down than they are to stop."

User-Made Images Could Bring The 'Social' Back to Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and several newcomers are betting on artificial intelligence to rejuvenate the fun, interactivity and whimsy of creating and sharing images.
Myuri Thiruna, a freelance photographer in Toronto, used to post frequently on Instagram and discuss photography with other users. But she said she had stopped two years ago, feeling "drained" by the demands of social media and the pursuit of followers and trends.
Then in July, Ms. Thiruna discovered Can of Soup, a new invitation-only social network where people make fantastical images of themselves with artificial intelligence and share the images with others. Enthralled by those abilities, she created A.I. images that showed her sitting on a unicorn floating in an ocean and her wearing a jacket made of Froot Loops.
Ms. Thiruna, 33, also commented on other users' posts, chatting with them and making images together. She now spends as much five hours a day interacting with others on the app, she said.
"I met so many people on this app that I didn't know before, and it goes beyond just posting and getting the likes," she said. "It's this meaningful connection with people and being also inspired by what they're doing."
Social networking apps are beginning to integrate A.I. into their image capabilities to make their platforms more social. After Facebook, Instagram and other apps have become more corporate over the years, A.I. imagery presents a way for them to bring back the whimsy and fun so users can rediscover what was once the point of the platforms: to share and interact with one another.
Large social platforms and new apps alike are incorporating A.I. image features. Last month, Snapchat announced Dreams, an A.I. imaging feature that lets users in Britain, Australia and New Zealand create outlandish selfies. TikTok last year rolled out several in-app filters that use A.I. to transform selfies into the style of a comic or a dreamlike character. BeFake, a social app launched in August, is also experimenting with A.I. selfies and images.
On Wednesday, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger jumped in as well. Meta, which owns the apps, said the services would now offer A.I. tools for instantly generating photorealistic "stickers," which can be shared. It added that it would introduce similar tools for editing and restyling existing images. These tools could put cowboy boots on two babies in a family photo, for instance.
"You can generate imagery inside of your chats," said Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta's vice president of generative A.I. While most image-generation tools need 10 to 20 seconds to create an image, he added, Meta's new tool needs only five.
The growing number of A.I. imagery tools in various apps underlines how "using A.I. interactively is where social media will go," said Sam Saliba, who was Instagram's global brand marketing lead and is now a marketing and branding consultant in Silicon Valley.
The trend takes A.I. images further than the apps that allowed people to produce A.I.-generated images without conversing or easily sharing them in an online community. Those apps included Lensa AI -- which let people create A.I. selfies in styles like "cosmic," "fairy princess" and "anime" -- as well as Remini, Snow and Wombo. Interest in those apps peaked in mid-December, and downloads have since declined, according to the market intelligence firm Apptopia.
Ben-Zion Benkhin, the founder of Wombo, said many people didn't stick with A.I. apps that were merely a "creation tool" and that gave users no ability to chat with one another about what they had produced.
"All of these apps are very limited," he said. Adding social networking, he said, "does connect you to the other people."
That understanding has helped drive new apps like BeFake, which has melded A.I. image features with socializing and sharing. BeFake prompts users at a different time every day to take a picture with their smartphone's front and back cameras and then has A.I. transform the image.
Users need to share their posts before viewing other people's posts. The concept was borrowed from BeReal, a photo-sharing app that has been popular among young users.
BeFake connects people through their creativity, said Kristen Garcia Dumont, one of the app's founders. "What that means to each person is unique and intriguing, and you get to explore that with whoever you want in the app," she said.
BeFake's parent company has raised $ 3 million, and the app has tens of thousands of users, said Ms. Dumont and her co-founder, Tracy Lane.
Hayley Fligel, 17, a high school student in Burlingame, Calif., said she began using BeFake in July after a friend invited her to join. It's different from apps like Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram, which are stressful because "if you want to take pictures or videos of yourself, you have to get ready, you have to get dressed, and you have to be doing something or have a nice background around you," she said.
She said she could use A.I. on BeFake to make herself look like Taylor Swift or appear that she was playing volleyball, which shows "a more personal snippet of who you are." While she seldom interacts with others on Instagram, she said, she comments on her friends' posts on BeFake and browses a "Discovery" feed for inspiration from other posts.
Gabriel Birnbaum, who created Can of Soup with Eric Meier in May, said the point was to encourage creation and have fun. "It's an app where you spend time with your friends," he said.
Since then, he said, he has seen many creative and social moments happen in the app. In particular, a feature called Stir -- which lets users put themselves in scenarios that someone else created -- makes up one in four posts on the platform, Mr. Birnbaum said, with people inserting themselves into an A.I. image of Einstein inside a black hole in space, for example.
Mr. Birnbaum, who declined to disclose Can of Soup's funding and number of users, said he didn't plan to roll out the app widely until it had the "right trust and safety" with users comfortable with the content and whom they create photos with.
"I like the creation aspect and people liking my work and interacting with them," said Alex Rosenblatt, 35, of San Francisco, who has used Can of Soup since June. "Most of my interactions on it are with people I don't know, actually."

Antitrust Clash Is True Cage Match For Big Tech: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chair of the Federal Trade Commission wants to disrupt Amazon, whose founder built a trillion-dollar firm by disrupting retail.
Jeff Bezos made his fortune with one truly big idea: What if a retailer did everything possible to make customers happy?
His forcefully nurtured creation, Amazon, sold as many items as possible as cheaply as possible and delivered them as quickly as possible. The result is that $ 40 out of every $ 100 spent online in the United States goes to Amazon and Mr. Bezos is worth $ 150 billion.
Lina Khan made her reputation with a very different idea: What if pleasing the customer was not enough?
Low prices, she argued in a 95-page examination of Amazon in The Yale Law Journal, can mask behavior that stifles competition and undermines society. Published in 2017 while she was still a law student, it is already one of the most consequential academic papers of modern times.
These two very different philosophies, each pushed by an outsider unafraid of taking risks, at last have their much-anticipated confrontation. The Federal Trade Commission, now run by Ms. Khan after her stunning rise from policy wonk to policy player, filed suit against Amazon on Tuesday in federal court in Seattle. The suit accused Amazon of being a monopolist that used unfair and illegal tactics to maintain its power. Amazon said the suit was "wrong on the facts and the law."
Mr. Bezos, 59, is no longer in charge of Amazon on a day-to-day basis. He surrendered the chief executive reins to Andy Jassy two years ago. But make no mistake: Mr. Bezos is Amazon's executive chair and owns more of the company than anyone else. It is his innovations, carried out over more than 20 years, that Ms. Khan is challenging. The F.T.C. complaint quotes him repeatedly.
Silicon Valley spent the summer transfixed by the prospect of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg literally fighting each other, despite the odds of this actually happening being near zero. Ms. Khan and Mr. Bezos are, however, the real thing -- a courtroom clash that could have implications far beyond Amazon's 1.5 million employees, 300 million customers and $ 1.3 trillion valuation.
If Ms. Khan's arguments hold sway, the competitive landscape for tech companies will look very different going forward. Big antitrust cases tend to have that effect. The government achieved only a muddled victory in its pursuit of Microsoft 25 years ago. Yet that still had enough force to distract and weaken a much-feared software empire, allowing 1,000 start-ups to bloom, including Amazon.
It's largely because of Ms. Khan, 34, that imposing major changes on the retailer is even thinkable. After spending a few days interviewing her and those around her for a profile in 2018, I thought she understood Mr. Bezos because she was so much like him. Very few people can see possibilities unseen by others and successfully work toward them for years, getting others to join along the way. But these were attributes they both shared.
"How does change happen in history?" asked Stacy Mitchell, an early Khan ally who is co-executive director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy group that promotes local power to fight corporations. "Lina has captured imaginations in a way that has enabled the reform movement to engage a wider set of people."
Ms. Khan and Mr. Bezos were even similar in their silence. For years, every article about Amazon featured the line "Amazon declined to comment," another form of control. Ms. Khan likewise never willingly surrendered to me a piece of personal data, even if it was inconsequential.
Amazon and the F.T.C. declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Bezos' unlikely saga long ago entered the realm of myth. He spent his childhood summers on his grandfather's West Texas ranch, wanted to be a theoretical physicist but became a Wall Street analyst instead. He had no retailing background. He was interested in ideas, not things.
Amazon was not the first online store -- it wasn't even the first online bookstore. It spent lots of money foolishly and drove many employees mercilessly. The whole enterprise nearly failed in the dot-com crash in the early 2000s. But the media was fascinated by it, customers liked it, and that gave Mr. Bezos room to run.
A former Amazon engineer once memorably described Mr. Bezos as making "ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies." A company that puts "attendance reminder" signs in bathroom stalls telling warehouse workers they will be "reviewed for termination" if they screw up their time keeping is a company with overwhelming ambition.
Reformers are just like entrepreneurs: They, too, are fighting against reality, trying to carve out space for their vision of how things could be better. Ms. Khan's journey to confronting Amazon in federal court is in some ways an even less likely tale than Mr. Bezos'. And so, like Mr. Bezos in the early years of Amazon, she has become a figure of fascination.
The daughter of Pakistani immigrants by way of London, Ms. Khan had the natural instincts of a good journalist. At Williams College, where she worked on the school paper, a friend described her as especially interested in understanding power, particularly the way it conceals itself to seize more power. She was in her late 20s when she wrote her paper on Amazon -- about Mr. Bezos' age when he quit his Wall Street job to drive with his wife at the time, MacKenzie Scott, west to Seattle and his destiny.
Antitrust law was the traditional tool used to rein in companies that became too powerful. Antitrust played a major role in the 1890s, marking the beginning of the Progressive Era, and again in the 1930s under the New Deal. But by the early 1980s, antitrust was at a low ebb. The so-called consumer welfare standard reduced antitrust down to one issue: the price customers paid. If prices were low, there was no problem.
The Microsoft case was important and influential, but it was very much an aberration. In the early years of this century, the prevailing laissez-faire philosophy allowed not just Amazon but other start-ups to rise much quicker than they might otherwise have. Facebook and Google charged users nothing, and were allowed to acquire their way to dominance. Six of the eight most valuable U.S. companies are tech companies -- seven if you consider Tesla a tech firm.
Government was slow; Silicon Valley was fast. The marketplace would decide the fate of corporate empires. By 2015, when Ms. Khan was entering law school, hardly anyone was interested in promoting competition through government intervention. Criminal justice reform, environmental law, immigration -- those were the topics that appealed to students. She chose antitrust, practically alone.
Anyone with a radical idea in Washington faces so many obstacles that it is not surprising it happens so rarely. When Ms. Khan was nominated to be chair of the F.T.C. in 2021, Amazon complained that she was biased.
"She has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up," the company wrote in a 25-page petition to have Ms. Khan recused from any judgment on it.
The logic: If you are critical of a company, you can't be allowed anywhere near it as a regulator. Ms. Khan survived this challenge, but it was only the first. To go against the live-and-let-live attitude of many bureaucrats, a relentless determination is required.
A hostile media is another hurdle. Dozens of Wall Street Journal editorials, opinion essays and letters to the editor have criticized Ms. Khan over the last two years. They called for Congress to investigate her, argued she didn't understand that monopolies were actually good and accused her of letting people die by blocking a drug company merger.
Then there is the lobbying. Amazon spent $ 10 million in the first half of this year, five times the 2013 level. It gave money to hundreds of trade associations and nonprofits in 2022, some of which issue pro-Amazon reports without publicizing their funding. Under the "know your enemy" philosophy, Amazon has also been staffing up with Ms. Khan's former F.T.C. colleagues.
Getting to court offers little relief. Well steeped in decades of the consumer welfare standard, judges are not particularly encouraging to Ms. Khan's arguments. Cases against Meta, Facebook's parent company, and more recently Microsoft have faltered. The Amazon case incorporates aspects of the consumer welfare standard, which might make it more palatable in court.
It's a formidable amount of opposition. Even some of her ideological foes are impressed that Ms. Khan is nevertheless having such an impact. By sheer force of intellect, she is opening up a conversation about how companies are allowed to behave.
"Five years ago, you would have been laughed out of the room if you challenged the consumer welfare standard," said Konstantin Medvedovsky, a former antitrust lawyer who is now a hedge fund analyst. "Now serious people make that argument at major conferences and are taken seriously. That's Lina's triumph."
Mr. Medvedovsky is not very sympathetic to Ms. Khan's enforcement agenda. He was one of the critics who derided the reform movement as "hipster" antitrust. Still, he said, "It's hard not to be somewhat in awe."

U.A.W. Says Auto Strike Could Grow: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union said the strikes against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could grow on Friday if negotiators don't make enough progress.
The United Automobile Workers union said on Wednesday that it planned to expand its strike against the big three Michigan automakers on Friday if negotiators failed to make substantial progress on new contracts.
The union ordered workers to walk off the job nearly two weeks ago at three vehicle assembly plants -- each owned by one of the companies, General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler and Jeep. Last Friday the union broadened the strike to include spare parts-distribution centers owned by G.M. and Stellantis, saying it had made progress in its talks with Ford.
The U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, is scheduled to update members in a video streamed live on Facebook on Friday morning.
The union is seeking a substantial wage increase to make up for much smaller raises over the last decade. Each of the companies has offered to lift wages by roughly 20 percent over four years, about half of what the U.A.W. is seeking. The union has demanded other measures including cost-of-living adjustments, the right to strike to protest plant closures, pensions for more workers and company-paid health care for retirees.
The three plants that have been shut down by the strike include a G.M. factory in Wentzville, Mo., a Ford plant in Wayne, Mich., and a Stellantis complex in Toledo, Ohio. They make some of the manufacturers' most profitable models, including the GMC Canyon pickup truck, the Ford Bronco sport-utility vehicle, and the Jeep Wrangler.
The second wave of the strike idled 20 Stellantis parts-distribution centers and 18 owned by G.M. More than 18,000 U.A.W. workers are now on strike. The union represents about 150,000 workers employed by G.M., Ford and Stellantis.
The union and the companies started negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in July, but made little progress until this month. Their contracts expired on Sept. 14 and Mr. Fain called on the first round of work stoppages the following day.

Full text: Ryan Bizzarro, a Democrat and member of Pennsylvania's House of Representatives, announced a bid to challenge the Republican incumbent, Stacy Garrity, by invoking issues galvanizing to Democrats.
A Pennsylvania Democrat announced a bid for state treasurer on Tuesday by seeking to tie his Republican opponent to two of the country's most incendiary issues: abortion rights and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
In his announcement video, Ryan Bizzarro, a member of the state House of Representatives, accuses the Republican incumbent, Stacy Garrity, of being "Pennsylvania's highest-ranking extremist office holder." He highlights her past support for abortion restrictions and her appearance at a rally in Harrisburg the day before the Capitol riot in which she appeared to endorse former President Donald J. Trump's false claims that the election was rigged.
Campaigns for a lower-profile office like state treasurer -- where the duties include managing the government's cash flow, not setting policy -- have tended to fly under voters' radars. But in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, where the presidency and a U.S. Senate seat will be fiercely contested in 2024, down-ballot races, too, can take on intense partisanship over issues with little connection to an official's duties.
"She's one of those extreme folks we've got to get rid of," Mr. Bizzarro said in an interview. His opening salvo takes a page from the playbook of Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who ran in 2022 against a hard-right opponent by promising to protect abortion and voting rights. Abortion rights in particular proved a galvanizing issue for Democrats in the midterm elections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But while Pennsylvania's governor has immense sway over those issues, its treasurer does not.
A campaign adviser to Ms. Garrity, Dennis Roddy, said that bringing abortion and Jan. 6 into the race was an effort to dodge the fact that Ms. Garrity has been a successful steward of Pennsylvania's money.
"She's done a hell of a job, she's well liked and this is just the usual 'let's nationalize an election we can't win on the merits,"' he said.
Mr. Bizzarro's announcement video begins with harrowing scenes of the violent attack on the Capitol, then cuts to Ms. Garrity at a Jan. 5, 2021, rally in Harrisburg that was organized to pressure Pennsylvania lawmakers to decertify the state's vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. After courts in Pennsylvania had already rejected multiple claims of fraud by the Trump campaign and allies, Ms. Garrity insisted to the crowd, "The election from this November is tarnished forever."
Ms. Garrity, an Iraq war veteran who defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2020, has also shown an inclination to lean into national issues. Her campaign Facebook page recently criticized Mr. Biden's "hasty and spineless retreat" from Afghanistan, equated "Bidenomics=Bideninflation" and joined a chorus of Republican critics of Senator John Fetterman's shorts-and-sweatshirt wardrobe.
In the past, Ms. Garrity, 59, has asked people to "please pray" for the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade and called to defund Planned Parenthood. In 2020, she boasted of being endorsed by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a group that says it exists "to end abortion."
Mr. Bizzarro, 37, the House Democratic Policy Chair, comes from a family of professional prizefighters in Erie County, Pa. It is unclear if he will have a primary competitor. He appears in his video inside a boxing ring.

Art Institutes' Last 8 Campuses Abruptly Close: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The for-profit network of colleges is closing its final eight campuses several years after it shuttered most of them.
Hundreds of students and faculty members were left stunned on Friday by the news that the Art Institutes, a system of for-profit colleges, would close its eight remaining campuses across the United States by the end of this month.
The system had suffered from low enrollment since the coronavirus pandemic began. Previous challenges included a $ 95 million settlement after fraud allegations in 2015 and a loss of accreditation that led to the shuttering of nearly 20 other locations in 2018.
When Hannah Grabhorn, 21, a sophomore studying games, art and design at the Art Institute of Atlanta, received an email on Friday that said her school was closing, she looked for more answers online. But every page on the school's website referred her back to the same notice. The email said that "the Art Institutes do not anticipate any further communication."
Grabhorn said she and her classmates were informed of the closure one day after final exams for the school's summer quarter.
"All of us were crying," she said.
The Department of Education said 1,700 students would be affected by the decision. In addition to Atlanta, campuses are closing in Austin, Texas; Dallas; Houston; Miami; San Antonio; Tampa, Fla.; and Virginia Beach.
The Art Institutes did not respond to emails and phone requests for comment.
"There are students who thought they were pursuing an education who are now going to be left out in the cold," said Deborah Obalil, executive director of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design, a nonprofit consortium.
Traditional models of arts education have experienced contractions, Obalil said. Some schools, such as the San Francisco Art Institute, are declaring bankruptcy, while others, like the Watkins College of Art in Nashville, are merging with larger institutions to save themselves.
"We are at an inflection point," Obalil said. "Delivering an arts and design curriculum is an expensive operation."
The Art Institutes were often marketed as cheaper options, with some students saying they were quoted about $ 90,000 for a full degree's tuition. One year of tuition at a prestigious alternative like the Rhode Island School of Design is about $ 58,700.
Experts said that federal rules requiring educational institutions to provide students with a "teach-out" plan for completing their degrees after a closure might not apply to for-profit schools. The Education Department has proposed a rule change to include for-profit schools in the guidelines, but the policy would not go into effect until July 2024.
"We are committed to supporting students as they explore options to continue their education or apply for a closed school loan discharge," the department said in a statement. "We are working to post information as soon as possible."
Teachers at the Art Institutes were also surprised by the news.
Anne Perry, an instructor at the Art Institute of Dallas, posted on Facebook that she would "grieve over its fate," calling the school "a creative, life-giving place to work."
"I got the message right after I had met on Zoom with a student, and we had expressed looking forward to next quarter," Perry wrote, adding, "Now it will be a different road, for many."
Sara Perez Sanders enrolled her daughter, Justice, at the Art Institute of Virginia Beach after Justice earned a scholarship that paid for half of the tuition. She covered the rest with money from the G.I. Bill of Rights, which began offering expanded education benefits in 2009.
"I though it was a hoax," she said of the school's closure. "I told my daughter to call her adviser, but the phone lines were disconnected. She was in the middle of uploading her last assignments."
The school network traces its history back to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, which was founded in 1921. A Pennsylvania company named Education Management Corporation acquired the college in 1970 before expanding its portfolio and adding courses such as culinary arts, fashion design, audio production and video games. By 2010, the company made $ 2.5 billion annually, with $ 1.8 billion coming from Education Department grants and student loans.
Five years later, Education Management Corporation settled claims with the Justice Department about illegal recruiting, consumer fraud and other claims.
Problems only grew after a faith-based nonprofit called Dream Center Education Holdings acquired the schools in 2017. After settling a class-action lawsuit that said that four Art Institutes were misleading students into believing they were accredited institutions, all that remained of the brand was a handful of campuses.
Grabhorn, the student at the Art Institute of Atlanta, said she was in a better position than those of her peers who needed only one more quarter of school before graduating. She has a couple of months before most schools begin their spring semesters to plan her next steps. Her teachers are also looking for new jobs.
"I immediately messaged my professor, who said he was really shocked," she said. "He asked for a testimonial."

Arsenic Preserved the Animals but Killed a Taxidermy Museum: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A popular taxidermy exhibit in Sioux Falls, S.D., was closed after the toxic substance was discovered laced throughout the specimens. Many lament the loss of the "works of art."
Usually, you go to the zoo to look at live animals. But at the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, people also went to see the dead ones.
The attraction, called the Delbridge Museum of Natural History, hosted one of the most impressive taxidermy collections in the country, with some 150 animals from six continents, each meticulously positioned in a diorama depicting their natural habitat. There, visitors could encounter -- up close -- a (stationary) mob of kangaroos, a pouncing lion, a panda eating bamboo and more.
On Aug. 18, Sioux Falls and Great Plains Zoo officials announced that the Delbridge Museum had closed after nearly 40 years, citing an increased risk of chemical exposure to staff and visitors as the animal specimens age. At a news conference, streamed live on Facebook on Aug. 29, they specified that a majority of the taxidermy mounts contained arsenic, a toxic substance that can cause pregnancy complications, cancer and even death.
"When we have a known carcinogen in one of our public displays, we can't take risk," Paul TenHaken, the mayor of Sioux Falls, said at the conference. Dave Pfeifle, city attorney for Sioux Falls, added that "there are no acceptable levels of risk regarding arsenic."
But the museum's closing has drawn a backlash from Sioux Falls residents, many of whom have fond memories of visiting the taxidermy collection and worry that the decision represents the first step toward its disposal. Some feel the city is not being transparent about the risk, while others suspect that the zoo wants to get rid of the museum to make room for newer attractions.
Greg Neitzert, a member of the Sioux Falls City Council, described the closing as an "out of the blue" decision that had come as a shock to him and other council members. He said the reasoning "just isn't passing the smell test" -- that the risk alone should not lead to the museum's decommissioning.
Conservators at large worry that the museum's closing could raise undue concern over how safe antique collections truly are. "This is already something that bubbles along the surface for natural history museums," said Fran Ritchie, chair of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections' conservation committee. "And then to have something boil over like this -- it's difficult." Since the closing, she said, her colleagues have been contacted by other museums anxious to know if they should remove taxidermy pieces from display, or get rid of them entirely.
The presence of arsenic is not uncommon in antique artifacts. The element is prevalently found in green pigments that were once used to dye clothing, book covers and even artificial flowers, according to Ms. Ritchie. (In the Victorian era, she said, people even ate small amounts of arsenic, hoping to make their skin appear pale.)
Arsenic can exist organically in animals and plants, but it is the inorganic kind, found in soil and groundwater, that can be harmful. Before the 1980s, inorganic arsenic "soap" was used in taxidermy as an embalming agent, applied to the inside of an animal skin to prevent harmful pests. The skin was then pasted over a mannequin shaped in the animal's likeness, and sewn together to create a realistic mount.
"These aren't stuffed animals, these are model sculptures," said John Janelli, former president of the National Taxidermy Association. Most of the specimens at the Delbridge Museum were procured between the 1940s and 1970s by Henry Brockhouse, a Sioux Falls businessman and hunter, and the skins were mounted by the Jonas family, renowned taxidermists in the conservation world, Mr. Janelli said.
Mr. Brockhouse displayed the animals behind glass, in the back of West Sioux Hardware, a store he owned, until his death in 1978. In 1981, his attorney, C.J. Delbridge, purchased the collection at a public auction and donated it to the city of Sioux Falls. Three years later, the Delbridge Museum opened, one of only a few natural history collections in the state.
The value of the exhibit extends beyond Sioux Falls, Ms. Ritchie said, in part because many of the species it includes are now protected, so a collection like this could never be replicated. Taxidermy is an invaluable educational tool, offering "a chance to get up close to an animal in a way that you cannot do safely in the wild," she said. "It creates an experience that's unlike anything else."
According to Becky Dewitz, chief executive of the Great Plains Zoo, who spoke at the Aug. 29 news conference, an appraisal had concluded that at least 45 percent of the collection showed wear and tear. In a chemical analysis, 79.5 percent of the mounts tested positive for arsenic.
Conservators generally assume that all taxidermy mounts dating from before the 1980s were probably made using arsenical soap, Ms. Ritchie said. That the substance was applied to the inside means that, as the mounts age, arsenic is exposed around the seams, where the skin separates from the mannequin.
At a city council meeting on Aug. 29, Ms. Dewitz showed photos of the deterioration on many of the larger animals in the museum, including a zebra, an elephant and a giraffe. "Gravity and age are not kind, even when you're 15 feet tall," she said. Reported levels of arsenic ranged from 0.5 to 54.6 milligrams per kilogram.
But Kerith Schrager, an objects conservator at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum who specializes in hazardous collections, said that such data generally reveal little about the risk of exposure. "I can have a bottle of alcohol sitting on my desk, but if I don't ever open it or touch it or drink it, I'm not exposed to it," Ms. Schrager said.
With arsenic, the route of exposure matters. Ingestion is the most harmful, followed by inhalation, then skin contact. Milligrams per kilogram is a common dose measurement for arsenic levels in food, Ms. Schrager said, but it is not useful for assessing surface or air contamination, which are the primary ways that museum staff or visitors might be exposed to the chemical.
To accurately determine that risk requires an in-depth exposure assessment, Ms. Schrager said. This includes monitoring the breathing of a visitor as they "go about their business," and taking wipe samples of anything touched, to test for cross contamination. Museums can then make adjustments where needed, such as enclosing the mounts in airtight glass cases or working with taxidermists to redo the mounts without arsenical pesticides.
But that comes with a hefty price tag, Ms. Dewitz said. Installing glass and updating the museum's ventilation system for better climate control could reach up to $ 4.2 million; a new building for the collection could cost up to $ 14 million.
Sioux Falls residents at the city council meeting responded emotionally. "My soul is just broken," said Beverly Bosch, the youngest daughter of Mr. Brockhouse. "This was my dad's life."
On Sept. 15, Mr. TenHaken, the Sioux Falls mayor, announced the assembly of a new work group to develop a plan to make the taxidermy collection surplus, which marks the property as no longer useful to the city. But even if that occurs, navigating federal and state laws and figuring out what to do with the collection will prove tricky, as many of the animals are considered protected species.
"These are like works of art," Mr. Neitzert said. "You don't throw works of art away -- not lightly."
Mr. TenHaken affirmed that the city would not simply dispose of the collection in a landfill. "We wouldn't just take artifacts like this and treat them like a Papa John's pizza box," he said at the Aug. 29 news conference.
But some Sioux Falls residents want to keep the animals on display. A Facebook page for the effort has amassed over 1,500 followers. Mr. Neitzert plans to propose that the city hire a conservator to independently assess the situation.
John Sweets, owner of the building that used to be West Sioux Hardware, said he felt a personal obligation to help save the collection, because he is so frequently stopped by older residents reminiscing about the magic of the building's former contents.
The space currently functions as a warehouse, but Mr. Sweets dreams of turning it into an artists' bazaar, perhaps with taxidermy mounts arrayed throughout: the elephant here, the giraffe and hippo there. If the zoo can no longer house the animals, "let's get them to a place where they can go," he said. "And it just so happens that I own a place."

Croatian Museums Return Stolen Art: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The collection of a Zagreb businessman murdered in Auschwitz includes paintings by André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, along with lithographs by Picasso and Cézanne.
Three museums in Zagreb have returned artworks looted from a Jewish businessman, giving them to his grandson after court decisions that resolved a 70-year dispute and paved the way for the first reported Holocaust-era art restitution in Croatia.
The works returned to the heir, Andy Reichsman, this week include two paintings from the National Museum of Modern Art, André Derain's "Still Life With a Bottle" and Maurice de Vlaminck's "Landscape by the Water," as well as lithographs by Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Bonnard from the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.
"This seems almost beyond belief," Reichsman said in a phone interview from Zagreb. "I thought that our chances would be one in a million. They never had any interest in giving anything back to Jews."
Croatia's Jewish community was almost wiped out in the Holocaust after the invasion by the Axis powers and the creation in 1941 of the fascist Independent State of Croatia in parts of occupied Yugoslavia. Jews were evicted from their homes and forced to leave behind their belongings.
For decades, Croatia deflected claims for art looted from Jews during the Holocaust era. But in a major shift last year, the Croatian government cooperated with the World Jewish Restitution Organization to publish a joint report that chronicles the thefts and lists some of the stolen collections, many of which are still held by Croatian museums.
Nina Obuljen Korzinek, the Croatian minister of culture and media, said at the time that the report demonstrated the government "shares the wish to provide Holocaust survivors and their heirs with a fair measure of justice."
The president of the restitution organization, Gideon Taylor, welcomed the decisions to return the works to Reichsman. "This is a positive step in dealing with outstanding Holocaust-era restitution issues in Croatia," he said in a statement.
Reichsman's grandfather Dane Reichsmann was the wealthy owner of a large department store in Zagreb before World War II. After the Gestapo imprisoned Reichsman's father, Franz Reichsman, for two months in Vienna in 1938, he fled to the United States. His sister, Andy Reichsman's aunt, left for London. (Franz Reichsman dropped an N from his surname after fleeing to the United States.)
But Dane Reichsmann remained behind in Zagreb. He and his wife, Frieda Reichsmann, were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. His art collection was seized by the fascist Ustashe regime.
Danica Svoboda, Andy Reichsman's aunt, tried for 50 years to recover the looted art.
"She traveled to Zagreb every summer and met with gallery directors, government officials and anyone she felt could help her in her attempts to retrieve the art," Reichsman said.
After her death more than 20 years ago, her nephew continued her quest. The Zagreb Municipal Court ruled in December 2020 that the artworks had rightfully belonged to Svoboda; a second court decision, in 2021, declared Andy Reichsman her heir.
Monja Matic, the Croatian lawyer who has worked on Reichsman's behalf for two decades, said she was "very glad he had so much patience."
In a statement on Facebook, the National Museum of Modern Art expressed regret that the restitution had taken three generations. It said that museums throughout Croatia, with the support of the culture ministry, are now "working intensively on researching provenance" for artworks when there is "a well-founded suspicion that they were unjustly confiscated during World War II."
Reichsman also reclaimed a bronze plaque and a copper tray and bowl from a third museum, the Zagreb Museum of Arts and Crafts. His lawyer is seeking to recover 19 additional objects from the museum, including porcelain and a silver samovar.

Baton Rouge Police Used 'Torture Warehouse' to Interrogate Suspects, Suit Says: [National Desk]

Full text: Lawsuits filed in federal court said officers detained, abused and humiliated detainees in an unmarked "torture warehouse."
A grandmother detained by the Baton Rouge police for mixing two different prescription pills in the same container said officers interrogated and humiliated her in an unmarked "torture warehouse" known as the Brave Cave, according to a lawsuit filed last week.
The woman, Ternell L. Brown, was pulled over by officers on June 10 and "forcibly" transported to the warehouse, where she was stripped and cavity searched, according to the suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.
It was unclear from the documents why Ms. Brown, who was with her husband, was pulled over in the first place.
She was held at the warehouse for more than two hours before being released without being charged, according to the suit, which identified the officers as Troy Lawrence Jr. and Matthew Wallace. Another female officer, who was not named, was also involved, according to the complaint.
Officer Lawrence, who was described in court documents as having an "extensive record of injuring members of the public," resigned on Aug. 29, television station WAFB reported.
He was charged on Thursday with battery in connection with a separate incident on Aug. 8, in which he is accused of using a stun gun on a handcuffed male subject before he could comply with verbal orders, the Baton Rouge Police Department said on Facebook.
The warehouse, run by the Street Crimes Unit of the Baton Rouge Police Department, was closed in recent weeks after allegations similar to those raised by Ms. Brown came to light, according to the documents.
On Friday, the F.B.I. opened a civil rights investigation into the allegations, saying it was based on "allegations that members of the department may have abused their authority."
In a statement, the Baton Rouge Police Department confirmed the F.B.I. investigation, adding that Murphy J. Paul Jr., the police chief, had met with the F.B.I. and requested its help to "ensure an independent review of these complaints."
"The Baton Rouge Police Department is committed to addressing these troubling accusations and has initiated administrative and criminal investigations," the department said, noting that the Street Crimes Unit was "disbanded and reassigned."
According to Ms. Brown's lawsuit, the officers switched off their body cameras and searched her without a warrant, probable cause or consent.
"They were not acting as rogue officers when they sexually humiliated Mrs. Brown; rather, they were simply carrying out official BRPD policy," court records said.
Another lawsuit, filed on Aug. 29 in the same court, said that Officers Lawrence and Wallace, as well as another officer, Joseph Carboni, beat a 21-year-old man so badly that he had to be treated at a hospital for broken bones and other injuries.
The man, Jeremy Lee, was arrested in front of a house in Baton Rouge on Jan. 9 and detained "without reasonable suspicion or probable cause," according to court records.
Police handcuffed Mr. Lee and forced him down on a street near the house, where they pulled down his pants to search him and, despite Mr. Lee's insistence that he was being hurt, proceeded to shove and throw him around, according to the complaint.
Officers Lawrence and Wallace, who frequently muted or switched off their body cameras during the interaction, then took Mr. Lee to the "Brave Cave," where they were joined by Officer Carboni, the court papers said.
The three "repeatedly kicked and punched" Mr. Lee, according to the complaint.
"Mr. Lee's screams for help and screams in pain could be heard throughout the facility," court documents said, noting that the officers "laughed at and mocked" him for his pain.
The officers switched off their body cameras before the beating, which left Mr. Lee with a fractured rib and visible damage to his face, according to the documents. Mr. Lee was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
Neither the Baton Rouge Police Department nor the Southern States Police Benevolent Association responded to questions about whether or not the officers involved in both Ms. Brown and Mr. Lee's cases were facing disciplinary actions.
Mr. Lawrence and Officers Carboni and Wallace could not be reached for comment on Sunday night. Mayor Sharon Weston Broome also could not be reached.
According to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Ms. Brown, the "Brave Cave" was not a jail or detention facility but rather a warehouse adopted as the home base of the Street Crimes Unit.
"It is a place where BRPD takes suspects to interrogate them, gather intelligence and attempt to 'flip' them to begin cooperating with BRPD," the complaint states.
In a news conference last month, Chief Paul said he was "aware of the facility" and referred to the warehouse as a "narcotics processing center" but said he had been unaware of its nickname.
The lawsuits follow other allegations of misconduct in the Baton Rouge Police Department, which came under scrutiny in 2016 after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old Black man, Alton Sterling.
Officers were also found to have violated department policy when they strip-searched a teenager in 2021. The same year, an internal investigation of the department's narcotics unit led to criminal charges and internal discipline for the officers involved.

Arsenic Preserved the Animals but Killed the Museum

Usually, you go to the zoo to look at live animals. But at the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, people also went to see the dead ones.
The attraction, called the Delbridge Museum of Natural History, hosted one of the most impressive taxidermy collections in the country, with some 150 animals from six continents, each meticulously positioned in a diorama depicting their natural habitat. There, visitors could encounter — up close — a (stationary) mob of kangaroos, a pouncing lion, a panda eating bamboo and more.
On Aug. 18, Sioux Falls and Great Plains Zoo officials announced that the Delbridge Museum had closed after nearly 40 years, citing an increased risk of chemical exposure to staff and visitors as the animal specimens age. At a news conference, streamed live on Facebook on Aug. 29, they specified that a majority of the taxidermy mounts contained arsenic, a toxic substance that can cause pregnancy complications, cancer and even death.
“When we have a known carcinogen in one of our public displays, we can’t take risk,” Paul TenHaken, the mayor of Sioux Falls, said at the news conference. Dave Pfeifle, city attorney for Sioux Falls, added that “there are no acceptable levels of risk regarding arsenic.”
But the museum’s closing has drawn a backlash from Sioux Falls residents, many of whom have fond memories of visiting the taxidermy collection and worry that the decision represents the first step toward its disposal. Some feel the city is not being transparent about the risk, while others suspect that the zoo wants to get rid of the museum to make room for newer attractions.
Greg Neitzert, a member of the Sioux Falls City Council, described the closing as an “out of the blue” decision that had come as a shock to him and other council members. He said the reasoning “just isn’t passing the smell test” — that the risk alone should not lead to the museum’s decommissioning.
Conservators at large worry that the museum’s closing could raise undue concern over how safe antique collections truly are. “This is already something that bubbles along the surface for natural history museums,” said Fran Ritchie, chair of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections’ conservation committee. “And then to have something boil over like this — it’s difficult.” Since the closing, she said, her colleagues have been contacted by other museums anxious to know if they should remove taxidermy pieces from display, or get rid of them entirely.
The presence of arsenic is not uncommon in antique artifacts. The element is prevalently found in green pigments that were once used to dye clothing, book covers and even artificial flowers, according to Ritchie. (In the Victorian era, she said, people even ate small amounts of arsenic, hoping to make their skin appear pale.)
Arsenic can exist organically in animals and plants, but it is the inorganic kind, found in soil and groundwater, that can be harmful. Before the 1980s, inorganic arsenic “soap” was used in taxidermy as an embalming agent, applied to the inside of an animal skin to prevent harmful pests. The skin was then pasted over a mannequin shaped in the animal’s likeness, and sewn together to create a realistic mount.
“These aren’t stuffed animals, these are model sculptures,” said John Janelli, former president of the National Taxidermy Association. Most of the specimens at the Delbridge Museum were procured between the 1940s and 1970s by Henry Brockhouse, a Sioux Falls businessperson and hunter, and the skins were mounted by the Jonas family, renowned taxidermists in the conservation world, Janelli said.
Brockhouse displayed the animals behind glass, in the back of West Sioux Hardware, a store he owned, until his death in 1978. In 1981, his attorney, C.J. Delbridge, purchased the collection at a public auction and donated it to the city of Sioux Falls. Three years later, the Delbridge Museum opened, one of only a few natural history collections in the state.
The value of the exhibit extends beyond Sioux Falls, Ritchie said, in part because many of the species it includes are now protected, so a collection like this could never be replicated. Taxidermy is an invaluable educational tool, offering “a chance to get up close to an animal in a way that you cannot do safely in the wild,” she said. “It creates an experience that’s unlike anything else.”
According to Becky Dewitz, CEO of the Great Plains Zoo, who spoke at the Aug. 29 news conference, an appraisal had concluded that at least 45% of the collection showed wear and tear. In a chemical analysis, 79.5% of the mounts tested positive for arsenic.
Conservators generally assume that all taxidermy mounts dating from before the 1980s were probably made using arsenical soap, Ritchie said. That the substance was applied to the inside means that, as the mounts age, arsenic is exposed around the seams, where the skin separates from the mannequin.
At a City Council meeting on Aug. 29, Dewitz showed photos of the deterioration on many of the larger animals in the museum, including a zebra, an elephant and a giraffe. “Gravity and age are not kind, even when you’re 15 feet tall,” she said. Reported levels of arsenic ranged from 0.5 to 54.6 milligrams per kilogram.
But Kerith Schrager, an objects conservator at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum who specializes in hazardous collections, said that such data generally reveal little about the risk of exposure. “I can have a bottle of alcohol sitting on my desk, but if I don’t ever open it or touch it or drink it, I’m not exposed to it,” Schrager said.
With arsenic, the route of exposure matters. Ingestion is the most harmful, followed by inhalation, then skin contact. Milligrams per kilogram is a common dose measurement for arsenic levels in food, Schrager said, but it is not useful for assessing surface or air contamination, which are the primary ways that museum staff or visitors might be exposed to the chemical.
To accurately determine that risk requires an in-depth exposure assessment, Schrager said. This includes monitoring the breathing of a visitor as they “go about their business,” and taking wipe samples of anything touched, to test for cross contamination. Museums can then make adjustments where needed, such as enclosing the mounts in airtight glass cases or working with taxidermists to redo the mounts without arsenical pesticides.
But that comes with a hefty price tag, Dewitz said. Installing glass and updating the museum’s ventilation system for better climate control could reach up to $4.2 million; a new building for the collection could cost up to $14 million.
Sioux Falls residents at the City Council meeting responded emotionally. “My soul is just broken,” said Beverly Bosch, the youngest daughter of Brockhouse. “This was my dad’s life.”
On Sept. 15, TenHaken, the Sioux Falls mayor, announced the assembly of a new work group to develop a plan to make the taxidermy collection surplus, which marks the property as no longer useful to the city. But even if that occurs, navigating federal and state laws and figuring out what to do with the collection will prove tricky, as many of the animals are considered protected species.
“These are like works of art,” Neitzert said. “You don’t throw works of art away — not lightly.”
TenHaken affirmed that the city would not simply dispose of the collection in a landfill. “We wouldn’t just take artifacts like this and treat them like a Papa John’s pizza box,” he said at the Aug. 29 news conference.
But some Sioux Falls residents want to keep the animals on display. A Facebook page for the effort has amassed over 1,500 followers. Neitzert plans to propose that the city hire a conservator to independently assess the situation.
John Sweets, owner of the building that used to be West Sioux Hardware, said he felt a personal obligation to help save the collection, because he is so frequently stopped by older residents reminiscing about the magic of the building’s former contents.
The space currently functions as a warehouse, but Sweets dreams of turning it into an artists’ bazaar, perhaps with taxidermy mounts arrayed throughout: the elephant here, the giraffe and hippo there. If the zoo can no longer house the animals, “let’s get them to a place where they can go,” he said. “And it just so happens that I own a place.”

At Work, 'Whole Selves' Increasingly Include Religion: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Secular companies have invited employees to bring their "whole selves" to work. That increasingly includes their religion.
When Christy Childers moved from Austin to San Francisco in 2017 to start a marketing job at Facebook, she felt anxious about sharing her evangelical faith with her new colleagues. In Ms. Childers's religious community, Silicon Valley has a reputation for being overtly secular and less than accepting of Christian beliefs. She now calls that view "unfounded." Within a week, colleagues had invited her to a lunchtime Bible study and a happy hour attended by scores of Christians across the tech industry.
"I thought, 'I can be out about being a Christian. I can do that here,"' Ms. Childers said.
During her three years as a brand manager, Ms. Childers's evangelical identity became central to her work. She honed her managerial skills by leading the Christians at Facebook (now Christians at Meta) employee resource group. Weekly prayer meetings with colleagues led to what she called "real-time miracles," like engineers suddenly fixing bugs they'd struggled with for months and solutions to P.R. crises. Company leaders also consulted her about the attitudes of conservative Facebook users.
In 2019, Ms. Childers founded Pray for Tech, a nonprofit that supports Christian prayer communities inside tech companies. The next year, she left Facebook to run the organization full time. She has since worked with Christian groups at 40 companies, where she's observed a growing interest in supporting workers' core identities, including their faith.
This corporate effort to create a sense of belonging at work grew after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, when many companies rushed to improve their diversity, equity and inclusion, or D.E.I., efforts. Employees from underrepresented groups were encouraged to bring their "authentic" or "whole" selves to work, and companies increased support for identity-based employee groups organized around gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.
Increasingly, faith is a part of this list. Human resources professionals, diversity consultants and scholars all say it's become more common for employees to share their religious identities at work and to request the same corporate recognition and support given to other identity groups. Most major tech companies now have official faith-based affinity groups.
Fueling the effort are multiple Christian organizations including Pray for Tech; anti-discrimination nonprofits, like the Anti-Defamation League; and nonpartisan, multifaith nonprofits like Interfaith America and the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation.
"It feels like the train is moving and as imperfect as the D.E.I. vehicle is, hop on or hop off and get religion into the larger ecosystem," said Simran Jeet Singh, executive director of the Religion & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. "It's almost like, here's a way for people of faith to say, think about us too."
Twenty years ago, few secular companies recognized faith-based employee groups and those that did exist -- whether officially sanctioned or not -- were typically for Christians. Today, nearly 70 secular corporations officially fund them, according to the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, and scores more allow them to exist. Many groups are new since 2017, some have thousands of members and represent Christians, Muslims and Jews, along with Sikhs, Buddhists, Baha'is and even atheists.
Scholars call this a cultural shift. The secular office has long been "a neutral space, where there is separating out of religion," said Helen Chung, an assistant professor of industrial-organizational psychology at Seattle Pacific University who studies faith-based employee resource groups. This is partly "a carry-over from the separation of church and state," Ms. Chung said, and partly a way to keep the peace. "What are the two things you're not supposed to talk about?" said Brian Grim, president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation. "Religion and politics."
Inviting employees to bring their whole selves to the workplace means companies should be prepared to host some difficult conversations. "That doesn't mean companies have to weigh in on Israel-Palestine," Mr. Singh said. But, he said, workers of faith "have real issues that they'll be bringing to the table, and you have to be ready to address them."
'We shouldn't be hiding'
Americans may be turning away from organized religion, but a fifth still view their work as a spiritual calling, according to a nationally representative survey from Rice University.
"Historically, religious institutions have provided people a context, a container to mark transitions in their lives and do some meaning making," Ms. Chung said. "But some of that has lessened, and I think because of that, we look to recreate some structures for ourselves in the workplace."
Employees who have joined workplace faith groups or otherwise integrated religion into their professional lives, often do so for emotional support. Ms. Childers's organization, Pray for Tech, facilitates virtual inter-company prayer sessions, like one last March, where employees from Meta, Microsoft and Yahoo prayed for strength in the face of layoffs.
At PayPal, workers can submit requests to a "prayer portal," asking that colleagues pray for them. "A lot of times it's around a health diagnosis. Or a prayer for leadership and wisdom during difficult economic times," said Becky Pomerleau, the company's senior director of audit, who helped found both the company's interfaith and Christian affinity groups in 2019.
Sukie Singh Gandhi, a technical consulting manager at Salesforce, said engaging with her Sikh faith at work helps her feel seen and respected as a religious minority. Ms. Gandhi is global vice president of Faithforce, a 5,000-member affinity group at her company, and part of the "Sikhs at Salesforce" Slack channel -- positions she's used to help out her Sikh colleagues.
Some Sikhs, for example, are required to carry a kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger that represents justice and courage. Yet they worry colleagues or security will misconstrue the kirpan as a weapon. After her colleagues raised these concerns on the Slack channel last year, Ms. Gandhi helped convene meetings with executives, security officials and employees to discuss the issue.
As a result of these talks, Sikhs who want to carry a kirpan at work now receive special notation on their employee badges.
Ms. Gandhi found this experience empowering. "That is who I am," she said. "We shouldn't be hiding."
In fact, many religious employees say they were closeted about their faith before "coming out" to colleagues. Michael Roberts, a Salesforce engineer, said it took him three years to come out as an evangelical Christian. Once he did, he became a founding member of Faithforce.
A few years later, at age 30, Mr. Roberts came out as gay. After learning that he was in a same-sex relationship, his longtime church rejected him. But his Faithforce colleagues had the opposite response. "They were amazing champions," Mr. Roberts said. "That was a significant source of strength for me in that hard transition."
Difficult conversations
Companies with faith-based affinity groups are quick to emphasize how deeply their employees respect one another. But as religious workers become more vocal inside secular workplaces, "one potential downside is that what's safe and creates a more inclusive environment for one group might have an opposite or negative impact for another group," said Katina Sawyer, associate professor of management and organizations at the University of Arizona, who studies workplace inclusion. "That's not something organizations have necessarily thought about in great detail."
The Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against workers based on their religion, race, gender, nationality or sexual orientation. But recent Supreme Court decisions seem to have privileged religious freedoms, like exempting health plans at companies with religious objections from providing contraception under the Affordable Care Act or allowing a religious social services nonprofit to turn away same-sex foster parents.
In June, a unanimous Supreme Court decision made it easier for people to seek religious accommodations at work. Typically, such accommodations involve holiday time off or wearing religious dress. But Steven Green, director of the Center for Religion, Law and Democracy at Willamette University, thinks the ruling could open the door for other demands -- like the ability to proselytize, which is a core tenet of some faiths. "Some religious public interest groups are creating a narrative that you must be able to bring your entire self into the workplace," he said, "and that means your ability to evangelize, which has been inhibited."
During a recent Pride month, members of some faith-based employee groups at a large tech company grew frustrated over their employer's overt L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy. Some considered organizing a walkout. An adviser to the Christian affinity group, who requested anonymity to preserve his professional relationships, counseled the frustrated employees to consider how such an event would affect their L.G.B.T.Q. colleagues. The walkout never happened.
Mr. Grim, of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, recalled hearing about another incident in which an employee sent a mass email inviting staff to a Bible study. Mr. Grim says that the appropriate employer response should depend on the situation: If a supervisor sent the email, it could be considered coercive if it is viewed as mandatory or somehow consequential to an employee's place in the company. But if a rank-and-file employee is permitted to send a mass email invitation to a baby shower or Pride parade, then Bible study should be fair game.
Not every company is prepared to grapple with these questions. It's possibly why only 43 Fortune 500 companies officially recognize faith-based affinity groups, according to an assessment by Mr. Grim's organization.
"We're often approached by diversity professionals who are really versed in race, gender, sexuality, and they're like, "Oh, I don't get religion, and I'm not comfortable with it," said Megan Johnson, senior director for strategic initiatives at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Interfaith America. "Especially when these groups might come up against that person's own value set."
In 2021, Rebecca Leeman was an organizational consultant at PwC in Manhattan, when a man wearing a skullcap was assaulted near the company's Midtown offices. He had been on his way to a pro-Israel demonstration. Ms. Leeman said the company sent a mass email condemning the assault and even mentioned it during an all-hands meeting, but never used the word "anti-Semitism."
"Because of the connections to Israel and politics, I think they were intentionally vague," Ms. Leeman said. She felt the company needed to understand the very specific fear she'd been feeling about her Jewish identity in recent years.
She co-wrote a letter to Tim Ryan, then the company's U.S. chair, requesting that PwC recognize a formal Jewish affinity group. The company responded swiftly. Within a few months, they'd authorized an interfaith organization with a Jewish group under its umbrella.
'Feel-good stuff' vs. shared identity
Companies like an interfaith approach to religion in the workplace, because it allows them to focus on education and sidestep potential conflict. Last December, PayPal hosted its first interfaith fair, complete with turban tying and henna painting. This winter, PwC will host a lunch and learn about workers' different holiday traditions. Each spring, a handful of companies hold Ramadan "fast-a-thons" in which non-Muslims fast for one day alongside their Muslim colleagues.
At Dell, there is a single multifaith group with six religions represented but no faith-specific communities -- at least none the company officially recognizes. "Those become divisive and exclusive," said Vanice Hayes, Dell's chief culture, diversity and inclusion officer. "We are all about making sure people don't feel siloed."
Mr. Singh of the Aspen Institute agrees that an interfaith approach can help avoid polarization, but he worries the "feel-good stuff" can "fall really flat, because it's too superficial." He added that workers from minority faiths often want a space "to find their people on the basis of some shared identity and heritage." That's especially important, he said, with hate crimes on the rise.
In late 2022, the Anti-Defamation League started a Jewish Employee Resource Group Network to address growing inquiries from Jewish employees and D.E.I. officers. "Excluding Jews or bundling them in a much bigger group reinforces that signal that Jews are not vulnerable, aren't a minority group," said Adam Neufeld, senior vice president and chief impact officer of the A.D.L. "We think they are."
Access to a like-minded community also provides the safety some workers need to step outside of it. Steve Teng, whose Austin nonprofit Pivot helps Christians start Christ-centered communities at work, said some people have been taught to think that entering interfaith spaces means they're abandoning their own theology. "I tell them, don't be scared," he said. "When you receive ideas, you also get to share them. That's dignifying people of every kind."

Full text: Kim Hirsh and Jonathan Fingerhut first met in 1967 and by their early teens, he had "a little crush." Then high school and the rest of life led them apart.
As kindergartners in 1967, Kim Susan Hirsh and Jonathan Adam Fingerhut ran through the schoolyard of Thelma L. Sandmeier Elementary School in Springfield, N.J. Ms. Hirsh says she remembers her "pigtails flying" behind her.
Ms. Hirsh and Mr. Fingerhut, now both 61, grew up about a mile apart from each other in Springfield. Both are Jewish and Ms. Hirsh said seventh grade was bat and bar mitzvah season. She estimated that she attended about 70 parties as a guest and seven as a boy's date. "It put you at the center of attention," she said, "and I always loved a party."
When it came time for Mr. Fingerhut to choose a date for his own bar mitzvah, he asked Ms. Hirsh. "She was pretty, she was a sweet young lady," he said. "And probably there was a little crush."
But their teenage courtship only lasted about a week. "I was probably ready to move on to the next bar mitzvah boy," Ms. Hirsh said with a laugh.
The two attended separate high schools and lost touch. Mr. Fingerhut then received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Rowan College. He is now a sales executive at the Mooney-General Paper Company in Hillside, N.J.
Ms. Hirsh has a bachelor's degree in American civilization from Brown and is the executive director of the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater MetroWest NJ in Whippany, N.J.
They continued on their separate courses. Each got married and had three children. Both then separated from their spouses -- Mr. Fingerhut from his wife in 2014 and Ms. Hirsh from her husband in 2015. In early January 2016, Ms. Hirsh enlisted some girlfriends to help her create a profile on JDate, a Jewish dating site.
"I was just lifting my head up and starting to think about dating," she said. About a week later, she received a Facebook friend request from Mr. Fingerhut. She accepted and he sent her a message saying he had a New Year's resolution to reconnect with old friends.
Ms. Hirsh assumed Mr. Fingerhut was still married, so she asked if he knew of any available men for her. Mr. Fingerhut explained he was separated from his wife and asked her out.
A few days later, the two met at a Starbucks in Morristown, N.J., with plans for hot yoga and lunch at the now-closed Urban Table restaurant. "I remember thinking wow, he's so grown up and so handsome," she said.
The first date lasted several hours. "We had the same story," Mr. Fingerhut said. "We had a relationship, it went awry. We cared for our children and that was the most important thing."
Mr. Fingerhut told Ms. Hirsh that his children, then ages 12, 16 and 18, would have to come first if they began a relationship. "I thought, what a great dad," she said. "I could fall in love with this guy."
Mr. Fingerhut said he thought Ms. Hirsh was not exactly out of his league but maybe "a little too classy" for him. As a salesman, he said, he was able to sell himself to her.
Ms. Hirsh's divorce was finalized in November 2016 and Mr. Fingerhut's was finalized in January 2018. In September 2021, Mr. Fingerhut moved into Ms. Hirsh's house in Morristown where they still live today. They began seriously considering marriage around the time they moved in together and Mr. Fingerhut bought a ring in November 2021.
On the fourth night of Hanukkah that year, he got down on one knee in their bedroom and asked her to marry him. She said yes, and they drank champagne and lit the menorah.

The couple were married before 130 guests on Sept. 9 at the Mallard Island Yacht Club in Manahawkin, N.J. The ceremony, which was held in the on-site Boathouse Chapel, was officiated by Rabbi Jack Romberg, who is retired from Temple Israel, Tallahassee, Fla., and is married to one of Ms. Hirsh's cousins.
Ms. Hirsh's parents, Charles Hirsh, 94, and Barbara Hirsh, 87, began the procession down the aisle, followed by the partners of the couple's combined six children. Then Mr. Fingerhut was escorted down the aisle by his three daughters and Ms. Hirsh was flanked by her two daughters and her son. Mr. Fingerhut's father, Jerome Fingerhut, died in 2010 and his mother, Betty Fingerhut, died in 2020.
Ms. Hirsh recalled a moment during the reception in the venue's banquet hall when she danced with both of her parents, with many members of the couple's shared childhood looking on. "It was full circle," she said.

Full text: A reader who is uncomfortable with expensive gifts doesn't know how to respond to a $ 7,000 handbag she had begged her mother not to send.
My mom has wanted to buy me a luxury bag for a few years, but I have reservations about spending lots of money on things. Still, when she asked for my opinion about a bag for herself, I provided one -- though I suspected it was really for me. I texted her that I appreciate everything she does, but I asked her not to buy me a bag. (Having expensive things makes me anxious.) She agreed, but then she sent me more pictures of status bags. I repeated my request. Then I spoke to my sibling, who convinced me that gifts are my mom's way of expressing love, and that she can afford it. (She's also having a hard time now caring for my grandfather.) So, I prepared myself to receive a $ 2,000 bag. But the one that arrived cost $ 7,000 -- which stresses me out! I love my mom, but she didn't respect my feelings. How can I handle this nicely?
DAUGHTER
I admire your patience. It's hard to remember, sometimes, that good communication is a process that often involves failing to communicate along the way. I can't explain your mother's fixation with fancy bags, and even if gifts were her only way of expressing love, you were plenty clear that you didn't want this particular one. She may be having a rough time, but don't bury your feelings too quickly.
Now, some etiquette mavens may tell you to thank your mother and move along. (We shouldn't tell people what to give -- or not to give -- to us.) I disagree here: Your question isn't really about gifts; it's about getting through to your mother, kindly. You shouldn't have to choke down anxiety to make her feel good.
So, tell her that you love her, then suggest some gifts you would feel more comfortable receiving: a night at the theater, maybe, a dinner out, a weekend away. You may not be able to rein in her giving impulse, but you can help her do better. If she still reverts to pricey swag, recognize her blind spot and take care of yourself: sell the stuff or give it away.
Who Is My Boyfriend's Keeper?
My boyfriend and I, both 20, have been together for six months. He goes through periods of anxiety and depression that he tries to address with medication and therapy. When things get challenging for him, though, his parents arrive and remove him from the situation, under the guise of protecting him. I don't think their intervention helps, but I don't want to sound like a nagging girlfriend. Should I say something?
GIRLFRIEND
I am not belittling you at all when I point out that six months is a relatively short period, and 20 years of age is young to manage what may be a serious illness. But if coming off as "nagging" is the worst consequence you can imagine of interfering with your boyfriend's care during depressive episodes, then you may not know enough about depression.
You may be right about the efficacy of his parents' intervention, but you haven't said anything about the seriousness of your boyfriend's illness. Talk to him more deeply about his situation, if he's open to that, as well as his preferences, before starting a tug of war with his parents over his care.
What, Exactly, Do You Mean by 'No Kids'?
My husband's best friend is getting married soon, and my husband is a groomsman. We've been looking forward to the bash for almost a year, but when we opened our invitation, we were surprised to learn that children are not invited. We have an 8-week-old daughter. I am flummoxed about finding a babysitter in rural Tennessee, and I'm not sure I want our first babysitting experience to be with a stranger. When we asked our friend about the "no kids" policy, he suggested that my parents fly down with us. (Ha-ha!) Any suggestions for navigating this?
NEW MOM
Congratulations on the new baby! Unfortunately, neither her birth, nor your yearlong anticipation of the wedding, entitles you to change other people's guest lists. So, here are your options, as I see them: Try to find a local sitter whom you can check in on during the wedding and reception. (Your friends or a local pediatrician may be helpful with this.) Take turns with your husband watching the baby at your hotel. Or don't go. As you decide, though, try to center the bridal couple. This is their day -- not yours.
The Separation of Church and Checkout
I work as a cashier at a charity thrift shop. My co-workers and customers frequently talk about their religious beliefs. I'm cool with that, but I am not a firm believer in any religion. Recently, a customer who was buying an expensive item started talking about his faith and asked all of us if we believed in Jesus. My co-workers said they did, but I said: "Um, I don't know. That will be $ 400, please." It did not go over well. Any advice?
EMPLOYEE
I am usually unwilling to discuss my religious beliefs with strangers -- or on demand. It's probably not part of your job description, either. Next time, say: "My religious beliefs are private." If the customer decides to forgo that vintage Easy Bake Oven in pristine condition, that's on him, not you.

After Floods, Protest and Grief in Libya's 'City of Poets': [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Derna, which lost entire neighborhoods and thousands of residents in the deluge, has a history as a cultural and intellectual hub as well as a rebellious streak.
In the days after much of the coastal city of Derna, Libya, was washed away by devastating floods, Mahbuba Khalifa wrote a poem to honor her hometown, known by Libyans as the "city of poets."
I used to carry your great legacy in my conscience and on my shoulders, and I walked with arrogant pride and I had a certain pride that I did not deny.
Whoever sees me and sees the radiance of light that I bear as a mark on my features must know -- without asking me where I am from -- that I am your daughter.
For Ms. Khalifa, a Libyan writer and poet, it was the most poignant way to mourn a city with a history as an intellectual and cultural hub -- and a long tradition of rebellion against occupation and authoritarian powers.
Like the aging dams on Derna's outskirts that burst on Sept. 11, sending a torrent of storm water into the city and sweeping entire neighborhoods into the sea, the city had been neglected by the Libyan authorities for decades, residents and experts said.
That treatment was punishment from the various authorities who have controlled the area for the penchant of residents to resist control, they said.
The flood not only wiped away large parts of the city, ripping it in two with a wall of water and earth and killing thousands of its inhabitants, but it also destroyed a cradle of Libyan culture.
Derna, a once-lush seaside town on Libya's northeastern coast, was built on the ruins of an ancient Greek colony in the late 15th century by Muslims fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. They brought with them the culture and architecture of Al-Andalus Spain, and the city became a place for different religions and nationalities to mix.
It was the site of Libya's first theater and included cultural centers, cafes for discussions and debate, and bookshops, keeping the intellectual streak alive even in difficult times.
But the flood destroyed many of the cultural and religious buildings that represented those traditions -- like a cultural center where residents debated issues of the day, as well as mosques, churches and a synagogue, residents said.
Islam Azouz, an aid worker from Derna, lamented the destruction of what he called the Derna legacy. "The Old City, its streets, its churches, its houses of worship, its mosques," he said, "all of it has gone in the flood."
Ms. Khalifa said the intellectual and cultural traditions of the city, reflecting the rebellious nature of its inhabitants, had survived repeated crackdowns by the authorities -- until the flood washed many of them away.
"Because Derna people were always rebellious, they don't accept what is wrong," she said. "And one of the things that leaders have done was to crack down on Derna."
That tradition of speaking out was on display Monday when hundreds of Derna residents gathered for a protest in the devastated city, demanding the removal of those responsible for the collapse of the dams.
Many stood on the muddy, rocky earth that the floods carried through the city center, while others perched on the roof of a mosque that was still standing. Some appeared to be part of relief and rescue efforts, dressed in white biohazard suits and reflective vests.
"Aguila, out, out," they yelled, referring to Aguila Saleh, the speaker of Libya's Parliament, who has deflected blame for the disaster even though Libyans have said the catastrophe and its enormous scale were rooted in government neglect and mismanagement. And then, "Libya, Libya," they chanted.
In the wake of the protest, communications to the city were cut off for many hours, and the authorities arrested protesters and activists who were demanding accountability.
"The city, whatever its condition, it always rejected oppression," said Jawhar Ali, 28, a Derna native who lives in Turkey.
During the 32-year Italian occupation of Libya that ended in 1943, the Green Mountains above Derna were a haven for armed resisters, said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of the book "The Burning Shores: Inside the Battle for the New Libya."
Decades later in the 1990s, some in the city took up arms against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's dictatorial rule, using the same mountains as a base. Colonel el-Qaddafi's government responded with even more heavy-handed repression against the city and its people, Mr. Wehrey said.
In the 2000s, some young men from Derna went to Iraq to join the insurgency against the American military occupation there.
When the Arab Spring revolution came to Libya in February 2011, Derna was one of the first cities to join and came out strongly for the removal of Colonel el-Qaddafi.
Years of control by various armed groups followed Colonel el-Qaddafi's ouster by rebels in 2011, aided by a NATO-led military intervention.
In 2015, local fighters defeated and expelled a local branch of the Islamic State terrorist group in Derna.
For a while, Derna remained the only city in eastern Libya that was not under the control of Khalifa Hifter, the renegade commander and former C.I.A. asset.
Under the guise of fighting the Islamic State, Mr. Hifter tried to defeat the forces that controlled Derna, laying siege to the city and pummeling it with artillery and airstrikes. After years of battle, Mr. Hifter's Libyan National Army seized it in 2018.
Stephanie Williams, the former United Nations acting special envoy, said she remembered visiting Derna afterward. She said what she saw reminded her of the destruction she had seen in the Iraqi city of Mosul, parts of which were left in ruin in 2017 after a nearly nine-month campaign to defeat the Islamic State there.
Since then, Mr. Hifter has sought to punish Derna for its resistance. His army has kept a tight grip on the city, appointing a mayor who is the nephew of Mr. Saleh, the Parliament speaker.
Ms. Khalifa, the writer from Derna, remembers how as a child the city's identities as a place of culture and resistance intertwined.
In the 1960s she attended a play at the city's theater with prominent female actresses, she said. The proceeds of the play went to support the Algerian resistance to the French occupation.
That theater was demolished by the attacks of Mr. Hifter's forces, she said.
Just days before the floods, Mostafa Trablsi, a poet from Derna, attended a meeting at the Derna Cultural House, a hub for intellectual debates and the arts, about the dams looming outside the city, their neglect and the risk of collapse.
On Sept. 10, he posted a poem on his Facebook page titled "The Rain" that appeared to emphasize his fears about the dam and warning of an "alarm."
Exposing the wet streets;
And the cheating contractor;
And the failed state.
Mr. Trablsi died in the flood that surged through the city a day later.
The Derna Cultural House was destroyed.
"The city is not called the city of poets for nothing," said Mr. Ali, the former resident who lives in Turkey, referring to the verses Mr. Trablsi posted on Facebook. "Even in our catastrophe, poetry played a role."
As the search for flood victims continues under the rubble and in the sea, some residents say that culture will rise again in a city that has survived so much.
Ms. Khalifa said she planned to write a book about notable people from Derna, including intellectual and cultural luminaries, but that must wait until this mourning period is over. Each day brings news of more friends and family whom she has lost.
At least 49 relatives died in the flood, including several cousins and their families, she said. On Wednesday she found out that two of her teachers had died.
Her poem reflects her deep sorrow. It ends:
"But you are tired of the injustice of history and the injustice of tampering with you and your city's legacy,
So you chose to leave when the water met the water to hide in the depth of the sea, pure and pure."

That N.C. Wyeth Will Look Very Nice in My Bedroom: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A woman found a rare N.C. Wyeth illustration while rummaging through frames at a Savers in New Hampshire.
You can walk out of the Savers in Manchester, N.H., with a shirt for as little as $ 4.99. There are $ 2 rings for those interested in costume jewelry. Framed artworks too big for shelves lean invitingly against one of the walls.
The thrift store's manager says that shopping there is like a personal treasure hunt, which was certainly the case for one woman who made the find of a lifetime in 2017.
While pushing a metal cart through the Savers on a hunt for home décor, she spotted a dusty painting with a substantial wooden frame amid a stack of posters and prints. Two women in the image appeared to be in a standoff, the elder displaying stern disapproval.
The shopper was taken by the painting -- Who were the women? Why did they seem so tense? -- and clunked it into her cart. Minutes later, she was wheeling out an authentic oil panel by N.C. Wyeth, one of the premier American illustrators of the 20th century, known for bringing to life classic stories like "Treasure Island," "Robin Hood" and "Robinson Crusoe."
Her bill for the long-lost work, which sold at auction on Tuesday for $ 191,000 including fees? Four dollars.
"We look at all the donations we receive and we place a value on them as best we can," said the Savers manager, Shaun Edson. "We are not connoisseurs of paintings. We do our best to evaluate the pieces and value them appropriately."
"I wasn't with the company in 2017," he added. "Obviously we missed the boat."
The painting's owner recalled the sequence of events in a telephone interview with The New York Times and was granted anonymity because she is becoming much richer from the sale of a painting that has drawn considerable attention.
After purchasing the piece, the buyer hung it in her bedroom before eventually casting it aside into a closet with school pictures and other items. When she rediscovered the work in May and noticed a signed label on the back, she decided to post some images of it on Facebook.
Lauren Lewis, an art conservator, was among those who reached out after seeing the painting on social media. Eventually, the owner said, she and her husband wrapped the painting in a blanket, loaded it into the back of their S.U.V. and drove about 90 minutes to meet Lewis in the parking lot of a bus terminal.
Wielding a magnifying glass, Lewis became excited and spoke about aspects of the work the owner had never considered, such as its brushstrokes.
So the couple scrapped their plans to stop for lunch, instead driving straight home to rehang the painting. This time, the owner's husband placed pillows on the floor beneath it.
"How is this possible?" Lewis said she had been asking herself since she first saw the Wyeth on Facebook. "It's all very fortuitous. This has all come together in a lovely way."
The frontispiece illustration that is now being auctioned was part of a four-image set that Wyeth contributed for a 1939 edition of Helen Hunt Jackson's novel "Ramona," which revolves around an orphan living in Southern California after the Mexican-American War. The illustration, also called "Ramona," portrays the tension between the young woman and her foster mother, according to catalog notes provided by the auction house Bonhams Skinner, which also say Wyeth was known for his "vivid colors and a skillful use of light and shadow."
Wyeth's work is featured at the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., and he is part of one of the most prominent artistic families in the United States. The Museum of Modern Art owns the painting "Christina's World" by Andrew Wyeth, one of N.C. Wyeth's five children.
Experts say "Ramona" was probably a gift from book publishers to an editor or to the estate of the author. But exactly how it wound up at the Savers in Manchester is unclear.
Good things like the thrift store find, the painting's owner said, do not often happen to people like her and her husband. They have begun to allow themselves to think about the bills they can pay, and a vacation to Germany to visit one of their children.
Aware that she will soon part ways with the painting, its owner bought a copy of the 1939 version of "Ramona" on Amazon. Although she is a bibliophile, she plans to rip out Wyeth's illustration of the two women and frame it.

Full text: The suit, filed with the Authors Guild, accuses the A.I. company of infringing on authors' copyrights, claiming it used their books to train its ChatGPT chatbot.
A group of prominent novelists, including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen and Elin Hilderbrand, are joining the legal battle against OpenAI over its chatbot technology, as fears about the encroachment of artificial intelligence on creative industries continue to grow.
More than a dozen authors filed a lawsuit against OpenAI on Tuesday, accusing the company, which has been backed with billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft, of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train its popular ChatGPT chatbot. The complaint, which was filed along with the Authors Guild, said that OpenAI's chatbots can now produce "derivative works" that can mimic and summarize the authors' books, potentially harming the market for authors' work, and that the writers were neither compensated nor notified by the company.
"The success and profitability of OpenAI are predicated on mass copyright infringement without a word of permission from or a nickel of compensation to copyright owners," the complaint said.
The complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, said that while OpenAI does not publicly declare which works it uses to train its models, the company has admitted to using copyrighted material. The complaint also said that OpenAI's ChatGPT is capable of producing summaries of books that include details not available in reviews or elsewhere online, which suggests the underlying program was fed the books in their entirety.
The Authors Guild lawsuit is the latest in a series brought by writers against OpenAI. It is likely to generate attention because of its high-profile plaintiffs, who include best-selling novelists from a range of genres, among them David Baldacci, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, George Saunders and Michael Connelly.
Douglas Preston, a novelist who joined the lawsuit, said he was shocked when he asked ChatGPT to describe minor characters in his books and it spat back detailed information that wasn't available in reviews or Wikipedia entries for the novels.
"That's when I looked at this and said, 'My God, ChatGPT has read my books, how many of my books has it read?"' he said. "It knew everything, and that's when I got a bad feeling."
A representative for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November, authors, publishers and retailers have been trying to rein in the rampant and increasingly disruptive incursion of A.I. in the industry. Already, there has been a rise in A.I.-generated books on Amazon, including travel guides and books on plant and fungi foraging, which prompted the New York Mycological Society to issue a warning to avoid A.I.-generated guides.
Amazon has taken steps to monitor and curb the influx of A.I.-generated books. This month, it posted new guidelines for self-published authors, requiring them to disclose whether they had used A.I. to create texts. It also limited the number of titles users can upload to its self-publishing platform each day, to three. Amazon does not currently disclose which books are created by A.I. to its customers, but it may do so in the future, according to an Amazon representative.
A handful of other lawsuits have been filed in recent months by writers against OpenAI and Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram. This month, Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman and Matthew Klam were among a group of writers who collectively sued OpenAI and Meta, which has also developed A.I. technology, for copyright infringement.
In a filing last month for another suit brought by authors, lawyers for OpenAI moved to dismiss the bulk of plaintiffs' claims, and argued that using texts "for innovations," including training A.I., constitutes fair use.
Copyright questions surrounding A.I. remain unresolved, and experts are divided over whether authors' claims of infringement will hold up in court. Some argue that if an A.I. program is ingesting copyrighted works for training but creates new works that are substantially different, that constitutes fair use. Others, however, believe the authors' argument is likely to prevail.
"They've scraped all this content and put it into their databases without asking permission -- that seems like a huge grab of content," said Edward Klaris, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and media law. "I think courts are going to say that copying into the database is an infringement in itself."
Mary Bly, who publishes historical romance novels under the name Eloisa James, said she joined the Authors Guild suit because she worried that if writers failed to draw boundaries around their work, technology companies would continue to plunder and imitate them.
"This lawsuit is important because it establishes a line in the sand," she said. "If you're going to train things in the future on my books, you need to license them. You can't just take things."

Savor the Tastes of Summer Near the Seashore: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The water's warm and these spots are still open for burgers, clams and locally caught seafood.
Hi, it's Pete Wells, restaurant critic of The Times and hopeless summer person. I love summer and everything that comes with it -- heat waves, shark sightings, weird smells, you name it.
Last week, panic set in as I realized September is well underway and I haven't swam, fished, grilled or listened to "Padam Padam" anywhere near as often as I meant to.
But there's still time. Our beaches are beautiful this month, with acres of wide-open sand to lie on. The water is as warm as it gets, drawing pods of dolphins to spout and breach just offshore. And some of my favorite spots on or near local beaches won't close for a few more weeks. Others stay open all year long.
Spectro , Jacob Riis Park, Queens
There are two burger stands on the boardwalk at what's called the People's Beach, and each has its charms. Space Burgers, in Bay 9, the brick building at the west end of the park, flattens its grass-fed patties on a griddle, smashburger-style, giving them a dark and crunchy sear. It's a fine day-at-the-beach burger, and you can get it with a lemonade slushie. Still, when I pull into the enormous parking lot at Riis, my car usually noses toward a spot at the other end of the beach. Spectro's white prefab container is the only concession around, rising from the sand with the bold geometric confidence of an Ed Ruscha gas station.
The beef patties are a little taller and juicier than the ones at Space Burgers. The pickles are outstanding. The fries, slender and golden, are sprinkled with pepper and salt. There is watermelon juice, fresh honey-ginger lemonade -- "with electrolytes!" the chalkboard menu promises -- and many flavors of Ocean Bomb, a sugary Taiwanese soda in cans decorated with portraits of Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Guardians. (Friday to Sunday, weather permitting, at least until Oct. 1.)
Whit's End , Rockaway Beach, Queens
Every bohemian beach town from Provincetown to Tulum needs a bohemian restaurant. In Rockaway Beach, that restaurant is Whit's End. It has the cavernous, shadowy look of a roadhouse out on a country road, though it doesn't have any beer lights. (Or any beer, for that matter.) Two oil paintings hang on the walls. Both are portraits of striped bass. This gives you a fair idea what you are in for.
Whitney Aycock, the chef and owner, leans heavily on seafood caught nearby. He cooks in broad strokes, with no regard at all for what's stylish over in Manhattan. Slabs of local bluefin might be wrapped in crisp sushi rice and crisscrossed with spicy mayo. A super-smooth smoked bluefish dip, made with rivers of olive oil but no mayonnaise, comes with a Jenga stack of freshly baked crackers. The pot of clams is something to be reckoned with: chewy cherrystones and fried sticks of bread that you can soak in the pint or so of briny tomato sauce.
There is pizza, too, from two wood-burning ovens. Just don't ask for a slice -- one of about two dozen rules and best practices on a page of the menu called "The Ways of Whit." It's enthusiastically profane; "We like dogs" is one of the few items that can be printed in its entirety in The Times. (Year round.)
Butler's Flat Clam Shack , Port Washington, N.Y.
I won't try to tell you that the beaches near the North Shore town of Port Washington, N.Y., are more beautiful than Cape Cod's. They are not. I will tell you, though, that Port Washington has a clam shack that may be the equal of such revered Cape seafood palaces as Cobies, Moby Dick's and the Kream 'N Kone.
Butler's Flat looks the part. It's an unpainted shed on a Manhasset Bay pier where you order at the window, then look for a table next to the docks as sea gulls whine for scraps.The fried clams are fat and custardy under a crust that is less a helmet than a veil. If whole-belly clams, with their faintly bitter taste of organs, aren't for you, the fried scallops, oysters and flounder are also archetypal. So is the lobster roll, an item that's become more common in New York City than pastrami.
A more unusual treat is the stuffed quahog. Butler's Flat bakes its stuffies in the Portuguese manner of New Bedford, Mass., flavoring the chopped clams and bread crumbs with garlic-scented bits of linguiça. The shack's season ends in October, but about 20 miles south in Rockville Centre, Bigelow's stays open all year, slinging seafood platters and chowder at its wraparound linoleum counter. A few yards away, eight lanes of traffic zoom along the Sunrise Highway, but Bigelow's clams can make you hear the pounding surf. (Wednesday to Sunday, until Oct. 29.) What I'm reading ...
Momofuku Ssam Bar's impending closure was announced just two days after Fast Company published Joshua David Stein's article about Marguerite Zabar Mariscal, Momofuku's chief executive -- who did not mention Ssam Bar. I wonder if Ms. Mariscal still maintains that her company's restaurants "will always be the most experiential and complete way to experience Momofuku" now that she's turning out the lights on the restaurant that used to served as a manifesto for the Momofuku lifestyle?
Do shoppers who buy Momofuku Chili Crunch in their local Whole Foods care that the condiment is connected to actual places where you can sit down and have dinner? After all, the company that owns Rao's pasta sauce recently sold for $ 2.7 billion to Campbell Soup, even though the percentage of supermarket customers who've been to the original Rao's must be a very small number.

Internet Law in U.K. Shields Children and Targets Illicit Content: [Correction]

Full text: The far-reaching bill had set off debates about balancing free speech and privacy rights against efforts to halt the spread of harmful content online.
Britain passed a sweeping law on Tuesday to regulate online content, introducing age-verification requirements for pornography sites and other rules to reduce hate speech, harassment and other illicit material.
The Online Safety Bill, which also applies to terrorist propaganda, online fraud and child safety, is one of the most far-reaching attempts by a Western democracy to regulate online speech. About 300 pages long, the new rules took more than five years to develop, setting off intense debates about how to balance free expression and privacy against barring harmful content, particularly targeted at children.
At one point, messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal threatened to abandon the British market altogether until provisions in the bill that were seen as weakening encryption standards were changed.
The British law goes further than efforts elsewhere to regulate online content, forcing companies to proactively screen for objectionable material and to judge whether it is illegal, rather than requiring them to act only after being alerted to illicit content, according to Graham Smith, a London lawyer focused on internet law.
It is part of a wave of rules in Europe aimed at ending an era of self-regulation in which tech companies set their own policies about what content could stay up or be taken down. The Digital Services Act, a European Union law, recently began taking effect and requires companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit material.
"The Online Safety Bill is a game-changing piece of legislation," Michelle Donelan, the British secretary of technology, said in a statement. "This government is taking an enormous step forward in our mission to make the U.K. the safest place in the world to be online."
British political figures have been under pressure to pass the new policy as concerns grew about the mental health effects of internet and social media use among young people. Families that attributed their children's suicides to social media were among the most aggressive champions of the bill.
Under the new law, content aimed at children that promotes suicide, self-harm and eating disorders must be restricted. Pornography companies, social media platforms and other services will be required to introduce age-verification measures to prevent children from gaining access to pornography, a shift that some groups have said will harm the availability of information online and undercut privacy. The Wikimedia Foundation, the operator of Wikipedia, has said it will be unable to comply with the law and may be blocked as a result.
TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram will also be required to introduce features that allow users to choose to encounter lower amounts of harmful content, such as eating disorders, self-harm, racism, misogyny or antisemitism.
"At its heart, the bill contains a simple idea: that providers should consider the foreseeable risks to which their services give rise and seek to mitigate -- like many other industries already do," said Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex, who helped draft the law.
The bill has drawn criticism from tech firms, free speech activists and privacy groups who say it threatens freedom of expression because it will incentivize companies to take down content.
Questions remain about how the law will be enforced. That responsibility falls to Ofcom, the British regulator in charge of overseeing broadcast television and telecommunications, which now must outline rules for how it will police online safety.
Companies that do not comply can face fines of up of 18 million pounds, or about $ 22.3 million, or up to 10 percent of global revenue, whichever is the higher amount. Company executives could face criminal action for not providing information during Ofcom investigations, or if they do not comply with rules related to child safety and child sexual exploitation.

Australian Region Sees 'Catastrophic' Fire Conditions: [Correction]

Full text: The authorities ordered school closures on the south coast of New South Wales, where springtime temperatures were expected to near 100 degrees.
Less than three weeks after the official start of spring in Australia, temperatures in many towns have set records, some as high as 29 degrees above normal. Ski resorts have closed weeks ahead of schedule. At the Sydney Marathon over the weekend, dozens of people were hospitalized after running in a heat wave.
On Tuesday, the authorities said the state of New South Wales was experiencing "catastrophic" fire conditions on its southern coast, with high winds and temperatures approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit. They ordered 20 schools to close and residents in Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, not to light fires outdoors. Firefighters were already battling dozens of blazes across the country.
And in a possible omen for the months ahead, they also officially declared the arrival of the El Niño weather pattern, heralding the first hot and dry summer in the continent in three years.
Australia is bracing for a particularly dangerous fire season four years after the deadly Black Summer, when wildfires killed or were blamed for the deaths of nearly 500 people and scorched more than 60 million acres. The previous few seasons have had cooler and wetter La Niña conditions.
"We are already seeing extreme conditions in some parts of the continent, particularly in the duration of heat," said Karl Braganza, a spokesman for the national Bureau of Meteorology. "We've had an extended period of warm and dry weather to start spring."
Conditions have not been deemed as high-risk yet as those that led to the Black Summer, which had been preceded by several years of drought, Mr. Braganza said. Still, he said, parts of New South Wales where vegetation had dried out faced elevated risk.
The area most at risk currently is the far south coast -- an area which burned during the Black Summer fires -- where 20 schools were closed on Tuesday. A "catastrophic" fire danger rating was announced for the region because of the combination of the high temperatures, abundance of dry vegetation and strong winds.
"For your survival, avoid being in bush and grass fire risk areas today," the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Facebook on Tuesday. "These are the most dangerous conditions for a fire."
Last week, Sydney experienced some of the worst air quality in the world as firefighters raced to conduct controlled burns across swathes of New South Wales before conditions became too hot.
Experts say that the vegetation that grew and flourished during three years of wet and cool La Niña conditions is now drying out as Australia experiences El Niño conditions, creating potential fuel for the fires. At the same time, a warming planet means that firefighters have an ever-narrower window to do controlled burns.
The authorities are struggling to adjust to these conditions, said David Bowman, a University of Tasmania professor and one of Australia's leading fire management experts.
"We're absolutely not prepared" for the fire season ahead, he said. "We're not doing the necessary work at the speed we need to do the work, relative to the rate of climate change."
He added that outside his window, in the distance, "I'm watching a fire developing as we speak, and it's quite interesting."
Several other wildfires were also burning in Tasmania on Tuesday, including an uncontrolled blaze on the east side of the island state, near the popular tourist area of Coles Bay, where the authorities had asked residents to evacuate.
In the state of Queensland, emergency evacuation warnings were issued for the towns of Emerald and Beerwah on Sunday as large fires raged. Both blazes were under control by Monday, and no property damage was reported. But the authorities warn that the fire risk will increase on Thursday and Friday, with temperatures in some parts of the state expected to reach 97 degrees.
The death toll from the Black Summer wildfires included 33 direct deaths and almost 450 more through smoke inhalation.

Too Much, Too Soon: [Style Desk]

Full text: A reader who works with children wonders when she and her boyfriend should reveal their new relationship to his family, including his child who is in her care.
I am a divorced mother with two kids. I own a business in which I work with children, and I started dating the father of a student recently. Admittedly, this is a delicate situation, but so far, it has been good for us. He told me he loves me, but I didn't say it back: It feels too soon. He separated from his wife of 23 years and the mother of his kids just three months ago. (I know this can be a turbulent time.) Aside from concerns about my own heart, I worry how our news may affect his family. I have worked with his young son for several years and don't want to breach his trust or make the divorce more difficult. I know it's not my job to communicate with his family, but when should we tell them about our relationship -- in the interest of living an honest life?
GIRLFRIEND
I respect your desire for honesty, but I urge you to be more sensitive here: In the span of just 90 days, your boyfriend has separated from his wife and declared his love for you, all while you worked with his young son. I predict universal heartache -- especially for the child. You have violated his trust by secretly dating his father as his family fell apart, and his father's speedy substitution of you as a new partner may be painful for him.
Please slow down! I don't particularly care whether you had an affair with your boyfriend before he left his wife or if he ended his marriage independently of you. In either case, it is hard to imagine that jumping into a relationship with a man freshly out of a 23-year marriage is a healthy choice for either of you.
There are also children involved. Before things progress any further with your boyfriend, bring your work with his son to a gentle conclusion and be careful about making this man a big part of your own children's lives. Decisions about this relationship are for you to make with your boyfriend, of course, but I suggest putting them on hold for several months while he processes his major life changes.
A Sister's Claim on a Family Name
My sister has a 14-month-old son. She gave him a family name as a middle name. (Everyone calls him by his first name.) My husband and I would like to use this same family name as our daughter's first name. She is due in November. Do we have to ask for permission from my sister and brother-in-law? I want to be respectful, but I'd like to keep the name a secret, and I don't want to give them an opportunity to say no.
SISTER
There are plenty of times when it is easier to apologize than to ask for permission. This is not one of them. I don't foresee a problem here, but new parents are often territorial (and a little touchy) about baby names.
Tell your sister what you have in mind and ask her to keep it a secret. If she objects, talk it out. You can still name your baby whatever you like, even if she objects. Wouldn't it be better, though, to know her feelings before you do? She is your sister, after all!
Diminishing Returns on Colleagues' Kindness
I have a medical condition that results in bouts of severe pain several times a year. I told a few co-workers about it: If my pain prevented me from working, it would affect their work. Now, whenever I speak with them, they ask how I'm holding up. I appreciate their concern, but I don't want to be reminded of my condition all the time or to report on my health. Advice?
CO-WORKER
Here's my take: In an act of (perhaps excessive) responsibility, you gave your colleagues probably the most personal information they have about you. I suspect they are trying to be thoughtful in response. Still, I understand your feelings. Start with something like: "I feel great, thanks. I'll let you know if I don't." If you are comfortable, add: "I know you mean well, but I'd rather not talk about my health every time we speak."
My Welcome Mat Isn't Your Territory to Mark
I live in a large apartment building. Someone has been letting his or her dog pee in the hallway, directly outside my door, at least twice a week. My neighbors and I put up signs asking for this to stop, but it hasn't. The managing agent says he can't do much until we figure out who it is. Should I set up a camera to catch them in the act or pack up and move?
TENANT
Allow me to make this problem even more disgusting: There may be multiple culprits here. My dog frequently marks where other dogs have urinated. This is not an excuse, mind you! Problem dogs should be carried outdoors, and owners (or dog walkers) are responsible for cleanup -- preferably with a stain- and odor-removal product.
Ask the managing agent to install a camera. This problem is unsanitary (and gross) for all tenants. If he refuses to pay, consider installing a doorbell with a camera. That may do the trick.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on the platform X.

Full text: Even if the equinox, and official start to autumn, is a few days away, a season of new books is upon us.
Here are 67 books to watch for this fall. Whether you like novels or nonfiction, stories or memoir, historical fiction or evolutionary science (really!), there's certainly a book you'll love.
Beyond the Wall: A History of East Germany, by Katja Hoyer
A historian turns her eye to the country of her birth in this political history of the German Democratic Republic, which existed from 1949 to 1990. Contrary to common depictions, Hoyer presents a picture of a vibrant society that weathered intense state suppression but also enacted solidarity.
Basic Books, Sept. 5
Crossings: How Road Ecology Is Shaping the Future of Our Planet, by Ben Goldfarb
Humans have built 40 million miles of road on earth, which have profoundly influenced our world. Goldfarb's account examines roads in context of the environment around them -- touching on the Trans-Canada highway that conservationists called "the meatmaker," and even the mountain lions trapped in California's Santa Monica Mountains -- and profiles the scientists, engineers and organizers seeking to mitigate their ecological harm.
Norton, Sept. 12
Do You Remember Being Born?, by Sean Michaels
When an aging poet realizes that her critical acclaim hasn't translated to financial stability, she agrees to train a poetry A.I. program named Charlotte at a tech company's campus in California. Over the course of a week, she grapples with questions of art, family and connection.
Astra House, Sept. 5
Elon Musk, by Walter Isaacson
The best-selling author of "Steve Jobs" returns with a biography of the richest man on earth. Isaacson spent two years shadowing Musk, the head of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX, and interviewing both his friends and foes. The resulting book delves deep into the billionaire's demons, including childhood bullies and a difficult father, and interrogates their relationship to his success.
Simon & Schuster, Sept. 12
The Fraud, by Zadie Smith
Smith's new novel centers on a trial that divided Victorian England, in which a lower-class Australian butcher claimed the right to a huge estate. This roving work of historical fiction examines who has the right to tell a story, who is taken seriously and who is remembered.
Penguin Press, Sept. 5

Autoworkers Determined To Hold Out For Big Win: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rodney Cornett got up at 4:30 a.m. on Friday, hopped in his F-150 pickup and reported as usual for a morning shift at the Ford Motor plant in Wayne, a gritty city just west of Detroit.
But this morning Mr. Cornett, 56, a veteran union member who has worked at Ford for 28 years, wasn't heading to the axle assembly area where he's a team leader. Instead, his work was putting in six hours on the picket line with a dozen co-workers at the plant's Gate 1 as part of the strike called by the United Auto Workers late Thursday.
"We really haven't had much of a raise in 15 years," Mr. Cornett said, holding a sign that read, "Fair Pay Now!" while cars and trucks constantly whizzed by, honking in support of the strikers. "We've gone through several contracts, and the company keeps saying how they're hurting, but they're making record profits. It can't be the status quo."
The U.A.W. has been negotiating a new labor contract with the three Detroit automakers, but since the sides remain far apart on wages and most other issues, the union called a strike that began when the current bargaining agreement expired at midnight.
In a first, the U.A.W. is striking against all three manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis -- but has limited the stoppages to one plant at each of the companies. At Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, only the 3,300 workers in the assembly area and paint shop have walked off the line, but that is enough to idle the factory.
All 5,800 U.A.W. workers at Stellantis's Jeep complex in Toledo, Ohio, and 3,600 union members at G.M.'s pickup truck factory in Wentzville, Mo., also went on strike.
While limited, the strike will have an impact on the automakers. The affected vehicles are among their most popular and profitable. The Ford plant makes the Bronco, a rugged sport utility vehicle, and is preparing to make a new version of the Ranger pickup. Jeep makes its Gladiator and Wrangler models in Toledo. The G.M. plant produces the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups.
The U.A.W.'s president, Shawn Fain, said the union could extend the strike to additional plants if the talks failed to produce an agreement. "That will supercharge the leverage we have in negotiations, and will create confusion for the companies," he said in a video streamed on Facebook on Thursday night.
Mr. Fain joined workers outside the Ford plant in Wayne after the strike began at midnight. The union broke off discussions with the companies for a day but said it expected the talks to resume on Saturday.
The union has demanded wage increases of 40 percent over the next four years, roughly the same pay gains the chief executives of the three companies have seen over the last four years.
Among its other demands, the union wants to end a pay scale where new hires make about a third less than the veteran wage of $ 32 an hour and have to work eight years before reaching the top of the pay scale. It also wants the companies to pay for health insurance for retirees, offer more paid time off and provide pensions for workers who now have only 401(k) savings accounts for retirement.
The companies have offered wage increases of roughly 20 percent but have denied most of the union's other wishes.
At the Ford plant, several strikers said a raise of 30 percent or more was needed to make up for concessions that the union had to make in previous years to help the automakers survive the 2007-8 financial crisis.
Jason Vinson, 42, a forklift driver, started as a temporary worker in 2007 making about $ 17 an hour, then worked his way up to $ 25 until he was laid off. When he was rehired in 2012, he had to start over at $ 17 an hour, he said.
"I had to get used to it, just pay the necessities," he said with a shrug. Now he earns $ 32 an hour, he said, but thinks a substantial raise is warranted because of the profits his plant generates and the sacrifices he made in the past.
The strikers, many wearing red T-shirts, waved placards and acknowledged honks of support from passing motorists. The picketing is being conducted in six-hour shifts; the plan is for union members to take on one shift per week.
Drawing on a strike fund of $ 825 million, the union will pay the striking workers $ 500 a week and cover their health insurance premium. That helps, but still puts some workers in a pinch.
"I'm getting rid of my cable TV," said Diana Osborne, 42, an assembly worker who has worked for Ford for 16 years. And her 18-year-old daughter, who just enlisted in the National Guard, has offered to lend her money if things get really tight.
Mr. Cornett, the team leader in axle assembly, makes $ 32 an hour but said he fretted about sending his son to college. If he works 40 hour a week, he will earn about $ 67,000 a year. "There's college, plus property taxes are going up, the price of gas is through the roof," he lamented.
Aside from a raise, the thing he wants is an end to the tiered wage system, under which newer workers and veterans are paid on different scales, saying it's "disheartening" seeing colleagues doing the same work while making $ 22 or $ 24 an hour.
"We all labor hard," he said. "You have a precise amount of time to do your job on the line, and our jobs are timed to the second. When the line starts, it doesn't stop until we go on break. A lot of new hires come in and they have aches and pains, the same aches and pains that I have, so they should get paid the same as me."

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to make their way to showrooms.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
“We’re seeing movement from the companies, but they’re still not willing to agree to the kinds of raises that will make up for inflation on top of decades of falling wages,” Fain said Wednesday evening in a video on Facebook.
He added that workers at all three companies were prepared to strike and stay away from their factory stations as long as it took to win big gains. The UAW has never struck the three companies simultaneously before.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike will almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer, and hoped to have a deal that would avert a strike.

Cries of 'Save Us, Save Us' As Homes Fill With Water: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: "We walked out barefoot and saw our friends and neighbors dying," said a woman from the hard-hit city of Derna. More than 5,000 are reported dead and 10,000 more are believed to be missing.
As two dams collapsed and storm waters tore through the streets of the Libyan city of Derna, carrying bodies and buildings with them, Ruba Hatem Yassine, her pregnant sister and several older relatives clambered up a neighbor's ladder to the roof to flee the grasp of the rushing flood below.
From there, they scampered from rooftop to rooftop along their narrow street, Ms. Yassine, 24, recounted on Wednesday, two days after her terrifying ordeal. Eventually, they sought shelter in a small storage unit on one of the rooftops and watched for hours as the water overwhelmed the city.
They could hear their neighbors -- trapped in half-destroyed homes by rising water or under rubble -- screaming, "Save us, save us," Ms. Yassine said, speaking by phone from a friend's home in the nearby town of Marj. Once the floodwaters had somewhat subsided, other survivors helped her family of nine come down from the roof to safety.
They waded through the knee-deep water, leaving everything behind.
"We walked out barefoot and saw our friends and neighbors dying around us," she said. "And we couldn't do anything."
More than 10,000 people were missing, Libyan authorities said on Wednesday, after the catastrophic floods that pummeled the country's northeast.
The death toll, which has surpassed 5,000, could reach up to 20,000 based on the number of districts that were wiped out, the mayor of Derna, Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi, told Al Arabiya television.
A North African nation polarized by years of civil war and intense political and territorial divisions, Libya was poorly prepared for Storm Daniel, which swept across the Mediterranean Sea, pummeling its coastline and quickly destroying poorly maintained infrastructure.
The country is split between an internationally recognized government in the western half based in Tripoli, the capital, and a separately administered region in the east. That includes Derna, where the main authority is the Libyan National Army. The rival governments have further complicated rescue and aid efforts.
Desperately needed aid was trickling into the eastern half of the country by Wednesday. But with roads and bridges damaged or cut off, access to the hardest-hit city, Derna, on the Mediterranean coast, remained a major hurdle to bringing in help, according to international aid groups.
Beyond the dead and the missing, more than 34,000 people have been displaced, aid groups said.
"The ultimate figures won't be clear within a day or two or three," Kamal Abubaker, who runs a government agency that tracks down and identifies missing people, told The Times. "It may take weeks, months or even years, as the destruction is vast. The waters have dispersed the corpses over tens of kilometers."
Islam Azouz, an aid worker from Derna, said he lost dozens of relatives. He was outside the city when the flood ripped through and when he returned he said he could no longer recognize the city where he grew up, which had been swallowed by water or mud. Those who survived, he said, were waiting to hear news of those who are still missing.
"People are waiting by the sea," he said. "Today 40 bodies washed up ashore."
Faris al-Tayeh, who is heading a network of volunteer relief workers, said he managed to reach Derna on Monday afternoon despite treacherous, torn-up roads packed with people fleeing.
"We could never have imagined what we saw: corpses in the ocean, whole families wiped out, fathers and sons and brothers stacked on top of each other," he said. "Whole buildings dragged into the water with their residents still inside."
The entire city had been split in two by the flooding, he added.
"To get from one side to the other, you need to travel around for over a hundred kilometers," said Mr. al-Tayeh, who is now organizing an aid convoy to Derna.
The failures of the dams raised alarm over Libya's dilapidated infrastructure.
On Tuesday, the mayor of the northeastern town of Tocra told al-Masar, a Libyan television channel, that a third dam in eastern Libya, the Jaza dam, was filled with water and on the brink of collapse. That dam, between Derna and the main eastern city, Benghazi, needs maintenance to prevent another disaster, he warned.
Hours later, a military official with the Libyan National Army, the main authority in the east, raised concerns about the safety of yet another dam, the Qattara, next to Benghazi. A government statement sought to assure residents that both dams were functioning and under control. Nevertheless, the government said it was installing water pumps to relieve pressure on the Jaza dam.
The flooding began after heavy rains over the weekend burst through two dams south of Derna, unleashing torrents of water through the city of nearly 100,000 people. Much of the city was destroyed as entire neighborhoods, including homes, schools and mosques, were swept away.
The Derna City Council has called for the opening of a maritime passageway to the city and for urgent international intervention.
Rescue teams and some aid deliveries began reaching Derna on Monday via the damaged roads that made passage more difficult and time-consuming, said Tawfiq al-Shukri, a spokesman for Libya's Red Crescent, a nonprofit aid group whose volunteers have helped evacuate residents and which is leading the search-and-rescue efforts.
Aid is also being sent to the airport in Al Bayda, he said, one of the towns in the stricken area.
International aid sent to Benghazi, more than 180 miles by road from Derna, has already been dispatched to the disaster zone, Mr. al-Shukri said, including rescue teams from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
"When the aid arrives, it is immediately sent to the affected areas," he said. "The needs are greater than our abilities and the aid that has come."
Both the western and eastern entrances to Derna were not passable, so the only way into the city was from the south on an unpaved road, slowing the delivery of aid and the arrival of rescue teams, said Bashir Ben Amer, an aid worker with the International Rescue Committee in Libya.
But because of the wet conditions, there is concern that the one functioning road may not hold up under the demands of the convoys pouring into the city, he added. Many of the more than 30,000 people left homeless in the city have not tried to leave, he said.
"Most people are staying inside the city, either looking for loved ones, or they are burying them," he said.
But the Libyan National Army on Wednesday urged residents to leave, saying that the army was taking over Derna to coordinate relief efforts, according to a report on al-Masar.
As with other natural disasters, climate change factors into storms in the Mediterranean Sea and Libya is especially vulnerable. Warming causes the waters of the Mediterranean to expand and its level to rise, eroding shorelines and contributing to flooding, according to the United Nations. Low-lying coastal areas, where much of Libya's population lives, are at particular risk.
The Libyan Red Crescent reported early Wednesday on Facebook that, for a third day, its volunteers were searching for some of the thousands still missing, combing fields, trails and riverbanks.
"No missing people have been found at this moment," the group said.
The group published a document on Facebook listing the survivors from Derna. By Wednesday evening, it had grown to more than 300 names.
"The support is trickling in. We just need more of it," said Dax Roque, the Norwegian Refugee Council's country director for Libya. "The response in Libya for so long has been underfunded. There's an urgent need for international help."
He welcomed a U.N. announcement that it was allocating $ 10 million from its emergency response fund to help those affected by the floods.
Shipments of supplies, including body bags and medical equipment, left early Tuesday morning from Tripoli for Benghazi, the Tripoli government said. A convoy of doctors, nurses and other rescue volunteers had already arrived in Benghazi that morning.
Most needed, the Tripoli government said, were rescue workers and inspectors and others who specialize in floods.
"The infrastructure has been destroyed, which makes it very difficult for emergency medical workers to reach these areas," said Basheer Omar, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Libya. He added that local authorities had to disable the electrical grid for fear that people would be electrocuted in the floods.
His organization has been sending supplies and technical support to the Libyan Red Crescent.
"These areas are totally disconnected. There are no phones, no food, no electricity. So the situation is really dire in these areas," he said. "It's beyond the capacity of the authorities in Libya, so Libya needs the support of the international community."

Union Girds For a Strike In Detroit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The union's president, Shawn Fain, said negotiators were nowhere near an agreement and ruled out a contract extension while talks continued.
Barely 24 hours before the contract deadline, the United Auto Workers leader said Wednesday that his members were prepared for a strike against the three Detroit automakers -- first at a limited number of factories, with the walkout expanding if talks remain bogged down.
The U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, also ruled out any extension of the existing four-year contracts with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis after they expire on Thursday night. "September 14 is a deadline, not a reference point," he declared in an address to union members on Facebook Live.
He said the initial strike locations would be "limited and targeted," and would be communicated to members on Thursday night ahead of a Friday walkout.
This tactic -- a departure from the union's usual strategy of staging an all-out strike against a single automaker chosen as a target -- is intended to give the U.A.W. negotiators increased leverage in the talks, and to keep the manufacturers off balance.
"It will keep them guessing on what's going to happen next," Mr. Fain said.
Striking at even a handful of plants would disrupt the automakers' production while ensuring that a large portion of the 150,000 U.A.W. members at the three companies continued to work and receive paychecks.
The union plans to pay striking workers $ 500 per week and cover the cost of their health insurance premiums. The union has a strike fund of $ 825 million, which would cover payments to workers in a full strike against all three companies for about three months.
In its initial proposal to the companies, the union demanded a 40 percent increase in wages over four years, on the premise that pay packages of the companies' chief executives have on average risen that much over the last four years. The union has also sought regular cost-of-living adjustments that would nudge wages higher in response to inflation.
The union is also seeking pensions for all workers, improved retiree benefits, shorter work hours and an end to a tiered wage system that starts new hires at about half the top U.A.W. wage of $ 32 an hour.
The companies -- each negotiating separately with the union -- have made counterproposals raising wages by roughly half what the union is asking, according to Mr. Fain, and have done even less to satisfy the other demands.
After Mr. Fain's announcement, General Motors issued a statement saying in part: "We continue to bargain directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and have presented additional strong offers. We are making progress in key areas."
Declaring that "the future of our industry is at stake," Ford said it was "ready to reach a deal," adding, "We should be working creatively to solve hard problems rather than planning strikes and P.R. events."
Stellantis said it had presented its latest offer to the union on Tuesday. "Our focus remains on bargaining in good faith to have a tentative agreement on the table before tomorrow's deadline," the company said.
A week ago, the U.A.W. filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board saying G.M. and Stellantis had failed to respond to the union's proposals and were bargaining unfairly.
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry, said a strike was very likely. "I think they can reach an agreement on wages," he said, "but these other issues are complicated and can't be resolved in the last 36 hours by splitting the difference."
Mr. Fain's 40-minute address was highlighted by citations from the Bible; memories of his grandfather, who was also a union autoworker; and plenty of fiery language.
"For the last 40 years, the billionaire class has been taking everything and leaving everybody else to fight for the scraps," he exclaimed at one point. "We are not the problem. Corporate greed is the problem."
He also showed a series of slides listing the union's demands for wages, benefits, job security and other issues alongside what he said were the companies' responses. And he contrasted his leadership team's approach to the negotiations with that of the predecessors they ousted last year.
In the past, the U.A.W. leadership typically gave union members little information on the state of the negotiations until a tentative agreement was reached. Mr. Fain said that members were "fed up with the company-union philosophy" and that dealings with the companies would be transparent to union members, "not behind closed doors as in the past."
The prospect of a large-scale strike comes as the automakers are reaping near-record profits but also contending with the transition to electric vehicles. G.M., Ford and Stellantis -- the parent of Chrysler -- are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new technologies and electric models, build new battery plants, and retool older factories.
The union is concerned about the potential loss of jobs as a result of the transition. Electric vehicles -- which don't have components like transmissions or fuel systems -- require fewer workers to produce.
All three companies are also building battery plants with partners that are not automatically covered by the U.A.W. contract. Workers at one G.M. battery plant in Ohio that started production late last year voted to join the U.A.W. and are negotiating a contract of their own with the company.

“To get from one side to the other, you need to travel around for over a hundred kilometers,” said al-Tayeh, who is now organizing an aid convoy to Derna.
The failures of the dams raised alarm over Libya’s dilapidated infrastructure.
On Tuesday, the mayor of the northeastern town of Tocra told al-Masar, a Libyan television channel, that a third dam in eastern Libya, the Jaza dam, was filled with water and on the brink of collapse. That dam, between Derna and the main eastern city, Benghazi, needs maintenance to prevent another disaster, he warned.
Hours later, a military official with the Libyan National Army, the main authority in the east, raised concerns about the safety of yet another dam, the Qattara, next to Benghazi. A government statement sought to assure residents that both dams were functioning and under control. Nevertheless, the government said it was installing water pumps to relieve pressure on the Jaza dam.
The flooding began after heavy rains over the weekend burst through two dams south of Derna, unleashing torrents of water through the city of nearly 100,000 people. Much of the city was destroyed as entire neighborhoods, including homes, schools and mosques, were swept away. The Derna City Council has called for the opening of a maritime passageway to the city and for urgent international intervention.
Rescue teams and some aid deliveries began reaching Derna on Monday via the damaged roads that made passage more difficult and time-consuming, said Tawfiq al-Shukri, a spokesperson for Libya’s Red Crescent, a nonprofit aid group whose volunteers have helped evacuate residents and that is leading the search and rescue efforts.
Aid is also being sent to the airport in Al Bayda, he said, one of the towns in the stricken area.
International aid sent to Benghazi, more than 180 miles by road from Derna, has already been dispatched to the disaster zone, al-Shukri said, including rescue teams from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
“When the aid arrives, it is immediately sent to the affected areas,” he said. “The needs are greater than our abilities and the aid that has come.”
Both the western and eastern entrances to Derna were not passable, so the only way into the city was from the south on an unpaved road, slowing the delivery of aid and the arrival of rescue teams, said Bashir Ben Amer, an aid worker with the International Rescue Committee in Libya.
But because of the wet conditions, there is concern that the one functioning road may not hold up under the demands of the convoys pouring into the city, he added. Many of the more than 30,000 people left homeless in the city have not tried to leave, he said.
“Most people are staying inside the city, either looking for loved ones, or they are burying them,” he said.
But the Libyan National Army on Wednesday urged residents to leave, saying that the army was taking over Derna to coordinate relief efforts, according to a report on al-Masar.
As with other natural disasters, climate change factors into storms in the Mediterranean Sea, and Libya is especially vulnerable. Warming causes the waters of the Mediterranean to expand and its level to rise, eroding shorelines and contributing to flooding, according to the United Nations. Low-lying coastal areas, where much of Libya’s population lives, are at particular risk.
The Libyan Red Crescent reported early Wednesday on Facebook that for a third day, its volunteers were searching for some of the thousands still missing, combing fields, trails and riverbanks.
“No missing people have been found at this moment,” the group said.
The group published a document on Facebook listing the survivors from Derna. By Wednesday evening, it had grown to more than 300 names.
“The support is trickling in. We just need more of it,” said Dax Roque, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s country director for Libya. “The response in Libya for so long has been underfunded. There’s an urgent need for international help.”
He welcomed a U.N. announcement that it was allocating $10 million from its emergency response fund to help those affected by the floods.
Shipments of supplies, including body bags and medical equipment, left early Tuesday from Tripoli for Benghazi, the Tripoli government said. A convoy of doctors, nurses and other rescue volunteers had already arrived in Benghazi that morning.
Most needed, the Tripoli government said, were rescue workers, and inspectors and others who specialize in floods.
“The infrastructure has been destroyed, which makes it very difficult for emergency medical workers to reach these areas,” said Basheer Omar, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Libya. He added that authorities had to disable the electrical grid for fear that people would be electrocuted in the floods.
His organization has been sending supplies and technical support to the Libyan Red Crescent.
“These areas are totally disconnected. There are no phones, no food, no electricity. So the situation is really dire in these areas,” he said. “It’s beyond the capacity of the authorities in Libya, so Libya needs the support of the international community.”

Full text: Great fries take time, effort and a lot of space.
There are many good things to eat at Libertine, a new French bistro in the West Village that I reviewed this week. But there's one French-bistro standby you will not find there.
"We're not serving fries," Cody Pruitt, one of the owners, told Pamela Vachon of Resy. "You can get fries anywhere."
Maybe that's true. But we don't want the kind of fries you can get anywhere. No, we want great fries. We want fries that, once you've eaten the first one, dominate your consciousness until they are gone. Fries so powerful no amount of Ozempic will silence them. Fewer than 20 restaurants in New York put out fries like that.
The children of Balthazar
For consistency over the long haul, influence over other fry-making restaurants and sheer tonnage of potatoes, we should probably start in SoHo, with Balthazar.
The fries at Balthazar are famous. Your Aunt Sharon in Rapid City has heard about the fries at Balthazar, and has probably watched one of the videos on YouTube demonstrating how they are made. The technique involves peeling russet potatoes, pressing them through a hand-powered French fry cutter, and rinsing them overnight. The next day they are drained, dried, fried at a moderate temperature, allowed to rest, fried again at a higher temperature and tossed with salt.
Crunchy outside, creamy inside, Balthazar fries rarely bend and are never limp. Somehow they taste more like potatoes -- well, potatoes and salt -- than most other fries.
The authors of this method are Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, who oversaw all the McNally kitchens from 1997 until 2013. Two of Balthazar's younger siblings in Keith McNally's company, Pastis, in the Meatpacking District, and Minetta Tavern, in Greenwich Village, follow the Balthazar template.
Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr use it today at their own restaurants, Frenchette, in TriBeCa, and Le Rock, in Midtown, with some modifications. (The potatoes are cut a little thicker, for instance.) A Frenchette or Le Rock fry is like a remix of a Balthazar fry, with a heavier groove.
The fries at Corner Bar and Altro Paradiso (both owned by the chef Ignacio Mattos) are very similar -- to each other, and to the specimens Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr serve. Corner Bar, between Chinatown and the Lower East Side, and Altro Paradiso, west of SoHo, achieve an exterior crisp shell encasing potatoes that are less fluffy than smooth, almost like a purée. They use the double-frying method, too, but after the first trip through the oil they go into the freezer. (Frenchette and Le Rock cool theirs on sheet trays in the kitchen.)
Taking the French out of the fries
Altro Paradiso, being an Italian restaurant, calls its fries patate fritte. But its fries are solidly, recognizably French. And if we are really going to talk about the great fries in this city, we need to expand our range to Belgian frites and English chips.
My first choice for the fatter, mayonnaise-loving Belgian model is Mark's Off Madison, in the Flatiron District, even though the owner, Mark Strausman, says he learned his recipe in Amsterdam in the 1980s. The potatoes are cut by knife to the width of an index finger -- thicker than the fries of the other restaurants. From there, the technique is a double-frying, very similar to the Balthazar method.
"The true, true key is peanut oil," Mr. Strausman said. (The restaurants in the Balthazar lineage use peanut oil, too; Corner Bar and Altro Paradiso blend equal parts peanut oil and canola oil for the second frying.)
For English chips, I like the ones served at Hawksmoor, in the Gramercy Park area, which are misted at the last minute with malt vinegar, and I really like the ones served at Dame and Lord's, sister restaurants in Greenwich Village. All three places follow a triple-cooking method pioneered by the English chef Heston Blumenthal. I won't go into it here, but Ed Szymanski, an owner of Dame and Lord's, calls it "quite an operation." He also stresses the importance of hand-cutting -- English chips should be irregular. I know the off-kilter widths and odd angles are one of the things I enjoy when chips appear at Dame or Lord's.
Where to look for me
I keep all kinds of restaurant lists. One of them, updated constantly, keeps track of newer places that intrigue me. Here's a way shorter version of that list.
Mitica , Greenpoint
When Mariscos El Submarino's bruisingly spicy, inky-dark aguachile negro showed up in 2021, all the fluke crudos around town instantly seemed about as cool as a "live, laugh, love" wall hanging. The food at Mitica, run by the same owners, is more varied and cheffed-up. There's a reprise of the aguachile negro, with butterflied raw shrimp alternating with curves of charred avocado. That soy-darkened marinade, though, is just as uncompromising.
Sartiano's , SoHo
Yes, Sartiano's is fancy Italian in a SoHo hotel. On the other hand, it's guided by Alfred Portale, having a late-career renaissance, with Chris Lewnes as the executive chef. The kitchen seems to be able to look at any ingredient -- even the zucchini wheels among the squid and rock shrimp in a tempura-like fritto misto -- then find flavors in it that other kitchens might miss.

Hundreds Are Feared Dead in Libya Flooding: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The waters swept away hundreds of homes as emergency officials raced to find survivors of the flooding caused by torrential weekend rains. Officials in one city described "catastrophic" devastation.
Deadly floods swept through northeastern Libya over the weekend, with the top official in the region warning that the toll could exceed 2,000 dead as rescue teams searched for survivors.
The Libyan Red Crescent, a nonprofit aid group whose volunteers had helped evacuate residents, said late on Monday that more than 300 people had died in the floods in the port city of Derna in eastern Libya. And more than 5,000 to 6,000 were missing because of floods in the city, apparently caused by the collapse of dams above Derna, said a spokesman for the Libyan National Army that controls eastern Libya, according to The Associated Press.
Exact figures on the scale of fatalities were difficult because of ongoing search efforts on Monday, a spokesman for authorities in that region said on Monday evening.
Libya has been divided between an internationally recognized government based in Tripoli and a separately administered region in the east.
It was not immediately clear what the head of the divided country's eastern region, Osama Hamad, or the military spokesman, Ahmed Mismari, were basing their numbers on. But the flooding was centered in the region under Mr. Hamad's administration, with parts of it declared a disaster zone in the aftermath and rescuers struggling to gain access to the area to provide help.
The internationally recognized authority in western Libya, in Tripoli, did not put out fatality figures, but its leaders held an emergency meeting on Monday on the crisis and said they had sent ambulances, rescue convoys and doctors to the area. They declared three days of mourning for the victims of the flooding.
For years, Libya has been fractured between the two rival governments and prime ministers -- and the militias they control.
Heavy rainfall over the weekend in the country's northeast swelled waters past riverbanks and officials said the force of the floodwaters swept away hundreds of homes and washed away roads. Stranded residents posted accounts of being trapped inside homes and cars, according to footage on social media.
"Entire neighborhoods have been swept away by the sea, and entire neighborhoods have disappeared with their inhabitants," Mr. Hamad said in a phone interview with the Libyan television channel al-Masar on Monday from Derna, among one of the worst-hit cities.
The flooding also ravaged other areas, including the cities of Al-Bayda and Shahhat, where the rising waters forced more evacuations. One medical center in Al-Bayda said it had been forced to move patients, and it shared footage of workers desperately trying to sweep floodwaters outside of submerged hallways.
Derna appeared to have suffered the worst. Local officials in the port city have declared the area a disaster zone, with large parts of the city having been submerged in water. Roads into the city have been cut off, the City Council confirmed on Monday on its Facebook page. It called for the opening of a maritime passageway to the coastal city and for urgent international intervention.
"The situation is catastrophic," the Council said. "The city of Derna is pleading for help."
Residents of the area described chaotic scenes.
"What has happened is a tragedy and a humanitarian catastrophe for us," said Mohammed Jadallah, a Derna resident who woke up his three children and fled the city on Sunday night after water began seeping into his home from the intensifying rain. Since then, with communications down, he has been unable to reach his siblings and has been unable to return to Derna because of the collapsed roads.
"We don't know where our families are, we don't have homes, and we've heard that there are a significant number of casualties," he said, adding that he had already seen photos of his home, which had been washed away. "We have become displaced."
Many of the victims' bodies in Derna had been scattered through the city by the flooding, said Mohammed Abulammousha, a spokesman for the Hamad administration's interior ministry. In a phone interview on Monday evening, he said he had witnessed "horrifying scenes."
He cited a shortage of rescue capabilities and difficulties getting to some of the affected areas. But he added that the authorities were trying to rescue survivors, provide them with food and evacuate them from the city's devastated areas.
"We call on international organizations and countries to assist us in the catastrophe that has befallen the city," he said.
Some foreign governments and aid groups offered to help. The U.S. embassy in Libya said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that they were in close contact with the United Nations and Libyan authorities to quickly bring assistance. An emergency team was being prepared to support local authorities and parties, said Georgette Gagnon, the U.N's humanitarian coordinator.
The United Arab Emirates also said that it would send urgent relief and rescue teams to Libya, according to the Emirati state news agency.
The drenching rains were part of a weather front that had unleashed major flooding in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria last week, sweeping away buildings and killing more than a dozen people before moving toward Libya.

Escaped Pennsylvania Killer Sighted Beyond Search Area: [National Desk]

Full text: After slipping through a perimeter, Danelo Cavalcante appeared clean shaven in an area 40 minutes away and obtained a van, which the police later found. He remains at large.
On Saturday morning, the fugitive who had escaped Chester County Prison and eluded authorities for more than a week was apparently surrounded, hemmed in by a sprawling law enforcement operation in the Philadelphia suburbs. But that night, the man showed up miles away, freshly shaven, in possession of a van and still very much at large.
As the search has grown and shifted across the county, it has become ever more clear that Danelo Cavalcante, a Brazilian national who has been convicted of murder, is an incredibly elusive target.
Roughly 10 days after his jailbreak, Mr. Cavalcante somehow slipped out of a ring formed by nearly 400 federal, state and local officers and appeared on a doorbell camera at the house of a former co-worker in East Pikeland Township, more than 25 miles away. He had driven there, said Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police, in a refrigerated van stolen on Saturday from a dairy farm outside the perimeter that authorities had set up to catch him.
That night, Mr. Cavalcante stopped at the houses of two people he had once worked with, Colonel Bivens said, though neither was home. Then, he drove west, into the Pennsylvania countryside. The van was found on Sunday morning behind a barn in East Nantmeal Township, a small village about 12 miles from East Pikeland, amid cornfields and thick woods. It had apparently run out of gas. "We will continue aggressively proceeding on this search and this investigation and we will eventually capture him," said Colonel Bivens in a news briefing on Sunday. "I'm not prepared to say that will be today or tomorrow, I don't know. But I hope sooner rather than later."
Colonel Bivens was not sure how Mr. Cavalcante managed to get past the perimeter, though he said the area, which was focused around a 1,000-acre botanical garden, included tunnels and drainage ditches that "could not be secured."
The home where Mr. Cavalcante was seen on the doorbell camera is not far from the place where he murdered his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandão, in April 2021. He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder just days before he escaped. According to testimony at his trial, reported in the Daily Local News of West Chester, Mr. Cavalcante had a sister living in Phoenixville, which is next to East Pikeland Township, and he had called on friends there after the murder to help him flee. Authorities believe he was trying to make his way back to Brazil, but he was arrested in Virginia.
The former co-worker whose house Mr. Cavalcante visited on Saturday night notified the police, which was how the authorities learned that he had made it away from the search area, Colonel Bivens said. Mr. Cavalcante went to the house of another former co-worker about 10 minutes later; there, a woman saw him and called a friend, who called the police.
Colonel Bivens declined to comment as to whether anyone was suspected of helping Mr. Cavalcante in his escape. He did confirm a report that Mr. Cavalcante's sister had been recently arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though he gave no further details.
Ms. Brandão's sister and children still live in the Phoenixville area. Last Thursday, Deborah Ryan, the Chester County district attorney, said that they were "terrified" of Mr. Cavalcante and had not left their home since he broke out of jail.
"They're barricaded inside and very concerned about their safety," Ms. Ryan said, adding that they were under 24-hour police protection.
Mr. Cavalcante is also wanted in Brazil for allegedly killing a man in 2017 in Figueirópolis, a small town in a rural part of the country. That time, too, he managed to evade authorities.
On the morning of Aug. 31, Mr. Cavalcante clambered up a wall outside the exercise yard at Chester County Prison, pushing through razor wire, running across a roof and scaling a fence to escape. The officer on duty in a watchtower at the time, who did not notice the jailbreak, has been fired.
In the small communities near the jail, Mr. Cavalcante was seen several times, either spotted by local residents and or picked up on security cameras. Baily's Dairy at Pocopson Meadow Farm, which reported the stolen van, lies between the botanical garden and Chester County Prison.
In a message on Facebook, the owners of Baily's Dairy acknowledged the theft and said they were "just as disappointed as everyone that he broke through the perimeter."
Colonel Bivens said the keys had been left in the van. He did not know what other supplies Mr. Cavalcante may have picked up in his days on the run.
As the search has grown, residents of Chester County, a wealthy and picturesque suburb of Philadelphia, have watched with a mix of dread, frustration and curiosity.
"It's the most excitement we've had," said Mike Holowis, 63, who was among a small crowd that had gathered in front of the Nantmeal United Methodist Church on Sunday morning as the police searched the area where the van had been abandoned. "I mean, nothing happens here."

Singer Denounced Over Video She Made in Ukraine: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The singer Wang Fang drew criticism after she performed "Katyusha," a Soviet-era patriotic song, at the ruins of a theater in Mariupol.
The Chinese singer stands on a balcony inside a bombed-out theater in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the site of a deadly attack last year by Russian forces. Looking at the camera, she sings an excerpt from the Soviet-era patriotic song "Katyusha" and lifts her arms triumphantly into the air.
The video of the singer, Wang Fang, a 38-year-old performer of patriotic songs and Chinese opera, has circulated widely online in recent days, fueling outrage in Ukraine and abroad. She appeared in Mariupol last week as part of a visit by a small group of Chinese media and cultural figures.
The exiled mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, said the theater, which was hit by a Russian air attack while civilians sheltered there, was a "symbol of tragedy, a symbol of Russia's war crimes" that should not be used for entertainment.
"People died there, among them children," he said in a statement. "To turn the theater into a tourist destination and to sing on the bones of the dead is incredible cynicism and disrespect for the memory of the dead civilians."
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry called the performance "an example of complete moral degradation" and said that Ms. Wang and the other Chinese visitors had entered the city illegally.
"Ukraine respects the territorial integrity of China and expects from the Chinese side explanations of the purpose of Chinese citizens' stay in Mariupol," Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for the ministry, said in a Facebook post.
Chinese officials did not respond to a request for comment.
The episode poses a challenge for Beijing, which has sought to publicly portray itself as a neutral broker since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while also providing diplomatic, cultural and economic support to Russia, a longtime ally. The video of Ms. Wang and news articles about it were promptly removed from the Chinese internet.
Elizabeth Wishnick, a senior research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses in Virginia who studies Chinese foreign policy, said the authorities in Beijing might have been concerned about the "tone deafness" of the video.
"It was a shocking display," she said. "This kind of stunt puts China in a difficult spot and tarnishes its so-called neutral image and its support of sovereignty."
Mariupol's Academic Regional Drama Theater was destroyed in 2022 in the midst of the weekslong Russian siege of the city. Hundreds of people had taken shelter in the theater during the siege, and before the attack, the word "children" had been written as a warning in large white letters on the ground outside. At least a dozen people -- estimates of the toll vary -- died in Mariupol.
After her performance, Ms. Wang and the other Chinese visitors met with Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-declared separatist Donetsk People's Republic, Mr. Pushilin said in a post on the messaging app Telegram. He praised Ms. Wang's performance and said the theater was "being restored by St. Petersburg."
The group also met with the top Russian-installed official in Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, who said in a Telegram post that they had discussed "cooperation in the field of tourism." Mr. Aksyonov quoted Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, saying, "China is a brotherly state to Russia."
Ms. Wang has not commented on the episode. But her husband, Zhou Xiaoping, a prominent nationalist writer who was in Moscow, defended her. In a post that was later deleted, he described Ms. Wang as a "Chinese folk singer without any political identity" and said that she had been pushing for peace.
"I personally applaud my wife for her strength, bravery and determination," he wrote.
Mr. Zhou, a member of a political advisory group to the Chinese government who has been praised by China's top leader, Xi Jinping, for exhibiting "positive energy" in his writings, many of which are critical of the United States, said he had not traveled to Mariupol to "avoid unnecessary disputes."
Ms. Wang, who trained at the Shenyang Conservatory of Music in northeast China, rose to prominence after winning a 2012 competition promoting "red songs," or Communist patriotic music. She is known for renditions of works like "Hymn to Heroes" and "Beautiful Chinese Dream," and she has performed on state television, often in military-style costumes.

"Katyusha," the song she performed in Mariupol, was a popular patriotic ballad in the Soviet Union during World War II. She sang the Chinese translation of the song, about a woman on a riverbank, singing to a faraway soldier. "Katyusha" is the diminutive form of the name Katherine in Russian; a Soviet rocket launcher was nicknamed for the song.
The international online backlash against Ms. Wang has been heated, with many people saying she should be banned from the stage. The controversy has also affected other performers in the industry.
Another prominent Chinese soprano, Ying Fang, who is a regular at major opera houses, said that she had received racist and violent messages because people had mistaken her for Ms. Wang.
Ms. Fang issued a statement denouncing the messages. "I do not and will not tolerate racism and blind hatred and bullying," she said.

Contract Deadline Near, Union and Automakers Still Far Apart in Talks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Auto Workers has said it is prepared to strike at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis if a deal is not reached before current contracts end on Thursday.
The United Auto Workers union and the three established U.S. automakers remain far apart on wages and other issues with less than a week to go before contracts covering 150,000 union workers expire.
So far, the companies -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler -- have offered to raise pay by 14 percent to 16 percent over four years. Their offers include lump sum payments to help ease the impact of inflation, and policy changes that would lift the pay of recent hires and temporary workers, who typically earn about a third less than veteran union members.
But the union's combative new president, Shawn Fain, has dismissed the offers as "insulting," noting that the three manufacturers have been making near-record profits for almost a decade, and that pay packages of top executives have increased substantially. He has been seeking pay increases of about 40 percent and repeatedly warned that workers were ready to leave assembly lines when the current collective bargaining agreements with the automakers expire on Thursday.
Mr. Fain has said the union is willing to strike at all three automakers simultaneously, a step it has never taken before. An across-the-board stoppage would deal a big blow to the economies of Michigan and other states.
"We aren't going to stand by and allow them to drag out the negotiations like they've done in the past," Mr. Fain said Friday in a video on Facebook. "If we hit 11:59 on Thursday without a deal at any of the Big Three automakers, there will be a strike -- at all three if need be."
The talks are taking place during a sweeping shift from combustion engine cars and trucks to electric vehicles, which require fewer parts and less labor to produce. U.A.W. leaders and members are increasingly worried that the transition will eliminate jobs and, over time, reduce wages and benefits.
The automakers are also worried about the transition. G.M., Ford and Stellantis are spending tens of billions of dollars to build new factories and scour the world for battery raw materials like lithium. Company executives have argued that offering the U.A.W. members big raises could leave them at a significant cost disadvantage to Tesla, which dominates the U.S. electric car market and employs nonunion workers.
The auto industry is the largest U.S. manufacturing sector, and accounts for about 3 percent of the nation's economic output. The three Detroit automakers operate dozens of plants that make about 500,000 cars a month.
The Anderson Economic Group, a research firm in East Lansing, Mich., estimated that a 10-day strike against the three companies would reduce the companies' profits by $ 1 billion and wages by $ 900 million for U.A.W. members and workers employed by other companies that depend on the automakers.
Aside from wages, the union and the companies remain far apart on several other matters, including measures to preserve jobs and discourage the closing of U.S. plants, increases in retirement benefits and cost-of-living adjustments, which were once standard in U.A.W. contracts.
The union has made some progress in its discussions with Ford. In response to Mr. Fain's demands, the automaker offered to increase wages by about 15 percent, through a 9 percent increase in base wages and one-time lump sum payments of $ 11,000 per worker. While Mr. Fain rejected that, the two sides have continued bargaining. He was scheduled to update U.A.W. members later on Friday about Ford's latest offer.
Talks with G.M. and Stellantis have proceeded more slowly. The U.A.W. filed a complaint last week with the National Labor Relations Board, saying the two manufacturers had refused to offer proposals in response to the union's demands and were not negotiating in good faith.
G.M. responded by offering a combination of base wage increases and lump sum payments that would lift worker pay by about 16 percent. "We have already said we want to reward and recognize our employees with wage increases," Gerald Johnson, G.M.'s executive vice president for global manufacturing, said this week.
Agreeing to all of the union's demands would threaten G.M.'s ability to compete, he added.
Mr. Fain said the wage offer didn't go far enough to make up for the impact of inflation on workers' take-home pay over the last decade, and was too little in light of the profits G.M. was making. The automaker reported profits of $ 7 billion in the first half of the year. Mr. Fain also complained that G.M. had rejected the union's proposals on job security, retiree pay, cost-of-living adjustments and other issues.
Stellantis submitted its proposal to the union Friday morning, offering a 14.5 percent rise in base wages with no lump-sum payments.
"This is a responsible and strong offer that positions us to continue providing good jobs to our employees," Mark Stewart, the chief operating officer of Stellantis's North American operations, said in a statement. "With this offer, we are seeking a timely resolution to our discussions."
Stellantis, which is based in Amsterdam and was created by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot in 2021, earned 11 billion euros ( $ 12 billion) in the first half of the year, a record.

Half a Century of Grief: The Orphans of Flight 723: [National Desk]

Full text: At the age of 58, stuck in her house through the long nights of the coronavirus pandemic, Michelle Brennen started to spend more and more of her time thinking about the worst thing that had ever happened to her.
She was 10, on summer vacation. She had been playing in the yard in Essex, Vt., and when she came inside, she found her mother standing in the archway between the kitchen and the living room, crying.
"Daddy's plane crashed," said one of her five siblings -- she has never known which one. The information did not register; she thought they meant one of her father's model airplanes. No big deal, she thought. Just glue it back together.
It was 1973, a time when adults didn't talk to children about death. That afternoon, a neighbor took the children to the beach so they wouldn't see news coverage of the crash, among the deadliest in New England's history.
The following week, when their father was buried, they weren't allowed to attend the funeral. When school started, a guidance counselor called her in and asked her how she was doing. Michelle said, "Fine," and that was that.
Maybe that's why, all these years later, something kept steering Michelle's mind back to the plane crash.
Clearing out her mother's basement after she died in 2021, Michelle found a cardboard box where her mother had stored everything related to the flight, Delta 723 -- newspaper clippings, correspondence with lawyers, journal entries.
Once she began reading, Michelle found that she could not stop. She was especially drawn by the dog-eared passenger manifest, 89 names on a battered sheet of paper. How many of them had left children like her behind? Where were those children now? How had their lives turned out?
And so, planting herself in front of an iPad at the dining room table, she tracked them down one by one. She popped up in their DMs. She called their landlines. She invited them to exchange stories on a Facebook page. She hoped she didn't sound like a kook.
In her own way, she was exploring questions that have preoccupied the field of mental health. How does traumatic loss alter the course of a person's life? Does grief subside more fully when left in a box, or when it is shared? Does it subside at all?
These questions hung in the air on a Sunday morning in July, when Michelle, now 60, awaited the arrival of around 200 people, nearly all of them strangers. Over two years, she had managed to track down survivors for all but four of the 89 people who had been aboard the plane, and persuade them to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of the crash.
She had chosen for the location of their one and only meeting an obvious and terrible place -- Logan Airport, not far from the runway where Flight 723 had burst into flames.
A 'large, long flame'
The plane was descending through dense clouds surrounding Boston when something seemed to go wrong in the cockpit. "Going like a son of a bitch," said the pilot, John Streil, to his co-pilot, Sidney Burrill, who was trying to line up the jet to approach the runway properly.
Thick fog in Boston had caused many flights to be diverted, so Flight 723, from Burlington, Vt., had made an unscheduled stop in Manchester, N.H., to pick up stranded passengers. Most of them were probably looking at their watches, worried about making connecting flights.
On the instructions of air traffic control, the crew had made a series of turns intended to align the aircraft with a localizer beam, which demarcates the centerline of the runway and acts as a guide for pilots in low visibility.
But they were moving too fast -- 237 miles per hour -- and they were too high. They overshot the localizer, and then scrambled to correct course, descending too quickly.
The crew had been told that the cloud cover was at 400 feet, and peered into the whiteness, expecting to break through at any moment. But a thick bank of sea fog was moving across the airport. They saw nothing.
"OK, just fly the airplane," the pilot said, according to cockpit voice recordings. Two seconds later, Mr. Streil understood that the plane's flight director was malfunctioning, and he said: "You better go to raw data. I don't trust that thing."
For the first time, his voice betrayed strain. "Let's get back on course if you can," he barked at his co-pilot. The plane was traveling at around 150 m.p.h. when it hit the concrete sea wall that separates the airport from Boston Harbor.
The impact shattered the plane, and pieces of the cabin rocketed forward onto the runway. A construction worker nearby described a "large, long flame" appearing on the runway, rising "as if it were a curtain."
When rescue workers arrived, they found fragments of the plane and its passengers scattered down the runway, covering an area the size of three football fields. There were blue and red seats, some with passengers still strapped in.
The remainder of the aircraft had broken with such force that, a spokesman with the National Transportation Safety Board later said, "you could pick up almost any of the pieces in your hands."
Many things went wrong simultaneously during the landing, Paul Houle, a former U.S. Army accident investigator, concluded in his 2021 book on the disaster. The plane's flight director was faulty; the air traffic controller was distracted; the crew had been misinformed about the weather. Each of these factors, he said, carried equal weight.
But at the time, the public was offered only one explanation: pilot error. Aviation officials "would only say that the pilot, Captain John N. Streil Jr., was flying the jetliner 230 feet too low and 3,500 feet short of the usual touchdown point," The Associated Press reported.
Fishermen told The Boston Globe that the fog had been so thick that they hadn't been able to see their hooks hit the water. "The goddamn fools, flying in this weather," one of them said.
The box
On the day of her father's funeral, Michelle watched the adults leave in their church clothes.
She had shouted at her mother -- she thought she was old enough to go -- but now the fight had drained out of her, and she sat on a cement floor in an unfinished part of the house, behind a piece of lumber, where they couldn't see her cry.
To comfort her, an aunt promised to bring her a gift: a bottle of Shower to Shower baby powder. But nothing could comfort her.
She came to understand her role in the family tragedy. "You knew something big was going down, and you didn't make any waves," she said. Her mother was "constantly trying to get us to go outside and play -- go outside and play."
In all that silence, terrible thoughts snagged in her mind. The night before the crash, she had gotten into an argument with her father, and, "in my 10-year-old, very stubborn and bossy way," muttered to herself: "I wish you would die." This ate at her, this unforgivable thing, but she never told. Whom would she tell?
And somehow it transpired that she did not quite take in her father's death. Years later, she still sometimes thought she spotted him in crowds. She would look for him in Barre, Vt., where he had grown up. Her sister Denise, who was 8 when their father died, felt the same way. "I kept thinking for years that he was coming back," she said.
Her father, Michael Longchamp, was 39 that summer, working as a draftsman at an architectural firm. He was an outdoorsman and a former Air Force tail gunner. By temperament, he was preternaturally even-keeled. At home, he would lie back in an armchair and let his six children crawl over him like puppies.
That summer was a perforated line, separating life with their father from life without him: Tear here.
The extended family closed ranks; their aunt moved her family back to Vermont so she could be near. Michelle remembers her mother, Patricia, as always busy in the years that followed. Chris was 9; Denise was 8; Anthony was 6; Renee was 5; and Joseph was 2. "It wasn't like she could sit and cry over it with nobody around," she said. "She had stuff to do."
In that sense, they coped well. They moved on. "My family did a fabulous job of making sure that we didn't feel any repercussions over it," she said. "You know, we didn't dwell on it." But something was off-kilter, like a bone that had not been set properly. Even today, she wonders: Who would they have been if their father had not died?
After graduating from high school, she got a job at a flower shop and married her high school boyfriend, more or less to get out of the house.
She is sure that would not have happened if her father had been alive. He would have insisted that she go to college. Maybe she would have followed her father into the military. At the least, she would have left Vermont. "I think about that every day," she said.
It was worse for her brothers, though. "You're the man of the house now," one of the grown-ups told Chris.
"I think my mother, to her deathbed, would say that just crushed him," Michelle said.
When Michelle found the box in her mother's basement, she realized how much her mother had carried alone. There were her father's death certificate -- "two broken legs and generalized thermal burns" -- and her mother's handwritten journals.
"Anthony asked tonight to see a picture of his daddy, because he had forgotten what he looked like," read one of the entries. "I showed everyone a picture and Joseph laughed right out loud and said, 'That my daddy.' It hurts so much sometimes I don't think I can make it."
"In 48 years, we never knew that side of her, the pain she was going through," Michelle said. She wondered if the box was a form of communication, whether she was meant to look inside.
"My mother had saved that whole box of stuff," she said. "And I'm thinking that maybe, I did it for her, too. Like, maybe in the back of her mind, she thought this was important."
On the phone
Tracking down the other families felt satisfying. When she finally did get her bachelor's degree, racking up one or two credits each semester while working two jobs, she had majored in psychology. Now she rolled up her sleeves and began collecting data.
There were, as a social scientist might put it, correlations. Many of the passengers' children recalled feeling completely alone in their grief, excluded from the rituals of mourning. Douglas Watts, an IT manager in Portland, Maine, was 8 when his mother, Sandy, died in the crash. "It was basically: She died, we had a service, it was done," he said. His job, he understood, was "to never do anything that brought pain or emotion to anybody." So he did not cry, not once.
Many shared the feeling that the crash had radically changed the circumstances of their lives, setting them on a new path. Albert Holzscheiter, a building contractor in Fredericksburg, Texas, was 3 when his father died in the crash. His mother moved the family to Key West, Fla., as far as she could get from the extended family in Vermont.
"It has totally changed and rewired who I probably would be," he said. "I do not know if I would recognize the person that I would have been."
Even their memories of the day itself lined up with hers. Cornelia Prevost, who was 12 when her father, Count Laszlo Hadik, died in the crash, had written a poem that made Michelle cry when she read it, it was so close to her own recollection.
"A glorious, simple / summer day tripped / into slow motion," it read in part. "Expectant, heavy calm / an approaching thunderhead / and sibilant grownups roboted. / We knew not to be boisterous."
But not everyone understood what she was trying to do. "I'm barely getting people to tell me who they are," she complained a year into the effort. It was too painful, some of them told her. "You know, my family was ripped apart, and I can't even talk about it," she recalled some saying.
Cindy Provost Long, 66, a nurse in Bennington, Vt., felt that way. She was 16 when the plane crashed; her grandmother, two cousins and her 14-year-old brother, Michael, were on board. She remembers a doctor coming "and giving my mother some kind of injection to calm her down." After that, her mother "had, essentially, a nervous breakdown."
She never really got better. Ms. Long used to wait for the mail so she could throw out her brother's Mad magazine, to spare her mother the pang of seeing it. When dementia clouded her mother's memories, she said, it was a blessing.
For Ms. Long, discussing the loss on Facebook was not therapeutic. The scab that had formed in her mind, slowly, over decades, was prized off, and she started having bad dreams again, lying awake at night, "asking what-ifs." Michelle's whole outreach project, she said, was "an intrusive act."
"It's too late, and it's still too personal," she said. And as for getting together at Logan Airport? No, thank you. "I don't understand how this could be, like, a celebration," she said. "Is it the airport asking forgiveness? Is it Delta that is doing this? I don't even know what it is."
Michelle didn't argue when she got that kind of response. But there were a few families she kept going back to, because their story troubled her so deeply: the families of the men in the cockpit. Early in her research, she learned something she found wrenching. As New Englanders mourned the dead of Flight 723, some had turned their anger on the pilots' families.
"They got death threats over the phone. They got death threats in the mail," said Hollie Streil, who married the pilot's son, John Randolph Streil. The experience, she said, "turned his mother into an alcoholic."
Mr. Streil, who was 12 at the time of the crash, began drinking heavily in his teens, and struggled with addiction throughout his life. "He, his family, bore the brunt of everyone's anger," Ms. Streil said. "I just remember my husband just sitting and crying and saying they blamed him."
She and Mr. Streil divorced in 2013 but lived together until he died of a heart attack in 2015. Her feelings about the crash and its aftermath were complicated and dark. But Michelle kept reaching out to her, and Ms. Streil became convinced that her intentions were good.
So she arranged to attend, with three children and two grandchildren.
She was dreading it, she confessed. "This has been buried under the rug for so long. All of a sudden people are going to rip up the pieces," she said.
"I will be glad when it is over," she said. "I don't think I will ever go back into Boston."
In the ballroom
On the night before the big gathering, Michelle was frazzled and anxious. She had developed a sinus infection, and was so hoarse she could barely speak. Also, she was acutely aware of the things that might go wrong.
Culpability was litigated, slowly and painfully, for nine years after the crash. Passengers' families sued Delta; Delta argued that the air traffic controllers were responsible; the pilots' families sued the manufacturer of the faulty flight director.
But none of it, not the settlements or the court decisions, fully put to rest the question of blame. Two years of research had given Michelle a sense of the anger that some families still harbored, burning as steadily as a pilot light.
Now, at her request, they would all be in the same room, with an open microphone. This was a minefield. Delta had donated money for the buffet lunch. Then there were the Streils, whom she had coaxed into attending. What was she thinking?
It was true, she had shaken things loose. Mr. Holzscheiter, who had driven 30 hours from Texas, felt a wave of sickening panic after he checked into his hotel; he wasn't sure he could go through with it. His wife, Ginger, compared the gathering to the story of Pandora's box from Greek mythology, releasing all manner of phantoms.
On her way to the ballroom, Liz Axness, who lost her mother in the crash, found herself in an elevator with a group that appeared to be headed to the event. When she asked, "Who was your loved one?" one of them replied -- meekly, she thought -- that they were from Delta.
"I'm like, What do you think I'm going to do, kick you in the tummy or something?" she said. "You weren't even born."
The night before, Jim Fuller, a sportswriter who lost his mother and father in the crash, had met the Streils. It had been a pleasant interaction; they had participated in a memorial blood drive he had set up.
He had nothing but compassion for the Streils; their family, he said, "had been through more than any of us." He would never assign blame. But a question had gnawed at him since he was 8, and he could not help asking it aloud now.
"Why," he said, "would you try to land a plane if you can't see the runway?"
Coming to terms
One thing that has changed in this country since 1973 is the way we respond to traumatic losses.
When a child dies in a car accident, grief counselors are on hand at schools, to help students process their feelings. Police officers attend debriefings. Bereaved people send out flares of raw grief on social media. This is viewed as healthy. With luck, it gives us closure.
But researchers trying to pin down this phenomenon have been left with doubts. Two years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Roxane Cohen Silver, a social psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, and a team of researchers looked at a group of people who had been asked to describe their emotions on the day of the attacks.
What they discovered, she said, was that "those who emoted most, wrote the most words, actually did the worst over time." It wasn't that emoting was bad, Dr. Silver said. More likely, those who emoted more were simply in more distress.
Her research has also called into question a much larger assumption: that people who suffer terrible losses eventually come to peace with them. In a 1989 study, she and Rosemary Tait interviewed 45 older men and women -- the mean age was 76 -- about the worst thing that had ever happened to them. For most, it was the death of a spouse or a close family member.
These were old losses; the average elapsed time was almost 23 years. What the researchers found was that the pain had not gone away. Seventy-one percent said they still experienced mental images or memories of the loss, and 96 percent said they sometimes ruminated about it. Thirty-seven percent said they were still searching for meaning in it.
"There are some for whom resolution never happens," Dr. Silver said. "And there is some acknowledgment that, for some people, they will never resolve their sudden tragic loss, and they will probably function well. It's not that they will not be able to get out of bed. But they will not, quote, get over it."
Still, something seemed to be happening that morning in the lobby of the airport Hilton, as those who had come recognized one another. They embraced each other, squeezed each other's hands. They ran their fingers over a memorial plaque of Vermont granite that had been mounted in the airport's chapel.
It was a comfort. There were so many of them. "My mother was on the plane," a woman in dreadlocks told a man in Bermuda shorts. "My father was on the plane," he responded.
Finally, they took their seats in a ballroom, where photographs of the dead were projected onto a screen. Michelle's sister sang with her barbershop quartet. Someone read a poem by Robert Frost. Michelle said she hoped they could set aside whatever anger and bitterness remained, to honor the dead.
Then Jillian Streil, the pilot's granddaughter, made her way to the microphone. She was 37, a waitress in Manchester, N.H., with blond bangs and cat's-eye glasses.
She never met her grandfather, but when she searched online for information about the crash, the phrase that came up was "pilot error." She had read through the passenger manifest many, many times. "I almost feel like it's my responsibility," she said.
Standing before the passengers' siblings and spouses, their children and grandchildren, she held up a piece of paper on which she had written down what she wanted to say.
"He deserved to be remembered for more than this awful tragedy," she said. So she said a few words about him. That he had been a devoted son. That he had loved to fly. That when he died, he had a son who was about to turn 13. That as his wife and son mourned, they absorbed the hatred of those who blamed him.
"They are no longer with us, and that's why I am here today, to speak for them," she said.
Standing up there, she set aside passages of the speech -- things she had been thinking about for 20 years -- because she couldn't get through them.
"From the Streil family, thank you all," she said.
She returned to her seat, looking pale.
And then a row of people were lined up to put their arms around the young woman.
The son of Bette Vincent, who died in the crash, hugged her.
The son of Sandy Watts, who died in the crash, hugged her.
The son of Al Holzscheiter, who died in the crash, hugged her.
The sister-in-law of Michael Longchamp, who died in the crash, hugged her.
The sister-in-law of Maria Abrams, who died in the crash, hugged her.
Michelle hugged her. And, for the first time that day, she wept.
Closing the box
Then it was done. The families dispersed quickly, stopping by a desk outside to validate their parking tickets, vanishing into the hubbub of the airport.
On the long drive back to Texas, Mr. Holzscheiter had time to consider something that had been proposed at the gathering: that this group reconvene every 10 years. "I think the word 'generations' was used," he said.
He disagreed; his children didn't have strong feelings about the crash, and he thought that was as it should be. "Daddy's memory will die when I die," he said. "My generation, and my mother's generation, remembers them, and I think it should probably pass on."
Michelle returned to Vermont the same day, loading up her S.U.V. with tote bags and centerpieces. All morning, people had been praising her, thanking her for bringing them together, and this made her uncomfortable; she shook it off reflexively, the way a dog shakes off water.
She was now finished with the memorial, a moment her friends and family had long pondered. What would she do without her project? The next day, she spent some time with her chickens. She went to see "Barbie" with her girlfriends.
But it didn't take long before she started thinking about the crash again. Strangers were reaching out through the Facebook page. She still had questions; she had never known what meetings her father had been headed to in Boston that day, and it bothered her.
So her mother's box of documents stayed in its spot at the dinner table, and before long, she was back at her iPad, looking for those four families she had never been able to reach.

Murdaugh's Lawyers Say Court Clerk Tampered With Jury: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lawyers for Alex Murdaugh, a South Carolina lawyer convicted of murder, said in a court filing that an official told jurors not to be "fooled by" his testimony.
When Alex Murdaugh, the once-influential South Carolina lawyer, was convicted in March of murdering his wife and younger son, the verdict was widely seen as a rebuke of corruption in a legal system that Mr. Murdaugh had bent to his benefit for years.
Now, Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers say that he is a victim of a corrupt judicial process, and are seeking a new trial and an F.B.I. investigation. In an explosive court filing on Tuesday, they claim that the clerk of court had a series of inappropriate conversations with jurors and committed other misconduct during his trial.
Among the claims are that the clerk, Rebecca Hill, told jurors not to be "fooled by" Mr. Murdaugh's tearful testimony; that she had private conversations with the jury forewoman, including one in a courthouse restroom; and that she fabricated a story about a Facebook post by another juror's ex-husband in an effort to have that juror removed.
Ms. Hill did not respond to several requests for comment.
The state attorney general, Alan Wilson, said he was reviewing Mr. Murdaugh's motion and would respond "through the legal process."
One juror said in an affidavit filed with the motion that at the beginning of deliberations, Ms. Hill told jurors that "this shouldn't take us long." Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers said that Ms. Hill told the six smokers on the jury that they could not take a smoke break until after they reached a verdict.
The trial lasted nearly six weeks, but the jury deliberated for only three hours on March 2 before convicting Mr. Murdaugh, the scion of a legal family in the state's Lowcountry region, of two counts of murder. The judge hearing the case sentenced him the next day to life in prison. Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers promised an appeal.
The lawyers have also asked the U.S. attorney in South Carolina to have the F.B.I. investigate whether Ms. Hill violated Mr. Murdaugh's constitutional rights by depriving him of a trial by an impartial jury.
"The clerk of court is the person that makes sure the jury gets their food," Dick Harpootlian, one of Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers, said at a news conference on Tuesday. "They're not someone that ever should talk to them about the case. I've never had it happen."
Ms. Hill is the clerk of court for Colleton County, S.C., where the trial was held. It is an elected position, responsible for a range of administrative matters in the county courts, including managing jury logistics. The job is distinct from that of a judge's law clerk. Ms. Hill was elected in 2020; her term ends next year.
Since the verdict was handed up, Ms. Hill has kept an unusually high profile for a court official. Immediately after she read the verdict aloud in the courtroom -- which was shown live on television -- she stood on the second-floor balcony of the courthouse with her dog as prosecutors held a news conference below.
A few days later, when the lead prosecutor on the case, Creighton Waters, posted a video on Twitter, now known as X, of himself playing the guitar, Ms. Hill replied with three heart emojis and the comment, "Your biggest fan in Colleton County!"
In July, Ms. Hill and a co-author, Neil Gordon, published a book of her firsthand account of the trial, a move that raised eyebrows among some legal observers. Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers said that after Ms. Hill published the book and began promoting it, they heard from some jurors who felt uncomfortable about her behavior.
Some passages in Ms. Hill and Mr. Gordon's book are cited in the motion filed by Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers, who argue that Ms. Hill may have pushed jurors toward a conviction in order to get herself a book deal and appearances in the media. One passage from the book says that while she was chaperoning jurors on a visit to the crime scene as part of the trial, she and the jurors and law enforcement officers who were present "had an epiphany and shared our thoughts with our eyes."
"At that moment," she wrote, "many of us standing there knew. I knew and they knew that Alex was guilty."
Bruce A. Green, a law professor at Fordham University who specializes in criminal law and ethics, said he had never before heard of a clerk of court publishing a book about a trial in which she was involved. Professor Green said that the actions alleged in Mr. Murdaugh's motion would not have been appropriate, and would probably lead to a factual inquiry by a judge.
"If it really happened, it would really be improper," he said.
He noted that jurors were not supposed to discuss a case even with one another before formal deliberations began, let alone discuss it with a clerk. "It's a pretty incendiary allegation," he said.
Mr. Murdaugh, who gave two days of dramatic testimony during his trial, has maintained that he is innocent of the fatal shootings of his younger son, Paul, and wife, Maggie, who were killed in June 2021.

Cuba Claims Traffickers Lure Recruits For Russia: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Cuban government said it had begun criminal proceedings against a "trafficking network" that had been recruiting its citizens in both Russia and Cuba for Russia's armed forces.
Cuba's government has begun criminal proceedings against a "human trafficking network" that recruited Cuban citizens to fight in Russia's war with Ukraine, according to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The ministry issued a statement on Monday saying that Cuban authorities had begun dismantling the recruiting group for Russia. The statement said the network had intended to "incorporate Cuban citizens living there and even some living in Cuba" into the military and take part in operations in Ukraine.
The statement cited Cuba's "firm and clear historical position against mercenarism" and said that it was "not part of the war in Ukraine."
The statement did not say who was behind the trafficking network, or how many people had been affected. The claims had not been independently verified, and the Russian authorities did not immediately comment.
The Moscow Times reported that a social media account under the name of Elena Shuvalova had for months been posting ads in a Facebook group called "Cubans in Moscow" offering a one-year contract with the Russian Army. On Tuesday, the group had nearly 76,000 members. The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry did not mention the group.
But Andrés Albuquerque, a Cuban political analyst in Miami, said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would not recruit in Cuba without the consent of the country's government, and that it was "not possible" for the government not to know about the human trafficking network.
"In Cuba that does not exist," Mr. Albuquerque said.
Cuba has been a close ally of Russia since the Cuban Revolution in 1959. The country's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, met with Mr. Putin during his official visit to Russia last November, and they have pledged to strengthen what they have called a "strategic partnership." And when Álvaro López Miera, the head of Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, visited Moscow in June, he was received by his Russian counterpart, Sergei K. Shoigu, who said that Cuba was Russia's "most important ally" in the Caribbean.
"Our Cuban friends confirmed their attitude toward our country, including demonstrating a full understanding of the reasons for the start of a special military operation in Ukraine," Mr. Shoigu said at the time, according to reports from Tass, a Russian state media agency. There are direct flights between the countries, which have a mutual visa-free arrangement for 90 days out of 180. About 70,000 Russian tourists visited Cuba in the first half of 2023, according to Russian state media, and about 11,000 Cubans visited Russia in 2022, according to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
It is not the first time that a country has claimed that its citizens were being recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine. In late June, a prosecutor's office in the Kostanay region of north Kazakhstan issued a statement saying that advertisements attempting to recruit people to "participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine" had been appearing on social media and elsewhere online.
The statement said that mercenary activities were prohibited by the Kazakh Constitution, and that serving in military operations in a foreign country was a criminal offense.
Mr. Shoigu announced late last year that the ranks of the Russian Army needed to be expanded from 1.15 million servicemen to 1.5 million, and U.S. officials have said that Russia has struggled to attract recruits.
The Russian government has taken a number of measures to bolster its military ranks, including making draft evasion more difficult and raising the maximum age of men required to complete military service from 27 to 30.

U.A.W. and Big 3 Face Sizable Gap To Avoid a Strike: [National Desk]

Full text: With their contract expiring Sept. 14, the United Auto Workers and the companies are far apart in talks. A walkout could take a big economic toll.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers have less than two weeks to negotiate a new labor contract, and a strike of some sort seems increasingly likely.
The union's president, Shawn Fain, has primed rank-and-file members to be prepared to walk off the job if the union's long list of demands for improved wages and benefits are not met.
A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. G.M. workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three -- a step the union has never taken but one Mr. Fain has said he is willing to call for this year -- could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
"If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation," said Patrick Anderson, the chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Mich.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an E.V.-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tailwind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Biden has declared that "the U.A.W. deserves a contract that sustains the middle class" and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the U.A.W. has withheld an endorsement of his re-election bid so far, partly because of concern over the union's share of E.V.-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire on Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Mr. Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline -- the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the U.A.W. presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
"President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there's going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike," said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. "The U.A.W. leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it's pretty unlikely there won't be a strike."
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $ 859 million and manufacturers' losses of $ 989 million, according to estimates by Mr. Anderson's firm.
In August, Mr. Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making a third less than veteran workers. Mr. Fain suggested as much as a 40 percent wage increase, noting that the chief executives of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
"The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be," Mr. Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Mr. Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were "insulting" to the U.A.W.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9 percent wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker's income by 15 percent over the four-year contract. Mr. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker's income over a long period.
The U.A.W. and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Mr. Fain said that G.M. and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union's proposals, and that the U.A.W. had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
"I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I'm fed up," he said. "Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will."
G.M. said it was "surprised by and strongly refutes" the charges in the N.L.R.B. complaint. "We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress," Gerald Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was "disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining," the company said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement."
In recent weeks, workers have organized several dozen rallies and other gatherings to prepare for picketing. "I think the membership is energized," said Christine Bostic, a battery tester at a G.M. electric vehicle plant in Detroit. "The facts are on our side. If it comes to a strike, I'm ready for that."
To soften the impact of a stoppage, the union has amassed a strike fund of $ 825 million. It plans to pay striking workers $ 500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums while they are out of work.
In recent days, Mr. Fain has joined the union's negotiating teams in their talks with each of the automakers, an unusual step. Normally, the U.A.W. president does not take a direct role until the final days or hours of negotiations.
On Wednesday, he took part in discussions with Stellantis, where tensions between the two sides have been high. When Stellantis responded to Mr. Fain's demands with a list of cost concessions it wanted from the union, Mr. Fain took to Facebook to denounce them, dropping the document into a wastebasket.
Decades ago, when the U.A.W. had more than a million members and the Big Three -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis -- had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the United States economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. G.M., Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 U.A.W. workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.
But the union entered this year's talks in a much stronger negotiating position than it had in years. In the past, the Detroit companies were struggling badly against foreign rivals that operate nonunion plants in the South, like Toyota and Honda, and had a significant cost advantage. In most of the last several contracts, G.M., Ford and Stellantis had to get concessions on wages and benefits to survive.
Over the last 10 years, however, all three companies have rung up record profits, thanks in part to the concessions they won from the union as well as the shift in consumer preferences to high-margin trucks and large sport utility vehicles.
In the first half of this year, Ford made $ 3.7 billion and G.M. made $ 5 billion. Stellantis reported profits of 11 billion euros (about $ 11.9 billion).
In the past, the U.A.W. has chosen one company -- it was G.M. four years ago -- as the "target" to focus on in the talks. Mr. Fain has said the union could target all three companies this time around, but many analysts think the union will eventually choose Stellantis. In addition to the strains between the company and the union, their talks involve a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis has idled and that the union wants the company to reopen.
Getting Stellantis to reopen the plant is a critical task for Mr. Fain. Four years ago, G.M. closed a plant in Ohio and the U.A.W. failed in its efforts to push the company to reopen it. In his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Fain promised members that his tougher approach would prove successful this time.
The union could get a hand in this battle from the federal government. On Thursday, the Energy Department said it had made $ 2 billion in grants and $ 10 billion in loans available to auto companies to convert existing factories that build gasoline-powered cars and trucks into plants that produce hybrid and electric vehicles.
Stellantis, like G.M. and Ford, aims to introduce several more electric models over the next few years and will probably have to retool some plants to make them. It is already building a battery plant in Indiana for its E.V. push.
Mr. Fiorani suggested that Stellantis could decide to overhaul the Belvidere plant to make electric models. "Stellantis could find a product to go in there," he said. "For the U.A.W. to truly win something, though, it has to be electric vehicles that Stellantis would plan on making for several years."

Custody of a Clone: [Style Desk]

Full text: A thorny question of custody is complicated by the fact that the reader adopted the original dog, but her ex paid a majority of the $ 50,000 needed to clone it.
My partner and I went through a breakup recently. During our relationship, he developed a close bond with my dog. As the dog grew older, we joked about cloning her to keep her in our lives. If Barbra Streisand could do it , why couldn't we? Then the joke became a reality: When my dog turned 12, we cloned her. It's been a joy to see her as a baby! (I rescued her when she was older.) Then came the breakup. I am keeping the older dog, but we can't agree who should take the younger one. I think of her as part of my dog and want to keep her. He argues this is selfish of me and we should each get a dog in the breakup. (Note: He paid most of the cloning costs, about $ 50,000, and we share dog care.) Thoughts?
DOG MOM
As an exercise in tolerance and compassion, I'm setting aside any urge to judge you and your former partner's decisions here, and I hope readers will, too. ("How dare they clone a dog when so many dogs need homes?") The fact is, there are now two living creatures, both beloved by their caretakers. I am sorry for your distress in having to make new arrangements, but it seems you must.
Having long lived with dogs myself, I can't help thinking first of their well-being. Disrupt your dogs' lives as little as possible. Keep them together if you can. (They probably spend more time together than with either of you.) And let them stay in the same environment if possible: Most dogs thrive in routine.
Still, there is no avoiding the fact that your former partner paid most of the $ 50,000 in cloning costs. That is persuasive evidence of an ownership stake. If the younger dog tolerates it well and geography allows, try sharing custody of her -- or perhaps both of them -- in weekly turns. Or offer to repay your ex for his financial outlay. If neither of those options works, let him take the younger dog and help him make an easy transition for her.
Neither a Borrower Nor a Dealer Be?
I was sitting on the lawn at an outdoor concert and I started chatting with a couple in folding chairs behind me. (They told me they were coming down from ecstasy, an illegal party drug.) When they left early, I asked to borrow one of the chairs. The man agreed and said I could return it to his brother who lived nearby. After they left, I got up to dance, and when I returned, the chair was gone. Later, I texted the guy to apologize, and he sent me a screenshot of the chair. It cost $ 150. I had no idea it was so expensive! He also offered to give me an ecstasy pill when I paid him. I told him I could not afford to replace the chair and didn't want any drugs, which led him to send me a series of unpleasant texts. Before I paid him one-third of the quoted price, I told him I would not walk away feeling like a bad person: He's the one who lent his chair to a stranger. And he's a drug dealer. What should I have done?
BORROWER
I don't care whether you borrowed the chair from the Dalai Lama or Charles Manson: It is your responsibility to replace it. (If you can't afford to do so now, pay him in monthly installments.) It's an unsavory move to try to wiggle out of your debts with ad hominem attacks on your lender. The man did you a good turn by letting you use his chair, and you were careless with it. Pay him.
'Everything We Need' Isn't Everything
A longtime friend is getting married for the second time. He is middle-aged and well off, as am I. When the invitation arrived, I asked if he and his partner were registered somewhere. He replied: "We have everything we need." When my husband and I married during the pandemic, we threw our wedding plans out the window. No one sent us cards or gifts, and we wouldn't have wanted them even if there had been a party. Still, I don't want to break with etiquette or seem cheap. Should we give a gift?
FRIEND
I'm confused by the analogy to your own canceled wedding plans. I am sorry if your feelings were hurt that friends didn't acknowledge your big day -- though you imply they weren't. Unlike you, though, your friend is holding a wedding and a reception. I would write the couple a congratulatory card, at the very least, and give them a small gift or take them to a celebratory dinner.
Avoid Mildew and Dirty Looks in One Easy Step
I live in an apartment building with a small community laundry room. Lately, people have been leaving their laundry in the machines after the cycles have finished, sometimes for hours at a time. Thus far, I have avoided removing anyone's laundry from a machine so I could put my own in, but it's becoming more tempting. May I?
ALLIE
Here is a balancing act between shared resources (washers and dryers) and the sanctity of our sheets, towels and underthings. Personally, I would leave the laundry alone for 30 minutes (15 if you're in a rush), then remove it, leaving a friendly note that you waited for half an hour.

Auto Strike Looms, Threatening to Shut Detroit’s Big 3

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers have less than two weeks to negotiate a new labor contract, and a strike of some sort seems increasingly likely.
The union’s president, Shawn Fain, has primed rank-and-file members to be prepared to walk off the job if the union’s long list of demands for improved wages and benefits are not met.
A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. GM workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three — a step the union has never taken but one Fain has said he is willing to call for this year — could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
“If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation,” said Patrick Anderson, the CEO of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Michigan.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an EV-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tail wind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Joe Biden has declared that “the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class” and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the UAW has withheld an endorsement of his reelection bid so far, partly because of concern over the union’s share of EV-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline — the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the UAW presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
“President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there’s going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike,” said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. “The UAW leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it’s pretty unlikely there won’t be a strike.”
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3% of the country’s gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $859 million and manufacturers’ losses of $989 million, according to estimates by Anderson’s firm.
In August, Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making one-third less than veteran workers. Fain suggested as much as a 40% wage increase, noting that the CEOs of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
“The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be,” Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were “insulting” to the UAW.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker’s income by 15% over the four-year contract. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker’s income over a long period.
The UAW and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Fain said that GM and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union’s proposals and that the UAW had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
“I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I’m fed up,” he said. “Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will.”
GM said it was “surprised by and strongly refutes” the charges in the NLRB complaint. “We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was “disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining,” the company said in a statement. “We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement.”
In recent weeks, workers have organized several dozen rallies and other gatherings to prepare for picketing. “I think the membership is energized,” said Christine Bostic, a battery tester at a GM electric vehicle plant in Detroit. “The facts are on our side. If it comes to a strike, I’m ready for that.”
To soften the impact of a stoppage, the union has amassed a strike fund of $825 million. It plans to pay striking workers $500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums while they are out of work.
In recent days, Fain joined the union’s negotiating teams in their talks with each of the automakers, an unusual step. Normally, the UAW president does not take a direct role until the final days or hours of negotiations.
On Wednesday, he took part in discussions with Stellantis, where tensions between the two sides have been high. When Stellantis responded to Fain’s demands with a list of cost concessions it wanted from the union, Fain took to Facebook to denounce them, dropping the document into a wastebasket.
Decades ago, when the UAW had more than 1 million members and the Big Three — GM, Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis — had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. GM, Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 UAW workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40% of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.
But the union entered this year’s talks in a much stronger negotiating position than it had in years. In the past, the Detroit companies were struggling badly against foreign rivals that operate nonunion plants in the South, like Toyota and Honda, and had a significant cost advantage. In most of the last several contracts, GM, Ford and Stellantis had to get concessions on wages and benefits to survive.
Over the last 10 years, however, all three companies have rung up record profits, thanks in part to the concessions they won from the union as well as the shift in consumer preferences to high-margin trucks and large SUVs.
In the first half of this year, Ford made $3.7 billion and GM made $5 billion. Stellantis reported profits of 11 billion euros (about $11.9 billion).
In the past, the UAW has chosen one company — it was GM four years ago — as the “target” to focus on in the talks. Fain has said the union could target all three companies this time around, but many analysts think the union will eventually choose Stellantis. In addition to the strains between the company and the union, their talks involve a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis has idled and that the union wants the company to reopen.
Getting Stellantis to reopen the plant is a critical task for Fain. Four years ago, GM closed a plant in Ohio, and the UAW failed in its efforts to push the company to reopen it. In his campaign for the presidency, Fain promised members that his tougher approach would prove successful this time.
The union could get a hand in this battle from the federal government. On Thursday, the Energy Department said it had made $2 billion in grants and $10 billion in loans available to auto companies to convert existing factories that build gasoline-powered cars and trucks into plants that produce hybrid and electric vehicles.
Stellantis, like GM and Ford, aims to introduce several more electric models over the next few years and will probably have to retool some plants to make them. It is already building a battery plant in Indiana for its EV push.
Fiorani suggested that Stellantis could decide to overhaul the Belvidere plant to make electric models. “Stellantis could find a product to go in there,” he said. “For the UAW to truly win something, though, it has to be electric vehicles that Stellantis would plan on making for several years.”

Manhunt Is Underway Outside Philadelphia for an Escaped Murderer: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hundreds of law officers were searching for a Brazilian national who escaped from prison two weeks after being convicted of first-degree murder.
Hundreds of law enforcement officers were scouring the railways, creeks and roads in a suburban county near Philadelphia on Friday, looking for a man who escaped from prison a little over two weeks after being convicted of first-degree murder.
The authorities said on Friday that local, state and federal officials were using "helicopters, drones and dogs" to find the convicted murderer, Danelo Cavalcante, who escaped from Chester County Prison on Thursday. He was last seen a little before 10 a.m. that morning by someone going to work at the prison, walking south and wearing a white T-shirt, gray shorts and white sneakers.
"We believe that he is still in the general area," said Deborah Ryan, the Chester County district attorney, at the Friday news conference. "We believe that he is hiding somewhere locally and that he is alone."
Ms. Ryan said that people in the area needed to be on "high alert" as Labor Day weekend commenced, suggesting that they lock their doors and keep watch over their children. "We have every reason to believe he is considered dangerous at this time," she said.
West Chester University, a public college about six miles from the prison, canceled classes for the day, citing "an abundance of caution."
Mr. Cavalcante, 34, was sentenced to life in prison on Aug. 22. Less than a week earlier, a jury found him guilty of stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, to death "in front of her two young children," Ms. Ryan said in a Facebook post last month.
After killing Ms. Brandao, in April 2021, Mr. Cavalcante tried to make his way back to his home country of Brazil, but was arrested by the police in Virginia, the district attorney said at the news conference. Ms. Ryan suggested that he might be heading south again. He was described as five feet tall and someone who speaks Spanish and Portuguese.
According to the district attorney's office, investigators learned after the arrest that Mr. Cavalcante was wanted for murder in Brazil. They concluded that he killed Ms. Brandao because she had threatened to tell the police.
In a statement released on Friday, Brazilian law enforcement authorities said that Mr. Cavalcante was charged with shooting and killing a man in November 2017, apparently in a dispute over "an alleged debt related to the repair of a vehicle." A warrant for his arrest in Brazil was issued in June 2018, and he was considered "a fugitive from justice."
Edgar Larrea, who served as Mr. Cavalcante's interpreter during his trial, described him as quiet and aloof. "He just sat there during the entire trial giving us no questions, no emotions," he said. "Very cold guy."
But he also suggested that Mr. Cavalcante could be on the run for some time. He "comes from the boonies in Brazil, so he knows how to survive," Mr. Larrea said. "He could be anywhere."
Mr. Larrea had been scheduled to see Mr. Cavalcante on Thursday morning at the prison, arriving there with a public defender a few minutes before 10 a.m. to discuss an appeal. But they were not allowed to go inside, he said, because the correctional staff learned just as they showed up that an inmate, who turned out to be Mr. Cavalcante, had gone missing, and the prison went on lockdown.
The acting warden of Chester County Prison, Howard Holland, said at a news conference on Thursday that the circumstances of the escape were under investigation, declining to elaborate further.
Mr. Holland had been overseeing the prison since late July, when the previous warden, Ronald Phillips, was placed on administrative leave. A county spokeswoman would not reveal why Mr. Phillips was put on leave, but said that he officially retired at a prison board meeting on Wednesday, the day before Mr. Cavalcante's escape.
Local and federal authorities, including the U.S. Marshals Service, have announced a $ 10,000 reward for information that leads to Mr. Cavalcante's capture.
Around the prison, which sits amid rolling hills and cornfields, people were wary but seemingly unrattled by the warnings from the authorities.
Wanda Bradley, 52, said that she was still planning to have children and grandchildren over for a barbecue this weekend.
"I won't let it deter me, but we'll keep our eye open," she said.
When she heard the siren alerting the community to the escape on Thursday, Nancye Lane, 78, at first thought that she had lost track of the days. The prison usually tested that siren on Saturdays, she said. Then it dawned on her: "A person must have escaped," she said.
Ms. Lane believed, however, that living so near to the prison gave her a kind of security in cases of escape. "First thing they're going to do is go as far away as possible," she said.

In Monitoring Child Sex Abuse, Apple Is Caught Between Safety and Privacy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An advocacy group is starting a $ 2 million campaign calling for the company to better police materials on its products and services.
In 2021, Apple was embroiled in controversy over a plan to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse materials. Privacy experts warned that governments could abuse the system, and the backlash was so severe that Apple eventually abandoned the plan.
Two years later, Apple is facing criticism from child safety crusaders and activist investors who are calling on the company to do more to protect children from online abuse.
A child advocacy group, the Heat Initiative, has raised $ 2 million for a new national advertising campaign calling on Apple to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse materials from iCloud, its cloud storage platform.
Next week, the group will release digital advertisements on websites popular with policymakers in Washington, such as Politico. It will also put up posters across San Francisco and New York that say: "Child sexual abuse material is stored on iCloud. Apple allows it."
The criticism speaks to a predicament that has dogged Apple for years. The company has made protecting privacy a central part of its iPhone pitch to consumers. But that promise of security has helped make its services and devices, two billion of which are in use, useful tools for sharing child sexual abuse imagery.
The company is caught between child safety groups, which want it to do more to stop the spread of such materials, and privacy experts, who want it to maintain the promise of secure devices.
A group of two dozen investors with nearly $ 1 trillion in assets under management have also called on Apple to publicly report the number of abusive images that it catches across its devices and services.
Two investors -- Degroof Petercam, a Belgian asset manager, and Christian Brothers Investment Services, a Catholic investment firm -- will submit a shareholder proposal this month that would require Apple to provide a detailed report on how effective its safety tools were at protecting children.
"Apple seems stuck between privacy and action," said Matthew Welch, an investment specialist at Degroof Petercam. "We thought a proposal would wake up management and get them to take this more seriously."
Apple has been quick to respond to child safety advocates. In early August, its privacy executives met with the group of investors, Mr. Welch said. Then, on Thursday, the company responded to an email from the Heat Initiative with a letter that defended its decision not to scan iCloud. It shared the correspondence with Wired, a technology publication.
In Apple's letter, Erik Neuenschwander, the director for user privacy and child safety, said the company had concluded that "it was not practically possible" to scan iCloud photos without "imperiling the security and privacy of our users."
"Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems," Mr. Neuenschwander said.
Apple, he added, has created a new default feature for all child accounts that intervenes with a warning if they receive or try to send nude images. It's designed to prevent the creation of new child sexual abuse material and limit the risk of predators coercing and blackmailing children for money or nude images. It has made those tools available to app developers as well.
In 2021, Apple said it would use technology called image hashes to spot abusive material on iPhones and in iCloud.
But the company failed to communicate that plan broadly with privacy experts, intensifying their skepticism and fueling concern that governments could abuse the technology, said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center, who opposed the idea.
Last year, the company discreetly abandoned its plan to scan iCloud, catching child safety groups by surprise.
Apple has won praise from both privacy and child safety groups for its efforts to blunt the creation of new nude images on iMessage and other services. But Mr. Stamos, who applauded the company's decision not to scan iPhones, said it could do more to stop people from sharing problematic images in the cloud.
"You can have privacy if you store something for yourself, but if you share something with someone else, you don't get the same privacy," Mr. Stamos said.
Governments around the world are putting pressure on Apple to take action. Last year, eSafety Commissioner in Australia issued a report criticizing Apple and Microsoft for failing to do more to proactively police their services for abusive material.
In the United States, Apple made 160 reports in 2021 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for abusive material. Google made 875,783 reports, while Facebook made 22 million. These reports do not always reflect truly abusive material; some parents have had their Google accounts suspended and have been reported to the police for images of their children that were not criminal in nature.
The Heat Initiative timed its campaign ahead of Apple's annual iPhone unveiling, which is scheduled for Sept. 12. The campaign is being led by Sarah Gardner, who was previously the vice president for external affairs at Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat child sexual abuse online. Ms. Gardner raised money from a number of child safety supporters, including the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and the Oak Foundation.
The group has built a website that documents law enforcement cases where iCloud has been named. The list will include child pornography charges brought against a 55-year-old in New York who had more than 200 images stored in iCloud.
Ms. Gardner said the Heat Initiative planned to target advertising throughout the fall in areas where Apple customers and employees would encounter it. "The goal is to continue to run the tactics until Apple changes its policy," Ms. Gardner said.

Nigerian Police Raid Same-Sex Wedding: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A 2014 law makes such unions illegal in the country. Anyone found guilty of taking part can also face up to 10 years in prison.
The police in Nigeria have arrested over 60 people who were in attendance at what the authorities claimed was a same-sex wedding, reinforcing a crackdown on L.G.B.T.Q. people in Africa's most populous nation.
The police also broadcast the identities of some of those arrested on social media and encouraged members of the public to help "uphold the moral standards of the society" by providing relevant information -- moves that raised concern that those who attended the event would be subjected to stigma or violence.
Under a 2014 law, anyone entering a same-sex marriage or civil union in Nigeria can be imprisoned for up to 14 years. Those who administer or witness such a ceremony can face up to 10 years in prison. At the time it was enacted, the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, said the law violated basic human rights protections.
Bright Edafe, a police spokesman in Delta State in southern Nigeria, said the arrests were a sign that the country was going to use an iron fist against gay unions.
"We are in Africa, and we are in Nigeria. We cannot copy the Western world, because we don't have the same culture," he said at a news conference on Tuesday in front of the dozens who were arrested.
Same-sex weddings are rare in Nigeria, with many such couples opting to hold their ceremonies in countries where it is legal to do so, Mr. Edafe said in a telephone interview. "It is not common, and we don't even want to get to that level," he said. "That is why we are taking the action we are taking now."
In a video that the Nigerian police published on Facebook on Tuesday, one of those charged told reporters that he was wearing a skirt and crop top for a fashion show. Asked whether he was gay, he said that he was not and that the event had been a party rather than a wedding ceremony.
In 2020, a case in Lagos in which 47 men had been charged with public displays of affection with members of same sex was dismissed, with the judge citing prosecutors' failure to appear in court and call witnesses.
The latest arrests occurred after police officers raided the Teebilos Hotel in Warri, a city in southern Nigeria.
The police said on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, that on Sunday night they had stopped a person whom they identified as "a male cross-dresser" who said that he was an actor and that he belonged to "a certain gay club." He said that he was going to a same-sex wedding, the police wrote.
In a video that the police published on the social media platform, a couple -- one wearing a white dress with a veil and one in a white suit -- stood beside a swimming pool surrounded by guests and balloons as a master of ceremonies introduced a performer on a stage.
Mr. Edafe said in a telephone interview that the those arrested were being held and that they may be charged at the end of an investigation. It was not immediately clear who was legally representing those in custody.
Isa Sanusi, Amnesty International's country director for Nigeria, said that homophobia had been an issue in the country even before the 2014 law was passed, but that the legislation had become a way to put added pressure on L.G.B.T.Q. people.
"That law emboldened homophobia," he said. "It's given people the ground to carry out human rights violations in Nigeria."
Mr. Sanusa also denounced the police's decision to publish photos and videos of those arrested at the gathering, a move that he said put those accused at risk of violence.
"This parading like yesterday," he said, "is a complete violation of human rights."
Many of the approximately 60 countries around the world that criminalize homosexuality are in Africa, and in recent years some have passed or vowed to introduce harsher penalties for same-sex relations.
In Uganda, a draconian law passed in May includes the death penalty for some kinds of homosexual acts, and life imprisonment for anyone who engages in gay sex. Two men in the country have been charged with "aggravated homosexuality" this summer, a crime punishable by death.

Legionnaires' Is Blamed For 16 Deaths In Poland: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Infections have surged in Rzeszow, whose strategic location near the Ukrainian border has transformed it into a hub for the Western response to Russia's invasion.
Sixteen people have died and over 150 have been hospitalized in southeastern Poland in an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, a severe strain of bacterial pneumonia, local health authorities said Wednesday.
The outbreak has been concentrated in the southeastern city of Rzeszow, which lies about 60 miles from the border with neighboring Ukraine, although some cases have been registered elsewhere. The Polish health ministry said this week that the most likely source of infection was Rzeszow's municipal water network.
Once relatively quiet, Rzeszow has become an important hub for the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hosting American soldiers and thousands of Ukrainian refugees. The deaths, which have occurred over the past week, sparked unfounded rumors in Poland of Russian responsibility for the outbreak that the authorities have tried to tamp down.
Stanislaw Zaryn, a deputy minister who oversees the country's intelligence services, said Friday that the Polish internal security service was pursuing a routine investigation into the circumstances behind the infection to rule out "potential intentional action in this case."
Prof. Robert Flisiak, an epidemiologist who leads the Polish Association of Epidemiologists and Infectiologists, said there had been no evidence that someone had sought to cause the outbreak.
"The actual number of registered cases in the last two weeks is what we usually record in two years," Professor Flisiak said in an email. But the number of cases in Poland was still small compared to regular outbreaks in other European countries, he added.
Legionnaires' disease can be fatal in about 10 percent of cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria do not become sick, but the risk is higher among the elderly and people with weak immune systems.
The disease is usually spread by breathing in airborne water droplets -- such as vapor from decorative fountains or hot tubs -- rather than through interpersonal contact or drinking water, according to the C.D.C. In Rzeszow, a government crisis team shut off water fountains and drinking stations in response to the outbreak.
Over the past few days, local authorities in Rzeszow have treated the city's water supply network with chlorine in an attempt to wipe out the infection, the municipality said on its Facebook page. The city recommended that residents -- faced with the stench of chlorine coming from their taps -- boil the water before consuming it.
Rising temperatures spurred in part by climate change may have played a role in the outbreak, Professor Flisiak said, as the bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease thrive in the heat. Like much of Europe, Poland has had sweltering temperatures this summer, part of a continentwide heat wave.

Liberals on Their High Horse About 'Rich Men': [Op-Ed]

Full text: What's wrong here?
A self-described high school dropout living in a camper with a tarp on the roof sings a plaintive cri de coeur about blue collar workers being shafted by the wealthy, and it is right-wing Republicans who rush to embrace him while Democrats wag their fingers and scold him for insensitivity.
Huh? Have Democrats retreated so far from their workingman roots that their knee-jerk impulse is to dump on a blue collar guy who highlights "folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat"?
If you've been on Mars for the last couple of weeks, I'm talking of course about Oliver Anthony, a country singer who a month ago was unknown and now has had his song, "Rich Men North of Richmond," soar from nowhere to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the last two weeks.
"I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day," Anthony laments. He blames the travails of workers on "rich men north of Richmond" -- a swipe at Washington and elites generally. Some of his lines aren't so different from elements in F.D.R.'s speech about "the forgotten man" or in Robert Kennedy's elegy for "the shattered dreams of others."
Yet in this case, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene labeled "Rich Men" the "anthem of the forgotten Americans," and Fox News asked participants in the Republican presidential debate to discuss it. Meanwhile, some on the left pounced on it as right-wing propaganda and even as "racist trash."
Does the left really want to leave battered, angry workers to be defended by a G.O.P. that periodically guts unions, targets Social Security, resists health care coverage and opposes increases in the minimum wage?
Anthony, who calls himself "just some idiot and his guitar," seemed taken aback by the assumption that he must be a right-winger. He said his song was meant to blast politicians on both sides, including those in the G.O.P. presidential debate who were trying to weaponize his words. "I wrote that song about those people," he said.
"It's aggravating seeing people on conservative news try to identify with me like I'm one of them," he added.
I don't agree with everything Anthony says, but his principal theme is that working-class Americans have been screwed over -- and he's right on that. He's also correct that both parties bear some responsibility and have twiddled their thumbs as working-class Americans die by the tens of thousands from drugs, alcohol and suicide.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures offer a metric of the catastrophe: Average weekly nonsupervisory wages, a metric for blue-collar earnings, were actually higher in 1969 (adjusted for inflation) than they were this year. Meanwhile, bosses are earning far, far more.
A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies says that the C.E.O. of Live Nation Entertainment, a concert company, earned $ 139 million in 2022 -- while workers earned a median pay of $ 25,673. The report adds that since 2020 at Dollar Tree, where many struggling Americans shop and work, prices have increased, average worker pay has dipped and the C.E.O.'s stock holdings increased in value by more than 2,000 percent.
This is the context in which many working-class Americans have lost hope and are self-medicating or simply killing themselves. It constitutes a social great depression: We lose more Americans to "deaths of despair" every 10 days than the total of all the service members killed in two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq -- yet we have all been far too complacent about the suffering. This was the topic of my last book, it's a theme of my next and it's the focus of my "How America Heals" series this year, so I'm all for Anthony bellowing his frustrations and calling attention to these issues.
He makes the valid point that these disparate social crises reflect a broader pathology that is holding America back. "People talk about epidemics in this country, and the homelessness and the drug use and the lack of skilled labor and the suicide rates," he said. "Those aren't problems, those are symptoms of a bigger universal problem ... we don't talk about it enough."
Anthony says he dropped out of high school, earned a G.E.D. and worked in a paper mill for $ 14.50 an hour until he fractured his skull in a workplace accident. He has wrestled with alcohol and drug use and with mental health issues, he acknowledges.
"I am living in a 27-foot camper with a tarp on the roof that I got off of craigslist for $ 750," he wrote on Facebook. His message and his story resonate deeply with frustrated workers -- that's why the internet is full of "Oliver Anthony for President" T-shirts.
Liberals are properly attentive to racial injustice, but have a blind spot about class, driven in part by unfair stereotypes that members of the white working class are invariably bigots. In fact, you can't think seriously about inequality in America without contemplating race, but that's also true of class. And as the Harvard professor Michael Sandel has noted, one of the last acceptable prejudices is disdain for the less educated.
Anthony sounded some conservative themes in his song, including complaining about taxes -- and that led to some liberal jeers. But as Noah Smith observed in his economics blog, a Virginian earning the median factory wage pays a total tax rate of more than 24 percent --higher than one estimate of the rate paid by the 400 richest Americans.
I wish Anthony hadn't complained in his song about obese people on food stamps; that's a horrible stereotype and was simply mean. But just as Anthony should show more compassion for people struggling on food stamps, liberals should show more compassion for workers who have been left behind. It's partly this condescension that has driven many working-class voters, initially white voters and more recently brown and Black ones as well, into the arms of conservative politicians who would shaft them even more.
If we're going to achieve a more progressive agenda, then we need to win elections -- and that means respecting workers rather than scorning them, insulting their faith and casually dismissing them as bigots. If we believe in empathy, let's show some.

Everybody's Talking About the New Folks In Town, and Worrying: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In Solano County, Calif., longtime residents are both worried and baffled by an ambitious plan to build a city where there is now mostly farmland.
In a rural slice of California's Solano County, between the cities of the Bay Area and Sacramento, rumors have been swirling for years about "the Flanneries," a mystery company buying up mostly undeveloped land.
At a shooting range in Birds Landing, an unincorporated community accessible by a two-lane highway or a gravel road through grassy foothills covered in wind turbines -- many of them over 200 feet tall -- an employee questioned why anyone would want to buy land in the quiet area.
"There's sheep farms, there's cattle ranches, and guys that are doing hay and safflower farming," said the employee, Ashley Morrill, 40. "That's what they do. There's livestock, and things to feed the livestock."
Solano County's rural roots are still front and center in an area where a company backed by tech industry billionaires has been buying up land to create what they imagine to be a city of the future. That company, Flannery Associates, has committed roughly $ 900 million to secure thousands of acres of farmland, court documents show.
The cities of Vallejo, Fairfield and Vacaville, which are home to the majority of Solano County's 450,000 people, aren't very far away. But this part of the county, which covers about 900 square miles in all, has more in common with the farms of California's Central Valley than the corporate campuses of Silicon Valley. And the prospect of big changes has unnerved some families that have lived in the area for generations.
Down the two-lane road a few miles from the range is Collinsville, an unincorporated community that's essentially a mile-long, dead-end street with about a dozen houses, farms and silos along it. It backs into a marsh near the mouth of the Sacramento River. Property owners in the neighborhood said the mysterious Flanneries had approached them, and a few who have left abruptly apparently sold their land.
On a hot Sunday afternoon, as the air began to smell swampy, Lacey Miles was helping her retired father, Tom, unload his car in the driveway of his single-family home. Across the street was a recreational vehicle with a yellowing sign that read "For Sale" amid five-foot-tall hay grass.
Mr. Miles, 71, said he was concerned that the buyers were trying to change the countryside that he had lived in and enjoyed for decades. The only sound behind him was the low hum of wind turbines turning a few miles away.
"That's why we're here, the quiet community," he said. "Love it out here."
Ms. Miles, 42, who owns a housekeeping business, lives a few miles away. She had heard about the plans to build a "private city" on Facebook, and was opposed to the changes it would bring.
"I moved out here to escape the city," she said. She had grown up near Collinsville, then moved away and came back 14 years ago with her husband to raise children in the rural area.
Ms. Miles said the people who hadn't sold their land were likely to be opposed to any political push to create a new town. But she said with a sigh, "Anything is possible when you have money."
In nearby Rio Vista, a town of about 10,000 people, most residents who spoke to The New York Times were aware that a coalition of Silicon Valley investors had been buying up farmland outside town.
The mystery buyers had been a subject of discussion in the town for the past few years, with theories ranging from more development for the wind turbines that dot the surrounding hills to an attempt to build another Silicon Valley to some foreign interests doing who knows what.
Downtown Rio Vista was right around the corner from a tractor shop, a recreational vehicle repair shop and a walkway along the river that men fish from starting in the early morning. It was a stretch of a few blocks lined with American flags and a street art project with differently painted ceramic sheep.
Pickup trucks and sedans were parked in the spaces along the road. A few drove down the street playing country music with the windows down. Older people wearing cowboy hats gathered in Raul's Striper Cafe, which is filled with 1950s memorabilia.
More residents gathered at Foster's Bighorn, a watering hole displaying hundreds of mounted animal heads on the wall, including a moose, a buffalo, a giraffe, a lion and a snow leopard.
Some residents said they were relieved to know the identities of the land buyers. Others were still concerned, and didn't want the area to be flooded with techies. A bartender at Foster's Bighorn said that whatever this new type of city was, it would price current residents out -- a lot like all those Bay Area cities to the south.

Oliver Anthony Music's 'Rich Men' Still Tops Hot 100: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The song by Oliver Anthony Music played a role at the Republican primary debate, though the musician clarified he doesn't identify with "people on conservative news."
"Rich Men North of Richmond," the out-of-nowhere viral protest song by Oliver Anthony Music, is the country's No. 1 single for a second time, after playing a key role in last week's Republican primary debate.
"Rich Men," a spare acoustic track uploaded to YouTube just weeks ago by the largely unknown Anthony, quickly caught fire as an angry cry against corporate and political elites, though it also took shots at welfare recipients. Embraced by conservative commentators, the song shot to the top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart, with big download and streaming numbers.
Last week, the first question at the Republican debate was about the significance of "Rich Men," and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida spun it as a sign of policy failures by the Biden administration.
In a video response posted to YouTube, Anthony -- real name Christopher Anthony Lunsford -- said he was bothered by how his song has become a political talking point. "It's aggravating seeing people on conservative news try to identify with me like I'm one of them," he said. "I see the right trying to characterize me as one of their own. And I see the left trying to discredit me." The song, he added on Facebook, "is about corporate owned D.C. politicians on both sides."
"Rich Men" repeats at No. 1 on the all-genre Hot 100 with 23 million streams and 117,000 downloads, according to the tracking service Luminate. It is also No. 1 on Billboard's country chart.
On the Billboard 200 album chart, Travis Scott's "Utopia" marks a month at No. 1 with the equivalent of 161,000 sales, including 92 million streams and 92,000 copies sold as a complete package, according to Luminate, driven by discounted vinyl sales on the rapper's website. According to Billboard, "Utopia" is the first rap album to spend its first four weeks at the top since 2018, when Drake's "Scorpion" had five. (In 2021, Drake's "Certified Lover Boy" spent its first three weeks at No. 1, then returned to the top for another two weeks later on.)
Morgan Wallen's "One Thing at a Time" holds at No. 2, while the singer-songwriter Hozier opens at No. 3 with his new "Unreal Unearth." The "Barbie" soundtrack remains in fourth place, and Taylor Swift's "Midnights" is No. 5.

Pope's Praise for Russian Legacy That Putin Invokes Is Criticized: [briefing]

Full text: "Never forget the legacy," Francis said in a video speech on Friday to young Catholics in St. Petersburg. "You are the heirs of Great Russia: Great Russia of saints, rulers, Great Russia of Peter I, Catherine II, that empire."
In comments made by video to Catholic youth in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Friday, Pope Francis praised 18th-century Russian rulers and the Great Russia they helped create -- an empire that President Vladimir V. Putin has invoked in framing his invasion of Ukraine.
"Never forget the legacy," Francis said. "You are the heirs of Great Russia: Great Russia of saints, rulers, Great Russia of Peter I, Catherine II, that empire -- great, enlightened, of great culture and great humanity."
The pope, who was finishing his address at the closing of a conference focused on the church's young members in St. Petersburg, had shifted from his prepared remarks in Spanish to urge the audience in Italian to keep history in mind, according to Reuters. The Vatican released only the prepared remarks, but a clip circulated later by religious agencies showed him making the additional comments.
While for the past year Francis has been consistently supportive of peace and the Ukrainians he has called "martyrs" in the fight against Russia's invading forces, his comments were quickly criticized in Ukraine and other countries near Russia that used to be part of the Soviet Union.
"It is very unfortunate that Russian grand-state ideas, which, in fact, are the cause of Russia's chronic aggression, knowingly or unknowingly, come from the Pope's mouth," Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.
The former Estonian president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, wrote on the X platform, previously known as Twitter, that the remarks were "truly revolting."
And the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, issued a statement noting the "pain" and "disappointment" caused by the pope's remarks and calling for the Holy See to clarify Francis' comments to avert "any manipulation of the intentions, context and statements assigned to the Holy Father."
Mr. Putin -- who last year compared himself to Peter the Great -- has over the past 18 months used the idea of rebuilding the Russian empire to frame the invasion of Ukraine, which was a Soviet state until 1991, when the U.S.S.R. was dissolving. He has also portrayed the invasion as an effort "to put an end to the war that was unleashed by the West," as he put it last week.
The pope's prepared speech, released in a Vatican bulletin that did not mention his final statements, revolved around the importance of young people building bridges between generations.
"I invite you to be sowers, to sow seeds of reconciliation, tiny seeds that in this wintertime of war will not germinate for the moment on frozen ground, but in a future spring will flourish," the Vatican transcript read.
In the early months of the conflict, Francis appeared to avoid picking sides and refrained from overtly criticizing the Russian president or the war's chief religious backer, Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church. In May, after a video conference with Kirill, Francis changed course and warned Kirill not to "transform himself into Putin's altar boy."
On Monday, the Vatican issued a statement saying that the pontiff never takes a political stance and that his words "are to be read as a voice raised in defense of human life and the values attached to it."
It maintained that the pope always condemned a "morally unjust, unacceptable, barbaric, senseless, repugnant and sacrilegious" war.

Full text: A fierce fighter known for wielding improvised weapons, he brought his menacing image not just to the ring but also to Hollywood, in films like "Road House."
Terry Funk, the Hall of Fame professional wrestler whose hard-core fighting style inspired decades of bloody brawls and entertaining matches, has died in a hospital near Phoenix. He was 79.
His death was announced on Wednesday by World Wrestling Entertainment, the company for which his career exploded in the 1980s. The announcement did not cite a cause.
Funk's wrestling career, which began in the mid-1960s and lasted four decades, took him around the country and the world, from playing in front of sold-out WWE crowds to entertaining fans in the growing Japanese market with All Japan Pro Wrestling. He quickly became known as a fierce wrestler who wielded improvised weapons against his opponents: chairs and ladders, barbed wire and bats, trash cans and fire.
In a sport built on performer-athletes who play exaggerated or downright invented versions of themselves, the extreme quality of Funk's matches made him one of the most celebrated wrestlers of his generation.
Many of his highlight reels show him a bloodied mess, his long wet hair slicked back and his face bleeding from some kind of punch, kick or chair shot. He did not have the chiseled six-pack build typically expected of a professional wrestler. But his frame was wide, his grappling of opponents was precise, and he displayed a barbaric creativity inside the ring that earned him the respect of his peers.
Ric Flair, a retired professional wrestler known for his flashy outfits and extravagant lifestyle, said on Wednesday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he had "never met a guy who worked harder" than Funk. Mick Foley, who also wrestled Funk, said on Facebook that he was "the greatest wrestler" he ever worked with.
Terrence Funk was born on June 30, 1944, in Hammond, Ind., according to the book "Pro Wrestling FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the World's Most Entertaining Spectacle" (2015), by Brian Solomon. His father, Dory Funk Sr., was also a wrestler.
After Dory Sr. finished his tour of duty in the South Pacific during World War II, the family relocated to Texas, where the elder Funk became a well-known wrestler and promoter.
It was in Texas that Terry Funk's familiarity with the sport deepened, as did his love of it. He made his debut for his father's wrestling company in 1965.
By 1985, he had reached the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment). At WrestleMania 2 the next year, he and his brother Dory Funk Jr. defeated Tito Santana and the Junkyard Dog in a tag-team match.
In 1989, Funk moved to the rival league World Championship Wrestling, for which he would have one of the most acclaimed matches of his career against Ric Flair.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The 20-minute contest was an "I Quit" match, in which both men would scuffle and fight until one man surrendered. The match, now regarded as a classic, was a showcase for the brutal realism that drew fans to pro wrestling, in which the winner of a match is determined in advance.
There were chest slaps from Flair, headlocks by Funk, tosses out of the ring, wrangling along the sidelines, hair yanks and repeated shrieks from both wrestlers: "Want to quit?"
Finally, when Flair wound Funk into a figure-four leg lock, Funk, his face contorted in pain, said the words that prompted the match bell to ring: "I quit."
In 2000, when he was in his mid-50s, Funk returned to World Championship Wrestling, winning the United States Championship and WCW Hardcore Title belts. His final WWE match was in 2006.
In 2009, both Terry Funk and Dory Funk Jr. were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.
Funk also took his menacing image to Hollywood. In 1989, he played a bouncer in the film "Road House," which starred Patrick Swayze. He had earlier played the intimidating character Frankie the Thumper in "Paradise Alley," a 1978 wrestling drama starring Sylvester Stallone.
Funk married Vicki Weaver in 1964. She died in 2019. He is survived by his brother; his two daughters, Stacy Clenney and Brandee Dungan; and three grandchildren.
In Mr. Funk's autobiography, "Terry Funk: More Than Just Hardcore" (2005), he wrote about his fond memories of listening to his father talk about wrestling and about how his "eyes would sparkle with pride when they talked about the tough guys in the profession and the crazy ones."
"When I grew up, I was fortunate enough to live the wrestler's life, a life that gave me stories to tell, just like the ones I had heard as a boy," he wrote. "Pirates, millionaires, kings and adventurers have nothing on me! I would trade my life with no one."

Full text: Fed up, a reader blocked the caller's phone number. But should she leave room for the woman to forge a relationship with her granddaughter?
Our daughter was married for 15 years, until her husband left her for another woman five years ago. She receives a monthly, court-ordered payment from him. He does not see their daughter, now 14, or show any interest in her. (Our daughter brought her to a child psychologist to help process this rejection.) When their rent was increased recently, we invited them to live with us so our daughter could save for a home of her own. The problem: Her ex's mother calls our house daily, demanding to speak to our granddaughter. We think she is inconsiderate and doesn't care about our granddaughter's needs. Our granddaughter takes the calls about once a week and meets with her occasionally. Tired of these calls, I finally blocked them on our home phone. Now, she calls our daughter relentlessly. What should we do?
MOTHER
I suspect that, from your perspective, the optimal outcome here may be for your daughter's ex-mother-in-law to simply disappear -- as her son did. But that may not be in your granddaughter's best interest, which I know you care about. I am not suggesting that you or your daughter put up with phone harassment. But let's acknowledge that this other grandmother has a valid interest in her grandchild. The solution is not to block her calls, but for your daughter to set and enforce healthy limits on them.
Now, I don't know why this woman is calling so relentlessly. My suspicion, though, is that she's ashamed of her son's abandonment of his child, so she's compensating by calling way too much. Still, if your daughter can harness this behavior, it may be healthy for your granddaughter to be in touch with someone from her father's family.
The great news here is that your granddaughter already has a relationship with a therapist. If I were you, I would encourage your daughter to lean into it. A therapist can help her establish what your granddaughter wants, what's healthiest for both of them and how to communicate this to her former mother-in-law. I know you're frustrated, but try to keep your eyes on the long-term prize.
Vulnerability Deserves a Response
A previously close friend and I go to school together. Many of our friend groups overlap. She texted me to say that she misses me and wants to hang out. But I'm not comfortable spending time with her: Our relationship has become filled with conflict. I would rather let it fade and become friendly acquaintances with her. Should I tell her this or avoid the conversation?
FRIEND
Never ignore a friend who makes herself vulnerable to you or who asks for something directly. Your friend has done both: I miss you, and I want to see you. It would be unkind to leave her hanging. Better to reply truthfully: "We've had so much conflict lately. I'd rather take a beat and see you around. OK?" If she presses you to engage further -- and some friends will -- you can hash it out or let it go (after you have staked out your position clearly).
Helping With Medical Costs, or Paying for Information?
I am in my 70s, and I've done well for myself financially. My younger sister hasn't. Her son was hospitalized for four weeks with an infected jaw that I believe arose from drug abuse. I know he doesn't have health insurance, so I fear that medical bills are looming over them. But neither of them has said anything to me about his health or drug use. I would like to help financially, but part of helping is knowing what happened and what is going on now. Suggestions?
SISTER
Gifts don't have strings -- or entitle givers to private information. It doesn't sound as if your sister has asked you for anything. If you want to offer her money on the condition that she tell you about her son, do so. But frankly, that seems more like payment for satisfying your curiosity than a gift. (And if he's still using, does that revoke your offer?) I suggest extending emotional support to your sister -- without the 20 questions -- instead.
Staking a Claim in the Sand
My wife and I were on a beach vacation. We set up our chairs in a row with other families at the high-tide mark in the sand. Later, a couple of women came and set up their things directly in front of us. I asked if they would mind moving 15 feet down the beach, where there was an opening between groups and where they wouldn't block anyone's view. I even offered to help them. They refused. They said this was "their beach," where they came every day, and they called me a hippie as I walked away. Was I wrong to ask?
VACATIONER
You had every right to ask, and with an opening so nearby, it seems odd they didn't agree. (I would have.) Having asked, though, I hope you didn't make a fuss. You and your wife could also have moved 15 feet down the beach. I know you were there first, but beach protocols are about soft norms, not hard-and-fast rules. As for looking like a hippie, congratulations! (I am picturing a dreamy Peter Fonda in "Easy Rider.")

Curriculum's purged of all facts we abjure.
We may have whipped slaves
But our motives were pure.

To restrain this Son of South.

Pistol snub noses and shooting positions
Bright copper casings and carbines with pistons
Wood stocks of walnut with swivel stud slings

Pump action shotguns and toggle lock Lugers
The sound of a round as it seats in a Ruger
Wild geese that plummet right when they've been winged
These are a few of our favorite things.
When the law's tight
When ammo's low
When there's gun control
We simply remember the Second Amendment

Gun barrels that gleam with a stainless steel satin
Pistol grip diamonds and holsters of patent

These are a few of our favorite things.
Butt plates on shoulders, cheek pieces to nuzzle
Suppressors for flashes to thread on a muzzle

When police cease
When we're feeling sad
We simply find peace in our safety release
and then we don't feel so bad.

Send Back the Gowns
(to the tune of "Send In the Clowns")
Isn't he rich?
Isn't it clear?
How Clarence Thomas takes bribes
Year after year.
Send back his gowns
Is he alone?
Six out of nine,
Writing opinions to crush
Your rights and mine.
Still, they wear gowns.
Send back their gowns
When will they stop closing the doors,
When will you find that the next one is yours?
Judging humanity's plight without ethics or care.
Voting far right.
Nothing is fair.
Is this a farce?
Limit their terms.
Send what they've worn to the cleaners,
Wash out the germs.
Do not forgive Dobbs.
Cancel their jobs.
Send back the gowns.
Are there no rules?
Where is the probe?
Give We the People the tools,
Watch them disrobe.
And lock up their gowns.
They ought not wear gowns.
Send back the gowns.

A work on par with Robert Burns.

Once upon a midnight dreary
As I pondered a new theory
How could I invest my money,
Money on the trading floor?

Even Buffett warned I'll rue it
FTX, you really blew it!
Beware the con man at the door!
I cast aside all inhibition
Trusting in the crypto vision

My monies you cannot restore.
I contemplate the bad decision
Writhing in my self-derision
The criminals should go to prison
I'll be a victim nevermore!

It's De-Lusion, (It's De-Lovely)
He lied to donors and Congress too
He made up the story that he's a Jew
It's de-lusion
It's de-lirious
It's de-mented
George Santos ran on a pack of lies
Now we found out it's a thin disguise
It's de-lusion
It's de-lirious
It's de-mented
His schools were false, the facts were tossed
No relative died in the Holocaust
It's de-lusion
It's de-lirious
It's de-mented
He made up stuff so he could brag
But simply forgot that he did drag
Now I wish this were an anecdote
But he's now in Congress and has a vote!
It's de-lusion
It's de-lirious
It's de-mented
Its de-crepit
It's de-plorable
It's de-limit

Twitter
(Based on Shakespeare's Sonnet 18)
Shall I compare thee to a Facebook post?
Thou art more chatty and more volatile.
Rough winds do shake thee coast to coast
and Musk as owner doth impress his style.
Sometime too hot, the eye of commerce shines,
and oft your gold complexion dimmed
And share price tumbles and declines
by chance or Elon's wobbly course undimmed.
But thy true existence shall not fade
nor shall the image of your name at birth.
Nor shall that name by him mislaid
be lost to all who live on Earth
So long as men do breathe and Musk doth vex
So life goes on, tho' Twitter morph to X.

Instacart Reports Profit Ahead of Anticipated I.P.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly 30 percent of Instacart's revenue came from advertising, and grocery orders were flat in the first half of this year, the company said.
Instacart, the grocery delivery business that boomed during the pandemic, took a step on Friday toward an initial public offering that will be a test of Wall Street's appetite for tech start-ups after a yearlong industry slump.
In an offering prospectus that gave the first public look at its financials on Friday, Instacart revealed that unlike other gig economy companies, it has managed to turn a profit. But growth of its core grocery delivery business is slowing.
If it is successful, Instacart's public offering could clear a path for many more from tech start-ups. At least 1,400 private tech companies worth $ 1 billion or more have been waiting for a more favorable I.P.O. market, said Brianne Lynch, head of market insights at EquityZen, an online marketplace for private stock.
Just 100 companies with market valuations over $ 50 million went public in the United States last year, compared with 397 in 2021, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks listings. New public listings have also been scant this year, though Arm, a chip maker owned by SoftBank, also filed an offering prospectus on Monday.
"Instacart and Arm are going to be ones that other tech companies eagerly watch because there is this pent-up demand to go public," Ms. Lynch said.
Instacart rode the tech industry's boom and slumped with the rest of the industry when the sugar rush of online pandemic activity faded. The company laid off workers last year and slashed its $ 39 billion valuation -- first to $ 24 billion and then to about $ 10 billion -- as it struggled to adjust.
Instacart is the straggler among high-profile gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash that have gone public in recent years despite being a long way from profitable -- though Uber is inching closer.
The company earned $ 428 million in profit in 2022, compared with a $ 73 million loss the year before, according to the prospectus. It said $ 358 million of that came from what it described as a tax benefit. Grocery orders in 2022 grew 18 percent from 2021, but orders in the first half of this year were flat compared with a year earlier, the company said.
Instacart has shifted its business away from reliance on low-margin delivery services to higher-margin online advertising. That change has helped the company's bottom line. The company earned $ 740 million from ads and other revenue last year, making up nearly 30 percent of Instacart's overall revenue, which was $ 2.5 billion.
The company began building its ads business in 2019, allowing brands to pay for product placement inside the Instacart app to pitch grocery items to customers while they are shopping. Last year, it also started selling software to the grocery retailers it works with.
Brittain Ladd, a consultant for the grocery industry, said Instacart was smart to diversify into advertising, but he was skeptical of how much more room there was to expand its grocery delivery business.
"They're not facing a future of significant growth in their core business," Mr. Ladd said.
Instacart was founded in San Francisco in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, now 37; Max Mullen, 37; and Brandon Leonardo, 38. Mr. Mehta, the company's chief executive at the time, raised $ 2.7 billion in funding for the company from top Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins.
As it has grown, expanding into thousands of cities across North America, Instacart has faced increasing competition from rivals like DoorDash, Gopuff and Amazon. Gig companies' reliance on independent contractors, who are responsible for their own expenses and do not earn a minimum wage or have health insurance like employees do, has also led to fierce conflict with labor activists who contend that gig drivers and shoppers are exploited and underpaid.
The pandemic supercharged Instacart's growth. Sales quadrupled from 2019 to 2020, Instacart said, and continued on a strong pace through early 2022. The company acknowledged that the boom in grocery delivery was unlikely to repeat itself, but said the Covid spike set it up for long-term success.
"While we do not expect our pandemic-accelerated growth rates to recur in future periods, our growth during this period helped establish a business with much greater scale and much higher gross profit," Instacart said.
When Instacart's growth began to slow in 2021, Mr. Mehta approached Uber and DoorDash about selling his company to them or striking a partnership, The New York Times previously reported. He stepped down from his role as chief executive after a series of tense discussions between himself and the company's board of directors. Fidji Simo, a rising star at Facebook who led the social network's video division, took the top job as chief executive.
In its offering prospectus, Instacart lists risk factors including its history of losses, its dependence on relationships with retailers, stiff competition from nine companies and the newness of its advertising business. It also said it had a new investor: PepsiCo. The packaged foods company said it would invest $ 175 million in new shares in a private placement as part of Instacart's I.P.O.
The company's largest shareholders include Sequoia Capital and D1 Capital, according to the prospectus.
Instacart plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol CART.

Full text: The Crooked House pub in England's West Midlands went up in flames earlier this month. Two men have now been taken into custody on suspicion of arson.
Two men have been arrested in connection with a fire that turned the Crooked House pub, a charmingly slanted watering hole in England's West Midlands, into a pile of rubble earlier this month.
A 66-year-old man from Dudley, a town just west of Birmingham, and a 33-year-old man from Milton Keynes, a town more than 50 miles northwest of London, were taken into custody on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, the Staffordshire Police Department said in a statement on Thursday.
The identities of the men were not released, but the authorities said they were being questioned as the investigation into the fire continues.
The Crooked House pub was originally built as a farmhouse in 1765, but the structure began to sag and sink in the 19th century after years of coal mining under its foundation. Its appearance, which drew curious glances and earned the pub the title of "Britain's Wonkiest Pub," had become part of the fabric of Himley, a village in Staffordshire.
A fire tore through the tilted landmark earlier on Aug. 5, weeks after it had been sold to a private developer with plans to redevelop the property.
Days later, the remaining structure was demolished, angering many local residents and drawing criticism from the South Staffordshire local council.
After the demolition, Matt Wright, who lives in a neighboring town, said people were grieving the loss of the pub.
"It's probably the only pub in the world where you'd come out and feel more sober than when you were in," he told The New York Times after the fire. "It was a really bizarre feeling that you couldn't experience anywhere else. And it made everyone who came really happy."
On Thursday, Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, praised the news of the arrests and reiterated his desire to see the pub rebuilt.
"My position on the site hasn't changed -- it must be rebuilt," he said in a statement on Facebook. "Those conversations are active and underway."

Full text: A mysterious company has spent $ 800 million in an effort to buy thousands of acres of San Francisco Bay Area land. The people behind the deals are said to be a who's who of the tech industry.
In 2017, Michael Moritz, the billionaire venture capitalist, sent a note to a potential investor about what he described as an unusual opportunity: a chance to invest in the creation of a new California city.
The site was in a corner of the San Francisco Bay Area where land was cheap. Mr. Moritz and others had dreams of transforming tens of thousands of acres into a bustling metropolis that, according to the pitch, could generate thousands of jobs and be as walkable as Paris or the West Village in New York.
He painted a kind of urban blank slate where everything from design to construction methods and new forms of governance could be rethought. And it would all be a short distance from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. "Let me know if this tickles your fancy," he said in the note, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Since then, a company called Flannery Associates has been buying large plots of land in a largely agricultural region 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. The company, which has little information public about its operations, has committed more than $ 800 million to secure thousands of acres of farmland, court documents show. One parcel after another, Flannery made offers to every landowner for miles, paying several times the market rate, whether the land had been listed for sale or not.
The purchases by a company that no one in the area had heard of and whose business was a mystery have become the subject of heavy speculation and developing news stories, rattling landowners, local supervisors, the nearby Air Force base and members of Congress. Was Disney buying it for a new theme park? Could the purchases be linked to China? A deepwater port?
Flannery is the brainchild of Jan Sramek, 36, a former Goldman Sachs trader who has quietly courted some of the tech industry's biggest names as investors, according to the pitch and people familiar with the matter. The company's ambitions expand on the 2017 pitch: Take an arid patch of brown hills cut by a two-lane highway between suburbs and rural land, and convert into it into a community with tens of thousands of residents, clean energy, public transportation and dense urban life.
The company's investors, whose identities have not been previously reported, are a who's who of Silicon Valley, according to three people who were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.
They include Mr. Moritz; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, venture capitalist and Democratic donor; Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, investors at the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm; Patrick and John Collison, the sibling co-founders of the payments company Stripe; Laurene Powell Jobs, founder of the Emerson Collective; and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, entrepreneurs turned investors. Andreessen Horowitz is also a backer. It was unclear how much each had invested.
Brian Brokaw, a representative for the investor group, said in a statement that the group was made up of "Californians who believe that Solano County's and California's best days are ahead." He said the group planned to start working with Solano County residents and elected officials, as well as with Travis Air Force Base, next week.
In California, housing has long been an intractable problem, and Silicon Valley's moguls have long been frustrated with the Bay Area's real estate shortage, and the difficulty of building in California generally, as their work forces have exploded. Companies like Google have clashed with cities like Palo Alto and Mountain View over expanding their headquarters, while their executives have funded pro-development politicians and the "Yes in my backyard" activists who have pushed for looser development and zoning laws in hopes of making it easier to build faster and taller.
The practical need for more space has at times morphed into lofty visions of building entire cities from scratch. Several years ago, Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, announced an initiative with dreams of turning empty land into a new economy and society. Years before that, Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and billionaire Facebook investor, invested in the Seasteading Institute, an attempt to build a new society on lily pad-like structures in the law-and-tax-free open ocean.
But while these ideas have garnered lots of attention and curiosity -- lauded in some corners for vision and derided in others for hubris -- they have been little more than talk.
As Flannery began seeking property, it bought so much land, so fast, that it spooked locals who had no idea who the buyer was or the plans it had in mind. Catherine Moy, the mayor of Fairfield, Calif., started posting about the project on Facebook several years ago after she got a call from a farmer about some mystery buyer making offers throughout the county. In an interview, Ms. Moy said she had gone to the county assessor's office and found that Flannery had purchased tens of thousands of acres.
John Garamendi, a Democrat who along with Mike Thompson, another Democrat, represents the surrounding region in Congress, said he had been trying to figure out the company's identity for four years.
"I couldn't find out anything," he said.
On Friday, he said that had suddenly changed. This week representatives for Flannery reached out to him and other elected officials requesting meetings about their plans. That meeting is now being scheduled, he said.
"This is their first effort, ever, to talk to any of the local representatives, myself included," he said.
The land that Flannery has been purchasing is not zoned for residential use, and even in his 2017 pitch, Mr. Moritz acknowledged that rezoning could "clearly be challenging" -- a nod to California's notoriously difficult and litigious development process.
To pull off the project, the company will almost certainly have to use the state's initiative system to get Solano County residents to vote on it. The hope is that voters will be enticed by promises of thousands of local jobs, increased tax revenue and investments in infrastructure like parks, a performing arts center, shopping, dining and a trade school.
The financial gains could be huge, Mr. Moritz said in the 2017 pitch. He estimated the return could be many times the initial investment just from the rezoning, and far more if and when they started building.
"If the plans materialize anywhere close to what is being contemplated, this should be a spectacular investment," Mr. Moritz wrote.
The Bay Area is among the country's most expensive regions, even after rent and home prices fell after the pandemic. Economists and housing experts have for decades blamed a longstanding housing shortage and California's inability to build enough to meet demand.
Mr. Moritz nodded to this in the email to the investor, arguing that "this effort should relieve some of the Silicon Valley pressures we all feel -- rising home prices, homelessness, congestion etc." He added that his group had secured some 1,400 acres for less than $ 5,000 per acre. The price per acre has since escalated, and the company's most recent purchases have neared $ 20,000 per acre, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
The purchases burst into public view this spring when lawyers for Flannery filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, accusing landowners of colluding to inflate prices.
The group focused on Jepson Prairie and Montezuma Hills, an agricultural patch of eastern Solano County between the cities of Fairfield and Rio Vista, according to the lawsuit. This area is mostly unpopulated and covered with ranches, windmills and power lines.
In November 2018, the company sent offers to "most landowners in this area," the lawsuit said, and included incentives such as allowing sellers to retain income from wind turbines, as well as stay on the properties rent-free under long-term lease-back agreements. Over the five years, the company purchased some 140 properties from 400 owners, the lawsuit said.
This month, a lawyer representing landowners jointly filed a motion to dismiss the case. In July, three landowners said they had reached a potential settlement with Flannery. Other owners could not be reached for comment this week, or had declined to do so.
As the offers continued and prices escalated, landowners in Solano County started buzzing about who was buying so much land for so much money.
"They would come with an offer of four and five times over the market at the time," Ms. Moy said. "They were deals that they couldn't pass up."
Flannery's offers were creating multimillionaires across the county, but no one seemed to know what the mysterious company intended to do with land that now amounted to a large chunk of the entire county.
That changed last week, when residents started receiving texts and emails with a poll gauging their opinions on a number of questions. One asked them to rate the favorability of several names including "Joe Biden," "Donald Trump" and "Flannery Associates." Another question began with a description of a possible ballot initiative for a project that "would include a new city with tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over a million new trees, and over 10,000 acres of new parks and open space."
Ms. Moy cited poor infrastructure, including the two-lane highway bisecting the region that she said was already clogged by super-commuters driving to the edges of the Bay Area and beyond. The area is also prone to regular droughts and is at high risk for wildfires.
"It seems very pie in the sky," she said.

U.A.W. Votes to Authorize Strikes Against 3 Companies if Talks Fail: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Auto Workers union is seeking big raises and other gains in contract talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.
The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that 97 percent of its members had voted to authorize strikes against General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis if the union and companies were unable to negotiate new labor contracts.
The result gives the union's president, Shawn Fain, the power to tell workers to walk off the job once the current contracts expire on Sept. 14.
Strike authorization votes are normally formalities that pass by significant margins and do not ensure strikes. But this vote comes as the newly energized U.A.W. takes a more assertive stance with automakers, part of a larger shift in organized labor.
G.M., Ford and Stellantis have posted strong profits for about a decade. That has emboldened Mr. Fain and his members to call for substantial wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments, and improved pensions and health care benefits.
"This is our time to take back what we are owed," he said on Facebook Live on Friday. "We are united, and we are not afraid," he added.
Mr. Fain, who was narrowly elected president this year in the union's first direct election of its top leaders, appears to have united the union's members. He appeared at rallies with workers in Detroit on Wednesday and in Louisville, Ky., on Thursday and Friday. About a dozen similar events are planned over the next two weeks. Such events were rare in contract talks over the last 20 years.
"There's nervousness, but there's excitement," Luigi Gjokaj, a vice president at U.A.W. Local 51, said at the Detroit rally. "If the company comes to the table and they're fair, we'll have an agreement. If it has to go to a strike, we are prepared."
Mr. Fain spoke to about 100 workers at that rally from the bed of a pickup truck just outside a Stellantis plant that makes the Jeep Wagoneer, a highly profitable sport utility vehicle.
"We're not asking to be millionaires," he said to loud cheers. "We just want our fair share."
In a statement after the result of the strike vote was announced, Ford said it hoped to work with the U.A.W. toward "creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive work force more than ever."
This month, Mr. Fain sent the companies a list of demands, including the possibility of working only four days a week and wage increases of 40 percent, noting that the chief executives of G.M., Ford and Stellantis have been awarded bigger compensation packages over the last four years. New hires at auto plants start at about $ 16 an hour and over several years can work their way up to the $ 32 an hour earned by veteran workers.
G.M., Ford and Stellantis have suggested they will probably agree to some form of higher wages. In a fresh indication of how the talks may go, an Ohio battery plant owned jointly by G.M. and LG Energy Solution, a South Korean battery maker, agreed on Thursday to increase the wages of 1,900 U.A.W. workers by 25 percent on average.
Mr. Fain had repeatedly criticized wages at the plant, which had started at about $ 16 an hour, as being too low. The plant is covered by a separate bargaining agreement from the one the union is negotiating for workers in G.M.'s wholly owned plants. Wages there will now start at about $ 20 an hour.
The three manufacturers aim to minimize increases in labor costs in any new contract because they are spending tens of billions of dollars on a momentous transition to electric vehicles. The companies have suggested that agreeing to all or most of Mr. Fain's demands would leave them at a competitive disadvantage against Tesla, the dominant maker of electric cars, and European and Asian automakers that operate nonunion plants in the United States.
President Biden told reporters on Friday that he was "concerned" about a potential strike by autoworkers. "I'm talking with the U.A.W.," he said.
Mr. Biden said the transition to electric vehicles should not shortchange workers. "I think that there should be a circumstance where jobs that are being displaced are replaced with new jobs," he said, adding that the pay for those new jobs "should be commensurate."
Former President Donald J. Trump, who is the leading candidate for the Republican nomination, has seized on autoworkers' unease about the switch to electric vehicles to court the U.A.W., which typically backs Democrats but has declined to endorse Mr. Biden so far.
Despite the costs of investing in electrification, the three automakers are enjoying healthy profits.
G.M. said in July that it expected to earn more than $ 9.3 billion this year, about $ 1 billion more than a previous forecast. Stellantis, which is based in Amsterdam and owns Chrysler, Jeep, Ram and other auto brands, made 11 billion euros (about $ 11.9 billion) in the first half of this year, a record. Ford expects earnings before taxes of $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion this year. All three companies make most of their profits in North America.
"Regardless of what other opinions might be, business profits enable future investments, which support long-term job security and opportunities for all," said Gerald Johnson, G.M.'s executive vice president for global manufacturing and sustainability, in a video message to employees last week.
The U.A.W. typically names one company that it will focus on in negotiations and make the target of a strike if it cannot reach an agreement. The union has not done so thus far, although Mr. Fain has publicly sparred the most with Stellantis.
After Mr. Fain presented his demands, Stellantis responded with proposals that would increase how much workers contributed to the cost of health care, reduce the company's contributions to retirement accounts and allow the company to close plants temporarily with little advance notice.
In a Facebook video, Mr. Fain angrily denounced the Stellantis proposals and tossed a copy in a wastebasket. "That's where it belongs, the trash, because that's what it is," he said.
Stellantis's chief operating officer for North America, Mark Stewart, said in a letter to employees that he was "incredibly disappointed" by Mr. Fain's remarks. "The theatrics and personal insults will not help us reach an agreement," Mr. Stewart said.
Tensions between the U.A.W. and Stellantis, which was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot S.A., have been simmering since the automaker idled a Jeep plant in Illinois. One of Mr. Fain's key objectives is getting the company to reopen the factory.

Scorching Heat Wave Shows Schools Aren't Well Prepared: [National Desk]

Full text: Early dismissals and school closures reflected the need to make schools more prepared for a hotter world.
The late-summer heat wave that blanketed a large portion of the country this week prompted several schools to cancel classes or send students home early, underscoring how ill-prepared many districts are to cope with extreme weather events that have become more common.
In Des Moines, school bus drivers received medical aid at the end of sweltering shifts. Chicago teachers were told to turn off overhead lights and draw shades to keep classrooms bearable. A marching band instructor outfitted students with water backpacks to prevent them from passing out from the heat -- at 7:30 a.m.
The scorching temperatures and high humidity that dogged millions of Americans from the upper Midwest to the Southeast added to the challenges of the first days of the new school year. It was a stark reminder, education experts and parents said, of the urgent need to make schools more resilient to climate change.
"We can't be sending students and educators into a sauna and expect them to learn," said Karen White, the deputy executive director at the National Education Association. "As the climate continues to change and warm, we have to modernize school buildings or we are putting students in danger."
On Wednesday, the first day of the school year for students in Des Moines, the temperature rose to 100 degrees, a record high. Only five of the public school district's 130 buses have air conditioning, which made the ride home miserable for many students, said Phil Roeder, director of communications for the school district.
By the end of the day, Mr. Roeder said 15 drivers were treated for signs of heat exhaustion, including one who was taken to the hospital.
In Concordia, Mo., Jessica Gieselman was alarmed when her 6-year-old son, Wesley, arrived home drenched in sweat on Tuesday, the first day of school. Wesley, who has asthma, gets off on the third stop on his route and usually spends no more than 30 minutes on the bus.
"My worry was how hot and stuffy it is on that bus for my asthmatic son to be sitting there," said Ms. Gieselman, who posted a short video on Facebook of her son looking weary as he walked in the door. She and her husband made arrangements to drive Wesley home from school the remainder of the week, during which highs reached into the triple digits, even though it's inconvenient because they both work. "It would be nice if we had air conditioning on the buses, but I know that that's expensive," Ms. Gieselman said.
Molly McGee Hewitt, the executive director of the National Association for Pupil Transportation, said districts in parts of the country unaccustomed to extreme heat during months when school is in session had been slow to make necessary infrastructure investments.
"Where they may have considered air conditioning a frill in the past, there's a realization it's becoming a necessity," she said. "It's going to be a huge investment, and it's not something that can happen overnight."
In 2020, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, found that roughly 41 percent of school districts had deficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems in at least half of their schools.
Since then, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted school districts to make major investments to upgrade air filtration systems. But many schools have been slow to install or upgrade air conditioning systems.
At Marshall Elementary School in Dubuque, Iowa, officials cut the school day short by two hours on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday as the temperature hovered in the 90s. The principal, Joe Maloney, said his staff worked hard to ensure students had water bottles handy and moved slowly through the day.
Toward the end of the school day on Thursday, he encountered a couple of students in the lunchroom who looked exhausted. "It looked like they were almost melting into the floor," he said.
Daniel Krumm, a drum instructor at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, said he and his peers around the country had come up with new protocols to keep band members safe on scorching days. Each student is issued backpacks with hydration packs and there are constant reminders to sip throughout practice, he said.
"We find that students, especially at the high school age, have a real desire to find their limit, and they're willing to push really hard, even when it's difficult," Mr. Krumm said.
Shannon McCann, a special-education teacher in Federal Way, Wash., said she and her colleagues struggled to keep students safe during a heat wave last May. Teachers bought water bottles to make sure students were hydrated. Some turned classroom lights off and blasted fans.
But Ms. McCann, who has been teaching for 11 years, said those measures weren't enough. Some students went to the nurse to get ice packs. Others were sent home with heat-induced migraines and bloody noses, she said.
"The heat and our underfunded schools and outdated infrastructure are really putting kids and educators at risk," she said.
Joseph G. Allen, a professor at Harvard University who heads the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program, said that schools that fail to make facilities more adaptable to climate change would pay a price in student learning. Professor Allen said this problem was exacerbating inequities in the public education system because schools in less-affluent communities had been slower to make the required investments.
"It's irresponsible that we haven't allocated the resources to make our schools more resilient to these threats," he said. Ian Roberts, the Des Moines Public Schools superintendent, talked with students before the first day of school at Samuelson Elementary in Des Moines on Wednesday.

Full text: Nicolas Sarkozy of France is accused of receiving illegal funding for his 2007 election from the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was ordered on Friday to stand trial on corruption charges over allegations that his 2007 campaign received illegal funding from the Libyan government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in one of the most serious of the legal entanglements dogging the French politician since he left office.
After a decade-long investigation, magistrates in Paris ordered Mr. Sarkozy to be tried on charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, criminal conspiracy and concealing the misappropriation of public funds, according to Jean-François Bohnert, France's top financial prosecutor. If convicted, Mr. Sarkozy could face up to 10 years in prison.
A three-month trial is scheduled for early 2025, Mr. Bohnert said in a statement, although that date could be delayed by appeals from Mr. Sarkozy, who has strenuously denied the accusations, or by other defendants in the case.
Mr. Sarkozy, 68, a conservative politician who was president from 2007 to 2012, remains an influential figure in French politics. But he has faced an array of legal troubles, and the allegations that his campaign illegally accepted money from Colonel Qaddafi, the former Libyan strongman assassinated in 2011, have been the most explosive.
The complex case was opened in 2013, after a 2012 report by the investigative news website Mediapart suggested that Mr. Sarkozy's campaign had received significant funding from the Qaddafi government, violating rules against foreign election funding. There have been conflicting accounts of the amount of money said to have changed hands.
Mr. Sarkozy did not immediately react on Friday to the order to stand trial. Instead, he shared a video on his Facebook page that showed fans greeting him for a recent signing of a new volume of his memoirs.
Asked about his multiple court cases, Mr. Sarkozy said this week in a television interview that he had "nothing to blame myself for."
"If I have to go to the European Court of Human Rights to ensure the truth prevails, I will," he told the TF1 television channel on Sunday. "I am a citizen who answers to the law, who is not above the law, but not beneath it either."
Mr. Sarkozy has argued that the accusations against him were driven by allies of Colonel Qaddafi seeking revenge. Under Mr. Sarkozy's leadership, France played a prominent role in the NATO-led campaign of airstrikes that ultimately led to the toppling of Colonel Qaddafi and his death at the hands of Libyan rebels.
Twelve other people were ordered to stand trial on Friday on similar corruption and embezzlement charges, including Bashir Saleh Bashir, a former confidant of Colonel Qaddafi; former top aides to Mr. Sarkozy; and several businessmen who played murky roles as intermediaries between France and Libya when relations between the countries warmed early in Mr. Sarkozy's presidency.
Those defendants include Claude Guéant, who ran Mr. Sarkozy's 2007 campaign before becoming his chief of staff and then interior minister; Éric Woerth, the campaign's former treasurer; and Ziad Takieddine, a French-Lebanese businessman who had said he personally delivered millions in cash and who has since fled to Lebanon.
Mr. Sarkozy no longer holds public office but he is still popular with the base of the conservative party, Les Républicains, and has some sway within it. And although Mr. Sarkozy recently distanced himself from President Emmanuel Macron over France's policies toward Ukraine, the two have a good relationship.
But after years of investigations, a flurry of legal cases has recently culminated in damaging convictions for Mr. Sarkozy.
In March 2021, he became the first former president in France's recent history to be sentenced to actual prison time after he was convicted on charges of corruption and influence peddling for trying to obtain information illegally from a judge about a court case against him. In May, an appeals court upheld that sentence, although Mr. Sarkozy is filing a new appeal on procedural grounds before France's highest court.
In September 2021, Mr. Sarkozy was found guilty of illegally financing his 2012 presidential bid by exceeding a strict electoral spending cap. He was sentenced to a year of house arrest. He appealed, and a trial is scheduled for November.
In any case, Mr. Sarkozy is unlikely to spend time behind bars in the near future. Appeals can take years to make their way through the French court system, and even if his current sentences are upheld, he would probably be allowed to serve any term outside of prison, for instance at home, with an electronic monitor attached.

Full text: He arrives as the Queens museum redesigns its core exhibition to include more nods to video games and social media.
As the Museum of the Moving Image begins the early stages of redesigning its core exhibition to entice visitors back into its futuristic building in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, its trustees have tapped a nonprofit executive to lead the way.
On Thursday, the museum announced that Aziz Isham would become its next director, filling the shoes of Carl Goodman, who recently left after nearly 12 years in the role. Isham, who does not have museum experience, has worked as a film producer and helped start the television program at BRIC, an arts organization in Brooklyn.
Isham will begin at the museum in October after leaving his current job as executive director of the arts nonprofit Twenty Summers.
"I can't think of a more relevant New York institution and a better place to make sense of the present and figure out our future," Isham, 45, said. "As the world of the moving image transforms, we've got this opportunity to redesign how the museum engages with the public."
When the Museum of the Moving Image opened in 1988, its mission seemed obvious. The institution was built upon the former grounds of a Paramount studio where the Marx Brothers sometimes filmed. The traditional definition of "moving images" largely meant television and movies, so the museum built its collection of 130,000 objects to explain how people designed within these artistic media.
During an interview, Isham suggested that the definition had changed with the rise of video games, social media and artificial intelligence.
"The moving image is how we define our time and wrestling with our future," he said.
The museum's board is fully behind his vision, according to Ivan Lustig, who works in private equity and one of the organization's chairmen. He said the museum would probably need to increase its $ 7.9 million budget to add staff members and capabilities that might fulfill Isham's vision. And though planning is still preliminary, Lustig has been brainstorming what shape the new core exhibition might take.
"If you have been to the second floor, you have seen a lot of televisions and cameras," he said. "Compared to their importance today, we can tell that story in 20 to 35 percent of the space that is there and introduce other digital images."
That is not to say that the museum is behind on the times; it has a reputation for creating significant exhibitions around video games and artificial intelligence ahead of its more academic peers.
"We have kept up with the exhibition technology, but the way it plays into our culture is not well told," Lustig said. "We don't really address TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. We do touch on historic electronic games, but they have advanced so much."
The challenge, according to Isham, is creating a museum that can anticipate the problems of tomorrow: "How do we not just tell the story of where we have been, but tell the story of where we are going?"

The Silicon Valley Elite Who Want to Build a City From Scratch

Full text: Enlarge this image.
In 2017, Michael Moritz, a billionaire venture capitalist, sent a note to a potential investor about what he described as an unusual opportunity: a chance to invest in the creation of a new California city.
The site was in a corner of the San Francisco Bay Area where land was cheap. Moritz and others had dreams of transforming tens of thousands of acres into a bustling metropolis that, according to the pitch, could generate thousands of jobs and be as walkable as Paris or the West Village in New York.
He painted a kind of urban blank slate where everything from design to construction methods and new forms of governance could be rethought. And it would all be a short distance from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. “Let me know if this tickles your fancy,” he said in the note, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Since then, a company called Flannery Associates has been buying large plots of land in a largely agricultural region 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. The company, which has little information public about its operations, has committed more than $800 million to secure thousands of acres of farmland, court documents show. One parcel after another, Flannery made offers to every landowner for miles, paying several times the market rate, whether the land had been listed for sale or not.
The purchases by a company that no one in the area had heard of and whose business was a mystery have become the subject of heavy speculation and developing news stories, rattling landowners, local supervisors, the nearby Air Force base and members of Congress. Was Disney buying it for a new theme park? Could the purchases be linked to China? A deep-water port?
Flannery is the brainchild of Jan Sramek, 36, a former Goldman Sachs trader who has quietly courted some of the tech industry’s biggest names as investors, according to the pitch and people familiar with the matter. The company’s ambitions expand on the 2017 pitch: Take an arid patch of brown hills cut by a two-lane highway between suburbs and rural land, and convert it into a community with tens of thousands of residents, clean energy, public transportation and dense urban life.
The company’s investors, whose identities have not been previously reported, are a who’s who of Silicon Valley, according to three people who were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. They include Moritz; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, venture capitalist and Democratic donor; Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, investors at the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm; Patrick and John Collison, the sibling co-founders of payments company Stripe; Laurene Powell Jobs, founder of the Emerson Collective; and Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, entrepreneurs-turned-investors. Andreessen Horowitz is also a backer. It was unclear how much each had invested.
Brian Brokaw, a representative for the investor group, said in a statement that the group was made up of “Californians who believe that Solano County’s and California’s best days are ahead.” He said the group planned to start working with Solano County residents and elected officials, as well as with Travis Air Force Base, next week.
In California, housing has long been an intractable problem, and Silicon Valley’s moguls have long been frustrated with the Bay Area’s real estate shortage, and the difficulty of building in California generally, as their workforces have exploded. Companies like Google have clashed with cities like Palo Alto and Mountain View over expanding their headquarters, while their executives have funded pro-development politicians and the “Yes in my backyard” activists who have pushed for looser development and zoning laws in hopes of making it easier to build faster and taller.
The practical need for more space has at times morphed into lofty visions of building entire cities from scratch. Several years ago, Y Combinator, a startup incubator, announced an initiative with dreams of turning empty land into a new economy and society. Years before that, Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and billionaire Facebook investor, invested in the Seasteading Institute, an attempt to build a new society on lily padlike structures in the law-and-tax free open ocean.
But while these ideas have garnered lots of attention and curiosity — lauded in some corners for vision and derided in others for hubris — they have been little more than talk.
As Flannery began seeking property, it bought so much land, so fast, that it spooked locals who had no idea who the buyer was or the plans it had in mind. Catherine Moy, mayor of Fairfield, California, started posting about the project on Facebook several years ago after she got a call from a farmer about some mystery buyer making offers throughout the county. In an interview, Moy said she had gone to the county assessor’s office and found that Flannery had purchased tens of thousands of acres.
Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who along with Mike Thompson, another Democrat, represents the surrounding region in Congress, said he had been trying to figure out the company’s identity for four years.
“I couldn’t find out anything,” he said.
On Friday, he said that had suddenly changed. This week, representatives for Flannery reached out to him and other elected officials requesting meetings about their plans. That meeting is now being scheduled, he said.
“This is their first effort, ever, to talk to any of the local representatives, myself included,” he said.
The land that Flannery has been purchasing is not zoned for residential use, and even in his 2017 pitch, Moritz acknowledged that rezoning could “clearly be challenging” — a nod to California’s notoriously difficult and litigious development process.
To pull off the project, the company will almost certainly have to use the state’s initiative system to get Solano County residents to vote on it. The hope is that voters will be enticed by promises of thousands of local jobs; increased tax revenue; and investments in infrastructure like parks, a performing arts center, shopping, dining and a trade school.
The financial gains could be huge, Moritz said in the 2017 pitch. He estimated the return could be many times the initial investment just from the rezoning, and far more if and when they started building.
“If the plans materialize anywhere close to what is being contemplated, this should be a spectacular investment,” Moritz wrote.
The Bay Area is among the country’s most expensive regions, even after rent and home prices fell after the pandemic. Economists and housing experts have for decades blamed a long-standing housing shortage and California’s inability to build enough to meet demand.
Moritz nodded to this in the email to the investor, arguing “this effort should relieve some of the Silicon Valley pressures we all feel — rising home prices, homelessness, congestion etc.” He added that his group had secured some 1,400 acres for less than $5,000 per acre. The price per acre has since escalated, and the company’s most recent purchases have neared $20,000 per acre, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
The purchases burst into public view this spring, when lawyers for Flannery filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court, accusing landowners of colluding to inflate prices.
The group focused on Jepson Prairie and Montezuma Hills, an agricultural patch of eastern Solano County between the cities of Fairfield and Rio Vista, according to the lawsuit. This area is mostly unpopulated and covered with ranches, windmills and power lines.
In November 2018, the company sent offers to “most landowners in this area,” the lawsuit said, and included incentives such as allowing sellers to retain income from wind turbines, as well as stay on the properties rent-free under long-term lease-back agreements. Over the five years, the company purchased some 140 properties from 400 owners, the lawsuit said.
This month, a lawyer representing landowners jointly filed a motion to dismiss the case. In July, three landowners said they had reached a potential settlement with Flannery. Other owners could not be reached for comment this week or had declined to do so.
As the offers continued and prices escalated, landowners in Solano County started buzzing about who was buying so much land for so much money.
“They would come with an offer of four and five times over the market at the time,” Moy said. “They were deals that they couldn’t pass up.”
Flannery’s offers were creating multimillionaires across the county, but no one seemed to know what the mysterious company intended to do with land that now amounted to a large chunk of the entire county.
That changed last week, when residents started receiving texts and emails with a poll gauging their opinions on a number of questions. One asked them to rate the favorability of several names including “Joe Biden,” “Donald Trump” and “Flannery Associates.” Another question began with a description of a possible ballot initiative for a project that “would include a new city with tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over a million new trees, and over 10,000 acres of new parks and open space.”
Moy cited poor infrastructure, including the two-lane highway bisecting the region that she said was already clogged by super-commuters driving to the edges of the Bay Area and beyond. The area is also prone to regular droughts and is at high risk for wildfires.
“It seems very pie in the sky,” she said.

Multiple Warnings About Killer Nurse Went Unheeded: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Since the trial of Lucy Letby, a nurse who murdered babies in her care, experts have warned of a culture of hostility toward whistle-blowers in Britain's National Health Service.
It was June 2016, and almost a year had passed since Stephen Brearey, the lead doctor at a neonatal unit in northwest England, first became concerned about a spate of troubling and unexpected deaths on his ward.
Five babies had died, and at least six others had experienced unusual complications. The neonatal ward at the Countess of Chester Hospital cared for premature and vulnerable babies, but the number of deaths was far above average for the unit. Something was desperately wrong.
Then, in the early evening of June 23, a baby boy -- one of a set of newborn triplets -- suddenly became sick and died. The following night, as the parents were still reeling, another of the triplets died.
The infants had been in the care of Lucy Letby, a seemingly conscientious and well-liked nurse. Dr. Brearey had noticed that she was present in every other suspicious case and raised that fact multiple times with executives, but he felt his concerns were dismissed.
After the second triplet died, he phoned a hospital executive and demanded that Ms. Letby be removed from the ward. The executive said there was no clear evidence against the nurse and insisted she was safe to work with, Dr. Brearey later told a court.
It would be another week before Ms. Letby, now considered the most prolific killer of children in modern British history, was moved to clerical duties, and months before the hospital's senior managers contacted the police.
She was finally convicted last week of killing those boys by injecting air into their bodies, murdering five other babies and attempting to murder six others in her care.
The harrowing case has not only horrified the nation but raised profound questions about the workplace culture that allowed her to continue working, even after doctors raised alarms.
Since the trial, clinicians who worked alongside Ms. Letby have spoken out, describing a culture of hostility toward whistle-blowers and a fear of scandal that they say meant their alerts were ignored.
The hospital delayed contacting the police.
In England, hospitals that are part of the National Health Service, or NHS, are operated by individual trusts that have their own management teams. The Countess of Chester Hospital Foundation Trust did not contact the Cheshire Constabulary, the police force responsible for the area, until early May 2017, a year and a half after doctors first began reporting their suspicions.
During the trial, the court heard that a number of pediatricians who worked alongside Ms. Letby, 33, including Dr. Brearey, had repeatedly alerted hospital executives to their concerns about the nurse.
Dr. John Gibbs, who worked in the department, told Channel 4 news that there had been "resistance on the senior management side to involving the police, but I don't know quite why." He added, "We pediatricians were certainly concerned that someone -- and suspicions fell on Lucy Letby -- could have been harming and perhaps killing patients on the unit."
After Ms. Letby left the unit, she began a grievance case against the hospital, claiming she was being victimized. In January 2017, some of the doctors were made to apologize to the nurse and asked to attend mediation sessions, including Dr. Brearey and Dr. Ravi Jayaram, a pediatrician at the hospital for nearly two decades.
Dr. Jayaram had spoken up about Ms. Letby as early as October 2015 and recently told ITV he believed "babies could have been saved" if the situation had been reported to the police earlier.
"There are things that need to come out about why it took several months from concerns being raised to the top brass before any action was taken to protect babies," Dr. Jayaram said in a statement on Facebook on Friday, "and why from that time it then took almost a year for those highly paid senior managers to allow the police to be involved." He declined an interview request from The New York Times.
The case highlights a problematic culture in the health service, experts say.
Medical professionals say the fact that the trust failed to involve the police sooner underlines a broader failing in the NHS. Rob Behrens, an ombudsman who investigates complaints about government departments and the health service in England, said the trial revealed how, for too long, nobody listened despite repeated alarms.
Mr. Behrens was clear that the type of intentional killing seen in Ms. Letby's case was extremely rare in the health service. But he said that senior managers' ignoring warnings was "depressingly familiar."
"I see this time and time again in the cases I investigate," he said, noting that a number of independent reports in recent years pointed to a defensive culture and hostility to those who disclosed safety issues.
Dr. Claudia Paoloni, an executive member of the hospital doctors' union in Britain, said that the case followed a longtime pattern in which whistle-blower clinicians were ignored or victimized.
"Every single trust should be reviewing their existing systems to make sure they are robust and effective," she said.
Dr. Jayaram said in his Facebook statement that there was a long history of whistle-blowers in the NHS, "not only being ignored but then being portrayed as the problem, sometimes to the point of their careers being destroyed."
"What happened here was history repeating itself," he wrote, "but the patient-safety issue that was ignored was beyond anything that the NHS has tried previously to cover up."
The case has prompted calls for change.
Tamlin Bolton, a lawyer at Switalskis Solicitors, is representing the families of seven babies who were victims of Ms. Letby in civil claims against the Countess of Chester trust.
"We really need to look at what was known and what the trust knew during that timeline, to know what they could have done and what they should have done with what was presented," Ms. Bolton said.
Immediately after the Letby verdict, the British government ordered an independent inquiry "to ensure vital lessons are learned and to provide answers to the parents and families impacted."
But many experts, and representatives of the victims' families, said this type of inquiry would not go far enough.
Mr. Behrens, the ombudsman, sent a letter to the health secretary on Wednesday calling for the government to set up a statutory inquiry, which would compel those involved to give evidence, rather than the weaker independent inquiry, which will allow people to opt out. He also requested better protection for whistle-blowers.
"This is a critical, pivotal moment in the history of our health service," Mr. Behrens said. "And we need to understand why patient safety is not considered as important as the reputation of the trust."

Full text: After a plane arrived from Egypt bearing cash, weapons and what looked like gold bars, Zambia arrested 12 people. Egyptian reporters covering the case were briefly detained.
When Zambian authorities searched a private jet that arrived from Egypt last week, they found a mysterious trove that included millions of dollars in cash, hundreds of bars of what appeared to be gold, and weapons.
They arrested 12 people, six of them Egyptian citizens, and the haul stirred wild speculation in both countries. Zambian officials launched an inquiry into what they called a gold scam, eliciting a jittery response from Egyptian authorities.
The Zambian officials said the gold was, in fact, fake -- made of copper and zinc, probably in order to fleece foreign buyers.
"This has been a clear case of scamming, gold scamming," Nason Banda, director general of the country's Drug Enforcement Commission, told a news conference days after the Aug. 14 raid. He said investigators at the airport had been tipped off beforehand about the plane's suspicious cargo.
Egyptian media outlets reported that several members of Egypt's military and security services appeared to be among those arrested. Egyptian authorities seemed eager to play down the plane's seizure: Two journalists covering the episode were detained in Cairo without charge on Saturday, then released on Sunday.
They were the latest of at least 200 journalists to be arrested under the decade-long rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose government and security services own or control most of the Egyptian press. Mr. el-Sisi's government, which has attempted to polish the country's human rights record recently with overtures toward its political opposition and releases of several high-profile political prisoners, has not commented on the events of the last week.
Zambia and Egypt have close ties, even though Zambia is often celebrated for its democratic governance and Egypt is often criticized as repressive. In June, Mr. el-Sisi visited Zambia to strengthen regional trade between northern and southern Africa.
The seized jet, a Bombardier Global Express that can seat up to 16 passengers, was carrying nearly $ 5.7 million in U.S. currency, 602 bars of the fake gold, five pistols and 126 rounds of ammunition. Zambian officials also seized a second, smaller passenger aircraft owned by a Zambian operator, which was believed to be linked to the first plane, Mr. Banda said.
In Zambia, the ballooning scandal has become a test of the country's resolve to crack down on corruption and the impunity of the political elite. The authorities led news tours of the seized planes and offered public assurances that the cash would not go missing, in a show of the country's push under President Hakainde Hichilema to root out corruption.
The six Egyptian citizens arrested did not appear in court in Lusaka alongside the Zambian detainees last week, with their lawyers saying they were ill, according to local news media reports. Zambian officials have declined to identify the Egyptian detainees. A Dutch national and a Spanish national were also detained in the raid, Zambian officials said.
Another court hearing is scheduled for Monday, but it was not clear whether the Egyptians would appear.
In Egypt, despite a near blackout on state news media, independent journalists set out to uncover the identities of the Egyptians detained on the plane.
A few independent media organizations published the names of the Egyptian defendants. Then an independent investigative outlet called Matsada2sh, which is Arabic slang for Don't Believe It, reported that three of them appeared to be former or current security officials, including a police officer, a military general and a former military attaché at Egypt's embassy in the United States.
In its sparse coverage of the incident, Egypt's state news agency quoted an anonymous source as saying that the plane had traveled through Cairo International Airport, where it had "passed all safety and security inspections."
On Saturday, security officials forced their way into the home of one of the journalists who had covered the plane's journey for Matsada2sh, according to another employee of the site, who asked that his name not be published out of security concerns.
The agents forced the journalist, Karim Asaad, to delete two posts on the outlet's Facebook page reporting that former or current members of the Egyptian security establishment were being detained in Zambia. He was then detained.
Another employee of the same site, a woman working for its social media team, was also arrested on Saturday evening. Her name was not immediately released.

Rift Grows Over Casinos and Children's Sports: [National Desk]

Full text: In the race to win a coveted license to open one of the first casinos in the New York City area, developers are showing how far they'll go for local support.
At a Coney Island park this summer, children in a basketball summer camp wore blue-and-white uniforms bearing the logo of "The Coney," a proposed casino project in the neighborhood and the camp's sponsor.
A few months earlier on Long Island, where Las Vegas Sands is pitching a casino, children from local soccer teams were invited to a Sands-sponsored training session featuring the superstars David Beckham and Carli Lloyd.
In the escalating race to be one of the first to open a casino in the New York City area, developers are rushing to win local support after state regulators said projects needed to be "embraced by the community." A casino logo emblazoned across youth sports jerseys is just one example of the lengths to which gambling operators have gone to woo those communities and secure a coveted license.
But their sponsorship of these recent children's events has proved to be as divisive as the prospect of the casinos themselves.
Some parents have argued in outraged Facebook posts that their children are being used as unknowing tools to promote gambling, while other parents expressed gratitude for the opportunities that funding has provided.
Many states, including New York, prohibit casino operators from depicting or targeting minors in their advertising. But, lawyers say, the sponsoring of children's sporting events by gambling companies often falls into a gray area that states are still seeking to regulate.
New York's gambling regulators this year proposed a rule, which is still pending, that would prevent the marketing of sports betting to minors -- including logos on clothing that are "intended primarily" for people under 21.
The New York City area has never had a full-scale casino -- until the State Legislature last year approved up to three new casino licenses for the region. It will most likely be several months before the winning bids are announced, and at least 11 contenders are expected to compete.
In March, Megan and Rich Corrao got a message from their daughter's soccer coach about a special training clinic at an athletic complex in Nassau County on Long Island.
The Corraos' 12-year-old daughter was thrilled. Their 9-year-old son tagged along. The flier they had received made no mention of a casino; nor had the message from the coach, Mr. Corrao said.
When Ms. Corrao arrived with her children, she discovered that the event was sponsored by the casino operator Las Vegas Sands. She and her husband were enraged.
"Don't use our kids as pawns in your effort to dump something in our community that a lot of people really don't want," Mr. Corrao said. "It's not appreciated. It's not right. They're not selling bubble gum."
Ron Reese, a spokesman for Las Vegas Sands, said the company routinely supported children's education and activities in the communities where it operates. It "adopted" an elementary school next to the casino it used to own in Bethlehem, Pa., and funds a charter school in Las Vegas. And at the March soccer event, the children wore their own team jerseys, and there was limited Las Vegas Sands signage, he said.
"We'll continue to invest in youth organizations because they're important parts of the communities in which we operate," Mr. Reese said.
Anita Means was initially happy when her 15-year-old grandson joined a free basketball clinic this summer hosted by a group called Brooklyn USA Basketball at Coney Island's Kaiser Park.
Then she learned that the clinic was funded by the Coney Island casino bid, a partnership between the real estate developer Thor Equities, Saratoga Casino Holdings, the Chickasaw Nation and Legends, a hospitality company.
Surrounding the basketball courts were banners with the name of the proposed casino, The Coney. Children played in shirts bearing the same logo.
Ms. Means, a lifelong Coney Island resident, demanded that her grandson stop attending the clinic.
"When I said to him, 'Well, who you playing for?' he didn't say the casino," Ms. Means said. "He didn't know it involved a casino."
Event organizers said the children were not required to wear the branded shirts, although the social media pages for Brooklyn USA Basketball seemed to exclusively show photos and videos of children who did.
Lakeisha Bowers, whose 12-year-old son is playing in the clinic, found out about the casino sponsorship only when she showed up to Kaiser Park and recognized the logo. She was furious that the organizers had not notified parents ahead of time.
Ms. Bowers, who is a member of the local community board in Coney Island, which opposes the casino, stopped her son from posing in a group photo with the casino-branded shirt but allowed him to stay in the program because he loved basketball.
She said the clinic's free backpacks and water bottles were difficult to turn down in a community where there are limited summer activities for children. She now sees residents all over the neighborhood wearing the casino-branded shirts.
"They're using our children to promote a casino," she said. "If all the kids' parents are aware of that and they're still OK with it, then it's fine by me. But let's not make it a secret."
The founder of Brooklyn USA Basketball, Thomas Sicignano, said his group had hosted 10-week clinics every year for the last 12 years. Because of the casino's sponsorship, he said, this was the first year that the clinic could afford uniforms for every child, as well as a full staff to help coach and organize the program.
A consultant for the casino project, Domenic Recchia, said the group was figuring out how to expand its children's programming in the fall, noting that the shirts do not say "casino."
Since the basketball clinic started in July, critics of the Coney Island casino bid have seized on the issue to stir up opposition among local residents, posting outraged messages on Facebook about children in casino-branded clothing that have sparked heated exchanges between pro- and anti-casino partisans.
Robert Cornegy Jr., a former New York City councilman and professional basketball player who is also working as a consultant for the casino project, said that the casino bid was responding to the community's requests for more youth programming.
"Everybody said, 'We're not listening to anybody about anything unless you're willing to leverage whatever resources that you have to benefit our children,"' Mr. Cornegy said. "And any community is going to say the same thing."
Mr. Cornegy added that it was routine for children to wear the names of league sponsors on their jerseys, even if those sponsors promote adult activities.
"I've had the names of everything from liquor stores to churches on the shirts I've played in," he said.
On a recent Saturday afternoon, some parents at the basketball clinic said they did not know what The Coney was. Others did know, but said they welcomed the sponsorship because it gave their children an opportunity they might not otherwise have.
Paul Jarrett, whose 9-year-old son was playing, said the casino's involvement was "not an issue" for him.
"He has a real interest, and we want to cultivate it," Mr. Jarrett said.

Wildfires Menace Washington, Prompting Evacuations: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Gray fire had burned 9,500 acres by Saturday morning in communities southwest of Spokane, with no sign of containment. One death has been reported.
A wildfire in eastern Washington State has left one person dead and destroyed dozens of structures as the authorities have raced to contain blazes across the state and in the nearby Canadian province of British Columbia.
The Gray fire began in Washington around noon on Friday, prompting evacuations, and had burned through 9,500 acres by Saturday morning, threatening the communities of Medical Lake and Four Lakes. The areas, less than 20 miles southwest of Spokane, have a combined population of more than 5,000.
One person has died and 185 structures have been destroyed by the fire, which was zero percent contained as of Saturday morning, according to Joe Smillie, a spokesman for the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.
A red flag warning, meaning that critical fire conditions were occurring or would soon occur, was also in effect for eastern Washington and northern Idaho through Saturday evening, according to the National Weather Service.
"All Medical Lake citizens, get out now," Mayor Terri Cooper of Medical Lake said in a Facebook post on Friday. The city later warned residents that local water recommended that residents boil local water before drinking as a safety precaution.
Mr. Smillie added that the fire was being fueled by dry grass and wheat fields.
The fire was spreading farther south, Mr. Smillie said, closer to Cheney, a city of about 13,000 that is home to Eastern Washington University. He added that firefighters were trying to reroute the fire and stop its spread.
Photographs that the Spokane County Sheriff's Office posted on Friday on the social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, showed pilots flying near a forest through a sky streaked with fire and smoke.
Jerry Hamilton, 54, said he was in his Medical Lake apartment on Friday when he heard someone banging on his door. He thought someone was messing with him until he looked outside and saw how close the fire was.
"My room turns orange and then turns red," Mr. Hamilton said. As he fled, Mr. Hamilton said, he heard people screaming the same thing: "Get in the car -- get in the car!"
Zack Zappone, a city councilman in Spokane, said in an interview that his father's and his uncle's houses in Medical Lake had been destroyed and "totally flattened" by the fire.
When his stepmother went back to her home in Medical Lake to try to save her bulldog, she was confronted by a "cloud of smoke" and felt "embers falling from the sky," Mr. Zappone said.
The bulldog was saved by a neighbor.
Residents of Medical Lake who had evacuated to a Spokane Falls Community College building on Friday were sifting through stacks of donated clothes, books and crayons on Saturday as they began to process the disaster. A man picked up some undershirts near the donation pile and then wrapped his arms around his wife, who cried and reached for tissues.
Catherine Swan, 54, said she had rushed to evacuate from Medical Lake on Friday night. An official assured her on Saturday that everything would be done to make sure she was able to quickly return home, but Mrs. Swan said she was blunt in her response: "Well, there's no home left."
She saw photos of what the wildfire had done to neighbors' homes, she said, and it looked as if lava had flowed through.
"But I'm going to go back to the land," Mrs. Swan said. "And we're going to regrow."
The state's natural resources department also warned on Friday that strong winds were likely to bring a fire into the United States, toward a protected conservation area. The blaze, the Crater Creek fire, has been burning across the northern border in the British Columbia Cascades since July, consuming at least 54,000 acres. The protected land, the Loomis Natural Resources Conservation Area, is only about half that size.
Another fire in Washington, the Oregon Road fire, has threatened the community of Elk, roughly 30 miles north of Spokane. That blaze, which began on Friday, has consumed more than 3,000 acres and destroyed 30 buildings, according to the state's natural resources department.
British Columbia was also under a state of emergency order early on Saturday because of wildfires. Some homes on its suburban fringes of Kelowna, a major resort area, had been burning, and a few had been destroyed.
Farther north, most residents of Yellowknife, the capital city of the Northwest Territories with a population of about 20,000, had fled before an evacuation deadline as a wildfire approached the city limits.
Canada has been besieged by a number of wildfires across its provinces this summer. Smoke from the blazes has billowed over parts of the United States in recent months.
Wildfires have also been increasing in size and intensity in the western United States, and fire seasons have grown longer. Recent research has suggested that heat and dryness associated with climate change are major factors contributing to the increase in bigger and stronger fires.

Full text: A stray comment on a dating app brought to light some hard feelings a reader once shared with a former friend. Should she confront her about it and talk to her stepbrother?
My stepbrother -- with whom I am cordial but hardly close -- connected with a childhood friend of mine on a dating app. She told him I hated him when we were growing up (30 years ago), and he confronted me about it. I tried to laugh it off and ascribe anything I said at the time to teen angst. Growing up, I found our stepfamily dynamic challenging and struggled with eating disorders and depression. My stepbrother probably struggled too, but we've never discussed it. I am miffed that my friend would repeat something so personal and hurtful to my stepbrother. She and I aren't friends anymore, but we follow each other on social media. May I ask her, via direct message, to stop sharing anecdotes about me with him? I am also considering reaching out to my stepbrother to clear the air and discuss our childhood traumas. Thoughts?
STEPSISTER
There may be excellent reasons to discuss your shared difficulties in childhood with your stepbrother. But straightening out an awkward mishap on a dating app is not one of them. And the fact that you haven't raised these issues with him for 30 years suggests (to me) that you should go slowly here.
In my experience, people who struggle with depression or disordered eating do not usually solve the underlying issues entirely. Even in recovery, we live with shadows. I suspect you worked hard to process your challenges. But it would be a mistake to assume that your stepbrother has, too, or that he would welcome this conversation. Mull it over, perhaps with a therapist, before you disrupt this cordial-but-hardly-close relationship. Do not let a random interaction on a dating app dictate your behavior.
As for your onetime friend, let sleeping dogs lie. She has probably done her worst -- possibly by accident. (Dating apps are hotbeds for weird conversations.) And contacting her now, via social media, may only revive questions about your dislike of your stepbrother that you have already put to rest. I get that you felt ambushed, but you handled it. I would let this go.
You're Invited! (Terms and Conditions Apply)
One of my closest friends since middle school, for 15-plus years now, is giving herself a birthday party. She rented a V.I.P. suite at a Drake concert and is inviting friends to join her. (The suite accommodates 15 people.) She invited me months ago, and I responded immediately that I was excited to join her. Three weeks before the event, she asked, by text, if I would be OK not coming. She wants to invite someone who likes Drake more than me instead. It felt like a terrible disinvitation. I told her I felt disrespected, but she maintains she's done nothing wrong. How would you handle this?
OLD FRIEND
I am sorry that your friend treated you so shabbily. Invitations, once issued, are not subject to greater Drake fandom. For now, there's not much you can do about this. Your friend has given you some unsavory news about who she is. In time, she may regret her error and apologize for hurting you. If she does, I hope you will entertain her apology. Being a friend doesn't mean being perfect, but it definitely requires owning up to our mistakes.
An Honest Mistake Wouldn't Happen So Often
I was waiting for my car at a valet stand when an incoming driver threw his keys at me, expecting me to park his car. I am Latino, and I've heard from fellow Latinos that this happens to them, too. I try to dress nicely and not to speak Spanish, but that doesn't stop this from happening. I don't want to walk away with the keys. The owners would only blame the valets. What should I do?
R.
Perhaps the most upsetting part of this story is that you seem to take some blame for the disrespect shown to you: if only you were even better dressed or didn't speak Spanish. But you should be able to walk around in whatever clothing you like and speak any language you choose and not be mistaken for a valet because you are Latino.
I am sorry for your experience! Return the keys to the owners and ask: "What made you think I was the valet?" (And to those who believe these episodes are just honest mistakes: When did this last happen to you?)
It's No Crime to Squeeze a Profit Out of a Day's Work
Our kids (ages 6 and 9) spent a hot Sunday afternoon making a lemonade stand. They squeezed the lemons, painted a sign and set up shop on our corner -- selling lemonade for $ 1 a glass. Their plan was to keep the cash they made, after paying us back for the ingredients. The problem: Half their customers asked what charity the proceeds would benefit. Did we make a mistake by letting the kids keep their profits?
MOM
Not at all! In my neck of the woods, I have noticed a growing number of children donating the proceeds from their stands to local charities. (Maybe it's a trend?) But that doesn't make your kids' operation wrong. My more pressing observation is that I haven't seen lemonade for $ 1 a glass in years. Tell your kids to raise their prices!
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on the platform X.

Full text: The plane crashed on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital and largest city, killing all eight people on board and two people on the ground.
A private jet crashed onto a highway near an airport on the outskirts of Malaysia's capital on Thursday, killing at least 10 people, the authorities said.
Video footage showed a plane appearing suddenly above the highway and crashing moments later, creating a fireball and a cloud of thick, black smoke outside Kuala Lumpur, the country's capital and largest city.
The victims included all eight people on board, a person on a motorcycle and another in a car, Razarudin Husain, the inspector general of Malaysian police, told reporters.
Six of those on the plane were passengers and the other two were crew members, Norazman Bin Mahmud, the chief executive of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, said in a statement. The crew did not make a mayday call, he said.
The jet had taken off from an airport in Langkawi, an island off Malaysia's western coast, near the border with Thailand, the statement said. Minutes before it crashed in the city of Shah Alam on Thursday afternoon, it had received landing clearance from the nearby Subang Airport.
The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. The Civil Aviation Authority said that an investigation was planned. Representatives for the agency could not be reached for comment on Friday morning.
A state assemblyman from the state of Pahang, Johari Harun, was among the passengers on the plane, Pahang's state assembly speaker, Mohd Sharkar Shamsudin, said on his official Facebook page.

Full text: The emergency order was issued late Friday as wildfires threatened Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, and Kelowna, in British Columbia.
The western Canadian province of British Columbia was under a state of emergency order early Saturday, hours after most residents of Yellowknife, a city farther north, had fled ahead of a deadline to evacuate because of a dangerous wildfire.
The wildfire near Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, was expected to reach the city limits by the weekend. The mass migration from Yellowknife occurred as blazes hundreds of miles away threatened Kelowna, a much larger city in British Columbia.
Officials in British Columbia issued the state of emergency on Friday evening, calling this year's wildfire season the worst for the province. The order allows officials to enact travel restrictions and other emergency measures.
It remained unclear precisely how many of Yellowknife's residents had heeded the order to vacate by noon. But officials said most stores had closed and that the hospital was offering only emergency care, its patients having been flown to facilities elsewhere.
By late Friday, the line of cars and trucks that had snaked down the only highway to refuge after the evacuation was ordered on Thursday had become a trickle, television footage showed.
In Kelowna, a major resort area, homes on its suburban fringes were on fire and orders to evacuate were decreed in a community where several homes were destroyed on Thursday night.
The blazes amplified Canada's image as an epicenter of wildfires in a year of record heat around the world, which scientists widely attribute at least in part to climate change. Canada has reported a record number of wildfires this year, with more than 5,700 burning from one end of the country to the other, some of them sending choking smoke into large parts of the United States.
Rebecca Alty, Yellowknife's mayor, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that more than 5,100 vehicles had exited the city, and about 3,500 people had flown out on a combination of commercial, chartered and military planes. She emphasized that the only road to safety was at risk because of the fire.
"This fire has been burning for the past month so residents are aware of how the highway can open and close at a moment's notice," she told the broadcaster, adding that most of the city's citizens were leaving "voluntarily and willingly."
Addressing those residents reluctant to go, the mayor warned holdouts that all services and shops, including grocery stores, were now closed and that fire officials anticipated that the city would likely be enveloped in dense choking smoke.
While firefighters were powerless to block the smoke, the city has taken several steps it hopes will keep the fire out of Yellowknife.
About 370 acres of trees were felled to create a buffer zone between the fire and city. Sprinklers are dousing the area with 1,000 gallons of water an hour as planes called waterbombers unload more water and fire retardant chemicals.
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces were assisting the local authorities to create fire breaks around the western part of Yellowknife and Dettah, a nearby hamlet, Bill Blair, minister of national defense, said at a news conference on Friday.
"This has been a very difficult summer for people across this country," said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada after meeting with evacuees in Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday evening. adding that among those who had fled the fire he found that "the sense of community is incredibly strong."
In British Columbia a fire that started on Aug. 15 made its way into a residential neighborhood of West Kelowna, a suburban municipality in the area, which has a metropolitan population of about 200,000 people.
Fire officials said that there was "significant structural loss" in a West Kelowna neighborhood on Thursday night although they had no count for the number of buildings destroyed. Houses remained under threat or on fire late Friday.
"It was a devastating night," Chief Jason Brolund of the West Kelowna Fire Department told reporters. "We fought a hundred years of fires all in one night."
Chief Brolund said that at some points police officers who had been ordering people to evacuate became trapped by the fire and had to be rescued. Other people went into nearby lakes to avoid the fire.
Strong wind arrived on Thursday, expanding the Kelowna area fire and impeding efforts to control it. Embers were carried over Okanagan Lake, setting off spot fires within the city of Kelowna that were largely extinguished.
On Friday afternoon, Bruce Ralston, the minister of forests in British Columbia, told a news conference that the weather was unlikely to provide relief.
"We remain in the midst of a strong weather pattern that is creating sustained winds and dry lightning," Mr. Ralston said. About 4,500 people were under evacuation orders as of Friday afternoon, while 23,500 people have been told to be ready to pack up and leave.
Pablo Rodriguez, Canada's minister of transport, told a news conference that the decision by Meta to block news from Facebook users' feeds in Canada had hindered the ability of residents of Yellowknife to be informed about the evacuation. The social media company took the step after Canada passed legislation requiring Meta to compensate news organizations for the use of their material.
Some residents in community Facebook groups found workarounds by pasting news article links, with added spaces or text in the link to bypass the block, and adding instructions on how to restore them.
Mr. Rodriguez said the government would ask Meta to end its block, calling it "unacceptable."
Meta did not directly address Mr. Rodriguez's criticism in an emailed statement. But the company said it has switched on an emergency service for the Yellowknife and Kelowna fires that allows users to find "reputable information, including content from official government agencies, emergency services and nongovernmental organizations."
The air quality in Yellowknife was expected to deteriorate over the weekend, said Terri Lang, a meteorologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, a federal agency. A high pressure system might curb gusting winds, Ms. Lang said, but there would be "very little chance of rain."

Cargo Ship Crosses Black Sea to Turkey: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A civilian cargo ship safely reached Turkish waters in the Black Sea on Thursday after departing a day earlier from the port of Odesa.
It was the first ship to enter the Black Sea from a Ukrainian port since Russia terminated an international grain deal last month that had allowed Black Sea shipments from Ukraine ports. Two days later, Russia warned that it would view any vessels traveling to and from Ukrainian ports as a potential military threat.
As of around 8 p.m. local time, the ship, the Joseph Schulte, had reached the waters off the coast of Turkey, according to the ship-tracking platform MarineTraffic. A container ship loaded with unspecified goods, it was flying a Hong Kong flag and is partly owned by China.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called the ship's passage "an important step toward restoring the freedom of navigation in the Black Sea," in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
Russia has not commented on the ship, which traveled through a corridor that Ukraine's Navy announced last week in the hopes of restoring some of the seaport traffic that had come to a halt with the war and Russia's de facto blockade of the Black Sea. The Joseph Schulte had been stranded in Odesa since arriving there on Feb. 23, 2022, the eve of Russia's full-scale invasion.

For about a year, ships transporting grain and some other food products were guaranteed safe passage in the waters of the Black Sea from Ukrainian ports under an internationally brokered agreement to alleviate pressure on global food prices, but other civilian vessels would not have had such protections. The Joseph Schulte is not intended to carry grain, but the more than 2,000 containers of goods on board included food products, Ukraine's infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, wrote on Facebook.
Since pulling the plug on the grain agreement last month, Russia has repeatedly bombarded Ukrainian port infrastructure, heightening tensions and creating more uncertainty and risk for ships traveling through the Black Sea.
Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a company based in Germany that co-owns the Joseph Schulte with a Chinese bank, said in a statement that the ship's crew was safe. The company said it was bound for Istanbul via the territorial waters of Romania, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
On Wednesday, Russian forces used drones to attack Ukrainian ports on the Danube River feeding into the Black Sea, destroying grain silos and port facilities. Romania's foreign minister, Luminita Odobescu, criticized the attacks just across the river from Romanian territory, calling them "flagrant violations" of international law and saying Russia was jeopardizing the world's food security as well as safe navigation in the Black Sea.

Group Aims to Raise $10 Million to Protect Election Officials: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The group is starting a new venture that will focus on five battleground states: Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin.
A group that works to elect Democrats as the top election officials in states around the country is planning a $ 10 million venture to pay for private security for election officials of both parties, register new voters and try to combat disinformation.
The group, the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, is starting a tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organization called Value the Vote that will initially focus on five battleground states: Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin.
"We've seen our election officials come under threat while they're just trying to do their jobs, and they're doing a fantastic job," said Travis Brimm, the executive director of the Democratic group, who will also serve as president of Value the Vote. "They deserve the ability and the right to feel safe while they're doing their job."
Mr. Brimm said the new group had raised $ 2.5 million so far of its $ 10 million pledge.
Since the 2020 election, once-uncontroversial matters of election administration have increasingly become entangled in partisan politics.
Election officials have faced increased threats in recent years, and they have been resigning at an alarming rate. Elections for secretary of state also became far more politicized last year, as several Republicans who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 vote sought the office in critical battleground states before ultimately falling short.
In turn, the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State grew rapidly after the 2020 election, when former President Donald J. Trump's attempts to overturn the results drew attention to the importance of the position. The group went from raising a few million dollars each election cycle to raising and spending more than $ 30 million in the midterms last year.
Officials at the group say they will provide equal funding opportunities to both Democratic and Republican election officials, but how the distribution will work in practice is unclear. Republican officials may hesitate to take money from a Democratic organization, fearing political fallout from fellow conservatives.
Mr. Brimm said that election officials could request grants to pay for private security themselves, and that Values the Vote would also proactively offer private security.
The introduction of private security with a loose affiliation to a political group could carry risks, however, especially in an era of extreme polarization and partisan distrust in the mechanics of voting.
The safety funding is also likely to serve as an early test of new bans on outside funding of elections in Georgia and Arizona, which passed laws after the 2020 election prohibiting private groups from providing financial help to election officials. The bans were rooted in conservative criticism of grants made by an organization with ties to the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg -- money frequently called "Zuckerbucks" by right-wing news outlets.
Republicans in the North Carolina legislature, who have veto-proof majorities, are currently seeking to pass a bill that would also ban outside money for election officials.
Campaign finance experts note that the new laws are untested, and say they include some gray areas that could allow for the security donations.
"The 501(c)(4) could theoretically provide security services directly to state election officials or at voting or vote-counting sites without charging for them," said Brett Kappel, an campaign finance lawyer at the firm Harmon Curran. "It will take a court to decide if that is prohibited donation of services or whether it falls within the exception for services provided without remuneration."
Mr. Brimm said the group was working with a legal team to make sure it was "navigating those laws correctly."
"In some ways, it's going to be a little bit of a new frontier," he said.
The rest of the initiative hews more closely to traditional campaign tactics and organizing. The group will look to counter election misinformation, including with paid digital advertising, and will begin a voter registration program.
And though the group says it will be apolitical, its voter registration efforts align with typical Democratic efforts, focusing heavily on Black and Latino communities, which have tended to back Democrats in greater numbers.
"The voter registration piece is about actually getting more people into the process," Mr. Brimm said. "The people who are not getting access to voter education and voter registration are typically rural communities, typically lower-income communities and Black and Latino or Hispanic communities."

Georgia Jurors Facing Threats In Trump Case: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the jurors' identities have been shared on social media, with suggestions that they be harassed or made "infamous."
The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that it was investigating online threats against the grand jurors who voted this week to indict former President Donald J. Trump and 18 others, accusing them of conspiring to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results.
The jurors' names are listed early in the sprawling 98-page indictment, as required in Georgia, making the state an outlier among federal and state court systems.
Now some of those jurors have had their faces, social media profiles and possible addresses and phone numbers shared on internet sites, in some cases with the suggestion that they should be harassed -- though it was unclear on Thursday if anyone had followed up on those suggestions.
The county sheriff's office said in a statement that it was aware of online threats against grand jurors and was working with other agencies to track down their origin. It did not answer inquiries about whether any jurors had reported harassment.
Other prosecutions of Mr. Trump have also resulted in threats. A Texas woman was charged this month with threatening to kill Tanya S. Chutkan, the judge in Washington who is overseeing the federal election interference case against the former president.
The jurors in the Georgia case were drawn from across Fulton County, where the district attorney, Fani T. Willis, spent two and a half years investigating actions by Mr. Trump and his allies in the aftermath of the 2020 election and presented evidence to the jury on Monday. Twelve of the 23 jurors were required to approve an indictment.
Soon after the indictment was released late Monday, some on social media began scrutinizing the jurors' identities and revealing their personal details.
"I thought it only fair to share a few names from that grand jury," one user wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, including possible addresses and phone numbers for several jurors. "I will continue to post the other jurors as I find them." (The post was later removed by site administrators, a spokesman for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said in an email.)
On Truth Social, the social media platform founded by Mr. Trump -- who has himself lashed out at prosecutors, judges and private citizens who have sued him -- many users reposted the names. In one response to a list of several jurors, a user urged others to make them "infamous" and to "make sure they can't walk down the street."
Media Matters, a liberal nonprofit that monitors conservative media organizations, collected other messages posted on one online board that included threats of violence against the jurors and called the list of their names and addresses a "hit list."
The New York Times viewed writings on nearly a dozen channels of the messaging app Telegram, where the jurors' information was being shared. In many of those channels, claims were made regarding the race or religious background of the jurors based on their names or their politics. Several people shared posts from one apparent grand juror who supported Democrats in the past.
Jon B. Gould, a lawyer and criminologist at the University of California, Irvine, said Georgia was fairly unusual in making grand jurors' names public. It opens up the possibility that they could be harassed for their decisions, he said, especially in cases involving gangs and organized crime.
Diane Peress, a former state and federal prosecutor who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said prosecutors in New York State and the federal system took pains to keep the names of grand jurors secret. For instance, jurors are usually referred to only by number during grand jury proceedings in New York State.
One reason for the Georgia rule requiring the release of the jurors' names, said Michael Mears, a professor at John Marshall Law School in Atlanta, is to give defense lawyers a tiny window into the proceedings -- letting them check, for instance, whether any of the jurors should have been excluded because they were convicted felons or resided outside the county.
Aside from the names, procedures in Georgia are more secretive than in New York, the other state jurisdiction where Mr. Trump has been charged with crimes. New York keeps a record of grand jury proceedings and testimony, which is turned over to the defense and can be used at trial.
But in Georgia, records are not kept nor is a transcript made, Mr. Mears said, making it extremely difficult to challenge the grand jury's decision.

The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday that it was investigating online threats against the grand jurors who voted this week to indict former President Donald Trump and 18 others, accusing them of conspiring to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results.
The jurors’ names are listed early in the sprawling 98-page indictment, as required in Georgia, making the state an outlier among federal and state court systems.

As Bond Yields Rise, Shares Take Tumble: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street weakened on Wednesday to worsen what has already been a messy August.
The S&P 500 fell 33.53, or 0.8 percent, to 4,404.33, following the previous day's tumble of 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 180.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 34,765.74, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 156.42, or 1.1 percent, to 13,474.63.
Increased pressure came from the bond market, where yields have recently neared their highest levels since the severe recession of 2007-09 caused interest rates to collapse. Yields climbed more following the afternoon release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.
The minutes suggested that Fed officials were unsure about their next move, after catapulting the main interest rate to its highest level in more than two decades. Hopes had been rising among investors that last month's rate increase by the Fed would prove to be its last for now.
High rates work to grind down inflation by bluntly slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. The Fed's minutes showed that officials still don not think the job on inflation is done but that they also acknowledge the risk of going too far and torpedoing the economy. They said they would make upcoming decisions based on what data reports about inflation and the economy tell them.
Some analysts took the minutes as a suggestion that another rate hike is possible, while others said it shows the Fed is likely done with its increases.
"Ultimately there were no major surprises in the minutes, as the Fed is expected to remain data dependent when determining the path of monetary policy through the end of the year," said Sam Millette, fixed-income strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.
Big technology stocks and other investments seen as vulnerable to higher rates were some of the day's heaviest weights on indexes. Tesla fell 3.2 percent. Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, dropped 2.5 percent, and Amazon fell 1.9 percent.
Wall Street has generally been retrenching this month because of several concerns that include worries that the torrid gains made this year through July were overdone and that interest rates may stay high for longer.
A surprisingly strong report on sales at U.S. retailers helped cause Tuesday's slide in stocks, as it suggested that upward pressure on inflation still exists. While strong economic reports calm long-held worries about a possible recession, they could also end up keeping rates higher for longer.
Data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. industrial production had improved by more than economists had expected last month. Home builders also broke ground on more homes.
Treasury yields have been generally climbing as reports paint a picture of a still-solid economy. That weighs on stocks because when safe bonds are paying more in interest, investors feel less pressure to pay high prices for stocks and other risky investments.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.26 percent, from 4.22 percent late Tuesday. The yield is close to where it was when the 2007-09 recession sent interest rates crashing. The 10-year yield helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security, which takes inflation into account, is at its highest level since 2009, according to Tradeweb.
On Wall Street, Intel stock fell 3.6 percent after it agreed to call off its $ 5.4 billion buyout of the Israeli chip maker Tower Semiconductor. The deal faced resistance from Chinese regulators.
Agilent Technologies fell 3.4 percent despite reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its forecasts for upcoming results, including revenue for the full year, fell short of expectations. It pointed to a challenging economy, particularly in China.

Biden Plans Visit 'Soon' To Inspect Disaster Area: [National Desk]

Full text: The president had not addressed the fires since last week, a relative silence that drew criticism from Republicans.
President Biden said on Tuesday that he would travel to Hawaii to inspect damage on Maui after deadly wildfires ripped through the island, killing at least 99 people and devastating an entire coastal town.
"My wife, Jill, and I are going to travel to Hawaii as soon as we can," Mr. Biden said in a speech focused on the economy at a wind and electric power manufacturing plant in Milwaukee. "That's what I've been talking to the governor about but I don't want to get in the way."
Mr. Biden had not addressed the Maui wildfires since last week, when he declared a federal emergency and issued a statement with condolences for the families of those who died. His relative silence had drawn criticism from Republicans, which led to pushback from the White House.
Mr. Biden spoke with Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii and Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, during his flight to Milwaukee, White House officials said.
The governor, a Democrat, thanked Mr. Biden on Tuesday for the federal government's support in the Maui crisis.
"Mahalo for having our backs in this time of need with the full force of the federal government," Mr. Green wrote on Facebook over a posting of the White House announcement.
Frustrated residents of West Maui have complained that victims were receiving less disaster aid from the government than from their own ad hoc volunteer network.
In recent days, however, hundreds of FEMA workers have been on the ground in Maui, including Ms. Criswell. The governor has also been in regular contact with the White House.
By Monday afternoon, more than 3,000 people had registered with FEMA for federal assistance, according to Jeremy Greenberg, the director of the agency's operations division.
FEMA is typically the first agency to face intense scrutiny after disasters, but while it plays a critical role in disaster response, its mission is to support states with funding and other resources, not to be the first on the scene.
Maui is still reeling from the deadliest wildfire in the nation in more than a century.
Recovery teams with cadaver dogs are searching for bodies in the ruins of incinerated cars, houses, businesses and historic landmarks and painstakingly working to identify the dead and notify their families. Only about one-third of the burn area has been searched, and the toll is expected to rise substantially.
The fire devastated much of the west side of the island, including Lahaina, a coastal community of 13,000 that was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom, and wiped out more than 2,000 structures, the vast majority of them residential.
Mr. Biden said in his remarks Tuesday that he wanted to ensure that his visit didn't disrupt recovery efforts before ticking through the assistance the federal government has begun to provide, including supplies, one-time cash payments and additional personnel to help aid firefighters and relieve first responders.
The fire's stunning toll -- abetted by hurricane-driven winds and drought-parched grasslands -- has raised questions about whether Hawaii's management of electrical infrastructure should have been more aggressive. Although an official cause for the fire has yet to be determined, witnesses have posted photos of a downed power line in an area of Lahaina where the authorities reported a critical flare-up, and the fire has already prompted lawsuits against Maui's dominant utility.
Lawyers for Lahaina residents suing Hawaiian Electric have contended that its equipment was inadequate to withstand the winds, and that the company should have shut down power during high-wind warnings. Hawaiian Electric officials have said that the company policy does not include power shut-offs during wildfires because the loss of electricity can create problems for first responders and people who use medical equipment that runs on electricity.
Criticism also has focused on state and local emergency management as the fires raged. Warning systems intended to alert residents to natural disasters failed to function and traffic management during the fire, as power poles toppled and panicked residents scrambled to outrun the inferno, drove hundreds of victims into gridlocked roads that became death traps.

Full text: A short list of memorable meals, plus an update for our Where to Eat newsletter.
I strongly believe that a little leap into the unknown is healthy for the psyche, which is why I'm taking a leap of my own: Starting this week I'm temporarily leaving the Food section, and this newsletter, to spend three months editing and reporting on The Times's Live desk, which you may know as the home of breaking news.
I'm leaving you in the most capable hands: Pete Wells, The Times's restaurant critic, will take over in my absence, sharing all the dining knowledge he's acquired on the job but can't always fit into a weekly review. Exciting, right?
So, this isn't goodbye -- it's au revoir, see ya soon, brb. And, as something of a parting gift, I thought I'd leave you with a rundown of the best dishes I've eaten these last eight months. I'll be back with you in November.
My favorite neighborhood joint
I spent a lot of time traipsing across the city while putting together our recent guide "Where to Eat in New York City This Summer." My favorite day by far was the afternoon I spent in Queens. I started out at Empanadas Cafe in Corona, where the vibes were immaculate as folks from the neighborhood gathered for helados made with real fruit. So, too, were the empanadas, especially the sweet-plantain-and-cheese version in a white flour shell.
A treasure in TriBeCa
I think because it's tucked away in a hotel in TriBeCa and there are sooo many options for French food, we haven't given Brasserie Fouquet's New York its proper due. This Parisian import is the closest you can get to dining on the Champs-Élysées without actually hopping on a plane, and the proof is in the Dover sole meunière. N'hésitez pas.
The reason for the beason
Before you know it, bean season, or beason, will be here. You don't want to be caught out not knowing where the good beans are. In a pinch, get the butter beans at Leo, but be sure to make an appointment for the tender, soul-warming Sorana beans run through with herby salsa verde at Foul Witch. Ask for crusty bread to go with.
Dessert of the year (so far)
I have a complicated relationship with bananas. I would never eat one straight up, but I love their flavor (thus my love of banana Laffy Taffys). I don't usually seek them out as a dessert, but the banana tart with caramel and salted Nilla Wafers at Cafe Camellia in Williamsburg shook me out of my apathy. I'm now on Team Banana.
Gone but not forgotten
Not one, but two of the best brunches I had this year are no longer with us. First was the short-lived brunch at Bonnie's, which was understandably more of a headache for the restaurant than it was worth. I'm just happy I got to try the golden lava French toast with salted duck egg custard and the brunched-up version of their naw mai fan sticky rice. (The nonbrunchy version lives on in dinner form.) I'm also holding out hope that Gjelina New York will reopen soon -- its Instagram account says "late 2023" -- because I need that smoked salmon plate and those lemon buckwheat ricotta pancakes stat. And where else can you watch the city's most beautiful people eat its most beautiful brunch?
That's it for now, but I'll see you all when I return. In the meantime, be nice to Pete and keep taking advantage of all the great eats in New York. Be brave!
In Other News ... Openings: Nar, near the Flatiron district, brings Turkish cooking and wines to Manhattan; Púsù, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, serves up vegetarian Chinese dishes with Shanghainese, Cantonese and Northwestern Chinese influences; and the Tipsy Baker, at Rockefeller Plaza, is the latest project from Pain d'Avignon.
Priya Krishna and Eleanore Park reported that the lifesaving drug Narcan is being stocked by more and more bars and restaurants as fentanyl overdoses in public spaces spike.

For Families of Hawaii's Missing, an Agonizing Wait for Answers: [National Desk]

Full text: Nearly a week after the fires started, relatives are receiving little information as search and identification efforts move slowly.
Terri Thomas's family has been waiting for days.
Ms. Thomas, a beloved aunt with a great smile who loved outdoor adventures, was last heard from on Tuesday as fires overwhelmed Lahaina, Hawaii, her longtime home.
Witness accounts relayed to the family have led relatives to believe the worst. But nearly a week after the fire started, Ms. Thomas's relatives remain in excruciating suspense, without any official news on her status and little sense of when, or even if, they might hear from the government.
"It's tragic -- this hopeless feeling," said Ms. Thomas's niece, Terra Thomas, who lives in North Carolina. She said she understood the difficulty of the situation, "but I feel like there could be better communication, especially when it comes to the people that are now presumed missing."
The search for people killed in the wildfire, the country's deadliest in more than a century, and the effort to identify the 96 found so far has moved slowly.
As of Saturday, officials had confirmed the identities of only two victims and had barely started searching the disaster zone with canine teams. Officials attributed the pace of the response, which many residents have criticized as too slow, to the overwhelming nature of the destruction and to Maui's remoteness, which complicated the arrival of out-of-state search teams.
"The heat of the fire, the intensity and the speed of the fire -- it literally just stopped everything in its tracks," said Representative Jill Tokuda, a Democrat, who represents Maui in Congress. "It's going to make identification and notification really difficult," she said, adding that "it's painful just to think about that."
For days now, families have struggled to learn the status of loved ones in West Maui. Spotty-to-nonexistent phone reception, especially in the immediate aftermath, made it hard for survivors to contact loved ones. Roadblocks prevented people from other parts of the island from looking themselves.
For some residents, agonizing waits have ended in relief. Noelle Manriquez, who lost her house in Lahaina but made it to safety with her husband and three children, said it took three days for her to learn her parents had also survived. That time, she said, was "very hard, very stressful."
Others have had heard nothing.
Chief John Pelletier of the Maui Police Department urged people searching for loved ones to take a DNA test that could help identify their remains.
"The remains we're finding is through a fire that melted metal," Chief Pelletier said. "We have to do rapid DNA to identify."
Terra Thomas said she was open to taking such a test if it might provide answers about her aunt, who loved living in Lahaina and was a mother figure in the lives of her nieces.
But Terri Thomas, 62, had no family in Hawaii, meaning there is no one to go to the support center on Maui to give a DNA sample to the authorities. And when Terra Thomas, who lives more than 4,000 miles away, has called seeking information, she said she has encountered "busy phone lines and unavailability."
State and county officials did not provide information about Ms. Thomas's status when asked by The New York Times on Sunday.
Interviews and social media posts make clear that large numbers of people with ties to Maui endured days of uncertainty about the status of friends and loved ones. Those waits were also agonizing for survivors like Harry and Toni Troupe, who made it to safety but had no way to relay that news.
The Troupes fled their home in Lahaina on Tuesday night with their two huskies, evacuating to a spot north of town before they were told once again to move further from the flames. They slept in their cars on a dirt road.
On Wednesday, they slept at a friend's house in Napili-Honokowai, but neither they nor their hosts had cell service, internet or electricity.
It was not until Thursday night that they were able to get their cellphones to work just long enough for Ms. Troupe to see the 63 increasingly frantic texts from friends and family members, asking whether she was safe.
One of those texts was from a cousin in Ohio, informing Ms. Troupe that she planned to list her as a missing person if she did not hear back soon. The cousin eventually did so, posting about the couple on Facebook and asking if anyone had seen them.
"We were on the missing list, but finally people started to get ahold of us," Ms. Troupe, 62, said, adding that she had heard from people in the Midwest and Bali.
Once the couple was able to inform loved ones they were safe, the social media attention proved helpful. A friend who saw the Facebook post offered a house in Napili-Honokowai, in West Maui, where the pair is staying now with their dogs.
A few days ago, the couple drove down the highway to Lahaina, staring from the distance at the rubble of their neighborhood, including the ashes of their house. They had no desire to get any closer.
"We were so numb to the whole thing," said Mr. Troupe, 66. "We just couldn't believe it happened."

Shark 'Buddies' Defy Image as Loners: [National Desk]

Full text: Scientists have discovered two white sharks that appear to be travel companions, swimming over 4,000 miles together since they were fitted with satellite tags in December.
In the minds of many, the fearsome white shark is a loner. It cares only about food, not its own kind. But new research indicates that some of the creatures may actually have friends.
Scientists with Ocearch, an organization that studies sharks and other marine life, have discovered two male white sharks that could be described as "buddies," they said. The two animals have been traveling together since last December, when they were fitted with satellite tags off the coast of Georgia, Ocearch reported.
"We've never seen anything quite like this before," Bob Hueter, the chief scientist at Ocearch, said in a video posted to the group's Facebook page this week.
The two sharks, named Simon and Jekyll, swam "together in tandem" for more than 4,000 miles up the Atlantic Coast to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, south of Quebec, where trackers last located them in late July, Dr. Hueter said in the video. When one was tagged on Dec. 4 and the other on Dec. 9, the fish were roughly nine feet long and were not yet of mating age.
Researchers at Ocearch are now testing blood samples from the sharks, which they collected in December, to see whether they could be siblings or half siblings. The findings could raise new questions about white shark migration patterns and relationships, and spawn new approaches to shark conservation, Dr. Hueter said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
At least since Peter Benchley's 1974 novel "Jaws" and its celebrated film adaptation, Americans have regarded white sharks with both fear and awe. But as overfishing brings the shark population to the point of extinction, scientists have pushed for a new understanding of sharks as creatures to be protected, not demonized. The loss of sharks, who are apex predators, could disrupt the balance of entire marine ecosystems and threaten the food security of many countries.
The Ocearch findings are part of a broader body of research that has emerged in recent years that is challenging the public impression of white sharks as antisocial creatures, said Yannis Papastamatiou, an ecologist at Florida International University in Miami.
"Some species of shark can form quite strong social bonds and social groups," he said.
But the bonds between sharks are likely different from those between humans. Sharks, Dr. Papastamatiou said, may spend time with each other in order to mate, more easily find food or fend off predators. (Killer whales, among others, are known to prey on sharks.)
In a 2020 study in the Pacific Ocean, Dr. Papastamatiou and other researchers found that a different shark species, known as the grey reef shark, tended to stick with the same social group for as long as four years. He said he had also observed white sharks "hanging out" with each other for hours in specific sites where the animals tend to gather.
Simon and Jekyll could add to that picture, he said, demonstrating that white sharks may "actually travel to and from these sites together." They may even have more friends who are not yet tagged, he added.
Ocearch researchers have tagged 92 white sharks since 2012 to study the creatures' migration and mating patterns, according to Dr. Hueter. So far, only Simon and Jekyll have moved together in such proximity.
Still, Dr. Hueter believes the two sharks are potentially groundbreaking and could draw more attention to the cause of shark conservation.
"In a way, it's humanizing," he said of the discovery, a reminder that "they have siblings. They have a mother. They have a father."
"They're just trying to make a living in the ocean," he said. "And we need them for the balance of life in the sea."

As Strike Thwarts Production, Viewers Catch Up on TV Glut: [National Desk]

Full text: After years of being inundated with new shows, some are using a pause in production to finally watch all the stuff they missed when it came out.
With Hollywood's labor disputes grinding on, and virtually all production stopped, anxiety began creeping into Zain Habboo's house in Chevy Chase, Md.
She and her husband had recently finished the latest season of HBO's "The Righteous Gemstones," but now they were worried that new episodes of favorite shows like "The Handmaid's Tale" would be significantly delayed.
What on earth were they going to watch?
Ms. Habboo, 49, quickly realized she had options. She might revisit classics like "30 Rock" and "Arrested Development" with her 17-year-old son. She could join him in watching a show he's bingeing, like all 62 episodes of "Breaking Bad." She has also never seen any of the "Mission Impossible" movies, and she has barely made a dent in the Oscar-nominated films from the past four or five years.
For many viewers, the writers' and actors' strikes in Hollywood will soon be felt in the form of altered film release schedules and prime-time lineups littered with game shows, reality TV and reruns.
At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
"I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all," said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen. "And that's just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription."
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content -- a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like "Altered Carbon" on Netflix or "The Path" on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn't as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wis., said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer's podcast "The Watch" to get some ideas.
"If you go to the Facebook page and write, 'Hey, I really loved "The Bear," tell me what to watch,' there will be like 400 replies," she said.

Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO's "House of the Dragon" was the breaking point.
"I made it through two episodes, and didn't finish it," she said. "There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too overstimulated, I'll just go back to my comfort shows. I'm going to go watch 'The Office."'
Ms. Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama "Severance" on AppleTV+ would be delayed -- but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
"I can take my time without everyone talking about what's coming next," she said, adding that she's currently wrapping up "Succession."
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held on Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two -- though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, "Suits," a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was "disinformation" that the strike would have "no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline."
"It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months -- and counting -- no matter how much they try and pretend it is," they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Ms. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and "that is a huge bummer."
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. "Don't be ridiculous," she said. "Canceling is never an option."
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in Brooklyn, said the Max service alone "could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest."
"I think it's disgusting what's going on," she added. "But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment."
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, "10 Years of Netflix Series," which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series "Euphoria." But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Mr. Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show "The Boys" for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. "I'm enjoying it, and I'm glad I started it," he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including "CSI" and "Murder, She Wrote." She's also a big fan of rewatching movies like "The Lion King" and other Disney classics.
Ms. Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have "Bluey" episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it's not exclusively for the little ones.
"It's a cartoon series for kids, but I'm not going to lie -- it's also for adults," she said, laughing. "There's stuff in there that just makes me chuckle."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Kenneth Felts began work on a memoir at age 90, he found himself filled with regrets over a secret gay love affair. So he came out -- privately and publicly -- which inspired Johnny Hau to do the same.
A decade ago, Johnny Javier Hau Dzib took a nighttime drive around his Denver neighborhood, his mind in a suicidal thought loop.
Several years later, Kenneth Wayne Felts was at home alone in nearby Arvada, Colo., contemplating death by a different means. Chemotherapy for a Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis was robbing him of life's pleasures. "I thought, I'm 90 years old," Mr. Felts said. "Am I going to live the rest of my life this way?" In March 2020, after four months of chemotherapy, he voluntarily ended his treatments.
When the two men met later that year, both were in better places psychologically. Mr. Felts, a Navy veteran who served in the Korean War, had recently come out as gay. Mr. Hau, an I.T. specialist for Denver Public Schools, hoped to follow his lead.
Mr. Hau is 34. Mr. Felts is now 93. He was born in the dust bowl town of Dodge City, Kan., one year into the Great Depression in 1930. His parents, Clyde and Ruth Felts, were devout Christians. A youth spent in fundamental Christian churches caused him profound guilt over two secret romances with male schoolmates before he graduated high school in 1948.
In 1950, he enlisted in the Navy despite never having seen the ocean. It was long before the era of "don't ask, don't tell." He recalled several men he served with being court-martialed for their homosexuality. To avoid the same fate, he said, "it was important not to even associate with other gay people."
In 1957, when he took a job as an insurance investigator in Long Beach, Calif., after graduating from the University of Kansas with a bachelor's degree in social sciences two years earlier, he adopted the persona of a straight man.
During that time, however, he had a secret love affair with a male colleague named Phillip Jones, who also attended the local Church of God with Mr. Felts. "He was in the choir, and I was in the pews," Mr. Felts said.
Mr. Jones was able to square his sexuality with church doctrine; Mr. Felts was not. One Sunday, he said, "out of the blue, I was bombarded with guilt. I knew I was going to go to hell, that I would burn in fire for eternity." Overcome with shame, Mr. Felts left California in 1958 and returned to Dodge City. He never said goodbye to Mr. Jones, though Mr. Felts was sure by then he was the love of his life.
Over the years, Mr. Felts would intermittently search for Mr. Jones in every California phone book he could get his hands on. "I called every Phillip Jones and every P. Jones I could find," he said. The search was never successful.
Mr. Felts continued to present as a straight man. In 1962, while living in Colorado Springs and working for the state as a rehabilitation counselor for the mentally and physically disabled (from which he retired in the mid-'90s), he married Mary Guinn, a schoolteacher. In 1973, their daughter, Rebecca Mayes, was born. The marriage didn't last -- they divorced in 1980 -- but Mr. Felts's commitment to appearing straight did. His resolve didn't soften even when Ms. Mayes came out to her parents in the mid-1990s.
"'It won't last six months,"' was the first thing Ms. Mayes recalled her father saying when she told him she was gay. She and her then-girlfriend, Tracie Mayes, treated his prediction as a challenge. In 1999, they were married. The couple are now the parents of Mr. Felts's grandchildren, an 18-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl, and the family lives near Mr. Felts in Arvada. (Ms. Guinn died in 2022.)
To occupy himself during the early months of the pandemic, Mr. Felts started writing a memoir. "I got to the point where I started writing about Phillip," he said. The memory sent him down a rabbit hole of regret. So he told Ms. Mayes about the relationship, essentially coming out. "He doesn't open up much, but he was obviously very sad," she said.
Ms. Mayes handled the news of her father's sexuality differently than he handled hers decades earlier: She was happy for him. "I completely understood why it was so hard for him to come out, given the time he grew up in," she said.
Mr. Felts was done with the secrecy and regret and ready to come out publicly, which he did with a Facebook post in June 2020. The story of the newly out 90-year-old went viral. "I started hearing from people from around the world who wanted to interview me," Mr. Felts said. "And each day I got new messages from people saying how much they appreciated me."
One online acquaintance offered to help track down Mr. Jones, only to learn he had died a few years earlier. Mr. Felts was heartbroken. "It is so terribly frustrating to be so close to and yet not reach my lost love," he wrote on Facebook. "My heart has turned to stone and I need my tears to wash away my sorrow. Rest in Peace Phillip."
Another online admirer was Mr. Hau. Like Mr. Felts, Mr. Hau was taught early that homosexuality is a sin. He grew up Catholic, the youngest of eight children born to Josefa Hau de Dzib and Nemesio Hau Poot, in Yucatán, Mexico. By the time the family moved to Colorado when he was 11, he knew he was gay.
"I tried to hide it," he said. "I would ask myself, 'What's going on with me? Why am I this way?"' He was 27 before he kissed another man. He had made attempts at relationships, "but I just felt tremendous guilt creep in. The guilt told me to end it every time."
College at the University of Colorado Denver, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2014, was a welcome distraction. But thoughts of suicide were a constant companion until the night he drove through his Denver neighborhood in 2013 and met an older man who had immigrated from Japan years ago to work in mining.
The man had missed his bus. Mr. Hau saw him crossing the street. "It was late," Mr. Hau said, so he offered him a ride. In return, the man offered him friendship.
Mr. Hau's friend, who died of leukemia earlier this year at the age of 90, became a mentor and father figure. He was also the first person Mr. Hau said he came out to. The friend, who was not gay, "looked at me and said, 'It's OK. Be who you are."'
Mr. Hau struggled to do so until October 2020, when he got a response to a note of support he had sent Mr. Felts via Facebook Messenger two months earlier. In it, Mr. Felts included his phone number (Mr. Hau said he lived locally and hoped they could speak someday). On Oct. 16, 2020, the two met at Namiko's sushi and Japanese restaurant in Denver to talk about their sexuality, and the trauma of hiding it.

They continued talking after the restaurant closed. In Mr. Felts's car, Mr. Hau took Mr. Felts's hand. "Ken was just extremely supportive," Mr. Hau said. He helped Mr. Hau past a second source of secrecy and shame. "I've always been attracted to older men," he said. "And I always felt like, how will people react if I start a relationship with someone older? Perhaps the gay community will see it as odd." Before he met Mr. Felts, "I looked online trying to find out, Is this normal?"
A first kiss at Mr. Felts's home the same night pushed him past that worry. "It was such a comfort," Mr. Hau said. By the end of October, Mr. Hau, who had never before spent the night with a lover, was spending every weekend in Arvada with Mr. Felts. In the summer of 2021, he moved in.
Talk of marriage, initiated by Mr. Felts, started soon after. But the cost of legal fees for a prenuptial agreement slowed it. Then, the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade, with its implications for potentially disrupting gay marriage rights, rekindled those conversations.
On May 20, Mr. Hau asked Mr. Felts to marry him in their living room. "I felt like, I had found this great guy, and the laws were changing, and it triggered this fear," he said. "I really wanted to solidify the relationship, to make it legal." Mr. Felts, given a second chance at marriage, was fully at ease saying yes. "I love being with Johnny, and I love being loved," he said.
On July 8, with a prenuptial agreement in place, Mr. Felts and Mr. Hau were married in a brief, informal ceremony in their backyard. (In Colorado, couples can legally marry without a formally registered officiant.) Jason Eaton-Lynch, a friend and the director of elder services at the Center on Colfax, a Denver L.G.B.T.Q. community center, led the ceremony.
Mr. Felts donned a pink jacket over a purple button down shirt; Mr. Hau wore a tan jacket and blue button down. Their 20 guests, which included Ms. Mayes and her family, dressed casually at the grooms' request. (Mr. Hau's family was not present, but when he came out to them last year via text message, he said "they were very supportive.") Before Mr. Eaton-Lynch pronounced them married, Mr. Felts read a poem he had written for Mr. Hau.
"Near the end of my days and in the heat of my night, I found a great love, whom I shall ever hold tight," he said. "We explore our new world with breathless delight."

D.I.Y. Reception After the ceremony, the grooms cut a brightly frosted cake picked up from a nearby grocery store. Ms. Mayes had organized a light lunch from a local sandwich shop. The couple skipped dancing to focus on mingling.
Handful of Stars The cancer Mr. Felts was being treated for before he met Mr. Hau is "pretty well not there anymore," he said, though he is still seeing his doctor and getting regular PET scans. The memoir he started writing during Covid, "My Handful of Stars: Coming Out at Age 90," was self-published in 2022.
Out There After the wedding, Ms. Mayes said her father had never seemed happier. She had started thinking of Mr. Hau as a member of the family well before. "We were suspicious of John for a while because of the age gap," she said. "But just watching them together -- John takes really good care of my dad. They continue to be just so happy." Coming out three years earlier enabled Mr. Felts to express himself in multiple ways, she said. "He used to be such a conservative dresser. Now he wears the loudest stuff."

Full text: A reader is perturbed to have been presented with a tip screen while groggily paying for a cosmetic procedure performed by a doctor.
I spent a few thousand dollars on cosmetic medical treatments -- Botox and fillers -- at a spa. The injections were performed by the dermatologist who owns the facility. I am frightened of needles and was nervous about the procedure. Afterward, I was a little out of it -- maybe because of my nervousness or the numbing agent. I presented my credit card and was surprised to see a screen asking me to select a tip amount between 15 and 30 percent. I understand why they have this: Some people come to the spa for facials and other treatments performed by aestheticians. So, I selected a 20 percent tip and left. Later, when I felt back to normal, I realized that my tip was several hundred dollars. I have never been asked to tip a doctor before. Should I have been?
PATIENT
Let's make a distinction between tip screens at coffee shops and other retail establishments, which I know aggravate some people, and tipping for medical care. Tips are always optional, but being solicited for gifts by a doctor, as you were, is really wrong. It muddles the doctor-patient relationship and is a violation of medical ethics. It's even worse that you were asked for a tip while you felt fuzzy after a medical procedure.
Now, I agree with your theory about why this happened: It sounds as if you were at a medical spa -- a hybrid business that offers traditional spa services (facials and waxing, for instance) along with cosmetic medical procedures, such as Botox injections. These businesses are pretty common; it's also customary to tip facialists and other aestheticians -- hence, the tip screen you encountered.
That doesn't make it right, though. We can leave the gray area of tipping for facials at doctor-owned medical spas for another day. Your case is simpler: A tip screen for medical services is inappropriate. Call the spa and ask for a refund of the tip you gave. If you feel comfortable, you may also ask the doctor or spa manager to eliminate tip screens for medical services. And if you return to the spa to see the doctor again, you should feel comfortable selecting the "no tip" option.
The Best Family Plan Is the One You Stick To
Before we got married, my husband and I agreed that I would be a stay-at-home mother for our future children. Now, we've had our first child, and my husband is not supportive of my desire to stop working. He is a medical resident, and I've supported us financially throughout most of his training. He is now looking at his dream fellowship programs in some very expensive cities, and he has asked me to keep working until he is "making the big bucks." But that's four years away! How do I let him know I'm not on board?
DOCTOR'S WIFE
Is this Doctor Week or something? I understand your frustration. Four years is a long time in the life of a child. It probably feels like a long time to you, too, after your husband's yearslong medical training. Speak to him directly about your household income. A medical fellowship is voluntary. It is not required to complete his medical training. What salary can your husband earn without taking one, and is it enough for your family to live on?
I sympathize with both of you. Professional ambitions are powerful, but so are your needs and the agreement you made with your husband. Insist that he take them into account as you jointly decide your family's next steps. Maximizing his career is not the only goal here.
Nothing Says Generosity Like Keeping a List
My sister has kept a list of all the gifts she has given me that I have given away to others. Most of them were regifts. Still, I hurt her feelings. She thinks that etiquette requires a recipient to give unwanted gifts back to the giver. I say: Once it has left the giver's hands, the recipient is free to do what she likes with it. You?
SISTER
Sorry, but you are both seriously out of step with the true spirit of gift-giving. Your sister's keeping an eagle eye on the trajectory of her gifts to you is petty, of course. But your willingness to continue hurting her -- on etiquette grounds, no less -- is just as bad. I suggest calling a moratorium on gifts until the two of you can give and receive them with an affection that transcends rules and score-keeping.
An Order of Buns for the Table
This is not a life-or-death issue, but it is awkward: When leaving a banquette in a restaurant where the tables are so closely spaced that one must turn sideways to extricate oneself, should one turn to face the next table or toward one's own table (thereby presenting one's posterior to strangers)?
DINER
Not to be coarse, but about half of us have delicate zones at the front and back of our bodies at about table height. When possible, I ask waiters to help pull out my table so I can exit from tight spaces with dignity. When that is not possible, I assess the characters involved and take my best shot at minimizing collective discomfort. (Spoiler: I usually flash my butt at my own table.)
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

As Hollywood Strikes Roll On, Viewers Have a Chance to Catch Up

With Hollywood’s labor disputes grinding on, and virtually all production stopped, anxiety began creeping into Zain Habboo’s house in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
She and her husband had recently finished the latest season of HBO’s “The Righteous Gemstones,” but now they were worried that new episodes of favorite shows like “The Handmaid’s Tale” would be significantly delayed.
What on earth were they going to watch?
Habboo, 49, quickly realized she had options. She might revisit classics like “30 Rock” and “Arrested Development” with her 17-year-old son. She could join him in watching a show he’s bingeing, like all 62 episodes of “Breaking Bad.” She has also never seen any of the “Mission Impossible” movies, and she has barely made a dent in the Oscar-nominated films from the past four or five years.
For many viewers, the writers’ and actors’ strikes in Hollywood will soon be felt in the form of altered film release schedules and prime-time lineups littered with game shows, reality TV and reruns.
At the same time, the pause in new scripted material provides a moment for many viewers to catch up after the breakneck pace of the so-called Peak TV era, when dozens of shows were premiering each month.
“I have a Netflix queue that is so deep and so long, it would take me months or a year or two to go through it all,” said Dan Leonhardt, a 44-year-old engineer who lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. “And that’s just Netflix! I also have a Max subscription.”
The slowdown will represent a major shift from recent years, when viewers were inundated with a fire hose of content — a record 599 new television scripted premieres last year.
On almost a daily basis, audiences found themselves clicking past new shows on their TVs, often ones they had never heard of, trying to figure out from a one-sentence description whether a series like “Altered Carbon” on Netflix or “The Path” on Hulu was worth their time.
For streaming services, the strategy was straightforward: The more shows they produced, the more chances they had to attract subscribers. The number of people who watched any one show wasn’t as important as the number of people who paid for the service.
So the promise of a constant flow of new stuff became a hallmark of the streaming era. One of the outstanding questions as the labor stalemate goes on has been whether viewers would start to cancel subscriptions to streaming services en masse when fewer new shows and movies became available.
For many, though, a slower output is just fine, giving them time to pick their way through streaming libraries, one missed TV series and movie at a time.
Emily Nidetz, a 41-year-old in Madison, Wisconsin, said she was relieved that production for reality series had not been affected and that there were still plenty of sports to watch. And though she is worried about a slowdown in prestige shows, she said she could always stop by a Facebook community page for The Ringer’s podcast “The Watch” to get some ideas.
“If you go to the Facebook page and write, ‘Hey, I really loved “The Bear,” tell me what to watch,’ there will be like 400 replies,” she said.
Tasha Quinn, a 36-year-old therapist from Chicago, said there was a moment last year when she was so overwhelmed by the conveyor belt of new series that she finally had to take a break. HBO’s “House of the Dragon” was the breaking point.
“I made it through two episodes, and didn’t finish it,” she said. “There was too much hype, and there were a lot of other things coming out at the same time. I was like, nope, I’m too overwhelmed, I’m too overstimulated, I’ll just go back to my comfort shows. I’m going to go watch ‘The Office.’”
Quinn said that the labor disputes had worried her briefly because new episodes of the dystopian workplace drama “Severance” on AppleTV+ would be delayed — but that she then quickly thought of the upside.
“I can take my time without everyone talking about what’s coming next,” she said, adding that she’s currently wrapping up “Succession.”
The length of the labor disputes will determine the length of the disruption. Actors have been on strike since July 14. Writers have been walking picket lines for more than 100 days. Formal talks between the writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, were held Friday for the first time since early May. No talks involving the actors are scheduled.
Third-party researchers believe that most of the streaming services should be well insulated if the strikes last another month or two — though that risk rises the longer production is shut down. The amount of content in their streaming libraries was one reason the studios initially said they could weather the strikes, at least in the short term, a pointed message to writers and actors currently going without paychecks. (For instance, “Suits,” a USA Network show that went off the air in 2019, has recently surged in popularity on Netflix.)
Leaders of the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents thousands of striking screenwriters, recently said it was “disinformation” that the strike would have “no impact because streaming services have libraries and some product in the pipeline.”
“It is not a viable business strategy for these companies to shut down their business for three months — and counting — no matter how much they try and pretend it is,” they said in a note to members.
Many viewers say they support the striking writers and actors. Habboo said she believed they were not being fairly compensated, and “that is a huge bummer.”
Still, when asked if she would cut any of her streaming subscriptions, she was emphatic. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she said. “Canceling is never an option.”
Mel Russo, a 56-year-old yoga teacher who lives in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, said the Max service alone “could keep you busy for the next 10 years, to be honest.”
“I think it’s disgusting what’s going on,” she added. “But I am not in dire straits about it as a watcher and as a lover of entertainment.”
The streaming services seem keen to capitalize. Last month, Netflix rolled out a new banner, “10 Years of Netflix Series,” which presents viewers with dozens of older titles from its library.
Eric Martinez, a 25-year-old video producer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, had been a big fan of the HBO series “Euphoria.” But the earliest that show will return for its third season is now 2025, so he went looking for an alternative.
On his Amazon Prime page, Martinez had been seeing a tile for the show “The Boys” for some time. The superhero series was one he thought he had no interest in. But with time on his hands, he finally took the plunge. “I’m enjoying it, and I’m glad I started it,” he said.
Not all the viewers need a new old show to watch.
Brenda Stewart, a 71-year-old Nebraskan, said she and her husband often fired up their Roku and watched reruns of older series including “CSI” and “Murder, She Wrote.” She’s also a big fan of re-watching movies like “The Lion King” and other Disney classics.
Stewart, who has six grandchildren, said it was not uncommon to have “Bluey” episodes playing again and again in her house when the children were over. And, sometimes, it’s not exclusively for the little ones.
“It’s a cartoon series for kids, but I’m not going to lie — it’s also for adults,” she said, laughing. “There’s stuff in there that just makes me chuckle.”

Full text: The mobile wallet service is a cautionary tale of how apps born at least a decade ago may be exposing more information than you would like.
There's an app for snooping on your friends, family and colleagues to find out about their fancy dinners, the people they are dating and the parties they are attending that you weren't invited to.
It's not a social networking app like Facebook or Snapchat. It's Venmo, the app that became popular more than a decade ago by enabling people to send mobile payments to one another and to post those transactions, often in the form of cute emojis, on a public timeline.
The snooping works the other way around, too. Even if you seldom use Venmo today, the app is most likely leaking sensitive information about you to the general public.
How do I know? I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I recently discovered that my contacts list, which includes the names of people in my phone book, was published on Venmo for anyone using the app to see.
That's because more than a decade ago, Venmo made people's contact lists visible to its users. It created an option to hide the address book only two years ago, long after I had stopped using the app.
Venmo is a strong example of how even as social norms shift on the ways we use technology, the companies and their apps don't change much. Venmo was founded in 2009 as a music start-up that let users buy songs from bands through a text message. By the time eBay acquired it in 2013, it had become a mobile wallet service that was trendy among younger people who were gung-ho about sharing information about themselves online.
At the time, social networking was novel, and posting your thoughts, movements and achievements for everyone to know about was cutting edge, not sinister. Since then, we have learned the hard way that sharing such seemingly innocuous information can be hazardous. Stalkers, employers or data brokers can use the data to study our whereabouts and activities to target us.
But Venmo remains an app with a strong social networking element, one of many in a generation of apps that are now nearly 15 years old. And if you have apps and internet accounts from then that are on autopilot, it's best to revisit them periodically to check their settings so that you can safeguard your privacy. If you no longer find value in the service, the safest bet may be to delete the account.
Before we get into that, let's dive into why Venmo remains a privacy concern and what to do to protect your data.
Venmo Transactions
In the early 2010s, as smartphones became popular, Venmo rode the coattails of companies like Facebook and Twitter, which brought the concept of a public timeline into the mainstream. Similar to those networks, Venmo allowed people to publicly post to a feed, in its case details of payment transactions, including the dollar amount, time, date and a description, such as a pizza or taxicab emoji.
At the time, Braintree, the payments company that bought Venmo in 2012 before it was purchased by eBay, said Venmo had created "rave-worthy experiences" to simplify mobile payments between smartphone users. (Venmo is now owned by PayPal, which was spun off from eBay in 2015.)
Venmo has made some changes over the years to protect its users' privacy. In 2021, it disabled its global feed, a stream where users could see Venmo transactions among strangers.
But critics say the app still falls short. Today, you can see transactions among people who are not your friends if you visit their profiles.
Venmo is still set by default to publicly share when you receive or make a payment. There's an option to make the transaction private, but if you use the app quickly and don't notice the setting, you could unknowingly broadcast the payments between you and others.
"It's not just that I went out to pizza with this person," said Gennie Gebhart, a managing director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. "It's a pattern of who you live with, interact with and do business with, and how it changes over time."
Last month, The Guardian discovered through a Venmo feed that an aide for Justice Clarence Thomas was taking payments from lawyers who have had business with the Supreme Court, a potential conflict of interest. The aide has since hidden his Venmo activity from public view.
While the idea of posting pizza and beer emojis and dollar amounts could sound like a fun way to tell others that you are out and about, there may eventually be consequences. Those transactions could be used to study your movements or, in the case of Justice Thomas, inadvertently disclose relationships.
In 2017, Hang Do Thi Duc, a data researcher who was at the Mozilla Foundation, published Public by Default, an interactive graphic summarizing the intimate details scraped from 208 million Venmo transactions. The graphic homed in on the daily lives of several Venmo users, including a cannabis dealer, a food cart vendor and a married couple splitting bills and paying off a loan together.
Venmo said in a statement that it had worked to change its privacy measures for customers and that privacy settings could be controlled within its app. "The privacy and safety of all Venmo users is always a top priority," the company said.
To prevent your day-to-day life from being broadcast on Venmo, make sure to change the settings. Inside the app, click on the Me tab, tap the settings icon and select Privacy. Under default privacy settings, select Private. Then, under the "More" section in Privacy, click "Past Transactions" and make sure to set that to "Change All to Private."
Your Contacts List
Venmo has made the contacts list, which can be generated from your smartphone's address book or your Facebook friends list, viewable to any other user on the app.
That can make a lot of information public. In 2021, my colleague Ryan Mac, who was then at BuzzFeed News, used Venmo to discover President Biden's account and personal contacts list. Mr. Biden later deleted his Venmo account.
On a personal level, a public address book can reveal a new romantic partner to an ex. For professionals, it could expose a doctor's patients, a journalist's sources or a salesperson's clients.
To hide your contacts list from public view, visit the privacy settings, click on Friends List and select Private. Also, toggle off the option for "appear in other users' friends lists."
Review, Then Review Again
All tech companies change their data-sharing features and settings over time. So take a moment to scroll through your phone and review the settings inside apps you haven't used in a while to see if there's something you missed.
Ms. Do Thi Duc, who is now a graphics editor at The New York Times, said she wasn't surprised that Venmo was still making headlines, because the app relied on people's public oversharing as a marketing mechanism. She said she deleted her Venmo account when conducting her research on the company.
After writing this column, I did the same.

F.B.I. Agent Kills Man Who Is Tied To Biden Threats: [National Desk]

Author: Goldman, Adam; Jiménez, Jesus

Publication info: Goldman, Adam; Jiménez, Jesus. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/f-b-i-agent-kills-man-who-is-tied-biden-threats/docview/2848070547/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The man, who was shot while agents were trying to serve arrest and search warrants at a home, was also charged with threatening other elected officials.
An F.B.I. agent on Wednesday fatally shot a man in Provo, Utah, who officials said was armed and had threatened to assassinate President Biden just hours before the president was scheduled to speak in nearby Salt Lake City.
Craig D. Robertson, 75, was also charged with threatening to shoot other elected officials, including Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, as well as with making threats against law enforcement officials, according to court documents filed a day earlier in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.
The shooting comes at a moment of intense polarization in American politics. The three indictments of former President Donald J. Trump have offered fodder for supporters and allies, who have seized on his mounting legal peril to fan a narrative of a Justice Department weaponized against him and bent on derailing the Republican front-runner's campaign to retake the White House.
The F.B.I. said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon that it was investigating an "agent-involved shooting" that had happened around 6:15 a.m. in Provo while agents were trying to serve arrest and search warrants at a home.
A federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the shooting, said that Mr. Robertson was armed at the time. Officials offered few other details.
A White House official said that Mr. Biden had been briefed on the matter, and a woman who was listed in public records as Mr. Robertson's daughter declined to comment when reached by phone.
According to the court filing, Mr. Robertson owned numerous firearms, including a sniper rifle. The complaint also laid out his history of threats on social media, where he referred to his guns as Democratic eradicators. In one post last year, he photographed three rifles and said he was "getting ready for the 2024 election cycle." He repeatedly taunted the agents investigating him, saying they came close to "violent eradication."
Last week, he noted on social media that Mr. Biden would be visiting Utah and that he was going to "dust off" an M24 rifle and get out his old camouflage suit, one typically used by snipers.
According to the complaint, other online posts indicated Mr. Robertson's intent to kill Mr. Biden and Mr. Bragg, who is leading a prosecution of Mr. Trump in New York in connection with a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 campaign.
On Sept. 19, 2022, Mr. Robertson wrote on Facebook that "the time is right for a presidential assassination or two."
"First Joe then Kamala," he wrote. In another message, he declared that he wanted shoot Mr. Bragg in the head and watch him die.
The post also mentioned George Soros, the financier and Democratic megadonor, who has been a target of Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, and echoed Mr. Trump's attacks on Mr. Bragg and Mr. Soros.
Other subjects of Mr. Robertson's threats: Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, whom he described as a Nazi; Gov. Gavin Newsom of California; and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.
In September 2022, referring to Ms. James, Mr. Robertson wrote on Facebook that "a sniper's bullet does not recognize your qualified immunity." In October 2022, he shared a picture of a semiautomatic handgun, calling it a "Merrick Garland eradication tool."
In yet another Facebook post in October, Mr. Robertson described a "patriotic dream" in which he said stood over a wounded Mr. Newsom, "my suppressed S&W M&P 9mm still smoking."
In a Facebook post in March, Mr. Robertson taunted the F.B.I.
"To my friends in the Federal Bureau of Idiots: I know you're reading this," he wrote.
Spokespeople for Mr. Bragg and Ms. James declined to comment.
The F.B.I. has been increasingly concerned about threats to its agents. Last year, law enforcement officers shot and killed a man who they said tried to break into the F.B.I.'s Cincinnati office.
And a Tennessee man accused of assaulting the police during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol faced additional charges of plotting to assassinate several of the federal agents who had investigated him. He was also accused of planning an attack on the F.B.I.'s field office in Knoxville, Tenn.
Mr. Trump and his supporters have downplayed the notion that his incendiary criticisms of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. are anything other than an expression of legitimate grievances.
But federal and local authorities have remained on heightened alert, providing additional security to prosecutors investigating Mr. Trump and the judges presiding over his cases.

From the air, the town of Lahaina looks incinerated. Charred palm trees are reduced to slender matchsticks protruding into the smoky sky. Homes are ash. Streets are deserted.
"Oh, my Gosh! Unbelievable," said Richard Olsten as he piloted a helicopter along the Maui coast on Wednesday. "This looks like Baghdad or something."
The firestorm that tore through the western shores of Hawaii's Maui island on Tuesday and continued on Wednesday has killed at least six people and forced the evacuation of more than 2,000, the authorities said. It was the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, according to Clay Trauernicht, a tropical fire specialist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
It was a scene familiar to residents of California and other states in the American West that have suffered a spate of hot-burning and fast-moving wildfires. This week they were ravaging a part of the United States that many consider paradise.
"This is not a safe place to be," Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke said at a news conference Wednesday. The state government was trying to stop tourists from arriving on the island, but as late as Wednesday morning, flights filled with tourists were still landing in Maui, she said. "We have shelters that are being overrun. We have resources that are being taxed."
Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawaii state Department of Transportation, said some 2,000 travelers spent Tuesday night at the airport and another 4,000 people had been stranded by road closures. The situation was "absolutely horrific," he said.
At least three fires on the island were propelled by strong winds as a hurricane moved across the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles to the south. The inferno came so quickly that some residents ran into the ocean to escape the smoke and flames. They were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, Maui County officials said. Others escaped by car, driving past flames in the shadow of the West Maui Mountains.
President Biden ordered all federal assets in Hawaii to assist with the fire response, the White House said. The Coast Guard, the Navy and the Marines were supporting firefighting and rescue efforts, and the Department of Transportation was working with commercial airlines to evacuate tourists from the island.
The most concentrated damage appeared to be in Lahaina, once the royal capital of Hawaii and now a major tourist hub.
The first signs of disaster for Rachel Zimmerman were the gusts of wind that tore through her condominium, ripping the screens from her windows. Then, around 4:45 a.m. Tuesday, she saw flames in the distance and called the fire department, but it said there was no need to worry, she said. So Ms. Zimmerman went back to sleep.
By the time she awoke, the power was out, and Ms. Zimmerman could smell smoke, so she and her partner decided it was time to go. In the 10 minutes it took to grab their clothes, a bicycle and their dog, the air had become so thick with smoke that they did not know which way to drive in order to get away from the approaching wildfire.
"It was black," Ms. Zimmerman said. "It happened so fast."
On Wednesday, she and her partner, both 34, were sheltering at a friend's home about 20 miles away in the town of Waikapu.
Mr. Olsten, the director of operations at Air Maui Helicopter Tours, flew back and forth across the devastation on Wednesday, even as smoke was still wafting over the azure waters of the Pacific. Entire neighborhoods appeared flattened by fire, with only charred remnants remaining of homes. Some larger structures appeared intact. And some neighborhoods were spared the flames, their lawns still green.
He filmed the scene and posted it to Facebook. In one frame, he captured a single house that remained standing while dozens around it had been rendered into a sickly white ash.
The death toll and wrecked landscape of the town reinforced the grim reality that even corners of the globe generally blessed with plentiful rainfall -- and until recently unaccustomed to powerful wildfires -- are now, partly because of climate change, much more vulnerable.
In August 2018, a series of fires on Maui destroyed dozens of homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents and tourists. Lionel Montalvo, an official with the Maui County Fire Department, was quoted at the time saying the fire was "unprecedented in our department's history."
Three years later, wildfires in Maui and the Big Island tore through more than 40,000 acres of ranchland and brush.
Wildfires in Hawaii are now burning through more than four times the number of acres than in previous decades, according to Professor Trauernicht, at the University of Hawaii.
Experts attribute the surge in wildfires to the prevalence of nonnative grasses, which are especially common on Maui, and are more flammable than indigenous plants. This is coupled with extreme weather patterns connected to climate change: unusually hot and dry summers and shifts in rainfall patterns.
"The grasslands make us incredibly vulnerable," Professor Trauernicht said.
"We have known there was the potential for this," he said, referring to incinerated homes in Lahaina, "but I still don't think any of us could have imagined how destructive and devastating this fire became."
The island of Maui is the state's driest at the moment, with much of West Maui facing moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Temperatures in Hawaii have risen by 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950 and are expected to rise by as much as 5 degrees more by 2085, according to calculations by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Officials said that they did not know what had caused this week's wildfires, which spread over at least 1,800 acres on Maui and the Big Island.
On social media, terrifying footage circulated of weathered wooden storefronts on Lahaina's Front Street, which lines the water, engulfed in flames. Normally, the area is bustling with visitors who browse the shops for surf gear or high-end art and stop for seafood and mai tais at restaurants like Fleetwood's on Front St., owned by the rock star Mick Fleetwood.
Friends and family members of residents and vacationers posted frantically on Facebook in hopes of reaching loved ones. They asked about their parents, who may have been stuck in traffic, or their siblings who work at resorts, whom they hadn't heard from since the previous night. Some posted about evacuation centers and donation drop-offs.
Roads into West Maui were closed to everyone except emergency workers on Wednesday morning, officials said, effectively cutting off access from outside to some of Hawaii's best-known resorts. In Lahaina, a town of about 12,000 people, all roads were closed, officials said.
The National Weather Service on Tuesday had expected winds of up to 45 miles per hour, with gusts of 60 miles per hour, and the agency warned residents to secure property and expect outages and difficult travel.
Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm, remained around 700 miles south of Honolulu on Wednesday and did not make landfall in Hawaii. Although the hurricane was not directly responsible for the conditions in the state, it has helped strengthen the winds, according to Robert Bohlin, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's Honolulu office.
A firefighter on Maui was hospitalized with smoke inhalation but was in stable condition.

Full text: The rap star's show in Rome at the Circus Maximus, an archaeological site by day and concert venue by night, has raised concerns about the risks posed by crowds.
When Travis Scott asked Rome to make some noise at the Circus Maximus on Monday, Rome cheerfully complied.
The 60,000-odd spectators jumped so vigorously that some locals panicked, thinking that an earthquake was underway. Archaeologists were alarmed by the vibrations and questioned the wisdom of holding musical events at an ancient site, where chariot races were held more than 2,000 years ago and to which Julius Caesar later added his own decorating touch.
The concert coincided with the release of Mr. Scott's chart-topping new album, "Utopia." He was joined by Ye, the rap star formerly known as Kanye West. The show in Rome marked Ye's first concert appearance after a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews last year led to his expulsion from social media for a time and the loss of fashion design partnerships. When he came onstage, the crowd roared and jumped some more.
Romans, including those living some distance from the site, took to social media to lament shaking windows, beds and chandeliers. In more recent years, the Circus Maximus has played host to major open-air rock concerts, including shows by the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and, this summer, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N' Roses and Imagine Dragons. The circus has also hosted the summer season of Rome's opera.
Giovanni Diaferia, a seismologist at the Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, also writing on X, calculated: "60k people, 70 kg each, jumping and reaching 0.15 m from ground radiate an energy of E = 6.2 MJ which is equivalent to a magnitude 1.3 earthquake, at each jump!! Enough to be recorded by a seismic station 9 km away."
On Tuesday, the institute said in an online note that its national seismic network stations "clearly registered the enthusiasm of Travis Scott fans in concert at Circus Maximus."
Similar activity was registered in 2021, when Italy won the European Championship final, as well as earlier this year when Naples won the Serie A championship, the institute said.
A seismogram identified several points during the concert, which lasted under 90 minutes, "with evident peaks of jubilation" on the part of fans, according to the institute.
In the aftermath, Alfonsina Russo, who oversees the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum, Rome's most important archaeological area, called on city officials to stop using the Circus Maximus for mass events and to put it to more cultural use.
Ms. Russo told the AGI news agency on Tuesday that the circus was a historical monument, not a stadium, and that "mega-concerts put it at risk."
Archaeological experts had given advice to the city for such events, and she said she had expressed concerns about the decibel levels and about spectators jumping in place.
"In my opinion, musical events can be held, but they should be carefully chosen like opera and ballet," she told AGI. "Rock concerts are best held in stadiums to not endanger public safety."
There was a moment of panic during the Scott show. Italian news media reported that around 60 people had to be treated for eye and throat irritation, possibly because someone used pepper spray in the crowd. Nearly five years ago, pepper spray used at a nightclub, where a rapper was to perform, in the central Italian town of Corinaldo led to a stampede that killed six people and left nearly 200 people injured.
Attempts to reach the organizers of Mr. Scott's concert were unsuccessful.
In 2021, 10 people were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured at a concert by Mr. Scott at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Mr. Scott was investigated, but a grand jury declined to indict him or others connected to the festival. A number of civil lawsuits against Mr. Scott and festival organizers are pending.
On Wednesday, Alessandro Onorato, Rome's City Council member responsible for tourism and events, defended the mega-concerts. Beyond the money spent by concertgoers visiting from around the world, he said, fees to use the Circus Maximus for concerts last year brought 2.1 million euros, or $ 2.3 million, into city coffers. The funds were earmarked for the city department that maintains city-owned archaeological monuments, he added. Without these fees, Roman taxpayers would have to pay up, he said in a Facebook live feed.
"There were zero incidents, zero people got hurt," he said of Mr. Scott's concert.

Full text: They are an unavoidable part of being online. But are they making us better cooks?
A few months ago, a decidedly unsexy, 1970s-era diet food began flying off supermarket shelves. Nearly overnight, cottage cheese was as trendy as Barbie pink.
People put it in dips and pasta sauce. They turned it into ice creams, even breads. Cottage cheese suddenly could do it all.
Who or what, exactly, revived your grandmother's afternoon snack? TikTok. Across the internet, videos of cottage cheese dishes abounded. Maybe you even bought a tub yourself.
Cooking videos have never been more persuasive, more inescapable, more addictive, more entertaining. And they've never been a more powerful driver of popular culture.
Videos on TikTok with the #foodtok hashtag have been viewed more than 64 billion times. But cooking videos are not only an unavoidable part of being online -- they've also infiltrated physical spaces. TikTok-esque cooking videos air on large vertical screens on New York City subways and on iPad-size displays in the back of cabs, in the lobby of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the waiting room at the doctor's office. They are everywhere.
TikTok may be the look of today, but cooking videos have captured our attention for decades, shaping how we eat along the way.
In the 1940s and '50s ...
they emerged as instructional television shows on local stations hosted by cooks like Julia Child and Joyce Chen. These shows were meant to educate above all, and many were "almost sterile in tone," said Ashley Rose Young, a food historian at the Smithsonian Institution.
In the 1990s ...
an entire channel devoted to cooking emerged: the Food Network. Shows like "Emeril Live," "Good Eats" and "East Meets West" brought both instruction and personality, and were filmed in studios with state-of-the-art kitchens and cameras that could capture the carefully styled glisten of a roast chicken. Food Network popularized the idea of celebrity chefs, who were as charismatic as they were good at cooking.
In the early 2000s ...
the arrival of YouTube allowed anyone to upload a clip to the internet in the hopes of going viral. Many of the tropes that are widespread on social media now -- like recreating dishes from movies, making outrage-inducing portions of calorie-laden foods and creating cake-decorating tutorials -- got their start on YouTube.
Starting in 2015 ...
hostless cooking videos shot from overhead -- or "hands-and-pans" clips -- put viewers across Facebook and Instagram in the driver's seat. Using little more than a stand and a camera, these videos were, critically, cheap to make, said John Gara, a former producer at BuzzFeed Tasty, which pioneered the style.
In 2016 ...
TikTok arrived in the United States, but Covid lockdowns in 2020 supercharged its use, as many Americans stuck at home began scrolling the app's algorithm-driven, hyper-personalized "For You" feed.
TikTok transformed videos into interactive two-way conversations with tools like Stitch and Duet, which allow you to combine other people's clips with videos of your own.
All of this benefited every category of video on TikTok -- but especially cooking videos. While television shows guided viewers through the entire cooking process and Instagram brimmed with stylish photos of the final dish, on TikTok, people could have both, said Sunny Xun Liu, a research scientist at the Stanford Social Media Lab.
"It changes the whole hourlong cooking process into 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds of entertainment -- consumable pieces," she said. "The product and process become one video that is entertaining, appealing and satisfying. That is what makes these videos so engaging."
Today, there isn't just one way to make a successful cooking video. What matters most is not creating a delicious, foolproof recipe, but grabbing someone's attention immediately.
On TikTok, three styles of video define the genre.
The Turbocharged M.C.
An energetic host injects every slice and sauté with personality.
"They are in a nice Hedley & Bennett apron or denim or black," said Hetal Vasavada, who has 54,000 followers on her TikTok account, @milkandcardamom. "They will have their kitchen in the background. They will cook and talk and shove food in your face and bring the knife up and quick shots. But it is always like, 'This is the sexiest potato you will ever have,' and chop, chop, chop."
The Gentle Storyteller
A soft-spoken creator soothingly tells a winding story played over hands-and-pans clips.
Althea Brown, who runs the Caribbean food-focused TikTok account @metemgeeblog, recently started making more videos that feature her cooking set to the tune of her own voice recounting childhood memories. People, she said, "don't want to just feel like they are being fed some tasty creation and there is nothing connecting them to a broader story."
The Mad Scientist
A frenzied cook prepares Frankenfood designed to outrage.
These videos are made not for instruction, but for rage-baiting. "I feel like it has started to swing back to where it was in the early Facebook days, with this maniacal TikTok twist to it," said Mr. Gara. The mentality is, "I don't care if this is a good recipe, I am going to do it and people will watch the car crash."'
Are these videos still teaching us how to cook? It depends on your perspective.
The pressure to assemble a picture-perfect dinner is certainly less intense on TikTok than on, say, the Food Network. But the quality of a recipe doesn't matter as much on TikTok.
"People now want to buy into the human behind the camera rather than just the recipe," said Ahmad Alzahabi, who runs the TikTok account @thegoldenbalance.
But TikTok's algorithm doesn't reward originality, diversity or complexity. The thing that trending recipes -- like Baked By Melissa's green goddess salad dressing, or cottage cheese ice cream, or butter boards -- have in common is that they're "low-cost and easy to execute," said Ms. Liu, the social media research scientist.
That's the catch of going viral: The lowest common denominator will always prevail at the expense of innovation and individuality.
Cooking is such a personal, deeply human activity. But the evolution of cooking videos represents a broader shift: Algorithms and artificial intelligence increasingly drive everyday behaviors and can stifle creativity.
This can be discouraging to the very people whose videos we can't stop watching.
"It is democratizing but also narrowing the field down in a sense that you'll just see the same trend," said Ms. Vasavada of the @milkandcardamom account. "I don't want to see 100 versions of feta pasta."
Cooking videos began with a clear aim: to educate. If that's still the goal, they're not as effective, said Mr. Gara, the former BuzzFeed producer.
"We had a really cheesy but earnest desire to help people learn how to cook in some way and eat things that tasted good," he said. "We got so far away from that."

Full text: Amazon's meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, known as "last rites" meetings, are typically a final step before the agency votes on filing a lawsuit.
Amazon is scheduled to meet with members of the Federal Trade Commission next week to discuss an antitrust lawsuit that the agency may be preparing to file to challenge the power of the retailer's sprawling business, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.
The meetings are set to be held with Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, who are F.T.C. commissioners, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
The meetings signal that the F.T.C. is nearing a decision on whether to move forward with a lawsuit alleging that Amazon has violated antimonopoly laws. Such discussions are sometimes known as "last rites" meetings, named after the prayers some Christians receive on their deathbed. The conversations, which are usually one of the final steps before the agency's commissioners vote on a lawsuit, give the company a chance to make its case.
If the F.T.C. files suit, it would be one of the most significant challenges to Amazon's business in the company's nearly 30-year history. Amazon, a $ 1.4 trillion behemoth, has become a major force in the economy. It now owns not just its trademark online store, but the movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the primary care practice One Medical and the high-end grocery chain Whole Foods. It is also one of the world's largest provider of cloud computing services.
The F.T.C. has investigated Amazon's business for years. The company's critics and competitors have argued that the once-upstart online bookstore has used its retailing clout to squeeze the merchants that use its platform to sell their wares.
U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the influence and reach of giant tech companies like Amazon, Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. The Justice Department has filed several antitrust lawsuits against Google, with two scheduled to go to trial next month. The F.T.C. has also sued Meta over accusations that it snuffed out young competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp.
Some of those efforts have stumbled in the courts. Federal judges declined this year to stop Meta from acquiring a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, dooming F.T.C. challenges to both deals. In 2022, the Justice Department also lost its bid to challenge UnitedHealth Group's plan to buy a health tech company.
Stacy Mitchell, a co-executive director of the advocacy organization Institute for Local Self-Reliance and an Amazon critic, said she hoped the F.T.C. would pursue a sweeping case against the tech giant. She said the agency should focus on how Amazon's control of the retail business -- from its store to its logistics network that delivers packages -- let it hurt competitors and merchants.
"It's a watershed moment," she said. "What we need to see from the F.T.C. is a case that targets the core of Amazon's monopolization strategy."
Amazon has said that it competes aggressively with other retailers and that efforts to regulate its business would only hurt consumers and the businesses that sell products through its site.
Under the leadership of Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, the retailer has recently been in retrenchment mode. The company has cut costs, laying off thousands of workers as growth slumped after a soaring period fueled by the pandemic. Last week, Amazon announced that its revenue in the second quarter of the year had increased 11 percent, to $ 134.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations.
In June, the F.T.C. sued Amazon in a separate case that accused the company of tricking users into subscribing to its Prime fast-shipping membership program and then making it difficult for them to cancel.
Amazon has also faced scrutiny from states and regulators in other countries. The District of Columbia's attorney general filed a lawsuit against the company in 2021, arguing that it had used unfair pricing policies against merchants on its site. The lawsuit was thrown out by a judge, though the attorney general has tried to revive the case. California filed a similar lawsuit last year that is moving forward. In December, Amazon also reached a deal to end a European Union antitrust investigation by agreeing to change some of its practices.
If the F.T.C. sues, it would formally pit Ms. Khan -- who has been one of Amazon's most prominent detractors -- against the company.
While a law student at Yale, Ms. Khan had argued that Amazon's growth represented a failure of American antitrust laws, which she said had become myopically focused on consumer prices as a measure of whether businesses were violating the law. Amazon's prices were often low, she wrote in a widely read 2017 paper, but that failed to account for other ways it could bully players across the economy.
The paper's success supercharged a debate in Washington about the power of the tech giants. In 2019, federal antitrust regulators decided to investigate some of the companies. In keeping with a longstanding practice of dividing responsibilities, the Justice Department agreed to look at Google and Apple while the F.T.C. examined Facebook and Amazon.
President Biden named Ms. Khan chair to oversee the F.T.C. -- giving her control of the Amazon investigation -- roughly two years later.

Full text: Putin's Forever War
Through towering pine forests and untouched meadows, the road to Lake Baikal in southern Siberia winds past cemeteries where bright plastic flowers mark the graves of Russians killed in Ukraine. Far from the Potemkin paradise of Moscow, the war is ever visible.
On the eastern shore of the lake, where white-winged gulls plunge into the steel-blue water, Yulia Rolikova, 35, runs an inn that doubles as a children's summer camp. She is some 3,500 miles from the front, yet the war reverberates in her family and in her head.
"My ex-husband wanted to go fight -- he claimed it was his duty," she said. "I said, 'No, you have an 8-year-old daughter, and it's a much more important duty to be a father to her."'
"People are dying there in Ukraine for nothing," she said.
He finally understood and stayed, she told me, with a look that said: Mine is just another ordinary Russian life. That is to say the life of a single mother in a country with one of the highest divorce rates in the world, a nation plunged into an intractable war, fighting a neighboring state that President Vladimir V. Putin deemed a fiction, where tens of millions of Russians, like herself, have ties of family, culture and history.
I spent a month in Russia, a country almost as large as the United States and Canada combined, searching for clues that might explain its nationalist lurch into an unprovoked war and its mood more than 17 months into a conflict conceived as a lightning strike, only to become a lingering nightmare. The war, which has transformed the world as radically as 9/11 did, has now taken 200,000 lives since Feb. 24, 2022, roughly split between the two sides, American diplomats in Moscow estimate.
As I traveled from Siberia to Belgorod on Russia's western border with Ukraine, across the vertigo-inducing vastness that informs Russian assertiveness, I found a country uncertain of its direction or meaning, torn between the glorious myths that Mr. Putin has cultivated and everyday struggle.
Along the way, I encountered fear and fervid bellicosity, as well as stubborn patience to see out a long war. I found that Homo sovieticus, far from dying out, has lived on in modified form, along with habits of subservience. So with the aid of relentless propaganda on state television, the old Putin playbook -- money, mythmaking and menace of murder -- has just about held.
But I also heard ambivalent voices like Ms. Rolikova's, along with a few raised in outright dissent, especially from young people in a country with a stark generational divide.
It was this restiveness, this impatience with the seeming incoherence of the war and with the insouciance of the privileged in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that formed the backdrop to the short-lived revolt led by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner group, in late June. It was not for nothing that he named his uprising the "march for justice."
"That Prigozhin rebelled was symptomatic of many social problems, but the way he advanced toward Moscow unhindered also demonstrated nervousness about whether all army units would fight," said Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. "Putin clearly did not want to give an order to fire he was unsure would be implemented."
Making a martyr of Mr. Prigozhin was too risky in the short term for other reasons, too. Wagner's role in avoiding recourse to an unpopular draft, by recruiting many thousands of criminals to bear the brunt of much heavy fighting in Ukraine, has been crucial. If Mr. Putin, 70, did not blink, he certainly flinched.
Yet, after 23 years leading Russia, Mr. Putin's hold on power is still firm as fighting intensifies in southern and eastern Ukraine. He learned long ago, indeed from the outset of his rule in 2000, that, as the author Masha Gessen has put it, "wars were almost as good as crackdowns because they discredited anyone who wanted to complicate things."
He has always used war -- in Chechnya, in Georgia and in Ukraine -- to unite Russians in the simplistic myths of nationalism and to usher them to the simplistic conclusion that his increasingly repressive rule is so essential that it must be eternal.
Still, as far as possible, the war must be invisible, banished to places like Ulan-Ude, near Lake Baikal, not far from the Mongolian border. That is done, in part, by paying recruits about $ 2,500 a month, a huge sum in a region where a monthly salary of $ 500 is more typical.
"Money is the main reason people go to fight," Ms. Rolikova said. "The contracts being offered volunteers are crazy by our standards."
But all of the money that Mr. Putin showers on remotest Russia only brings the war into sharper relief. It is etched in the fearful faces of young recruits lining up at the airport for flights to Moscow, and from there overland to Rostov-on-Don and into Ukraine. It is in the freshly turned soil of cemeteries where young men are laid to rest. It is in the air, a pall of dread.
The life partner of Ms. Rolikova's best friend was killed in Ukraine in February, leaving the friend with two young children. Her half brother has fled to Georgia. Her grandfather was from the Donetsk region of Ukraine, a family tie that compounds her anguish.
Ms. Rolikova gazed out at the vast shimmering lake that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water. The wind was suddenly up; the gulls beat their wings hard against it to hold still. She said she tried to derive wisdom from nature, finding in it a refuge from the turmoil of war.
For her daughter Valeriya's sake, at least, Ms. Rolikova hopes the war will be over within two years. "We are told one truth, they are told another truth," she said. "But why do we need to kill each other like in World War I?"
Moscow's New Czar
In Moscow, a world away from Ulan-Ude, Western sanctions appear to have had little effect beyond stores like Dior that have signs saying, "Closed for technical reasons," and the comical renaming of departed Western businesses, like "Stars," for Starbucks.
The subway is spotless; restaurants offering a popular Japanese-Russian fusion cuisine overflow; people make contactless payments for most things using their phones; there is a ridiculous concentration of luxury cars; the internet functions impeccably, as it does in all of Russia.
The war is nowhere to be seen, other than in the billboards from the Ministry of Defense and, until recently, Mr. Prigozhin's Wagner Group (now of uncertain future) that try to lure recruits with slogans like, "Heroes are not born, they become heroes."
These may be found next to a multitude of new high-rise developments with English names like "Trendy Towers" or "High Life." For all of Mr. Putin's efforts to vilify the West, it still lives in the Russian imagination as a chimera of cool.
I first visited Moscow four decades ago, when it was a city devoid of primary colors eking out existence in the penury of Communism. Gazing at Moscow today, it is possible to discern why Mr. Putin earned so much respect from his countrymen. He opened Russia, only to slam it shut to the West; he also modernized it, while leaving the thread to Russia's past unbroken.
Sitting at a cafe overlooking the Patriarch's Ponds in one of the toniest areas of central Moscow, Pyotr Tolstoy, a deputy chairman of the State Duma and a direct descendant of the great novelist Leo Tolstoy, exuded confidence as a moneyed crowd ate large crab claws and other delicacies.
When I asked him how Russia proposed to pay for a prolonged war effort, he shot back: "We pay for it all from our sales of oil to Europe via India."
This was bravado, but it had some truth to it. Russia has rapidly adjusted to the loss of European markets with oil sales to Asia -- and India has sold some of it on to Europe in refined form.
"Our values are different," Mr. Tolstoy said. "For Russians, freedom and economic factors are secondary to the integrity of our state and the safeguarding of the Russian world."
Mr. Putin's rule is all about the reconstitution of this imagined Russian world, or "Russkiy mir," a revanchist myth built around the idea of an eternal Russian cultural and imperial sphere of which Ukraine -- its decision to become an independent state never forgiven -- is an integral part.
As for the future, Mr. Putin has very little to say, leaving people guessing.
Rarely in Moscow or elsewhere in Russia is Mr. Putin's image visible, other than on television, even if he has ventured out a little more of late. He governs from the shadows, unlike Stalin, whose portrait was everywhere. There is no cult of the leader of the kind Fascist systems favored. Yet mystery has its own magnetism. The reach of Mr. Putin's power touches all.
It is evident in the bodyguards bursting into upscale Moscow restaurants to make room for some capo or oligarch of a system where great wealth comes only at the price of unwavering loyalty to the president.
Above all, it is in the fear that causes people to lower voices and hesitate before uttering that treacherous word of Mr. Putin's double-think -- "war."
The Kremlinology of the Cold War has been replaced by the equally arduous pursuit of trying to penetrate the utter opacity of the Kremlin to read the mind of a new czar, Mr. Putin, now in the autumn of his rule.
Repression has become fierce and the war Mr. Putin started in Ukraine has been waged with near total unconcern for the consequences of his decision, a human trait that John le Carré once described as "a primary qualification for psychopathy."
Putinism is a postmodern compilation of contradictions. It combines mawkish Soviet nostalgia with Mafia capitalism, devotion to the Orthodox Church with the spread of broken families, ferocious attacks on a "unipolar" American world with revived Russian imperialist aggression -- all held together by the ruthless suppression of dissident voices and recourse to violence when necessary.
An increasingly disarming phenomenon in Russia is that it looks familiar to an American or a European, yet it is not. It is "operating on a different software," as Pierre Lévy, the French ambassador, put it to me. The definition of state secrets keeps shifting.
I was advised to accept no document, unless it was a menu, and even then, to use a QR code to order food whenever possible.
Putin's True Believers
Five time zones away from Moscow, a dilapidated Soviet-era coal-burning power station belches smoke over the corrugated-iron roofs of modest wooden homes in Ulan-Ude. A bust of Lenin's head, the world's largest at 42 tons, still towers over the central square of this city of more than 400,000 people.
Now, this quiet capital of Russia's Buryatia Republic, a center of aircraft and helicopter production that was closed to foreigners during the Cold War, finds itself enmeshed in another war against the West, whose roots lie in the breakup of Lenin's Soviet Union.
Aleksandr Vasilyev, 59, an economist, was about to return to the distant front for a second tour, having signed one of those $ 2,500 contracts with the Ministry of Defense.
Last December, a Ukrainian shell killed his closest friend, Viktor Prilukov, near Soledar, in eastern Ukraine. Days later, Mr. Vasilyev was blown into the air by a grenade. "I am not a very good bird," he said. He returned to Siberia with a shattered shoulder, now largely healed.
"Of course, the money is nice, but it's not the main reason for going again," said Mr. Vasilyev, a vigorous man who makes regular use of the weights on the floor of his Soviet-era apartment.
"I fight out of duty to the motherland," he said. "Our grandfathers went all the way to Berlin in 1945 to ensure we not have an enemy country next door. We won't allow America to install that."
As Mr. Vasilyev spoke, a clock with the faces of Mr. Putin and his servile sometime stand-in, Dmitri A. Medvedev, stared down at him from the wall of his kitchen.
"My mother gave me the clock 10 years ago because she thought I criticized them too much!" he said. "You know, our usual Russian grumbling, taxes and corruption. We criticize -- the czars, Stalin and his gulag, Yeltsin -- and we accept."
Others' embrace of the war is still more ardent. Nikolai Vorodnikov, 44, invited me to his garage where he repairs and readies vehicles to be sent to the front. About 100 SUVs and trucks have already made their way from his Siberian garage to Ukraine.
He himself fought in Mariupol, a Ukrainian city pulverized by Russian forces. In April 2022, as he stormed the main administration building there, Mr. Vorodnikov took two bullets to his chest. He recuperated for many months back in Ulan-Ude after receiving emergency care.
Like Mr. Putin, he believes that the 10th-century Kievan Rus -- comprising territory that partially overlapped with today's Ukraine -- was the birthplace of modern Russia and that the region has always constituted the inalienable borderlands of greater Russia. Russia and Ukraine are "one body," he says.
"The body has a tumor -- it is in Ukraine, and we have to cure it," he told me. "The tumor comes from Americans who go places they have no need to go. Our task is clear and will be accomplished, justice restored, fascism defeated."
I asked him about Mr. Putin. "He was sent to Russia by God," he said.
The Magic Solution
In a time of terror, the great mass is enthusiastic, compliant, calculating or cowed. A few brave people, by contrast, move to an inner compass.
The problems of Yevgeny Vlasov, 39, started late last year when he began posting critical commentary on Vkontakte, or VK, a Russian version of Facebook.
A tall, lean man with a disarming frankness and fearlessness, Mr. Vlasov, an electrical engineer in Ulan-Ude, posted a graphic from an opposition website illustrating the war's toll.
It showed that for every Muscovite who dies in the war, 87.5 people die in Dagestan, Russia's southernmost republic; 275 people in Buryatia, where he lives; and 350 people in Tuva, home to an Asian minority and the poorest region of Russia.
In contrast to all the recruitment billboards, whose images are almost exclusively of white ethnic Russians, a disproportionate number of those dying at the front come from Russia's ethnic minorities, a pattern confirmed by Mediazona, among other independent news outlets. That was Mr. Vlasov's point.
His friends told him to stop posting. He paid no attention. As a nobody, he thought nobody would be interested in his antiwar videos.
Mr. Vlasov's friends, most of whom admire Mr. Putin, asked him when he had last watched TV. He replied: "I stopped watching 10 years ago. It's all garbage. And that's why I have a different view."
What view is that?
"I have been angry," he said. "I just did not understand why we had to attack Ukraine last year. There was no normal reason."
The president, Mr. Vlasov argued, had lost his bearings. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 went so smoothly that Mr. Putin thought eliminating Ukraine would be easy.
"The only problem," Mr. Vlasov said, "was that Ukraine was preparing all this time, while Putin's cronies were stealing billions all this time, which is why our soldiers were scrounging for socks."
Mr. Vlasov thought for a moment. "Putin is a thief," he said. "The war in Ukraine has shown Russians how much money has disappeared to build his palaces."
Last December, a police officer called and ordered Mr. Vlasov to report to the local police station. Mr. Vlasov demanded the reason. None was given. He went anyway and was asked if the social media page containing the criticism of the war was his. He said it was.
The police compiled a report saying that he had admitted guilt -- he had not -- and that he would be fined 60,000 rubles, or about $ 630, and be imprisoned if he did it a second time.
Mr. Vlasov hired a lawyer, Nadezhda Nizovkina, who has been active in the political opposition in Ulan-Ude. "I fight for freedom of speech, but I also fight against all that is going on," she told me. "Under the Constitution, my client should be free to post what he wants."
Over the past six months, Mr. Vlasov has appeared in court three times. His fine was eventually halved, then dropped in April, but he has not received any official communication that the case is closed.
With his children aged 10, 9, 4 and 2, Mr. Vlasov wants to leave Russia. He sees no future for the family in Ulan-Ude. His dream is to become an electrician in California; he thinks his wife could find a job in a nail salon.
"Putin has been in power so long that children do not ask who the next president will be, they ask who the next Putin will be," he said. "That is not a good thing."
Mr. Vlasov recalled going in 2021 to a demonstration in support of Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader who was sentenced this week to a further 19 years in prison under brutal conditions. "There were lots of people protesting," he said. "Support for Putin was down."
Two years on, some of his friends who protested are now supporters of Mr. Putin, a change he attributes to "this magic solution brought about by the war!"
We agreed to meet the next day at the Southern Cemetery, a 40-minute drive from Ulan-Ude, in a pine forest. There is no more room in the cemeteries in the city center.
We strolled through the vast burial ground, past scrawny stray dogs and picnic tables and large bouquets of multicolored plastic flowers glinting in the sunlight around newly dug graves of soldiers.
An entire section of the cemetery is given over to Ulan-Ude's dead in the war.
An old couple was preparing a grave, shoveling the earth and beating it back down. A level lay on the ground next to the headstone they were about to place.
I asked who they were burying.
"Our grandson."
How old was he?
"Nineteen."
What happened?
"Ukraine happened."
The headstone read: Andrei Malykh, born May 4, 2003, died Oct. 31, 2022.
As I read it, their daughter approached, threatening to call the ubiquitous Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., if the conversation continued.
Refighting an Old War
The celebration of the centennial of the Buryatia Republic was held on May 30 at the ornate Ulan-Ude opera house beneath a frescoed ceiling of Soviet planes with red stars and a Soviet flag emblazoned with Lenin's image.
The governor, Aleksei S. Tsydenov, of Mr. Putin's United Russia party, spoke for a half-hour, extolling the 39,000 Buryats who died in World War II. He then honored eight local soldiers of the current war already elevated to the status of "Hero of Russia."
The whole theater rose to applaud the pinning of medals on the lapels of three of these heroes, as well as on the lapels of several veterans of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945.
It was a perfect image of the far-fetched fusion of the two wars that Mr. Putin has sought to engineer.
"Today, the role of conquerors of Nazism is played again by a new generation," Mr. Tsydenov declared. "Our army will win. During all the stages of history there were those who wished evil on us. But we overcame all obstacles."
A theatrical performance, of stylized Soviet influence, followed, including an all-male dance troupe that gyrated to a hymn to coal production, slashing their arms downward as they sang: "YES! YES! COAL PRODUCTION IS ON OUR SHOULDERS AND ALL RUSSIA IS BEHIND US!"
Outside, the mood was less exultant.
Salaries averaging a few hundred dollars a month mean a hardscrabble existence for many.
Irina Kontsova's two daughters, 7 and 9, learned on TV of the death of their father, Maksim Kontsov, 33, last year in Ukraine. She had found herself unable to tell them. Her older daughter, Margarita, was back from school early and saw a TV announcement that her father had received a Gold Star Hero of Russia award.
We drove to the high school where the couple first met. A plaque is newly affixed to the facade. It commemorates the heroism of Mr. Kontsov, killed in a distant land in service to an aging leader's obsession.
Ms. Kontsova, a forestry expert, stood beside the plaque. "You cannot break the Russian people," she said. "Especially Russian women."
Watching her, all I could think of was the waste, the fatherless children, the poisonous bequest of tangled history, and all of those medals handed out to glorify the bloody sacrifice of war.
'A Tower of Silence'
To reach the Moscow office of Dmitri A. Muratov, the Nobel Prize-winning editor of the shuttered independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, you walk past the office of Anna Politkovskaya, murdered by the Putin regime in 2006 for her reporting on Russian human rights abuses in Chechnya.
Her typewriter sits on her desk, along with her glasses and notes and a book with a title that sums up the impunity of the Putin era: "History of an Inconclusive Investigation."
You walk on past the photographs of six other Novaya journalists killed since 2000. In different ways, they had adhered to a maxim of the great wartime photographer, Robert Capa, that Mr. Muratov cited in his Nobel acceptance speech: "If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough."
Mr. Muratov, 61, sits in an office featuring a photograph of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the leader now reviled by many Russians, who rejected Communism in favor of free speech, free enterprise and open borders.
His restructuring and openness -- perestroika and glasnost -- of the late 1980s led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union and, peacefully and fleetingly, brought a divided Europe together in liberty. In the photograph, Mr. Gorbachev, who died last year, holds an egg.
"He was very careful with live things," Mr. Muratov tells me. "He was a farmer. He valued life. Now, in our state, death is more important than life."
The past 17 months have resembled a funeral march. The government closed down Novaya, along with most independent media, soon after the war began. A branch of the paper, Novaya Gazeta Europe, now publishes in Riga, Latvia. Mr. Muratov stayed on in Russia, a country "where truth is now a crime," as he put it.
The truth speakers -- Mr. Navalny, the outspoken Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, the war critic Ilya Yashin, the theater director Yevgeniya Berkovich, the playwright Svetlana Petriychuk and countless other writers and poets -- are all in prison.
"We are the suffocated society," Mr. Muratov says. "Russia has become a tower of silence."
Nobody, he argues, knows what the country really thinks. All that is known is that the older generation believes in Mr. Putin with a religious passion.
As for the young, up to one million of the best and the brightest have left since the war began. These young Russians, Mr. Muratov tells me, did not want to kill or be killed. They did not think that glory was attained through bloodshed. If anything, they believe glory lies in art and intellect. To replace them will take a generation or more, he believes.
There are angry young people in Russia, too.
In the Belgorod region, close to Russia's western border with Ukraine, where Ukrainian cross-border attacks have forced thousands of Russians to flee their homes, I met Ilya Kostyukov, 19.
He was thrown out of college last year for his opposition to the war but learned enough about the law to work as what he called a "lawyer," mainly helping Russians desperate to avoid or leave the war's front.
"We put an F.S.B. guy at the top of the government, we allowed bandits to operate and rule, we thought whatever went wrong could be rectified in an election," Mr. Kostyukov said, "but it was too late when people started to realize -- and here we are!"
Beneath the surface of Russian life, a stark generational conflict lurks. It is unclear when it will erupt, but it seems possible that one day it will.
In Moscow, I asked Mr. Muratov what drove Mr. Putin to his reckless invasion of Ukraine.
"He developed utter contempt for the West," Mr. Muratov said. "All these leaders and politicians would come to Moscow and go to Politkovskaya's grave in the morning, and talk about human rights with representatives of civil society, and then they would go see Mr. Putin and sign deals for oil and gas."
"After they left office," he said, "Mr. Putin would buy them -- former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, former French Prime Minister François Fillon -- they were all happy to take Putin's money. So he concluded all this Western talk of values was garbage."
Mr. Putin, in Mr. Muratov's view, also reached another conclusion: Western powers had exploited a period of post-Soviet Russian weakness to undermine the glory of the Red Army that had fought its way to Hitler's Berlin in 1945. In effect, the West had insulted the 27 million Soviets lost to the war, among them Mr. Putin's older brother. His father was badly injured.
The West did so by expanding NATO east toward Russia's borders, a broken pledge in Mr. Putin's view.
"So Putin decided to win the already finished World War II," Mr. Muratov said. "He resolved to protect the result of that war. That is why we are told we are fighting Nazis and Fascists."
The miraculous bloodless end of Soviet totalitarian Communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 were not bloodless after all.
A New State Ideology
For Mr. Putin, the war has expanded in character, becoming the culmination of a civilizational war against the West. It may unfold in Ukraine, but Moscow's enemies lie beyond.
The United States, Europe and NATO are now consistently identified as sources of "outright Satanism," in the recent words of Sergei Naryshkin, the director of Russia's foreign intelligence service.
Being ideological, the war is doubly intractable. "There are currently no grounds for an agreement," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman, told me. "We will continue the operation for the foreseeable future."
Anti-Western invective has attained phantasmagorical proportions. It is part of an emergent state ideology that is setting a course for possibly decades of confrontation.
Thirty years after Russia -- in the midst of the ardent liberal hopes of the 1990s -- adopted a Constitution whose Article 13 said, "No ideology shall be proclaimed as State ideology," Mr. Putin's Russia is hurtling toward a new official ideology of conservative values.
The possibility of an amendment rescinding Article 13 has been raised by the justice minister, Konstantin Chuychenko, among others.
This anti-Western ideology is based around the Orthodox Church, the fatherland, the family and the "priority of the spiritual over the material," as laid out in Mr. Putin's decree on spiritual and moral values issued in November.
The enemy, it proclaims, is the United States and "other unfriendly foreign states," intent on the cultivation of "selfishness, permissiveness, immorality, the denial of the ideals of patriotism" and "destruction of the traditional family through the promotion of nontraditional sexual relations."
If the West was portrayed during the Cold War as the nightmarish home of ruthless capitalism, it is now, as Russia sees it, the home of sex changes, the rampages of drag queens, barbaric gender debates and an L.G.B.T.Q. takeover.
"For how long should Russia tolerate open warfare from the West using Ukrainian meat?" Sergei Karaganov, a well-connected Russian foreign policy expert, asked in an interview.
"There is a high risk of nuclear war, and it is increasing," he said. "The war is a prolonged Cuban missile crisis, but this time with Western leaders who reject normal values of motherhood, parenthood, gender, love of country, faith, God."
This scarcely veiled Russian nuclear threat is part of a relentless onslaught against the West. From late March to May, Russia signaled that a new phase of outright confrontation had begun.
In the first arrest of a foreign correspondent since the Cold War, Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal was detained on charges of espionage that are vehemently denied by the United States government and his newspaper. Four months on, he languishes in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.
The Anglo-American School of Moscow, an institution at the core of Russian-American cooperation for almost 75 years, shut down for good on May 12 after a court ruling and charges by a local newspaper that it was propagating L.G.B.T.Q. values.
Mr. Putin will no doubt use this ideological onslaught and the war in Ukraine relentlessly in the run-up to Russia's next presidential election, in March 2024. His re-election, nearly inevitable, would be for a renewable six-year term.
"Our presidential election is not really democracy, it is costly bureaucracy," said Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. "Mr. Putin will be re-elected next year with more than 90 percent of the vote."
The only time that Mr. Putin's popularity plunged was last September when a partial mobilization was ordered. "We saw the biggest overnight drop in support for Mr. Putin in 30 years of polling," Denis Volkov, the director of Levada Center, the only major independent pollster in Russia, told me in Moscow. "Suddenly the war was here!"
Mr. Putin's approval rating fell to around 50 percent from 80 percent, according to Levada, which focuses on door-to-door polling. Support for Mr. Putin has since returned to around 80 percent, in so far as polling can be trusted in the current environment.
By insisting, against all evidence, that Ukraine is a nation run by Fascists and Nazis, and by suggesting that the West wants Ukraine to be another home of gender-transitioning moral decay, Mr. Putin has successfully turned a war of aggression into a defensive war, essential to save Russia from those intent on ripping apart its physical and moral fabric.
"What we see is not the measured language of an establishment in power for decades," said Mr. Baunov, the fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. "It has the ardor of revolutionaries, and it emanates from a major world power with a nuclear arsenal."
Putin, the Romantic
A mirror effect is at work in this late Putin era. The accusations he levels at the West and Ukraine -- aggression, fascism, nuclear threats -- become his own actions. Russian-pulverized Mariupol in Ukraine in 2023 looks like nothing so much as Nazi-pulverized Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in 1943.
The vindictive fever churning inside the Russian leader came to a head on the eve of the war in Ukraine. The loss of Crimea, in particular, as the Soviet Union broke up was a festering wound because of the widespread Russian sentiment that it is a core part of the country's history.
"Putin was obsessed with justice, as he saw it," said Aleksei A. Venediktov, whose popular Echo of Moscow radio station was shut down soon after the war began. "He told me in 2014, 'You might not like the annexation of Crimea, but it's just."'
Mr. Venediktov says he knows Mr. Putin well. He believes everyone, himself included, got the Russian leader wrong.
"We did not see the Putin who was on a historical mission of revenge," he told me. "We thought he was a corrupt guy from a poor family who wanted yachts and palaces and girls and money. We did not see the K.G.B. officer who thought the loss of the Soviet Union was unjust. We thought he was a cynic. In fact, he was a romantic."
Nationalism is not fascism, but it is an essential component of it. Its perennial essence is a promise to change the present in the name of an illusory past in order to forge a future vague in all respects except its glory.
"History for Putin is an instrument to shape current events. He is absolutely uninterested in historical truth," said Oleg Orlov, a leading human rights activist for more than three decades at the head of Memorial, which was shut down in 2021.
Mr. Orlov, 70, is now on trial for "public actions aimed at discrediting the use of Russian Federation armed forces." He faces up to three years in prison.
For years, Mr. Putin's regime has deployed all means to re-energize and redirect history. "My History" theme parks spread, to remind Russians of their heroism, from resistance to the Mongols in the 13th century until the Nazi invasion. Children are indoctrinated through lessons and extracurricular activities built around military themes.
The march of millions of Russians carrying images of their dead forbears in parades across the country became a feature of the May 9 Victory Day celebration, marking the Russian triumph in the Great Patriotic War. This year, however, in a subdued ceremony, these so-called Immortal Regiment events were dropped.
"Perhaps there was a fear in the Kremlin that someone would march with a photograph of a son killed in Ukraine," Géza Andreas von Geyr, the departing German ambassador to Russia, told me.
At the beginning of the war last year, Mr. Orlov stood alone on Red Square with a banner saying, "1945: A country victorious over fascism. 2022: A country where fascism is victorious."
He told me that there were now two options. The first was that Mr. Putin would be replaced somehow, and that a period of reform would start, as under Khrushchev after Stalin.
"The second option, which is more realistic, is that the regime stays in place and Russia will be slowly dying," Mr. Orlov said. "It will fall behind other countries, and to make this regime stable, the level of repression will rise."
Mr. Putin almost certainly has enough of his country, and enough cash, behind him to pursue the war for at least another 18 months to two years, three Western ambassadors to Russia told me in Moscow.
I asked Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, if Russia sought more Ukrainian territory beyond the four provinces annexed.
"No," he said. "We just want to control all the land we have now written into our Constitution as ours."
Russia Turns in its Gyre
The fishery museum on Lake Baikal, a wooden building that has partly subsided into the water, is officially closed. But Ms. Rolikova, the innkeeper, thought it was important to see it, and so she opened the padlocked door to reveal a palimpsest of Russia over the past century.
Scattered here and there were barrels in which salted fish once lay, sleds, nets, benches and faded photographs of fishermen headed out in wooden boats onto the immense lake. I was reminded of the observation of Roland Barthes, the French philosopher, that in every old photograph lurks catastrophe.
Soviet posters from the time of the Great Patriotic War adorned the walls: "Big Fish to the Front Line!" "The Duty of Every Fisherman is to Exceed the Plan!"
A vision of vats of salted fish being hauled across thousands of miles of Russian steppe to nourish the Red Army battling its way to Hitler's Berlin seemed to capture the immensity of the Soviet resolve and sacrifice that Mr. Putin insists he must honor through yet more war.
"Nobody came and asked us: Do we want this war or do we not?" Ms. Rolikova said.
On the road back to Ulan-Ude from Lake Baikal, the toll of Mr. Putin's war to reverse history was inescapable.
In one cemetery lay Andrei Mezhov, a Marine, born in 2000 and killed on March 6, 2022, in Ukraine. He was from the nearby town of Talovka, had studied at the Baikal State University and served in the army in Vladivostok.
A Marine flag flapped in the wind above a bouquet of flowers. On it was the Marines' motto, "Wherever we are, there lies victory."
On each visit I made to a cemetery to see the graves of the war dead, F.S.B. agents would park their car 50 meters away, a gentle reminder.
On my last day in Moscow, I went to the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge beneath the Kremlin. A small shrine marks the spot where Boris Y. Nemtsov, a towering opposition figure, was gunned down on Feb. 27, 2015 -- a flagrant political murder.
Somebody is always present at the shrine, watching over it, making sure there is a fresh bouquet of flowers. On this day, the task fell to Arkady Konikov, who told me: "Nemtsov was an honest politician, a very unusual thing. He was a brave man, a great man."
The year before Mr. Nemtsov died, almost a decade ago, as the Russian-instigated fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine began, he wrote on his Facebook page: "Putin has declared war on Ukraine. This is a fratricidal war. Russia and Ukraine will pay a high price for the bloody insanity of this mentally unstable secret-police agent. Young men will die on both sides. There will be inconsolable mothers and sisters."
More recently, just before Mr. Gorbachev's death on Aug. 30, 2022, Mr. Muratov, the Novaya editor, visited his friend as he lay in a Moscow hospital. The condition of the Soviet leader who decided to set Russians free, and whose funeral Mr. Putin would not attend, was grave. He could not understand much.
There was a big TV in his room. On it, playing over and over, were images of bombings and explosions in Ukraine. As Mr. Muratov left the room, he heard Mr. Gorbachev say: "Who could be happy because of this?"

Full text: The wife of Judge Jeffrey Ferguson of Orange County Superior Court was found fatally shot inside their Anaheim home on Thursday, the police said.
A Southern California judge was arrested on Thursday in connection with the killing of his wife, whom police officers found dead from a gunshot wound inside the couple's Anaheim home, the authorities said on Friday.
The judge, Jeffrey Ferguson, 72, of the Orange County Superior Court, was booked into the Anaheim Police Department's detention facility on Thursday and held on $ 1 million bail, the police said.
He posted bail on Friday and has been released, according to Orange County Sheriff's Department records.
The police responded around 8 p.m. on Thursday to reports of a shooting at a home in Anaheim, Calif., which is about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
Inside the house, officers found that Judge Ferguson's wife, Sheryl Ferguson, 65, had been fatally shot, the Anaheim Police Department said in a news release.
It is unclear what led up to the shooting, and the police did not immediately respond to calls for comment on Saturday night.
Photos taken outside the home where Ms. Ferguson was killed showed a beige house flanked by palm trees and bordered by crime scene tape. Another photo shows an official walking near the scene with two firearms in his hands.
As of Saturday night, Judge Ferguson had not been formally charged.
The Orange County District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Saturday night. The Orange County Superior Court was closed on Saturday and could not be reached for comment.
Judge Ferguson has been a staple in Orange County's legal community for years.
He received his law degree in 1982 from Western State College of Law in Irvine, Calif. He served as a county deputy district attorney starting in 1983, 10 years after graduating from the University of California, Irvine, with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences and social ecology, according to his biography.
He was named prosecutor of the year four times by the Orange County Narcotics Officers Association, according to his biography.
From 2012 to 2014, he was the president of the North Orange County Bar Association, and in 2014 he was elected as judge of the Superior Court of Orange County.
In 2017, Judge Ferguson was admonished by the California Commission on Judicial Performance because he posted a statement on Facebook about a candidate for judicial office with "knowing or reckless disregard for the truth of the statement," according to commission documents.
He was also admonished by the commission that year for "being Facebook friends with attorneys who were appearing regularly before him in court," the documents state.
The judge, the documents state, never disclosed that he was Facebook friends with three criminal defense lawyers who were often appearing before him in court, undermining the credibility of the court, the commission said.
He unfriended the lawyers on Facebook after the commission contacted him about the matter, according to the documents.

Cyberattack Sabotages Medical Sites In Four States: [National Desk]

Full text: It was not immediately clear how many locations operated by Prospect Medical Holdings were affected but some sites had to cut back services or close.
A ransomware attack this week on a California-based health care system forced some of its locations to close and left others to rely on paper records.
The system, Prospect Medical Holdings, which operates 16 hospitals and more than 165 clinics and outpatient centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Southern California, announced the cyberattack on Thursday.
A Prospect Medical spokesman could not estimate on Saturday when services would return to normal. It was not immediately clear how many of the system's sites were affected.
On its website, Eastern Connecticut Health Network, an affiliate of Prospect Medical, listed locations that would be closed until further notice, including a medical imaging center, an urgent care facility and an outpatient blood-draw center, among others.
CharterCARE Health Partners, a Rhode Island affiliate, said on Facebook Thursday that it had to reschedule some of its appointments and to revert to paper records. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that computers were also down at Crozer Health facilities in Delaware County.
"Prospect Medical Holdings, Inc. recently experienced a data security incident that has disrupted our operations," the company said in a statement on Saturday. "Upon learning of this, we took our systems offline to protect them and launched an investigation with the help of third-party cybersecurity specialists."
The company said it was focused on "addressing the pressing needs of our patients as we work diligently to return to normal operations as quickly as possible."
It did not provide details on the nature of the security breach.
Waterbury Hospital, in Waterbury, Conn., said on Saturday that it was continuing to have disruptions. It also said that some of its outpatient and diagnostic imaging services had not been available on Friday or Saturday. On Thursday, it said it was relying on paper records.
Cyberattacks on hospitals have become more common, said John Riggi, national adviser for cybersecurity and risk at the American Hospital Association.
In 2022, One Brooklyn Health, a hospital group that serves low-income neighborhoods in New York, was hit by a cyberattack that also forced staff members to use paper records. Employees said at the time that it was a learning curve, given that most hospitals have been using electronic records since the 1990s and that some diagnostic test results were coming back slower because of the cyberattack.
CommonSpirit Health, which has more than 140 hospitals and more than 700 care sites nationwide, was the target of a cyberattack last year that led to postponed surgeries, doctor visits and other delays in care, NBC reported. And in 2020, Russian hackers launched a ransomware attack on United Health Services, which has at least 400 facilities, making it the largest attack of its kind at the time.
Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, in part because the coronavirus pandemic brought many more health care services online, Mr. Riggi said.
"We're relying more on cloud-based services, remote third parties," Mr. Riggi said. "So all of these things are done with good intention -- ultimately to improve patient care and to save lives. But the unintended consequence of this is that it has expanded dramatically our digital attack surface."
Hospitals and clinics typically use third parties to write code and develop the technology for these systems, so it's imperative these third parties deliver secure technology, he said.

Audio Stories Are Redefining Female Pleasure: [Style Desk]

Full text: Apps like Dipsea and Quinn have become popular destinations, particularly for some women who find them safe spaces to explore their sexuality.
"You know, I'm a sucker for a California queen bed," Liz says to her girlfriend, Sevyn.
"I'm imagining us chillin' on that balcony," Sevyn says.
Liz laughs and responds, "Well, there's some other things I'm imagining too ..."
Liz and Sevyn are characters in "Open Floor Plan," a series on the audio erotica app Dipsea. Like mini podcasts but spicier, these stories detailing sexy scenarios fill the space between audio romance novels and visual pornography.
Since Dipsea began publishing at the end of 2018, a handful of similar apps have hit the market. While Dipsea's stories are narrated by voice actors and written in house, Quinn, another popular platform that launched in 2019, hires mostly content creators to produce the app's stories. Other platforms like OhCleo and Bloom use a combination of those formats.
"There's clearly this gap between what erotic content has traditionally meant and what women are looking for," said Caroline Spiegel (sister of Snap's chief executive, Evan), the founder of Quinn. "Now, there's a growing opportunity to give women products and services that fill their sexual needs, because they have their own money to spend."
Designed in sleek modern packages, these apps can easily be confused with those used for meditation, yoga or therapy -- an intentional marketing plan. Situating pleasure in a wellness wrapper has allowed them to exist on Apple's app store and Spotify, as well as advertise on Facebook and Instagram.
On average, subscribers for Dipsea are women between 18 and 34, the company said, while Quinn's are women aged 18 to 24. Dipsea said its revenue grew 40 percent last year, though it declined to provide specific figures. Quinn said the average listenership for the past three months had been 14 million minutes each month. ("For context, in all of 2021, we saw 3.2 million minutes listened," Ms. Spiegel said.)
Hannah Albertshauser and her husband, Michael, are the co-founders of Bloom, an erotic audio platform based in Germany. According to a survey they recently conducted, Bloom found that there were just as many users who enjoy romantic content as were interested in stories involving different kinks, partner sharing and bondage. Despite Mr. and Mrs. Albertshauser starting Bloom to create more guided sex options for couples, 40 percent of its listeners are single women and over half are between 18 and 34, according to the same survey.
Experts say that the biggest benefits of audio erotica are its ability for listeners to imagine and be in control of their own story.
"I tell clients and students, if you're constantly watching something, you're never getting to create your own fantasies, explore your erotic imagination and know what your boundaries are," said Mal Harrison, the executive director of the Center for Erotic Intelligence, a collective of researchers and educators who study human connection and sexuality. Audio erotica, she said, is a response to power imbalances and sexual domination often seen in visual pornography.
Before these apps existed, Reddit threads and the back alleys of Tumblr were often used to create erotic audio content particularly made by and for women.
"It felt like when you wanted accessibility to pleasure, it was in a brown paper bag down a dark alley," said Dominnique Karetsos, the chief executive and co-founder of Healthy Pleasure Group, which invests in sexual health and technology companies, including Dipsea. When she started investing in the space nearly 10 years ago, the market was limited, she added.
But by the early 2010s, Ms. Karetsos said, products made for women's pleasure were marketed through partnerships with retailers like Selfridges and Sephora. The accessibility to and demand for these items created "social permission," she said, for women to talk about pleasure openly.
Last year The New York Times reported that Facebook rejected numerous women's sexual health advertisements. In 2019, the sex toy company Dame sued the M.T.A. for banning its advertisements while those for erectile dysfunction medication remained.
Gina Gutierrez, who founded Dipsea with Faye Keegan, said that much of what set audio erotica apart was that it was marketed as sexual wellness, unlike conventional porn. "Female pleasure is seen as especially gratuitous and frivolous," she said. "We wanted people to feel like they were making a choice that was good for them."
'It's actually like a wellness practice'
Liv Trexler downloaded Dipsea in 2021 after seeing its advertisement on social media. "It was weird at first," she said. "But when I actually tried it, things went well, very well."
She now uses Dipsea regularly and said the $ 12.99 monthly subscriber fee was worth the cost. "It's not harmful to those who make it, and it's not a harmful thing to those who hear it," said Ms. Trexler, a 29-year-old project manager who lives in Brooklyn. "It's actually like a wellness practice."
Angela Sarakan, a senior audio producer at Dipsea, said that the dialogue featured in its podcasts could provide listeners the tools to set healthy boundaries. "You're listening in on the private worlds of these characters and, in that way, learning more about yourself and the way you might want to communicate or do things differently."
Audio erotica's emphasis on communication and boundary-setting has helped some users with anxiety around visual porn.
"It was very hard for me to extricate any idea of sex, especially casual sex, from feeling safe," said a 25-year-old woman who was a victim of sexual assault. The woman, who requested not to be identified by her full name, said audio erotica helped her reconnect with her body through imagination. "It helped me get out of my head a little bit in terms of self-consciousness, like comparing my movements and my body to people on the screen," she said. "It made me see how you could have your sex life as part of a creative, imaginary life that feels meaningful."
Olivia Taylor, the editorial lead of Dipsea, said the app's goal was to capture the "texture of life and the texture of sex." Dirty talk, moans and the ruffling of sheets are just some of the sounds you may hear on the app. Dipsea's characters are often written with enough specificity for listeners to relate to, but vague enough for them to imagine themselves inside the story.
"It might make you be like, 'Hey, wait, that's not me, this is some other person or some other body that doesn't feel like mine at all,"' Ms. Taylor said. The editorial team, she added, keeps this in mind as they edit.
Aisha Jordan, an actress and a spoken word artist, was among the first to audition as a voice actress for Dipsea in early 2019. She landed the role of Liz and has since narrated many other stories. "Sometimes you're breathing into a microphone for 20 seconds," she said. "Sometimes you have to do something like kiss your hand to get a more authentic sound."
Ms. Jordan receives a full character description and a story arc with each script. "It's not just a sexual moment. It's an experience," she said. "Especially for a woman of color to be able to do this, it's super exciting. It allows you to be seen as a full person and not just stereotypes."
Although sexual wellness is a growing industry, research on the subject is still met with skepticism.
"It's just highly stigmatized, more so than drugs," said Dr. Nicole Prause, a neuroscientist who studies how pleasure can be used as a treatment for chronic pain, anxiety, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. "I almost lost my graduate funding." She said she no longer uses the word "sexual" in research proposals.
Dr. Prause hopes audio erotica will help raise awareness of the positive, if not therapeutic, outcomes of sexual wellness, though she recognizes its limitations.
Ms. Taylor of Dipsea believes that the format can at least offer an alternative. "We're showing much more than a snapshot of sex," she said. "It's the whole story of how people connect."

Full text: A reader asks whether she should be more blunt about her wish for birthday and anniversary presents from a man who isn't the gift-giving type.
My boyfriend and I are two weeks away from the first anniversary of our meeting. We both lost longtime spouses within the last five years. I love him, and I believe he loves me, too. We're talking about moving in together. My disappointment with him involves gift-giving: He doesn't celebrate special days or want gifts or any acknowledgment. But I love giving and receiving presents! For my birthday, he took me to dinner, but otherwise made little effort. He offered to buy me a gift if I wanted something. (For his birthday, I made a special dinner and some homemade candy.) Also, he's had some health issues recently that have created extra work for me. I don't begrudge that, and he seems grateful, but an occasional gift or word of appreciation would be nice. Should I tell him I want a gift for our anniversary?
GIRLFRIEND
Some people say: What's the point of a gift (or a thank you) if you have to ask for it? I am not one of them. You and your boyfriend are still working out the terms of your relationship. Now seems like a perfect time to explain to him that small gifts and words of gratitude are your "love languages" (as pop psychology puts it). Clearly, they are not his, but that doesn't exempt him from trying to meet your needs -- or you, his.
Set him up to succeed. Tell him, too, about shops you like or friends with whom he can brainstorm about gifts. You don't have a problem, in my book, until you have expressed your needs and he still makes little effort. We owe it to our partners to help them understand what makes us tick.
Now, burying issues like these can often lead us to weird conclusions. There was not a material difference, in my view, in how you and your boyfriend celebrated each other's birthdays -- though you seem to think there was. (Apologies to your homemade candy.) Worse, without discussing the emotional significance that gifts and kind words hold for you, asking your boyfriend for them after caring for him during an illness may be misinterpreted as mercenary. So, explain your needs to him -- and ask about his. Very few of us are mind readers!
Not All Ink Is Meant for Reading
I don't have any tattoos, though many people clearly like this form of self-expression. I don't want to make assumptions, either. I don't know if a person has a tattoo so that others will notice it or to promote their own sense of self. What should I do, for example, if I am on an elevator with a stranger who has tattoos on her chest and arms: stare at her to read the tattoos or avert my eyes? Engage or ignore?
CONFUSED
You frame the question nicely: None of us can possibly know why strangers have tattoos (or elaborate hairstyles or smashing new bags). We also can't know whether those people like to be studied or complimented by strangers. (It makes many people uncomfortable.) So, the safest approach here is to smile benignly and move along -- keeping our sparkling observations and curiosity to ourselves.
Now, there are others who believe that society is enriched by engaging with strangers. And I rarely succeed in convincing them that comments about appearance are often unwelcome, and even compliments betray an unappealing entitlement to judge. "It's just a compliment!" they say. (Sigh.) So, choose your own path. But I would respect the privacy of strangers and engage with your tatted-up friends, instead.
The Water Cooler Is Not a Pickup Joint
My friend and I are summer interns in state government. We bonded over a mutual crush: We wait by his office and pretend we just ran into him. We invited him out once, but he canceled at the last minute. We also have a crush on his co-worker, who is older but just as cute. We seem to have hit a brick wall, though. How can we tell if they like us back when they are somewhat introverted and we are extroverted?
INTERN
It sounds as if you and your intern pal have uncovered one of the joys of 9-to-5 work: office crushes. Enjoy them in private. It's not cool (or professional) to sexualize co-workers or to prowl the office halls looking for flirty fun. Focus on your work at work, and then hit the apps (or the gym, or the bars) with your friend after hours. Leave the cute government employees alone!
The Case of the Odd, Meat-Avoiding Vegetarian
I am a vegetarian. I don't judge what others eat, and I never ask people to accommodate my diet. (There is no risk that I will starve!) But when my husband and I go out to dinner with friends, he often encourages me to order dishes with meat in them so that he and our friends can pick at them -- salads with bacon, for instance. Should I explain my philosophy better or just smile and go along with him?
SHARON
If you believe your husband is so dim that he doesn't understand what vegetarianism is or that dishes prepared with meat don't work for you, remind him. Otherwise, tell him to order a side of bacon for the table if he wants one. Your dinner is not a communal plate, and he should respect your choices.

Big Tech Rallies and Channels Its New Momentum Into A.I.: [Correction]

Full text: As the tech giants found their financial footing last quarter, they doubled down on artificial intelligence, which has been a boon to companies like Nvidia.
A year ago, the tech industry's prospects looked bleak. Google's profit dropped. Shares of Facebook's parent company, Meta, were in free fall. Business growth at Amazon had slowed to its lowest level in two decades.
But what looked like an industrywide bust appears to have been more of a correction. The most recent quarter was surprisingly strong for tech's biggest companies. Meta's and Google's ad businesses rebounded. Microsoft's cloud computing business continued to expand. So did Amazon's e-commerce business. Apple, with a 1 percent decline, was the only big tech company whose revenue dropped.
Still, the slump exposed a weakness: The world's largest tech companies hadn't developed a big new idea in years. Despite pouring money into self-driving cars, the metaverse and quantum computers, the businesses still relied on digital ad sales, iPhones and cloud computing.
Now the companies are hoping that artificial intelligence will be the answer to the problem and a way to refresh aging product lines that haven't changed all that much in recent years. They have plans to invest billions in generative A.I. technology, which powers chatbots like ChatGPT.
While making serious money from new A.I. products is still a ways off, a quick return to form has given the companies plenty of room to experiment.
In a call with investors on Thursday, Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said work on generative A.I. was still in early stages, but "I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know." Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, made similar comments on Thursday. And during recent calls with analysts, Google, Meta and Microsoft also said they would increase investments to support A.I. work.
For tech observers such as Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst who has covered the chip industry for 15 years, the surge in spending to support the development of A.I. is reminiscent of the investments in servers in the late 1990s and data centers in 2010. Generative A.I. is expected to deliver more than $ 2 trillion in economic benefits, according to McKinsey, the corporate consultancy, by increasing productivity across a host of businesses.
The A.I. investments could also lift cloud computing sales across tech. The number of customers using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, a tool to build on the generative A.I. models developed by its partner OpenAI, has increased this year to more than 11,000, from 250. Microsoft said A.I. would contribute two percentage points of growth to the Azure business in the current quarter.
"It's very early, but no one wants to be left behind," said Gavin Baker, managing partner at Atreides Management, a Boston investment firm with $ 3.5 billion under management.
Mr. Baker compared it to the early days of the commercial internet in the 1990s. "It was obvious it would change the world, so people kept investing," he said. "The same is happening with A.I."
Generative A.I. products are just starting to hit the market. Microsoft plans to charge $ 360 a year for Microsoft 365 Copilot, an A.I.-powered assistant for Word, Excel and PowerPoint. But the amount of new sales it generates won't be clear until sometime next year, according to analysts.
For the chip maker Nvidia, the A.I. boom has already arrived. In May, Nvidia shocked Wall Street by forecasting that it would generate $ 11 billion in sales in its second quarter, which ended July 30, exceeding analysts' expectations by more than $ 4 billion.
The big jump reflected surging demand for the graphics processing units, or GPUs, it designs to power A.I. technologies. Nvidia has no serious rivals in that market.
"It seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs," Elon Musk said during a Twitter Spaces in April while discussing his plans for an A.I. company.
Nvidia's data center business is projected to double sales this year, adding $ 15 billion. It is predicted to add $ 20 billion in new sales next year, according to Bernstein Research. And Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, making the company one of a handful with a total value over $ 1 trillion.
Nvidia anticipated the A.I. boom. For years, Jensen Huang, the company's chief executive, had talked about how GPUs would power A.I. technologies. He was so convinced of this that he told analysts in 2017 that the company was "all in" on a single chip design.
"It's all going to work out, or it's going to work out terribly," Mr. Huang said.
Other semiconductor companies are trying to claim a piece of the A.I. expansion. Broadcom has had some early success by working on custom A.I. chips for Google, and AMD is introducing a GPU in a bid to loosen Nvidia's grip on the most important corner of the market.
If all the investment in A.I. fails to generate the financial boom that companies and investors hope, the tech companies that have splurged on GPUs and A.I. systems should be able to bear the costs and stomach the disappointment, Mr. Rasgon said. The recent quarter has demonstrated that their existing businesses are far from falling apart.
"If they guessed wrong, it's not an enormous hit," Mr. Rasgon said. "It would be a problem, but they can absorb it."

Judge Limits Scope of Trial Vs. Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling did not affect some central parts of the antitrust cases about Google search, which are scheduled to go to trial next month.
A federal judge said this week that the Justice Department and a group of states could not move forward with some claims in antitrust complaints against Google, narrowing the scope of what is set to be the most significant federal monopoly trial against a tech giant in decades.
In the decision, which was unsealed on Friday, Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed four claims in the lawsuits and allowed government lawyers to move forward with three.
Judge Mehta wrote that a trial was warranted to assess whether Google's exclusivity deals for web browsers and preloading its services on Android devices illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly. But he said the government had not "demonstrated the requisite anticompetitive effect" to prove that Google broke the law in other ways, such as by boosting its own products in search results over those of specialized sites, like Amazon and Yelp.
The decision sets the stage for the first major tech monopoly trial since the federal government took Microsoft to court in the 1990s, amid a renewed backlash over the power of tech giants. In recent years, American regulators have filed lawsuits and tried to block the acquisitions of companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as they have grown in reach and size.
Some efforts by regulators to challenge the tech giants have faltered. Twice this year, federal judges have declined to grant Federal Trade Commission requests to stop tech deals, allowing Meta to close the purchase of a virtual reality start-up and clearing the way for Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
But the Google trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 12, stands out as the most direct government attempt in years to confront one of the world's biggest tech companies about longtime business practices. The trial is expected to last almost 10 weeks and to scrutinize not only how Google conducts business but its relationships with other major companies, such as Apple and Samsung, which have largely been shrouded in secrecy.
Bill Baer, a former Justice Department antitrust official, said the cases were as significant as the landmark litigation against Microsoft.
The outcome "will set an important precedent about whether these dominant tech platforms are engaging in behavior that limits competition and disadvantages consumers," he said.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the company appreciated Judge Mehta's "careful consideration and decision to dismiss claims regarding the design of Google Search."
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The department filed an antitrust case against Google under President Donald J. Trump in 2020. It argues that the Silicon Valley company exploits its power over online search and the ads that appear in search results. The lawsuit was ultimately combined for trial with a separate case about Google search that was filed that same year by the attorneys general of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.
The Justice Department has separately filed another antitrust case against Google, focused on the company's software for placing ads across the web, which is headed to trial as soon as next year.
In his ruling, Judge Mehta allowed the core of the Justice Department's case to stand. But he dismissed three of the agency's claims regarding Google's management of the Android operating system, its relationships to phone makers that use Android and its Google Assistant service. He also threw out a central claim brought by the states, which accused Google of providing top billing in its search results to its own products.
Judge Mehta acknowledged in his opinion that Google was extremely popular and noted the bar that government lawyers must clear to prove that it had broken antitrust rules.
It is not illegal for Google to have a monopoly alone, he wrote, adding, "A company with monopoly power acts unlawfully only when its conduct stifles competition."
At trial, both sides are set to argue over whether the company's multibillion-dollar agreements to be the default search engine on various devices and browsers are anticompetitive, which could have significant consequences for its core business. Google's search engine collected $ 162 billion in advertising revenue last year.
Google has argued that these pacts with companies like Apple and Samsung are simple distribution deals that are common in business, and that the government has tried to penalize Google because of its popularity.
The agreements have been a linchpin in Google's efforts to be easily accessible to large audiences. The company retains an estimated 94 percent of search engine traffic on mobile devices, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.

Sales Down, But Apple Lifts Profit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The iPhone maker's recent quarter benefited from strong sales in its App Store and other services businesses.
The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world's most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $ 81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $ 19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple's financial results were the latest indication that tech's biggest companies have found their footing after last year's downturn. Last week, Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.
The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $ 5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $ 6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple's share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $ 39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world's second-largest economy.
"We've done a really good job with affordability programs around the world," said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. "The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing."
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company's services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $ 21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $ 8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $ 3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won't go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
"While I'm pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, during the call with analysts. "It's a huge opportunity for us."
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company's supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming "incrementally incremental."

Told to Pay, Meta Begins Blocking News To Canadians: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The change came in response to a new law in Canada that requires tech companies to pay news outlets for using their content.
Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, has started blocking news articles on its social networking services in Canada.
The change, in response to a new law in Canada that requires tech companies to pay news outlets for using their content, will roll out "over the course of the next few weeks," Meta said in a blog post on Tuesday. Content posted on Facebook and Instagram by both local Canadian news outlets and international outlets will not be visible to Canadians using the platforms.
Canada passed the Online News Act in June, joining a push by numerous governments to force big social media companies to compensate news organizations. The Canadian bill requires the platforms and search engines to negotiate with news publishers to license their content.
Meta had previously signaled that it would block news access in response to the Canadian law. In a blog post, the company said the Online News Act "misrepresents the value news outlets receive when choosing to use our platforms."
"The legislation is based on the incorrect premise that Meta benefits unfairly from news content shared on our platforms, when the reverse is true," the blog post said, arguing that news outlets "voluntarily" share content to expand their audiences. Meta said it had generated traffic for publishers in a 12-month period to April 2022 that it valued at more than 230 million Canadian dollars.
Pascale St-Onge, the country's minister for Canadian heritage, described Meta's actions as "irresponsible."
"They would rather block their users from accessing good quality and local news instead of paying their fair share to news organizations," Ms. St-Onge said in a statement on Twitter.
Ms. St-Onge said the Canadian government would stand its ground with the new legislation.
"Facebook is trying to send a message, not only to Canada, but to other countries like New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States," she said.
Google has also said it plans to remove links to local Canadian news content. In a June 29 blog post, Kent Walker, the company's global affairs president, said the Online News Act was "unworkable" and exposed the company to "uncapped financial liability" by forcing it to pay for showing links to news reports.
Mr. Walker said Google had informed the Canadian government that it would remove news links as well as discontinue its Google News Showcase product when the law took effect.
The Canadian bill is modeled after a 2021 law passed in Australia, the first country to enact such legislation. At the time, Meta temporarily blocked sharing news links in Australia, before coming to a deal and lifting the ban.
California lawmakers have been considering a bill that would require the tech giants to pay for news, but said last month that it had been shelved for a year. Meta has pushed back forcefully against the bill, known as the California Journalism Preservation Act.

Full text: With Elon Musk's rebranding of the app, is Twitter's name really retired? What about tweets? We unravel the terminology puzzle.
With a simple name change, Elon Musk has created confusion in social media.
The bewilderment stems from Mr. Musk's move last month to rebrand Twitter, which he owns, as X. No major social media app has undergone such a name change before, at least while it had tens of millions of active users.
In 2016, Snapchat dropped "chat" from its corporate name, but kept the app's name unchanged. When Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta in 2021, it also left the name of its flagship social network alone.
The rebranding has been hair-raising for Twitter fans, who embraced the company's iconic blue-and-white bird logo and used a bird-related lexicon when talking about the platform. A tweet referred to a post; tweeting was a verb for posting, and sharing another person's post was known as retweeting.
Some people have wondered if the X name will stick, especially with the word tweets still appearing on the site. The app's home button is also still shaped like a birdhouse, and the company's website -- at least for now -- remains Twitter.com.
So is the Twitter name retired? And do we now call a tweet a "xeet" or "xcerpt"?
Really, what do we call Twitter now?
Sorry, die-hard Twitter fans, it's X.
X said its app would definitively be called X going forward. In marketing copy, the company declared, "The X app is the trusted digital town square for everyone." The app has a new slogan, too: "Blaze your glory!" (Twitter's previous tag lines included "Let's talk" and "It's what's happening.")
The Associated Press also updated its stylebook, which many regard as the gold standard, to reflect the name change. It suggested that media outlets call the company and its social media platform "X, formerly known as Twitter."
Mr. Musk had laid the groundwork for the name change for some time. When he bought Twitter last year, he formed a new parent company, X Corp., for the transaction.
In other words, people are now using X, an app by X Corp.
Mr. Musk is slowly purging Twitter's brand digitally and physically. While Twitter.com still sends users to the service's familiar home page, so does X.com, indicating that the website could soon change. The bird branding that adorned the website and the app has been eradicated.
Mr. Musk also briefly erected a light-up X sign atop the company's San Francisco's headquarters last week. (It was removed this week after a permit dispute.) And he replaced the bird-themed names of conference rooms at X's offices with X-themed names including "eXposure," "eXult" and "s3Xy," and ordered the removal of bird logos around the building.
What do we call tweets?
Tweets are now posts. In the same app update that wiped out the bird logo, the company swapped its classic blue "tweet" button for one that says "post."
Some users have proposed other names for posts. One suggestion has been "xeets" (pronounced zeets), an X-themed play on tweets. Others suggested "xcerpts." None of these terms seem to have caught on in a big way, at least so far.
Some of the app's other monikers may also change. Retweets are likely to become reposts, while quote tweets -- which refer to retweets that add one's own commentary -- may just become comments or quote posts.
Why did this change happen?
Mr. Musk has long been enamored with creating a company called X. In 1999, he started X.com, an online bank that later merged with the electronic payments service PayPal. Nearly two decades later, he bought the X.com website back from PayPal.
Mr. Musk has said he envisions X as an "everything app" that will allow users to share social media posts, order dinner and transfer money. Taking over Twitter was just the first step, he said.
"X is the future state of unlimited interactivity -- centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking -- creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities," Linda Yaccarino, the company's chief executive, posted last month.
What happens if I can't shake off the Twitter name?
We get it! It will take time to adjust colloquially to X. The Twitter name and its bird-related vocabulary have been used since 2006 and were embedded in popular culture.
The change may be especially difficult since "it is extremely rare for consumers to develop a lexicon around a brand," said Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director at Forrester. "It would be viewed as an advantage in most circumstances because it suggests a deepening of the brand-consumer relationship."
Now Mr. Musk has to create that relationship with the X brand, even as some users insist they will stick to the old terminology.
"A lot of people are confused about what to do now that Twitter has been officially rebranded as X, and I thought I'd write up a helpful guide for those of you struggling with change," one user recently wrote. "You keep calling it Twitter and pretend you do not see it!"

In Online Dating, Distrust and Verifying Potential Mates: [Style Desk]

Full text: Facebook groups like Vouched Dating and Are We Dating the Same Guy? help strangers vet potential partners.
These days the idea of meeting a perfect stranger doesn't quite hold the romantic allure it once did (if it ever really did at all). Especially when it comes to online dating. Before apps like Tinder, it was common for people to meet potential mates in their neighborhood, or through school, work or religious institutions. The internet, however, provides a much larger dating pool, which can reduce the chances of two people having mutual friends.
With 30 percent of U.S. adults using dating platforms, according to a survey by Pew Research Center, how can people verify if someone is datable? In a time where scams run amok on the internet, some single people are taking matters of verification into their own hands.
Most dating platforms require users to import photos and basic information about themselves. The platforms also allow users to link to their social media profiles, but it's impossible to know everything about person based on those cues alone.
Last year, Lissie Pinckney, who lives in Los Angeles, joined a Facebook group called Vouched Dating -- Los Angeles, where mostly straight women tout their platonic male friends. Different versions of the group exist in cities across the country, including Jersey City and Minneapolis.
On the vouch dating groups, women post a few pictures of their guy friends, adding details about who the guy is and who he's looking for, Ms. Pinckney, said. "And then women can comment if they're interested," she said.
The friend then shares the potential matches with her guy friend and makes the connection if it's a fit. These groups provide the women with a sense of security. The posts act as endorsements -- like Yelp reviews for potential mates.
Approaching the issue of verification from the opposite side of the coin, popular Facebook groups known as Are We Dating the Same Guy? serve as forums for women to see if the men they are dating are trustworthy. Members in those groups will share an image and brief details about a guy they are seeing along with one single inquiry: Is he taken? Others will post photos of their bad exes in an effort to warn other women. (Similar groups exist for men, called "Are We Dating the Same Girl?")
These forums originated with the intention of helping women look out for other women. But Are We Dating The Same Guy groups -- there are more than 150 in different cities around the world -- have become increasingly criticized for divisiveness, toxicity, defamation and privacy issues. Lawyers have warned that these pages could put posters at risk of legal action, and there is at least one petition on change.org demanding that the groups be shut down.
Dating apps have long grappled with verification features. Some, like Hinge and Raya, use various strategies to make potential matches feel less like strangers.
Hinge once used a "romance graph" to pair you with friends of friends that fit your style. Raya, the membership-based app for dating and professional networking, requires users to link their Instagram profiles to their pages. Aspiring members must apply to join (a referral from a current member can boost the chances of being accepted).
According to Madeleine Fugère, a social psychologist and psychological science professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, these attempts to verify dates via groups or mutual friends or family members could signal "a backlash" to internet dating and the problems associated with it.
"Because of the anonymity that the internet offers, there's a lot of people who behave badly," said Dr. Fugère, who specializes in human attraction and romantic relationships.
"It's much harder to behave in that way if you're not only accountable to your potential date, but also to a friend or family member," she added.
Ms. Pinckney attended a Vouched Dating party in August that was hosted by the Los Angeles group of which she is a member. She followed the rules of the party and brought a couple of her guy friends she could vouch for.
"The ladies all seemed spectacular," she said. "There were a couple of very eligible men that all the women wanted to talk to." But she added that most of the men were "lackluster."
However, one of the men she brought, Chazztin Pascual, a 36-year-old software engineer, hit it off with a woman named Trinity Gruenberg, 32.
"Once we met, we talked literally the whole day," Mr. Pascual said. "We went from one side of the venue to the other, and then we ended up outside."
They had their first official date less than a week later, and he soon asked her to be his girlfriend. They now live in the Bay Area, recently got engaged in Hawaii and are planning to get married next year.
"I liked that it was more of a traditional approach," Ms. Gruenberg said. "Like the whole goal was that it was a dating event. I really liked that.
Dr. Fugère explained that another reason it's important to meet in-person, regardless of how you connect, is because when we're in a digital environment, we have a tendency to project characteristics onto a potential partner and assume they're going to be good rather than bad. Instead, she said, we should determine if they really have positive characteristics or if we're "inventing those in the absence of real information."
Mr. Pascual said that the experience emphasized why going through friends to find a romantic partner, especially if it's a female friend, may make women feel safer because it can lessen the fear that he's a misogynist.
"I know at least a handful of guys, like I've worked with, that I would not trust anywhere near my sisters," said Mr. Pascual, who has six sisters. "Just the fact that a guy would have a female friend that can vouch for him is a plus in itself."

Full text: An Italian restaurant with a little elbow room? No problem.
Hi friends, I hope you all made it through this weekend's heat wave in good shape. (I ran straight to the beach.) I'm back with another edition of reader questions and, boy, do we have an interesting mix this month. There's a visitor from the South searching for "decent Thai" -- and we can do much better than decent. Another reader wants to know where to enjoy cozy Italian dining, minus the physical closeness to other diners. And finally, someone seeking bistro lunchtime options near the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a gossip session.
As always, please send along your own reader questions (or responses) to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see it featured here. Thanks!
A Thai food tour
Our South Carolina friends and I will be in N.Y.C. in early October and will be visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Not having a decent Thai restaurant anywhere in S.C., we are longing to dine at one when there. Would you recommend one for us to enjoy and truly savor? -- Michael B.
Because you'll be on the Upper East Side, I'll recommend Up Thai, near 72nd Street and Second Avenue. They have a really fun cocktail menu and better-than-decent Thai. But consider branching out: For world-class Isan (or Northern Thai), you should go to Elmhurst, Queens, or Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and visit Zaab Zaab. Goong pow, or sausage-size prawns, anyone? If you want Thai food that will make you cry because it's so good (and so spicy), head to Ugly Baby, in Carroll Gardens -- get whatever panang curry is available at the moment. And for excellent Thai in Manhattan, I highly recommend Somtum Der on Avenue A. If I knew tomorrow would be my last day on Earth, I'd have their pad se eiw nue as one of my last meals.
Give me some room
I love eating in the city, but I become uncomfortable sitting too close to strangers. The coziest-hole-in-the-wall restaurants are a favorite, and as a vegetarian, I tend toward Italian for those easy-to-predict pasta dishes. I am inevitably sat so close to the next group that my bum almost sweeps their meal off their table when I rise to use the restroom. Asking for spacious but cozy is a hard ask. Is it possible to get romantic and cozy without bumping elbows with couples on both sides? -- Dave and Valerie
Love a niche question. I'll start with this: If you want space, dine out early or late. I've had entire restaurants to myself at 5:30 or 6 in the evening. Now my recommendations: Jupiter, which has the square footage benefit of being in Rockefeller Center, has relatively private velvet booths that are a feast for the eyes. Consume as many zucchini fries as possible before getting the tortellini with butter and Parm. Alternatively, try Altro Paradiso on the SoHo-Hudson Square border, one of the more airy Italian restaurants in the city. As I said two weeks back, the tomato crop is glorious this year, so go for the spaghetti pomodoro.
Lunchtime debrief near the Met
Can you recommend a good bistro or restaurant in walking distance from the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Going to the Lagerfeld fashion exhibit with three friends and we'll have plenty to discuss over a tasty lunch. Thank you! -- Joanne M.
Plenty to discuss? OK, tea! In another life, I would have recommended the nearby Café Sabarsky, but it's closed through the end of August. So, I'll recommend a restaurant that is near and dear to my sister, a longtime resident of the Upper East Side: Café D'Alsace. We've gone there a few times for brunch and ordered the burger d'alsace with caramelized onions (and Alsatian Munster, if you so please), as well as the schnitzel.
In Other News ...
An update: Last week, I shared that the East Village restaurant Claud would temporarily become a daytime bakery because of issues with its liquor license. Those issues have since been resolved and, as of Sunday, Claud is operating as a full-service restaurant.
This week, Pete Wells reviews Artesano, where the chef Rodrigo Fernandini serves "intelligently assembled" takes on ceviches, tiraditos and other Peruvian dishes.
Openings: Akram Nassir, a pilot and an owner of Yemen Café on Atlantic Avenue, has opened a third location on Staten Island; Regina's Grocery, a Lower East Side staple, has a new branch on South Third Street and Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and starting Aug. 14, dine on a 105-foot schooner in the New York Harbor with Marea at Sea.
Ella Quittner took a survey of the latest dining aesthetic: restaurants lit entirely in the color red, like a darkroom.
Marnie Hanel writes about the rebranding of Diamond Crystal kosher salt, a longtime favorite of professional chefs, as a more approachable ingredient for "the aspiring home chef."

Full text: The Center for Countering Digital Hate said it had received a letter from X, Twitter's parent company, accusing it of trying to hurt the social platform with its research.
Elon Musk has over the last year threatened legal action against tech competitors, employees and people who use Twitter, which he owns. Now he is also taking aim at an organization that studies hate speech and misinformation on social media.
X Corp., the parent company of the social media company, sent a letter on July 20 to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that conducts research on social media, accusing the organization of making "a series of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically," and threatening to sue.
The letter cited research published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in June examining hate speech on Twitter, which Mr. Musk has renamed X.com. The research consisted of eight papers, including one that found that Twitter had taken no action against 99 percent of the 100 Twitter Blue accounts the center reported for "tweeting hate." The letter called the research "false, misleading or both" and said the organization had used improper methodology.
The letter added that the center was funded by Twitter's competitors or foreign governments "in support of an ulterior agenda."
Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said, "Elon Musk's actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research." He added that Mr. Musk wanted to "stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers."
The center also said it did "not accept any funding from tech companies, governments, or their affiliates."
In a blog post Monday evening, X announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate for "actively working to prevent free expression." The suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California.
Twitter's advertising business has been struggling under the ownership of Mr. Musk, who bought the company last year. U.S. ad revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $ 88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier. Advertisers may have been spooked by Mr. Musk's changes to the social network, including the removal of rules of what can or can't be said on the service and more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products.
In May, Mr. Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former top advertising executive for NBCUniversal, to become Twitter's chief executive.
The letter was at least the third legal threat or action by X Corp. in the last two months. In May, it sent a letter to Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, accusing the tech giant of improperly using its data. This month, it also sent a letter to Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, saying it had copied Twitter's trade secrets when creating Threads, a new social app.
X also sued Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a leading corporate law firm, this month over what it said were unjust payments related to Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter.

Full text: O'Shae Sibley, 28, was vogueing when men attacked him with gay slurs and told him to stop. A hate crimes task force is investigating.
O'Shae Sibley was at a Brooklyn gas station with friends late Saturday night, filling up a car and blasting music by Beyoncé when a group of men approached and told them to stop dancing, according to friends.
The men began using slurs and Mr. Sibley, 28, a gay man who was a professional dancer and choreographer, confronted them, according to his friends and a video of the altercation. The argument escalated and one man stabbed Mr. Sibley, according to the police. Otis Pena, one of Mr. Sibley's best friends, pressed on his wound to stop the bleeding before he was taken to Maimonides Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.
"They murdered him because he's gay, because he stood up for his friends," Mr. Pena said in a Facebook video that he posted hours after the killing on Coney Island Avenue in Midwood. "His name was O'Shae and you all killed him. You all murdered him right in front of me."
No arrests had been made by Monday, but the police said that the hate crimes unit was involved in the investigation.
The killing has devastated Mr. Sibley's family -- he is one of 11 siblings -- and unnerved the city's gay community. While the motive remains under investigation, the attack was a reminder of the biases that L.G.B.T.Q. people face.
The Anti-Defamation League and the advocacy group GLAAD issued a report in June indicating an increase in harassment and violence against gay and transgender people, including online bullying, gatherings of armed protesters outside drag shows and bomb threats against hospitals that provide gender transition care. In the first three weeks of June there were 101 such incidents, more than twice the number during the same time period the year before.
Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a gay state senator in New York, said he was "heartbroken and enraged" over Mr. Sibley's killing.
"Gay joy is not crime," he said on Twitter. "Hate-fueled attacks are."
Mr. Sibley had moved from Philadelphia before the pandemic, hoping New York would provide more auditions and opportunities, said an aunt, Tondra Sibley, 49.
"It was a senseless crime," she said. "O'Shae has always been a peacemaker. All he wanted to do was dance."
She recalled him as a small boy, "gyrating and jerking" to Missy Elliott. When he got older, he honed his skills at the Philadelphia Dance Company and, on the advice of instructors, began ballet, taking advantage of his long, athletic frame.
Kemar Jewel, a 31-year-old choreographer and director, met Mr. Sibley in Philadelphia 13 years ago at the Attic Youth Center, where gay teenagers could go for after-school programs and activities. They were only a few years apart, but Mr. Sibley saw him as a mentor. "He was like, 'You're my uncle. I'm going to call you uncle,"' Mr. Jewel said.
Goofy and fun-loving, Mr. Sibley was serious about his craft. He would hunker down at Mr. Jewel's apartment until 3 a.m. to study dance videos, from vogueing to the modern techniques introduced by Martha Graham and Lester Horton, American dancers and choreographers born around the turn of the 20th century.
"O'Shae was so well versed. He was great at tap, ballet, hip-hop," Mr. Jewel said. "He was an incredible visual learner. I've seen him watch someone do something twice and then just do it."
Mr. Jewel, who is in London working on a show, said he was sleeping on Sunday morning when Mr. Pena called to tell him what had happened.
At the gas station, Mr. Sibley and his friends had been playing "Renaissance" by Beyoncé and vogueing, a style of dance that began as an imitation of fashion models in the 1980s and has evolved as an expression of pride and protest.
That is when the group of men approached, calling them names, Mr. Jewel said, recalling the account of Mr. Pena, who could not be reached for comment.
Both Mr. Sibley and Mr. Pena told them, "Stop saying that. There is nothing wrong with being gay."
Mr. Sibley fought with them, and he was stabbed as Mr. Pena ran to intervene, Mr. Jewel said.
At the Brownsville building where Mr. Sibley lived alone in a studio, his neighbor, Beckenbaur Hamilton, 51, said he had warned the younger man against being so open about his sexuality. Mr. Hamilton, who is also gay, recalled attacks he had suffered in his 20s when going out to clubs, and said that he has recently been overhearing comments on the street about "all these rights" gay people have.
"O'Shae wasn't afraid of being who he was," Mr. Hamilton said. "He would defend his friends."
They loved dancing outside and delighted in drawing a crowd. "But I'd see how people looked at them," Mr. Hamilton said. "There was a worry in the back of my mind."
In his video, Mr. Pena described Mr. Sibley as his brother and said the two were "always out and loud."
"We as a community don't deserve this," Mr. Pena said. "We may be gay, but we exist. We're not going to live in fear. We're not going to live hiding."

A Reassuring Voice on Tech In a World of Upheaval: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Masnick, who founded Techdirt in 1998, writes for an influential audience of lawmakers, C.E.O.s and activists. Somehow, he's still an optimist about the promise of technology.
How could they protect themselves from A.I.?
That was the question that Mike Masnick found himself fielding this summer in a WhatsApp chat with about 100 directors, actors and screenwriters. The group, including marquee talent, was worried about a grim possible future in which deepfake versions of actors perform screenplays written by ChatGPT.
Mr. Masnick, a professional tech wonk, told his Hollywood listeners to work with what they had: Publicly shame projects that replace human labor with artificial intelligence, use state publicity laws against any unauthorized deepfakes and fight hard for contractual protections. (The fight is on: A.I. is one reason for the writers' and actors' strikes that have paralyzed the film and television industry.)
But he also suggested that they capitalize on the technology. Convinced that "A.I. plus human" is the future, he pointed to the singer Grimes. She invited people to use A.I.-generated versions of her voice, trained on music that she had done in the past, in exchange for half of any royalties. One GrimesAI song is closing in on a million listens on Spotify.
"Let people be creative and they'll do creative things and expand the interest in your own work," Mr. Masnick, 48, said. The technological shift is inevitable, he said, so "use it to your advantage."
Since starting his Techdirt blog in 1998, Mr. Masnick has been doling out this same message as wave after wave of tech innovation has stirred fears, going back to the time of Napster: The new thing is less scary than you think it is.
He had been added to the Hollywood group chat about A.I. by Alex Winter, an actor and filmmaker whose oeuvre ranges from "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" to documentaries about other alarming technology, including Bitcoin and YouTube. Mr. Winter said he appreciated Mr. Masnick's pragmatism.
"I find people like Mike reassuring because they are setting up guardrails to prevent you from driving your car off the cliff in your zeal to find solutions," he said.
By sheer longevity and a deep knowledge of tech history, Mr. Masnick has become something of a Silicon Valley oracle. His message is to embrace change even when painful and to beware of knee-jerk legal protections with unintended consequences.
It hasn't paid very well, but what Mr. Masnick doesn't have in wealth he makes up for in influence. Lawmakers, activists and executives consider him an essential guide for what's happening in the technology world and what to do next.
"Whenever tech policy news breaks I always want to see what Mike's take is going to be," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, has called him "insightful and reasonable." The tech entrepreneur Anil Dash said he "shows up and ships every day" and has been "filing constantly for decades on a beat that is thankless."
What Mr. Masnick apparently hasn't had time for is a redesign of his blog. A wall of text, heavy on hyperlinks, it has not evolved much since its founding.
Intellectual Gig Work
Based just outside Silicon Valley in Redwood City, Calif., with an office view that features tech company commuters and a giant Buddha statue looking down onto U.S. 101, Mr. Masnick started writing online about the "high-tech industry" in the late 1990s while in business school -- mainly as a ploy to get a job at a long-forgotten start-up -- and then never stopped.
In the early 2000s -- a thousand years ago in internet time -- online file-sharing was taking off and CD sales were plummeting. Mr. Masnick exhorted the music industry to accept the internet and the opportunity it offered to connect with more fans. The internet would be great for artists: fewer middlemen and gatekeepers!
The digitization of music didn't go exactly the way Mr. Masnick had hoped. Creators weren't the primary winners; subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music were. But artists who had a direct relationship with their audience did gain more power, as many a Taylor Swift fan can attest.
Mr. Masnick has been a close observer of the tech industry's rise from disruptive force to world-dominating power center, but he has never quite managed to reap its astronomical financial rewards for himself. The best way to describe how he makes a living is as an intellectual gig worker, equal parts business owner, tech journalist, policy analyst, research fellow and game designer.
Techdirt has a handful of employees and paid contributors, almost all selected in meritocratic style from the comments section. Because of Mr. Masnick's commitment to the free flow of information, Techdirt has never had a paywall. Advertising and support from the site's million or so readers have never fully paid his bills.
Mr. Masnick has written more than 51,000 (often lengthy) blog posts, adding more several times a day, and also hosts a weekly podcast. On one Friday this month, he wrote about proposed A.I. regulations (mostly bad, in his opinion), a court's dismissal of a lawsuit against Amazon for selling teenagers "suicide kits" (a tragic case but a good ruling, he concluded), and legal challenges to "crazy" age-verification laws meant to protect children online. (He recently filed a declaration in a lawsuit seeking to stop California from enacting such a law, outlining how burdensome it would be for Techdirt to comply.)
He runs the Copia Institute, a think tank that organizes events about internet policy and produces geeky research reports; it accepts sponsorships from foundations and companies, including ones that Mr. Masnick writes about, such as Google and Yelp. The financial entanglement might get him in trouble at a traditional journalism organization, but not at a blog where he is the boss. Sponsors never have editorial control, he said.
Being a small independent tech blogger, Mr. Masnick said, means "finding that spot where you can survive."
In the last few years, he has taken to game design. He co-created a role-playing exercise for the United Nations to help forecast the future in countries with political upheaval and a game about what it's like to be an online content moderator, sponsored by a start-up advocacy group. Few people would describe them as fun, but Mr. Masnick said they helped people wrap their heads around complicated technology issues like nothing else he had done.
His productivity hacks include a laptop with a slide-out second screen that makes it easy to work on the go and Focusmate, a paid service that pairs him with a stranger so they can silently "co-work" together. At the end of a session, they tell each other whether they accomplished what they set out to do.
In the Heads of Tech C.E.O.s
The message in Mr. Masnick's Facebook Messenger inbox was from the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
"I don't think we've met," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in February 2021, "but I've always found your writing insightful and reasonable, even when you're critical of us for making mistakes."
Mr. Masnick, who provided this account, tried to message him back -- but couldn't. Because he and Mr. Zuckerberg weren't Facebook friends, the message was rejected.
Befitting his status as an outsider whom insiders read, Mr. Masnick reached out to someone else at Facebook, and soon Mr. Zuckerberg was back in his DMs apologizing for the "bug."
When they talked by phone, Mr. Zuckerberg asked Mr. Masnick what Facebook was doing wrong. Given his distaste for powerful tech companies that exercise too much control over people's internet experience, Mr. Masnick suggested that Mr. Zuckerberg consider decentralizing.
He talked about a concept he has been pushing called "protocols, not platforms" -- software that is interoperable, like email, so people from different services can interact and outside developers can build on it. This would open up a market for different content filters and algorithms that users could choose from, giving them more control over what they did and didn't see. It would make people like Mr. Zuckerberg less powerful, because his company would be allowing third parties to be the arbiters of online speech, but it could deflect the complaints they got about harmful speech and censorship.
The idea had resonated with Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder, who credited Mr. Masnick as an inspiration for the creation of Bluesky, a Twitter clone that embraced that approach.
Mr. Masnick spent more than an hour on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but wasn't sure if he was really listening -- until last month, when Mr. Zuckerberg launched his own Twitter clone, Threads. The news release emphasized that the plan was to make it a protocol interoperable with other apps, including Mastodon. Mr. Masnick celebrated with a long blog post.
The Streisand Effect
Mr. Masnick has a way of seeding ideas about technology that take root and grow.
In 2005, he wrote about legal threats against a website devoted to amassing urinal photos. (The early internet was a strange place.) The threats, intended to remove information about certain urinal owners, instead created their own news cycle and garnered more attention for the otherwise obscure site.
Mr. Masnick coined a phrase for an attempt to censor information on the internet that backfires: "the Streisand effect."
In 2003, Barbra Streisand sued an aerial photographer who had put photos of her Malibu beach house on his website, causing the little-seen images to go viral. Now the episode is internet lore, and the phrase has its own Wikipedia entry with a long list of examples.
It's a typical Masnickian principle of the internet, gleaned from lengthy observation: Poorly thought-out attempts to solve online problems will make them worse.
"He understands the internet in a deep way that I don't think is common," said Corynne McSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The digital liberties organization gave Mr. Masnick an award for digital activism in 2017, when fighting a defamation lawsuit almost bankrupted Techdirt.
A man who claimed to have "invented email" had sued Techdirt for $ 15 million over its blog posts questioning those claims. The suit garnered significant media attention; it's not among the examples in the Wikipedia article on the Streisand effect, but it really should be.
Mr. Masnick knew the lawsuit was ridiculous and unlikely to succeed, but the legal bills were a hardship. Techdirt turned to the internet and asked for donations. It got the support it needed, and the suit was eventually settled with no money changing hands.
Mr. Masnick got to continue evangelizing for tech innovation.
"I'm trying to get people to see the world the way I see it," he said. "It's cool when people can do stuff."

Full text: A reader doesn't want to upset his father, who requested his presence, but the idea of taking a vacation to celebrate a woman he has cut out of his life makes him squirm.
A year ago, I cut my toxic mother out of my life. It was a good decision. The problem: My father, whom I still see one on one, is distraught that I skip family events to avoid her. Now, he's decided to pay for the whole family to go to an expensive resort to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday, and he is pressuring me to join them. I think it would be hypocritical to go on vacation to celebrate a woman whom I no longer speak to. But my dad is 85. He has always been loving and supportive to me, and I know my being there would mean a lot to him. I'm torn: I don't want to subject myself to my mother, but I don't want to ruin the vacation for my father. Thoughts?
SON
I think you may be misunderstanding what your father is asking of you. And if my hunch is correct, your decision may be even easier. He is not requesting your mere presence on a family vacation; he is also asking you to engage (nicely) with everyone else, including your mother -- no avoidance or silent treatment allowed. If that's not possible, don't go. Your absence will probably be less upsetting to the group than wall-to-wall conflict.
Now, it's hard for me to assess the situation with your mother, thanks to our national fondness for the language of pathology. You say she is "toxic." But if I deleted every letter that used the word "narcissist" or "toxic" to describe people who seem vaguely selfish or unpleasant, my inbox would be practically empty.
So, I defer to you. Some parents are truly destructive. Steer clear of them and invest your energy elsewhere. More commonly, though, many adult children can recognize -- by the time our parents turn 80 -- that our mothers and fathers may not be the ones we would have wished for, but we can live with them and our ambivalence anyway. If you can keep your equanimity for the length of the vacation, great. If not, I respect that, too. But going on your mother's birthday trip is not about your father. Explain that to him.
Wanted: Magical Solution to Simple Problem
My husband and I went to dinner with close friends and another couple, who ordered an expensive bottle of wine for the table without mentioning its price. During dinner, they ordered a second bottle. We never complain about splitting bills, but there were comparable, less expensive wines on the menu, and my husband didn't even drink any. We don't want to say anything about this to our close friends or even to the other couple. What would you suggest for next time?
DINER
Let me tell you why I love your letter: There is an obvious solution to your problem. (Ask for separate checks.) But you don't want to do that, I assume, because some people find the request cheap or tacky, right? Instead, you want me to concoct a solution that doesn't require telling anyone what's on your mind. That's very human -- but also absurd!
So, which option bothers you least: paying your share for expensive wine you don't want, asking for separate checks or talking to close friends about a relatively minor issue that strikes you as unfair? Choose your own adventure. But for your sake, I hope it's not the one that lets an unspoken grievance fester among friends.
How Many Cents a Minute for Sisterly Bonding?
My 82-year-old sister, who lives in a rural area 300 miles from me, refuses to pay for long-distance service on her landline and doesn't have a cellphone. If I want to talk to her or check that she's OK, I have to call her. When I do, she dominates the conversation and rarely shows interest in what I have to say. This may sound like a trivial complaint, but I don't think she's making an effort to stay in touch. Am I being petty?
ELIZABETH
This doesn't sound petty or trivial at all! I'm sorry you feel estranged from your sister. Be careful about personalizing the situation, though. It's possible that your sister can't afford long-distance or cell service. And you haven't said anything about her health or cognition. In my experience with older relatives, untreated hearing loss -- which is common in older people -- can put a damper on phone calls (and connectedness in general). None of this would be a reflection on her feelings about you.
So, how would you feel about an old-fashioned correspondence -- with stamps and everything? She may communicate better that way. I hope you keep trying, in any event. You may not succeed, but she's the only 82-year-old sister you have.
When Sportsmanship Is a Recessive Trait
My twin brother and I (age 15) play competitive tennis. So does our younger brother (13). The problem: They cheat like crazy on line calls and scoring! What can I do about it?
HONEST BROTHER
You have come to the right place, my friend. I have two brothers, too. (Vicious cheats!) Here's what we did: set up round-robin singles games with the third brother acting as official linesman and scorer. Or start playing with kids who are not related to you. It's much less loaded.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

Full text: After Mallory Grossman took her own life at age 12, her parents accused her New Jersey school district of failing to respond to accusations of bullying.
A New Jersey school district has agreed to pay $ 9.1 million to the parents of a sixth grader who died by suicide in 2017, ending a lawsuit that accused administrators of failing to take bullying complaints seriously.
Dianne and Seth Grossman sued following the death of their 12-year-old daughter, Mallory, during her first year at Copeland Middle School in Rockaway Township. Mallory had been repeatedly bullied by other students in text and Snapchat messages, and although administrators were routinely contacted about the bullying, the school did not do enough to respond, according to the lawsuit.
The settlement, first reported by Northjersey.com, comes as schools face growing scrutiny over how they handle reports of bullying, both within their halls and online, after a student takes their own life.
The factors that contribute to suicide are complex and varied, and the act is rarely attributable to any one thing. But the question of a school's culpability in cases where administrators made missteps or took insufficient action has become the subject of court cases around the country.
"I am hopeful that it sends a strong signal to school districts across the country that they have to take bullying seriously," said Bruce H. Nagel, a lawyer representing the Grossman family.
The Rockaway Township School District superintendent of schools, Richard R. Corbett, said the district had no comment.
Mallory's death, and her parents' advocacy in the years that followed, led to the passage of Mallory's Law in New Jersey last year. The law substantially strengthened the state's bullying policies, according to Mr. Nagel, and required all schools to be far more active in preventing it. Her family also founded Mallory's Army, an anti-bullying foundation.
As concern for the mental health of American teenagers has grown since the start of the pandemic, the role that administrators can play has become a key issue for school communities.
In a rare admission of failure, the Lawrenceville School, an elite private boarding school in New Jersey, released a statement in April saying that "bullying and unkind behavior, and actions taken or not taken by the school, likely contributed" to the death of Jack Reid, a 17-year-old junior, in 2022.
The admission was part of the negotiated terms of a settlement between the school and Jack's parents. The school also committed to taking a series of corrective actions, including endowing a new dean's position that will be focused on mental health issues.
The rates of suicide and self-harm have risen among adolescents, across demographics, in recent years. A study published in 2022 found that adolescents who experienced cyberbullying were more than four times as likely to report suicidal thoughts and attempts. Nearly three in five teenage girls felt persistent sadness in 2021, double the rate of boys, according to a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study also found that one in three girls seriously considered attempting suicide.
For Mallory's parents, holding the school accountable for what they believe to be its role in the circumstances that led to her death was the key reason for their lawsuit. The settlement terms of lawsuits are not always made public, but Mr. Nagel said the $ 9.1 million agreement with the school district is the largest bullying settlement that he is aware of anywhere in the country.
Mallory was a cheerleader and gymnast who loved the outdoors, her parents said. They had no reason to believe that she was depressed or had other medical issues, they told The New York Times in 2018. However, she would often tell them that she was having bad days at school.
"She wanted help, but she didn't want to draw attention," Ms. Grossman said at the time.
In one instance, the school asked Mallory and her bullies to "hug each other," according to the lawsuit. When she was bullied at lunch, she was directed to eat in a counselor's office.
"There is this attack on the victim to 'suck it up,"' Ms. Grossman said at the time. "I knew they weren't taking it seriously."
On Wednesday, Ms. Grossman told Northjersey.com that she and her husband were satisfied with the settlement.
"Ready to put this part behind us and move forward," she told the outlet. "Continuing to lend our voice to the epidemic that is stealing our children's future."

Full text: In New York, Hamza Choudery and Zabreen Khan quickly bonded over a shared culture and cricket. This month they were married in Lahore.
Hamza Shabbir Choudery was trying to play it cool. He had casually asked his colleague Zabreen Akhtar Khan to grab a bite to eat after work one Friday in the fall of 2017.
Ms. Khan and Mr. Choudery, both 27, met in New York the year before as summer interns at Facebook, now known as Meta. After finishing college, each moved to Manhattan to join the company full time in the global sales department. They then became friends.
They worked on the same floor, and Mr. Choudery regularly made excuses to pass by Ms. Khan's desk. Her office mates noticed. "When I wasn't around, they would egg Hamza on, and when he wasn't around, they would tell me, 'Oh my God, he really likes you, has anything happened yet?'," Ms. Khan said.
Their casual, after-work dinner lasted for several hours, with the two going out for dessert afterward, then chatting on the fire escape of Mr. Choudery's East Village apartment. "That's the anniversary that we celebrate, because that is when things got serious for us," Mr. Choudery said.
Over the next few months their relationship slowly evolved. "I embarrassingly said, 'I wonder what your parents will think of me,"' Mr. Choudery said, laughing. "I had a lot of faith in the relationship from the get-go."
Ms. Khan, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Phenomenal Ventures, was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan. She has a bachelor's degree in science, technology and society from Stanford and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Choudery, a founder of Autoblocks, an artificial intelligence start-up company, was born in Bangial, a village in Pakistan about three hours outside Lahore. His family moved to the United States when he was 3, and he grew up on a farm in Pocomoke City, Md. He has a bachelor's degree in finance and information systems from University of Maryland and an M.B.A. from Stanford Graduate School of Business.
"There was a very easy bond between us because there were a lot of shared values and shared experiences," Ms. Khan said. "We're both a little bit Pakistani, a little bit American."
Both also like cricket. "He knows all the players' names, we can reference the same Pakistan cricket matches that happened 15 years ago," Ms. Khan said. Mr. Choudery even joined the same cricket league as Ms. Khan's older brother in New York, endearing him more to her family.
"To find someone that embodied two sometimes very different identities felt really comforting," Ms. Khan said.

She and Mr. Choudery formally began their relationship in early 2018, after Ms. Khan had returned from a trip to Pakistan for the winter holidays. They maintained a long-distance relationship for two years after they began attending graduate schools in 2021 on opposite coasts. Though the pair had discussed marriage before, with each other and their respective families, their separation cemented their certainty about each other. "Those two years apart, it felt like my limb was missing," Ms. Khan said.
Mr. Choudery proposed to Ms. Khan in July 2022. In a planned daylong scavenger hunt, he wrote note cards with rhyming couplets, each a clue to a different spot in the city that held meaning for them. The destinations included 770 Broadway, which was the site of the office where they had met.
Later that day, in a small courtyard behind the Gramercy apartment where Ms. Khan lived, Mr. Choudery got down on one knee and proposed with a round diamond solitaire. Surrounded by a cellist and bouquets of flowers, he read a speech he had scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper.
The couple celebrated with a dinner at Gramercy Tavern, but not before stopping by Ms. Khan's old apartment lobby, where her former doorman waited with flowers and a hug. In the early days of their relationship, the doorman gave Mr. Choudery pep talks as he waited for Ms. Khan, and he watched their bond grow over the years.
The two were legally married in Ms. Khan's childhood home in Lahore on July 5. An Islamic nikkah ceremony was officiated by Maulana Syed Abdul Khabir Azad, the imam from Badshahi Mosque.
The wedding celebrations took place over four days, and the couple incorporated American touches, including toasts from their siblings and friends, and exchanging vows.
A large wedding reception was held July 8 at Pearl Continental Hotel in Lahore, with 650 guests in attendance. Ms. Khan wore a bright red lehenga choli, while Mr. Choudery donned a white sherwani with a pagri on his head.
Another highlight of the celebration was a mango-themed garden party at Ms. Khan's family estate. Guests wore shades of yellow and orange, Punjabi music played, and the menu included mango kulfi, a frozen dessert, and mango lassi, a yogurt drink.
Under the shade of the mango trees, her mother taught some of her American friends how to eat the fruit, not by slicing it up, but cutting the top open and savoring the juice.

Full text: Accusations against the powerful sheriff in Clay County were there for anybody to find.
The accusations of sexual misconduct against Eddie Scott, the sheriff of Clay County, Miss., will be new to almost everyone who reads our latest investigation.
They are not new to the residents of Clay County, where Sheriff Scott has been in office since 2012 and was chief deputy sheriff before then. But the particulars of what the sheriff has been accused of and the accounting of how people in power handled the allegations is a long story -- one we wanted to tell.
After months of reporting, Jerry Mitchell, a veteran investigative reporter in Mississippi, and I published an article this month that charted allegations against the sheriff that date to his earliest days in office. Two women accused the sheriff of using his power to coerce them into sex. Another woman said she endured sexual harassment from the sheriff while she was an employee in his office. At least five people who accused the sheriff of misconduct, or who were potential witnesses, said he had retaliated against them.
Many of these allegations, despite being detailed in courtroom transcripts, lawsuits and Facebook posts, went nowhere.
Our investigation is part of a series on the extraordinary power of Mississippi sheriffs from The New York Times's Local Investigations Fellowship, led by the former executive editor Dean Baquet, and co-published by The Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting at Mississippi Today.
The fellowship gives reporters a year to focus on one project, without juggling the demands of daily news. It requires fellows to live in the areas they cover, ensuring that we are connected to the places and communities we write about. I'm one of three reporters based in Jackson, Miss. The Times also has fellows investigating issues in Maryland, Hawaii, Maine and Wisconsin.
The investigation into Sheriff Scott began with a tip. In January 2022, a woman named Amber Jones posted on a public Facebook page accusing the sheriff of forcing her into sex in 2017, when she was incarcerated at the Clay County jail.
Ms. Jones agreed to talk with us, but it took time to build trust with her. Before we interviewed her, she had spoken to lawyers and F.B.I. agents who were investigating the sheriff's actions. But those conversations, she believed, had gotten her nowhere. As she waited a year or more for news from federal authorities, she said, she endured vitriol from people in her town for publicly accusing the sheriff.
As Jerry and I talked to witnesses and reviewed court records to check the veracity of Ms. Jones's allegations, we found dozens of people who were critical of Sheriff Scott. We talked to several witnesses who said they believed they had been targeted for arrest after speaking up. We obtained a recording of a man who said he planted drugs in Ms. Jones's car at the request of a Clay County Sheriff's deputy.
The reporting was complicated by lax record-keeping in Clay County. Jail records, such as sign-out sheets that could have confirmed aspects of Ms. Jones's allegations, were missing or stacked in huge, lopsided piles on the floor of the sheriff's office. One file detailing allegations against Sheriff Scott had been misfiled in the court clerk's office. The file contained court testimony in which a woman accused Sheriff Scott of coercing her into sex starting in 2009, while he was a deputy sheriff working on her case.
After months of interviewing sources and digging through court records, we were finally ready to speak with the sheriff himself.
He appeared to be very open with us; he even agreed to be interviewed on camera -- at which point I showed him screenshots of Ms. Jones's Snapchat records and texts that he had written. And, still, he denied any untoward conduct.
After our article was published, he again denied any wrongdoing on local television and in a Facebook post.
While people across the country have expressed shock over our reporting, many in the tiny town of West Point -- where the sheriff remains popular -- have called our work an effort to smear him before his re-election bid on Aug. 8.
But that couldn't be further from the truth. The mission of the Local Investigations Fellowship is to devote journalistic resources to regions where local newsrooms have emptied out. And we have been told that certain lawmen in Mississippi have long ruled like kings, untouchable even when faced with serious accusations of abuse.
We don't plan on stopping our reporting anytime soon.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif. — How could they protect themselves from AI?
That was the question that Mike Masnick found himself fielding this summer in a WhatsApp chat with about 100 directors, actors and screenwriters. The group, including marquee talent, was worried about a grim possible future in which deepfake versions of actors perform screenplays written by ChatGPT.
Masnick, a professional tech wonk, told his Hollywood listeners to work with what they had: Publicly shame projects that replace human labor with artificial intelligence, use state publicity laws against any unauthorized deepfakes and fight hard for contractual protections. (The fight is on: AI is one reason for the writers and actors strikes that have paralyzed the film and television industry.)
But he also suggested that they capitalize on the technology. Convinced that “AI plus human” is the future, he pointed to singer Grimes. She invited people to use AI-generated versions of her voice, trained on music that she had done in the past, in exchange for half of any royalties. One GrimesAI song is closing in on 1 million listens on Spotify.
“Let people be creative and they’ll do creative things and expand the interest in your own work,” said Masnick, 48. The technological shift is inevitable, he said, so “use it to your advantage.”
Since starting his Techdirt blog in 1998, Masnick has been doling out this same message as wave after wave of tech innovation has stirred fears, going back to the time of Napster: The new thing is less scary than you think it is.
He had been added to the Hollywood group chat about AI by Alex Winter, an actor and filmmaker whose oeuvre ranges from “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” to documentaries about other alarming technology, including bitcoin and YouTube. Winter said he appreciated Masnick’s pragmatism.
“I find people like Mike reassuring because they are setting up guardrails to prevent you from driving your car off the cliff in your zeal to find solutions,” he said.
By sheer longevity and a deep knowledge of tech history, Masnick has become something of a Silicon Valley oracle. His message is to embrace change even when painful and to beware of knee-jerk legal protections with unintended consequences.
It hasn’t paid very well, but what Masnick doesn’t have in wealth he makes up for in influence. Lawmakers, activists and executives consider him an essential guide for what’s happening in the technology world and what to do next.
“Whenever tech policy news breaks, I always want to see what Mike’s take is going to be,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, has called him “insightful and reasonable.” Tech entrepreneur Anil Dash said he “shows up and ships every day” and has been “filing constantly for decades on a beat that is thankless.”
What Masnick apparently hasn’t had time for is a redesign of his blog. A wall of text, heavy on hyperlinks, it has not evolved much since its founding.
Intellectual Gig Work
Based just outside Silicon Valley in Redwood City, with an office view that features tech company commuters and a giant Buddha statue looking down onto U.S. 101, Masnick started writing online about the “high-tech industry” in the late 1990s while in business school — mainly as a ploy to get a job at a long-forgotten startup — and then never stopped.
In the early 2000s — 1,000 years ago in internet time — online file-sharing was taking off and CD sales were plummeting. Masnick exhorted the music industry to accept the internet and the opportunity it offered to connect with more fans. The internet would be great for artists: fewer middlemen and gatekeepers!
The digitization of music didn’t go exactly the way Masnick had hoped. Creators weren’t the primary winners; subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music were. But artists who had a direct relationship with their audience did gain more power, as many a Taylor Swift fan can attest.
Masnick has been a close observer of the tech industry’s rise from disruptive force to world-dominating power center, but he has never quite managed to reap its astronomical financial rewards for himself. The best way to describe how he makes a living is as an intellectual gig worker, equal parts business owner, tech journalist, policy analyst, research fellow and game designer.
Techdirt has a handful of employees and paid contributors, almost all selected in meritocratic style from the comments section. Because of Masnick’s commitment to the free flow of information, Techdirt has never had a paywall. Advertising and support from the site’s million or so readers have never fully paid his bills.
Masnick has written more than 51,000 (often lengthy) blog posts, adding more several times a day, and also hosts a weekly podcast. On one Friday this month, he wrote about proposed AI regulations (mostly bad, in his opinion), a court’s dismissal of a lawsuit against Amazon for selling teenagers “suicide kits” (a tragic case but a good ruling, he concluded), and legal challenges to “crazy” age-verification laws meant to protect children online. (He recently filed a declaration in a lawsuit seeking to stop California from enacting such a law, outlining how burdensome it would be for Techdirt to comply.)
He runs the Copia Institute, a think tank that organizes events about internet policy and produces geeky research reports; it accepts sponsorships from foundations and companies, including ones that Masnick writes about, such as Google and Yelp. The financial entanglement might get him in trouble at a traditional journalism organization, but not at a blog where he is the boss. Sponsors never have editorial control, he said.
Being a small independent tech blogger, Masnick said, means “finding that spot where you can survive.”
In the last few years, he has taken to game design. He co-created a role-playing exercise for the United Nations to help forecast the future in countries with political upheaval and a game about what it’s like to be an online content moderator, sponsored by a startup advocacy group. Few people would describe them as fun, but Masnick said they helped people wrap their heads around complicated technology issues like nothing else he had done.
His productivity hacks include a laptop with a slide-out second screen that makes it easy to work on the go and Focusmate, a paid service that pairs him with a stranger so they can silently “co-work” together. At the end of a session, they tell each other whether they accomplished what they set out to do.
In the Heads of Tech CEOs
The message in Masnick’s Facebook Messenger inbox was from the company’s CEO, Zuckerberg.
“I don’t think we’ve met,” Zuckerberg wrote in February 2021, “but I’ve always found your writing insightful and reasonable, even when you’re critical of us for making mistakes.”
Masnick, who provided this account, tried to message him back — but couldn’t. Because he and Zuckerberg weren’t Facebook friends, the message was rejected.
Befitting his status as an outsider whom insiders read, Masnick reached out to someone else at Facebook, and soon Zuckerberg was back in his DMs apologizing for the “bug.”
When they talked by phone, Zuckerberg asked Masnick what Facebook was doing wrong. Given his distaste for powerful tech companies that exercise too much control over people’s internet experience, Masnick suggested that Zuckerberg consider decentralizing.
He talked about a concept he has been pushing called “protocols, not platforms” — software that is interoperable, like email, so people from different services can interact and outside developers can build on it. This would open up a market for different content filters and algorithms that users could choose from, giving them more control over what they did and didn’t see. It would make people like Zuckerberg less powerful, because his company would be allowing third parties to be the arbiters of online speech, but it could deflect the complaints they got about harmful speech and censorship.
The idea had resonated with Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, who credited Masnick as an inspiration for the creation of Bluesky, a Twitter clone that embraced that approach.
Masnick spent more than an hour on the phone with Zuckerberg, but wasn’t sure if he was really listening — until last month, when Zuckerberg launched his own Twitter clone, Threads. The news release emphasized that the plan was to make it a protocol interoperable with other apps, including Mastodon. Masnick celebrated with a long blog post.
The Streisand Effect
Masnick has a way of seeding ideas about technology that take root and grow.
In 2005, he wrote about legal threats against a website devoted to amassing urinal photos. (The early internet was a strange place.) The threats, intended to remove information about certain urinal owners, instead created their own news cycle and garnered more attention for the otherwise obscure site.
Masnick coined a phrase for an attempt to censor information on the internet that backfires: “the Streisand effect.”
In 2003, Barbra Streisand sued an aerial photographer who had put photos of her Malibu, California, beach house on his website, causing the little-seen images to go viral. Now the episode is internet lore, and the phrase has its own Wikipedia entry with a long list of examples.
It’s a typical Masnickian principle of the internet, gleaned from lengthy observation: Poorly thought-out attempts to solve online problems will make them worse.
“He understands the internet in a deep way that I don’t think is common,” said Corynne McSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The digital liberties organization gave Masnick an award for digital activism in 2017, when fighting a defamation lawsuit almost bankrupted Techdirt.
A man who claimed to have “invented email” had sued Techdirt for $15 million over its blog posts questioning those claims. The suit garnered significant media attention; it’s not among the examples in the Wikipedia article on the Streisand effect, but it really should be.
Masnick knew the lawsuit was ridiculous and unlikely to succeed, but the legal bills were a hardship. Techdirt turned to the internet and asked for donations. It got the support it needed, and the suit was eventually settled with no money changing hands.
Masnick got to continue evangelizing for tech innovation.
“I’m trying to get people to see the world the way I see it,” he said. “It’s cool when people can do stuff.”

Full text: Mr. Musk, the owner of Twitter, is the latest Silicon Valley mogul to pursue an all-in-one app, the kind that has thrived in Asia but not elsewhere.
Four years ago, a billionaire tech executive leading one of the world's pre-eminent social platforms laid out a vision to transform it into an app that could do it all. In an online manifesto, he wrote that the app would not only be central to written communications but have audio, video, payments, commerce and more.
The idea was akin to that of an "everything app" espoused recently by Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter. But the dream belonged to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In a 2019 blog post, Mr. Zuckerberg outlined how he would turn WhatsApp into an app that could be a platform for many "kinds of private services."
In Silicon Valley, the pursuit of an everything app has come up time and again as tech leaders have strained to expand their digital empires. Mr. Zuckerberg tried it. So did Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber. Evan Spiegel, the head of Snap, said he wanted to go for it, too.
Yet those efforts fell short, with the tech executives unable to replicate the magic that has abounded in Asia with "super apps" like China's WeChat, Japan's Line and South Korea's KakaoTalk. U.S. tech giants have instead run into cultural differences, regulatory scrutiny and a splintered financial system that has made the quest to build such apps more difficult.
And now Mr. Musk, who this week changed Twitter's name to X, the moniker for his everything app, is chasing the same goal -- and is likely to face the same challenges.
In the United States, people are "accustomed to single-service apps, which makes moving to a multiservice app a bit disorienting," said Dan Prud'homme, an assistant professor of business at Florida International University. "To some extent, U.S. customers don't like feeling that they are too beholden to a single firm for their everyday needs."
Mr. Musk has been enamored with an everything app since at least last year. Weeks before closing his $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October, he tweeted that his purchase would be "an accelerant to creating X, the everything app."
On Monday, he tweeted about Twitter's rebranding to X, writing: "In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird."
Yet Mr. Musk has said little publicly about what his everything app would look like, how it would function or why people would want to use it. In November, Twitter filed paperwork with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to become a payments processor, and employees have been building a payments service.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
His plan faces many doubters. He has "taken a wrecking ball to Twitter" and undermined how people use the platform, said Chris Messina, a tech entrepreneur and the creator of the hashtag. "It seems as if he's going to build a grab bag of different functions and ram it through the user base."
Much of the desire to create an everything app is rooted in Asia, where such apps have flourished for more than a decade. In Japan, people use Line, the country's dominant messaging platform, to store vaccination cards and shop for clothes. In South Korea, people turn to KakaoTalk, which started as a messaging service, to send money and request taxi rides.
None have been as successful as Tencent's WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than one billion people, mostly in China. WeChat dominates the mobile internet and is a one-stop shop to read news, talk with friends, order pizza or pay the landlord.
Many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have long considered WeChat the gold standard for mobile apps.
"If you go to China, you see how much easier everything is, and you say, 'I wish I had that for myself,"' said Ted Livingston, the founder of the messaging platform Kik, which is backed by Tencent. "WeChat is effectively the operating system of daily life in China."
In 2013, Snap's Mr. Spiegel also referred to Tencent as a model when it came to making money. In an interview last year with Axios, he spoke glowingly of Tencent's continued success with WeChat and said Snap was also building a "Snapchat super app." Tencent has invested in Snap, most recently in 2017.
In 2019, following Uber's initial public offering, Mr. Khosrowshahi echoed the super app mantra. He said he saw his ride-hailing app as the "Amazon of transportation" and wanted it to be the "operating system for your everyday life in a city."
That same year, Mr. Zuckerberg stated similar ambitions for WhatsApp. Mr. Zuckerberg has since added payment and commerce features to Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, though none have become an everything app.
That may come down to different regulatory and cultural environments, Mr. Messina, the entrepreneur, said. U.S. tech giants have come under heightened antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world, but Chinese tech companies that have Beijing's blessing have flourished, even amid a crackdown on tech power.
In November, Mr. Musk was asked at a companywide meeting at Twitter about his everything app idea, two people who attended the event said. An employee noted that there were fundamental differences between Twitter and Tencent, the people said.
Mr. Musk responded that the questioner didn't know what he was talking about, before asking for the next question, the two attendees said.
Mr. Musk has not held back on his predictions for X. "If done right," he said in a recent podcast interview, X could become "half of the global financial system."
Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's chief executive, has also appeared enthusiastic about X.
"X is the future state of unlimited interactivity -- centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking -- creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities," she tweeted on Sunday. "Powered by A.I., X will connect us all in ways we're just beginning to imagine."

Judge Rejects Hong Kong's Bid To Ban a Protest Song Online: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The authorities sought a court injunction that could have pressured Google and other tech firms to remove "Glory to Hong Kong."
The Hong Kong authorities suffered a surprising setback on Friday when a judge denied their request to ban a popular pro-democracy song from the internet.
The government was seeking an injunction that could have given it the power to force Google and other tech companies to restrict access to the song in Hong Kong.
Since coming under the tighter grip of Beijing several years ago, Hong Kong has jailed political opponents, quashed street protest and shuttered pro-democracy newspapers. But the internet, in contrast to mainland China, has remained largely free of government control.
At issue in Friday's ruling was "Glory to Hong Kong," which was the unofficial anthem of 2019 democracy protests and has been a continuing point of contention for the authorities, who consider it an insult to China's national anthem. It has been banned from Hong Kong schools and has drawn angry official rebukes when played, apparently by mistake, at sports competitions.
The Hong Kong government was seeking a court injunction against the publication or distribution of "Glory to Hong Kong" with "seditious intention" on the internet or in other media.
But Judge Anthony Chan denied the request, ruling that what the government wanted was too broad and effectively targeted everyone in Hong Kong. He wrote that the injunction could have had a "chilling effect" on free speech in Hong Kong.
"Freedom of expression is not absolute in nature but is nonetheless a highly important right that cannot be lawfully restricted without the requirements of legal certainty and proportionality being met," he added.
Judge Chan also said that it would have been wrong to grant the injunction because existing criminal laws already gave the authorities the power to prosecute people for spreading the song, and that this ban would have been difficult to enforce, and unnecessary. Numerous people in Hong Kong have been arrested or charged for playing the song in public under an expansive national security law that Beijing imposed on the territory in 2020.
The injunction case has been closely watched in the Hong Kong business and tech communities. Foreign firms seeking access to China have long seen the city as an attractive hub, away from censorship controls in the rest of the country.
The Hong Kong government argued in court that "Glory to Hong Kong" should be banned because it could mislead people into thinking that Hong Kong is an independent state. When Google refused a public request to remove the song in December, Hong Kong's security chief called the company's decision "unthinkable."
The injunction request filed by the government in June did not name Google but listed 32 links to "Glory to Hong Kong" on Google or its sibling company YouTube.
The Department of Justice said in a statement that it was studying the ruling and "considering the way forward." Google and Meta said Friday that they would not comment on the ruling.
Legal experts and business leaders said they were surprised by the decision, given the Hong Kong courts' record in ruling on behalf of the government in matters concerning national security. Some said they were encouraged that the judge was willing to hold the government in check.
Kristian Odebjer, a lawyer and the chairman of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said he welcomed the judge's decision. The "Glory to Hong Kong" case had risked "muddling" the city's reputation as a place where the internet is open, he said. In China, the authorities block content and websites they don't like, a system called the Great Firewall.
"The fact that Hong Kong is outside of the Great Firewall, that we have a free flow of information and a free internet, that is clearly the key fundament in what Hong Kong is offering the world, and a key differentiator," he said.
Kevin Yam, a legal researcher and former Hong Kong lawyer now based in Melbourne, Australia, called Judge Chan's ruling "brave" but also noted that the judge emphasized the significance of the national security law in his decision.
"National security goes to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, the core interests of Hong Kong people," Judge Chan wrote.
On top of the existing national security law, the Hong Kong government is working to pass legislation against subversive actions and content that it describes as "soft resistance" and said it planned to close "internet loopholes."
Multinational companies have gradually reduced their presence in Hong Kong since 2020. Stringent travel and quarantine rules during the pandemic triggered a wave of departures of executives and skilled workers. Some companies have moved computer servers storing sensitive information to new business hubs elsewhere in Asia, like Singapore.
Facebook and Twitter were blocked from mainland China in 2009. A year later, Google shut down its China services and rerouted users to its search engine in Hong Kong, then a bastion of political freedom on Chinese soil.
Since the national security law was put in place, requests to tech companies by the Hong Kong authorities to remove content on the internet have soared.
Eric Lai, a visiting researcher at King's College London School of Law, said he didn't expect Friday's decision to be the final word on "Glory to Hong Kong."
"We have to wait and see how the government of Hong Kong will respond and whether there will be more political pressures from Beijing," Dr. Lai said.

LOS ANGELES — Four years ago, a billionaire tech executive leading one of the world’s preeminent social platforms laid out a vision to transform it into an app that could do it all.

The Market Surge Comes to an End: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks fell Thursday, taking some air out of Wall Street's big recent rally, despite fatter-than-expected profit reports from big companies and the latest signals of a resilient economy.
The S&P 500 sank 0.6 percent after touching its highest level in nearly 16 months during the morning. The Dow Jones industrial average also flipped from an early gain to a loss and dropped 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 percent.
Honeywell International was a heavy weight on the market despite reporting stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected. It dropped 5.7 percent after its revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, as did its forecast for earnings in the current quarter.
The dip for Wall Street put a halt to a torrid run where the Dow climbed for 13 straight days. It was up as many as 125 points Thursday morning and seemed to be on the verge of tying a win-streak record set in 1897, before it ran out of momentum.
Stocks have been roaring on hopes the Federal Reserve can pull off what earlier seemed like a long-shot bet: successfully pull down high inflation by raising interest rates without sending the economy into a painful recession.
But critics have been saying the market's sharp move upward has been too much, too fast and that the seemingly growing consensus about a "soft landing" for the economy is hardly a certainty.
"The move is very explainable, but I stop short of calling it justifiable because I think it's too early to go all in on the idea that the Fed can claim victory" over high inflation, said Bryant VanCronkhite, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.
"We still have to be humble about our ability to predict the long-term effects of what we're living through, including the rapid rise in interest rates and recovery from a pandemic that forced massive changes in the labor force and supply chains," he said.
Reports about the economy on Thursday were mostly encouraging, but Mr. VanCronkhite said they could also keep the pressure up on inflation.
Strong data on the job market in particular could mean U.S. households will keep spending, encouraging companies to keep raising prices.
That in turn could push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than expected, keeping alive the threat of a recession.
In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied after the wave of reports indicated the economy is in stronger shape than expected.
One estimate said growth for the overall economy accelerated in the spring. That easily topped forecasts from economists, who were expecting a slowdown from the first three months of the year.
That report also suggested a measure of inflation wasn't as high from April through June as expected.
Another report said fewer workers applied for jobless benefits last week. It's the latest indication the job market remains remarkably solid, while a third report said orders for long-lasting manufactured goods strengthened more than expected last month.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.01 percent from 3.85 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.92 percent from 4.85 percent.
Thursday's drops for stocks came despite a stronger-than-expected profit report from Meta Platforms, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks.
The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp attracted additional active members, and its stock rose 4.4 percent.
McDonald's rose 1.2 percent after it easily topped analysts' forecasts for profits during the spring and said its sales grew worldwide.

Takeover Threatens To Erase a Nation's 'Hard-Won Gains': [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Military mutineers said that they had ousted the country's elected leader. The move shakes a pillar of democracy in West Africa.
After a day of uncertainty in Niger on Wednesday, a cluster of uniformed soldiers took to state television to announce that they had seized control, ousting Mohamed Bazoum, the country's democratically elected president.
Anti-coup demonstrators clashed with security forces in Niamey, the capital, and the military putschists subsequently declared a nationwide curfew, announcing that they would also shutter the country's borders.
Although the foreign minister maintained that Mr. Bazoum remained the sole "legitimate power" in Niger and that the military was not united in the attempted coup, a statement from the army command on Thursday said that its forces supported the coup efforts.
Here's what to know about the attempted takeover.
What happened in Niger?
Members of the country's Presidential Guard encircled the president's palace in Niamey on Wednesday morning and held Mr. Bazoum hostage. For hours, an anxious country waited to see whether the crisis would be resolved quietly, with little clear information about either the rebels' identities or whether the president was safe.
Hundreds of demonstrators against the coup briefly took to the streets of Niamey on Wednesday afternoon to demand Mr. Bazoum's release before being violently dispersed by security forces.
That night, the mutineers declared that they had "put an end to the regime."
Col. Amadou Abdramane, a spokesman for those attempting the coup, read out a printed statement justifying their actions as a response to "the deteriorating security situation and bad social and economic governance." Niger faces several Islamist insurgencies in its southern region, and people across the country have been feeling the strain from the rising cost of living.
Colonel Abdramane was flanked by the deputy military chief of staff and senior members of the National Guard and Presidential Guard. And on Thursday, the country's military appeared to formally back the takeover, saying that it was necessary to avoid strife between branches of the country's security forces.
The Nigerien government called on the public to reject the attempted military takeover and defend the country's democracy.
"The hard-won gains will be safeguarded," Mr. Bazoum wrote on Facebook. "All Nigeriens who love democracy and freedom will see to it."
What could the events mean for the region?
A successful coup could deal a fatal blow to Niger's nascent democracy.
The country has been subjected to four military coups since gaining independence from France in 1960. Mr. Bazoum, president since 2021, had taken the reins in Niger's first peaceful, democratic transition since independence -- though elements in the military also attempted an unsuccessful takeover just two days before his swearing-in.
Mr. Bazoum had recently begun making changes in the ranks, pushing out the army chief of staff and forcing some other top generals into retirement, moves that may have antagonized the military, said Ibrahim Yahaya Ibrahim, an expert in the stretch of Africa known as the Sahel, which includes Niger, for the International Crisis Group.
But the military was also exploiting growing Nigerien public "disenchantment" with the country's democratic experiment, Mr. Ibrahim said. Mr. Bazoum "had achievements, but when you compare the achievements to people's expectations, they were much higher," he added.
The events could also affect dynamics in the region, which has been marred by insurgencies, aging dictators and military coups.
Niger's U.S.-backed government has been a critical ally for Western countries seeking to quash Islamist insurgencies in the Sahel. Over 1,100 American troops are based in Niger.
Mr. Bazoum's alignment with France had drawn the ire of some in the military who opposed the presence of Western forces in the country, Mr. Ibrahim said.
At least three other countries in West Africa -- Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali -- have had military coups since 2020. Western observers fear that a military junta in Niger could mimic events in neighboring Mali, whose putschists eventually expelled a United Nations peacekeeping force, while building close ties with Russia's Wagner mercenaries.
The Economic Community of West African States -- a union of 15 countries in the region -- denounced the attempted coup. President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria, who chairs the body, said that its members "shall not waiver or flinch in our resolve to defend and preserve constitutional order." Benin's president, Patrice Talon, would travel to Niamey to try to mediate a solution, Mr. Tinubu said.
How has the broader international community responded?
The United States and France, two of Niger's main allies, have strongly supported Mr. Bazoum.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called the embattled president on Wednesday to convey Washington's "unwavering support," the State Department said in a news release.
Mr. Blinken suggested that American economic and security assistance to Niger could be threatened should the coup go forward. The partnership "depends on the continuation of democratic governance and respect for the rule of law and human rights," he said.
France has deployed forces in Niger in an attempt to fight militant groups such as Boko Haram, but the ousting of the country's democratically elected leader could throw the future of that partnership into doubt, too.
António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said in a statement that he condemned "any effort to seize power by force and to undermine democratic governance" in Niger.

Meta Profit Climbs 16% In Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street investors were hoping the social media giant would regain its footing after more than a year of problems, including slumping ad sales.
Long before it was called Meta, Facebook was a Wall Street darling because of its breakneck growth and big profits. But the company had lost its luster with investors over the past 18 months thanks to a slump in ad sales and what some saw as self-inflicted wounds.
On Wednesday, the company appeared to regain some of its footing. Meta said its revenue for the second quarter jumped 11 percent from a year earlier, to $ 32 billion. Profits rose 16 percent, to $ 7.8 billion, fueled in part by improvements made to Meta's advertising technology using artificial intelligence, as well as other product tweaks.
Meta's improving finances are the second indication in two days that the online ad market, after a long slump brought on by a slowing economy, is showing signs of improvement. On Tuesday, Google's parent company, Alphabet, also reported strong quarterly results, powered by ads for the Google search engine and renewed momentum for YouTube.
"We continue to see strong engagement across our apps, and we have the most exciting road map I've seen in a while," Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, said in a statement. He also pointed to some of the company's high points over the quarter, including the release of new A.I. technology and Meta's answer to Twitter: Threads.
The results, which surpassed Wall Street's expectations, were bolstered further by the company's making more money from Reels, its TikTok-like video product inside Instagram, which Meta owns. More than 3.88 billion people each month had used one or more of Meta's apps, which include Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook proper, in the most recent quarter, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of $ 7.45 billion on sales of $ 31.1 billion, according to data compiled by FactSet. Shares of Meta rose 6 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.
In what Mr. Zuckerberg has called his "year of efficiency," Meta has laid off more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg has also tightened spending in some divisions, and flattened the hierarchy of an organization he has spent nearly two decades building.
Wall Street has appreciated the changes. Meta's stock has more than tripled to nearly $ 300 a share, up from a low of $ 90.70 in November.
"Now that we've gotten through layoffs, the rest of 2023 will be about creating stability," Mr. Zuckerberg said on a conference call with investors on Wednesday.
Threads, which was released this month, became the most rapidly downloaded app ever in less than a day. Though interest in the app had cooled in recent weeks, the positive response to it from internet users was a welcome change from the tepid consumer reaction to the virtual reality products that Mr. Zuckerberg had said were key to his company's future.
Mr. Zuckerberg is also in a race to make advances in artificial intelligence technology. Meta had long invested in A.I. but was slow to show its technology until competitors like OpenAI and Google released A.I. chatbots. Last week, Meta released LLaMA 2, a powerful A.I. system that the company hopes developers will embrace.
Even as Meta's revenues bounced back, the company said it planned to continue investing in the business. Meta said it expected its capital expenditures to rise in 2024, largely because of higher spending on infrastructure, such as servers and the powerful computers that undergird the company's A.I. systems. Meta also anticipated that hiring costs would rise as the company tried to recruit more top A.I. talent, who rank among some of the highest-paid in the industry.
"Investments that we've made over the years in A.I. are clearly paying off," Mr. Zuckerberg said, noting that the company's A.I. systems have added to a 7 percent increase in time spent across the company's platforms.
Susan Li, Meta's chief financial officer, said A.I. helped advertisers better measure the performance of their ads, which had, in turn, increased how much money they spent on Meta's ad products.
Instagram Reels also saw significant growth, the company said, though executives anticipate that it will take some time to make as much money from Reels as the company currently does from other products like Instagram Stories, as well as the lucrative ads in the main Instagram feed.
Mr. Zuckerberg has also reemphasized his commitment to the metaverse, the name used for virtual reality and from which the company derived its new name. The company shows no signs of slowing down spending on building the headsets running Meta's augmented and virtual reality software, though it expects that the bet may take years to pay off. Meta's Reality Labs division posted an operating loss of $ 3.7 billion for the quarter.
"I can't guarantee you I'm going to be right about this bet," Mr. Zuckerberg told investors on the conference call. "But I do think this is the direction the world is going in."
"I do think we're going to be happy that we did this," he added.

Internet Censorship By Russia Has Soared 30-Fold During War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A report from Citizen Lab laid out how much online censorship has increased on one of Russia's biggest social media sites.
What's the difference between Russia's internet before and after the invasion of Ukraine? The answer: a thirtyfold increase in censorship.
That was the finding of a report published on Wednesday by Citizen Lab, a group from the University of Toronto that studies online censorship in authoritarian countries. The new report was one of the first attempts to quantify the extent of Russian internet censorship since the war began in February 2022.
To compile its findings, Citizen Lab analyzed more than 300 court orders from the Russian government against Vkontakte, one of the country's largest social media sites, demanding that it remove accounts, posts, videos and other content. Before the war, Russia's government issued internet takedown orders to Vkontakte, known as VK, once every 50 days on average. After the conflict began, that number jumped to nearly once a day, according to Citizen Lab.
Often the court orders focused on getting VK to remove news from independent media sites, as well as posts and accounts that expressed opposition to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin or the war. The government also used keyword blocking to censor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer terms on the site, the report said.
"These findings suggest the extreme political sensitivity of the Ukraine war in Russia and in Russia's need to tightly control Russians' access to information regarding the invasion," said Jeffrey Knockel, one of the report's authors.
The limits on VK are a part of a wider effort by Russian authorities to use technology to shape public opinion and crack down on dissent. That campaign also includes a wider internet censorship system, a propaganda blitz and the deployment of digital surveillance tools to track people's mobile phones and online activities.
Since the war began, Russia has also blocked access to some international sites, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. To get around the bans, many in Russia have taken to using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are tools that circumvent those controls.
Despite Mr. Putin's determination to limit what can be said online, Russia's bureaucracy has not had great success in responding to real-time events. When Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary Wagner Group, turned against the Kremlin last month, Russia's censors blocked some content related to the mutiny -- like Mr. Prigozhin's name and that of the Wagner Group -- but proved ineffective at stopping widespread discussion and even media articles about what had transpired.
Platforms like Telegram and YouTube remain available in Russia and are widely used sources of information.
In the report, Citizen Lab researchers also compared content on VK that was available in Canada, where the site is less restricted, against what was not viewable to internet users in Russia. Citizen Lab found evidence of personal accounts, videos and community groups blocked from Russian users, much of it related to the war.
Russia's online content purges are small compared with those in other authoritarian countries such as China and Iran. Yet the techniques the countries use are similar.
The primary way Russian censors cut content on VK was by blocking community and personal accounts on the site. But Russian authorities also employed other techniques that are common in China, including measures to prevent users from searching for specific words on the site.

Hot Dogs, From Purebreds to Rescued Strays: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Skippy's on Staten Island is worth the hunt.
My sister sent me a TikTok in which the comedian Matt Bellassai shares his hourslong journey to New York City's last Dairy Queen, on Staten Island, only to find that it's closed. This week, I found myself in a similar situation: I drove to Staten Island on a Monday in search of the family-owned Skippy's Hot Dog Truck, a local legend that has posted up on Hylan Boulevard for 61 years. After circling the block for 30 minutes and chatting with a group of locals, I had to admit defeat.
And so began my journey for what might be the city's most elusive hot dog. Defeated but not deflated, I reached out to a Staten Island food reporter who'd covered the truck extensively. I dug through Instagram posts. I Googled and sorted through Reddit threads. Nothing. I had a hot-dog-shaped hole in my heart that needed filling, so here are the hot dogs that held me over until I finally found Skippy's.
Smoked franks and luxury pigs in a blanket
I headed for the lower level of Chelsea Market for a highly praised hot dog at Dickson's Farmstand Meats. It's made with beef and pork, and smoked over hickory and apple wood. The sausage is longer than the bun, which I've always regarded as a good sign vis-à-vis hot dogs. The hot dog was snappy and full-bodied, still managing to shine under a layer of raw onions, jalapeños and Kewpie mayo. The bun could use work, but I'm not holding it against them.
The next day, while working sources on Staten Island, I happened upon an email about what might be the most expensive pigs in a blanket in New York City. The culprit: the Bar Room, a power-lunch offshoot of the Modern, at the Museum of Modern Art. For $ 32 -- surpassing even the celebrated $ 29 hot dog at Mischa -- you get two bite-size Wagyu hot dogs nestled in crispy potato rolls and topped with caviar, dill oil and fried egg mustard sauce. As far as gimmicks go, it's worth it, especially if you consider yourself a pig-in-a-blanket aficionado.
Finding Skippy's
In case you think I had somehow lost the proletarian hot dog thread here, I followed that up with a stop at the 110-year-old Fulton Hot Dog King, in Downtown Brooklyn. Its standard hot dog, a skinny little thing, is passable. The hot sausage, however, is glorious. The gentleman manning the grill warned me that it was spicy, but it was exactly how I like it: with a nice, gentle burn that clears the sinuses and doesn't make you cry.
Still, I had Skippy's on my mind. So you can imagine my excitement when a response from Pamela Silvestri, the food editor of The Staten Island Advance, popped up in my inbox. And that's how I ended up sitting in the driver's seat of Skippy's Hot Dog Truck on a Saturday afternoon, breezily chatting with its third-generation owner and operator, Dawn LaVigne, who said she'd been working in the truck "since I'm 11."
The hot dogs are floppy Sabretts pulled from hot water, standard for trucks. But it's the toppings that have always been the draw: homemade chili and onions, recipes created by Ms. LaVigne's grandmother. A combination of both with brown mustard will set you right. The cherry on top was watching locals, many of whom have been coming to the truck since they were children, talk with Ms. LaVigne about their families -- "You get to share people's lives," she said -- while ribbing her over whether she takes cards. (She categorically does not.) She also doesn't show up when it's raining or too hot, a policy that I would love to adopt. But I'll just have to settle for a job that pays me to eat this many hot dogs.

Lawsuits Ask If Big Tech Is to Blame For Massacre: [National Desk]

Full text: Two new lawsuits filed by the victims' families are the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire.
Ask the families of the victims of last year's racist massacre in Buffalo what they want and one goal comes up again and again.
"To hold anybody and everybody, in anything and everything, that had a part in what happened to my mother and the other nine, what was done in Buffalo, to hold them accountable," said Garnell W. Whitfield Jr., whose mother, Ruth, was one of 10 people -- all of them Black -- who were killed.
That longing for accountability has resulted in two new civil lawsuits filed by the Buffalo families, the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire. But even as such massacres continue, seemingly unabated, lawsuit after lawsuit against tech giants has thus far failed to award victims and their families in court.
Indeed, the Buffalo suits will face significant challenges, experts in digital law say, with some blunt predictions as to their likelihood for success.
"It's not going to work," said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University's law school and a co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.
In recent years, a handful of cases involving social media and tragic incidents have advanced past preliminary stages, including two lawsuits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks in Istanbul and Paris that reached the Supreme Court. But the nation's highest court rebuffed both efforts to hold companies, including Google and Twitter, liable for Islamic State videos appearing on their sites.
The primary legal obstacle, Mr. Goldman and others say, remains Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides protection to online companies from liability from third-party content published on their sites. Drafted in the incipient days of the internet, the statute was meant to protect internet companies from lawsuits over speech published in chat rooms or other forums.
But as the decades have passed, critics say, its scope has broadened, even as calls to narrow it have grown.
"The vast majority of courts have really indulged this very excessive, unqualified immunity approach to the reading of Section 230," said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who has advocated reforms to Section 230. "There hasn't been a case, I think, exactly like this one. But if you look at some of the other attempts to hold social media companies accountable for acts of terrorism, et cetera, they've mostly lost."
All of which galls people like Barbara Massey-Mapps, whose sister, Katherine, was also murdered in the Buffalo attack, during which the gunman used an assault rifle to shoot 13 customers and employees of a Tops supermarket. Three people survived.
The gunman, Payton Gendron, an avowed white supremacist, livestreamed his attack. He had written voluminous online diaries filled with racist content and references to so-called "replacement theory," which posits a nefarious conspiracy to replace white people with people of color.
And Ms. Massey-Mapps, 66, believes that social media is to blame for introducing him and others to such ideas, and for using algorithms that are capable of feeding a steady stream of videos to people seeking racist or other hateful content.
"This wouldn't spread as fast if you didn't have Facebook or YouTube or what have you," she said. "There's so much negativity, so much ugliness. And I'm like, Why?"
Ms. Massey-Mapps was among three victims' families and an employee of Tops who filed suit in May against social media companies, including Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube). A second suit was filed this month by a legal team led by Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who said he intended to use the gunman's own admission that he was influenced by social media to prove the case and set a new precedent.
"The laws, the technical justifications, always exist until they don't exist anymore," Mr. Crump said, "Until people say, We can't condone this."
For opponents of Section 230, there have been glimmers of hope: In 2021, a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco -- Lemmon v. Snap -- limited the immunity provided by the law, in a case involving a so-called "speed filter" on Snapchat, which encouraged speeding in cars and had led to the deaths of three teenagers using the filter.
A recent case in Oregon -- against the anonymous chat site Omegle, which has been used by some sexual predators -- has also overcome Section 230 challenges. It is in the discovery phase and is headed to trial, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.
Like those cases, the suits filed in Buffalo argue that the social media platforms in question are essentially dangerous products, an effort to sidestep the content protections provided by Section 230. The two suits -- filed in state court in Erie County -- use nearly identical language, referring to the apps as "defective" and suggesting they were designed to be addictive to users and to encourage violence.
The Supreme Court, however, dealt blows to opponents of Section 230 in May, when it ruled against plaintiffs in the two suits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks seeking damages from Google and Twitter.
Jess Miers, legal advocacy counsel for Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group that represents tech firms such as Google and Meta, said that those Supreme Court decisions reinforced the protections provided by Section 230, while allowing websites leeway to crack down on hateful posts.
While "these tools and algorithms inadvertently amplify objectionable content," she added, the Section 230 protections are "crucial to ensure that social media companies can continue using algorithms" to monitor and minimize "harmful content."
José Castañeda, a spokesman for Google, said the company had "the deepest sympathies" for victims and families of the Tops shooting, and said that "YouTube has invested in technology, teams and policies to identify and remove extremist content."
Google also works with law enforcement and other platforms "to share intelligence and best practices," he added.
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy's Cyber Science Department, said that the Buffalo suits could face additional challenges over free speech, as hate speech was constitutionally protected, with the exception of "true threat or imminent incitement of violence."
In recent years, there has been increased attention on the effects of social media on young people -- including a warning from the surgeon general in May. And Mr. Kosseff says such anti-tech sentiments could begin to suffuse legal arguments.
"We've had a lot of judges, particularly in cases against big tech companies, who are not very big fans of big tech companies," Mr. Kosseff said. "So that's why I would never say it's absolutely doomed."
Mr. Gendron, now 20, has already faced criminal charges: In February, he pleaded guilty in state court and was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. He also faces federal charges, including hate crimes, some of which could carry the death penalty.
At a news conference to announce the second lawsuit, family member after family member stepped up to the podium, some in tears, others stoic, to describe their pain.
"It doesn't turn off for me," said Kimberly Salter, whose husband, Aaron, a retired Buffalo police officer, was killed while working as a security guard at Tops and hailed as a hero afterward. "I'm sure it doesn't turn off for the other families either."

X Will Replace Twitter's Bird, Musk Declares: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech billionaire indicated he would replace the company's blue bird silhouette with an X.
Elon Musk said he was about to make one of the most visible changes to Twitter since he took control of the social media company last fall: replacing its widely recognized bird logo.
In a tweet early Sunday morning Eastern time, Mr. Musk said that "soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds."
He added shortly after, "If a good enough X logo is posted tonight," it would "go live worldwide tomorrow."
"X" is a term for what Mr. Musk has described as an "everything app" that could combine social media, instant messaging and payment services, akin to the popular Chinese app WeChat.
Mr. Musk has said that buying Twitter is "an accelerant to creating X," and the corporate entity he created to purchase and control Twitter is called X Holdings.
Mr. Musk spoke on a Twitter audio livestream early Sunday to say he was changing Twitter's logo. "It should have been done a long time ago," he said. "Sorry it took so long."
A few hours later, Mr. Musk said in an email to Twitter's employees that "we are indeed changing to X" and that it was happening "today." "This is my last message from a Twitter email," he wrote, before signing off with a salute emoji.
Mr. Musk has few barriers to making such alterations at the company after taking it private as part of his acquisition of the firm. But he could still encounter resistance from the banks that have lent him billions of dollars and the private investors he brought into the deal, who could raise concerns about jettisoning one of Twitter's most visible assets.
The company saw its advertising revenue plummet amid the departure of sales executives and worries that the site had become more prone to problematic content. It now faces a well-funded rival in Threads, the recently introduced Twitter-like service from Meta, the owner of Facebook.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Musk has had a long affinity for the letter X. In 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online bank, and later merged it with another start-up to create PayPal. In 2017, he said that he repurchased the X.com domain from PayPal.
Mr. Musk has not always followed through on his public pronouncements, such as when he tweeted that the company would create a content moderation council to judge what kind of speech is acceptable on the site.
But he has pressed ahead in altering certain Twitter practices, like ending the free verification of prominent users' accounts, denoted by a white-and-blue check mark, and charging users a subscription fee for the check mark instead.

Are Google and Meta to Blame for the Racist Massacre in Buffalo?

BUFFALO, N.Y. — Ask the families of the victims of last year’s racist massacre in Buffalo what they want and one goal comes up again and again.
“To hold anybody and everybody, in anything and everything, that had a part in what happened to my mother and the other nine, what was done in Buffalo, to hold them accountable,” said Garnell W. Whitfield Jr., whose mother, Ruth, was one of 10 people — all of them Black — who were killed.
That longing for accountability has resulted in two new lawsuits filed by the Buffalo families, the most recent attempt to hold social media companies responsible when men steeped in violent ideologies on those platforms open fire. But even as such massacres continue, seemingly unabated, lawsuit after lawsuit against tech giants has thus far failed to award victims and their families in court.
Indeed, the Buffalo suits will face significant challenges, experts in digital law say, with some blunt predictions as to their likelihood for success.
“It’s not going to work,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University’s law school and a co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.
In recent years, a handful of cases involving social media and tragic incidents have advanced past preliminary stages, including two lawsuits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks in Istanbul and Paris that reached the Supreme Court. But the nation’s highest court rebuffed both efforts to hold companies, including Google and Twitter, liable for Islamic State group videos appearing on their sites.
The primary legal obstacle, Goldman and others say, remains Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides protection to online companies from liability from third-party content published on their sites. Drafted in the incipient days of the internet, the statute was meant to protect internet companies from lawsuits over speech published in chat rooms or other forums.
But as the decades have passed, critics say, its scope has broadened, even as calls to narrow it have grown.
“The vast majority of courts have really indulged this very excessive, unqualified immunity approach to the reading of Section 230,” said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who has advocated reforms to Section 230. “There hasn’t been a case, I think, exactly like this one. But if you look at some of the other attempts to hold social media companies accountable for acts of terrorism, etc., they’ve mostly lost.”
All of which galls people such as Barbara Massey-Mapps, whose sister, Katherine, was murdered in the Buffalo attack, during which the assailant used an assault rifle to shoot 13 customers and employees of a Tops supermarket. Three people survived.
The shooter, Payton Gendron, an avowed white supremacist, livestreamed his attack. He had written voluminous online diaries filled with racist content and references to so-called “replacement theory,” which posits a nefarious conspiracy to replace white people with people of color.
And Massey-Mapps, 66, believes that social media is to blame for introducing him and others to such ideas, and for using algorithms that are capable of feeding a steady stream of videos to people seeking racist or other hateful content.
“This wouldn’t spread as fast if you didn’t have Facebook or YouTube or what have you,” she said. “There’s so much negativity, so much ugliness. And I’m like, why?”
Massey-Mapps was among three victims’ families and an employee of Tops who filed suit in May against social media companies, including Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube). A second suit was filed this month by a legal team led by Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who said he intended to use the assailant’s own admission that he was influenced by social media to prove the case and set a precedent.
“The laws, the technical justifications, always exist until they don’t exist anymore,” Crump said, “until people say, ‘We can’t condone this.’ ”
For opponents of Section 230, there have been glimmers of hope: In 2021, a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco — Lemmon v. Snap — limited the immunity provided by the law, in a case involving a so-called “speed filter” on Snapchat, which encouraged speeding in cars and had led to the deaths of three teenagers using the filter.
A recent case in Oregon — against the anonymous chat site Omegle, which has been used by some sexual predators — has also overcome Section 230 challenges. It is in the discovery phase and is headed to trial, the plaintiffs’ attorneys said.
Like those cases, the suits filed in Buffalo argue that the social media platforms in question are essentially dangerous products, an effort to sidestep content protections provided by Section 230. The two suits — filed in state court in Erie County — use nearly identical language, referring to the apps as “defective” and suggesting they were designed to be addictive to users and to encourage violence.
The Supreme Court, however, dealt blows to opponents of Section 230 in May, when it ruled against plaintiffs in the two suits brought by families of victims of terrorist attacks seeking damages from Google and Twitter.
Jess Miers, legal advocacy counsel for Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group that represents tech firms such as Google and Meta, said those Supreme Court decisions reinforced the protections provided by Section 230, while allowing websites leeway to crack down on hateful posts.
While “these tools and algorithms inadvertently amplify objectionable content,” she added, the Section 230 protections are “crucial to ensure that social media companies can continue using algorithms” to monitor and minimize “harmful content.”
José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, said the company had “the deepest sympathies” for victims and families of the Tops shooting, and said that “YouTube has invested in technology, teams and policies to identify and remove extremist content.”
Google also works with law enforcement and other platforms “to share intelligence and best practices,” he added.
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy’s Cyber Science Department, said the Buffalo suits could face additional challenges over free speech, as hate speech was constitutionally protected, with the exception of “true threat or imminent incitement of violence .”
In recent years, there has been increased attention on the effects of social media on young people — including a warning from the surgeon general in May. And Kosseff says such anti-tech sentiments could begin to suffuse legal arguments.
“We’ve had a lot of judges, particularly in cases against Big Tech companies, who are not very big fans of Big Tech companies,” Kosseff said. “So that’s why I would never say it’s absolutely doomed.”
Gendron, now 20, has faced criminal charges: In February, he pleaded guilty in state court and was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. He also faces federal charges, including hate crimes, some of which could carry the death penalty.
At a news conference to announce the second lawsuit, family member after family member stepped up to the podium, some in tears, others stoic, to describe their pain.
“It doesn’t turn off for me,” said Kimberly Salter, whose husband, Aaron, a retired Buffalo police officer, was killed while working as a security guard at Tops and hailed as a hero afterward. “I’m sure it doesn’t turn off for the other families either.”

Full text: A reader asks which details of her marriage -- if any -- she is obligated to share with her visiting mother-in-law.
My husband and I have been married for 12 years and have a 7-year-old daughter. We no longer share a bedroom or have sex, but we continue living together peacefully to raise our child. My mother-in-law discovered our separate bedrooms while I was out of town: She was helping to care for our daughter and asking lots of questions, so my daughter told her. Since then, she asked a close friend about our situation -- which bothered me. But she's never said anything to me. Now, she and my father-in-law are planning a visit and she's asking many questions about their sleeping arrangements. She even offered to sleep on an air mattress. I told her she was welcome to take our daughter's room, as always, and our daughter would move to the guest room (just as she did before my husband started sleeping there). Am I obliged to discuss this with her?
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
You have no duty to discuss your sleeping arrangements or sex life with anyone. I understand it was upsetting to learn that your mother-in-law had grilled your daughter and friend about you. (The mystery here is why she didn't simply ask her son about her suspicions.) Still, she took care of your daughter. That was nice of her. And her questions about her coming visit may reflect sensitivity to your situation: Is it OK for your husband to move back in with you if your daughter takes the room that he now uses?
I would discuss this with your husband and propose telling your mother-in-law that you sleep in separate bedrooms -- and not a word more. It clears the air about something she sort of knows already, and it's not uncommon: About 20 percent of married couples sleep in separate rooms. She may be worried. So, reassure her that everything is under control.
Now, you know her better than I do. If you think that raising the subject with her will lead to prying questions, just tell her you sleep better in separate rooms -- which may be true for a host of reasons. Be direct, but set limits about your privacy.
Views, the Rare Resource Not Diminished by Sharing
I booked a flight from Denver to Aspen way in advance so I could choose a seat with a good view. The flight path is over the Rocky Mountains. I knew it would be thrilling and looked forward to the ride. About halfway through the flight, a passenger asked if I would swap seats with his young daughter so she could have a better view. She'd been jabbering that her seat wasn't as good. I refused politely. The family and other passengers gave me dirty looks. Did I do the right thing?
FRANK
Commercial air travel, as with other forms of shared transportation, is a brave experiment in community -- often, under lousy circumstances: crowded, cramped and depersonalized. I get that you booked your seat well in advance. You had every right to keep it. In a different context, though, I bet you wouldn't have minded letting a little girl enjoy your view for 10 minutes. It may not even have taken that long for her to get bored with it.
Workplace Annoyance, or Medical Condition?
I work in a shared office with six people. One of my co-workers belches these incredibly loud, frat-boy burps all day long. Once, she did it seven times in an hour! It's been going on for months, and I'm not sure how to address it. But it completely grosses me out, and it's so rude. What can I do?
CO-WORKER
Disgust is not a constructive starting point for fixing most problems -- though I might feel the same if I were in your office chair. Try to reframe this issue: It sounds as if your colleague has reflux or another medical condition that I am equally unqualified to diagnose.
Speak to your manager about the situation. If there is no manager, speak gently to your co-worker. She may not know she has a problem or may think there's nothing she can do about it, but there probably is if someone persuades her kindly to seek medical attention. So, the question here is: Are you that compassionate person?
A Hard-Earned Title Worth Demanding
I am a retired judge. Like many judicial retirees, I work as a private arbitrator, occasionally on panels of three. I am working on a panel now with a retired judge from another state. On conference calls, he refers to himself as Judge Smith and to me as Miss Jones -- even after he's heard the lawyers call me Judge Jones. Should I let this go, or take it up with him and the agency that books our cases?
JUDGE
To me, it seems just as premature to let this go as it does to report the man to the agency that hires you both. You are peers and have nothing to fear from him. Speak up! Tell him you want to be called Judge Jones -- the same honorific you use for him. If he doesn't, then report him. There is probably some degree of sexism baked into his current behavior, but you won't know how much until you point out his error directly.

Full text: On Long Island, the fascinated and obsessed come to gawk at the house where the suspect lived. Some bring the children.
Scarlett Fascetti approached the dilapidated red house as if it were a shrine.
"I couldn't wait to see it. I'm so into this thing," said Ms. Fascetti, 51, a teacher who had traveled 30 miles from her Long Island town to a section of Massapequa Park that has become an instant tourist attraction for a dark reason: It is the home of Rex Heuermann, the architect charged last week in the Gilgo Beach serial killings.
Ms. Fascetti could already reel off details about the killings and had quickly gotten up to speed on the three murder charges against Mr. Heuermann. She knew everything from precisely how 11 bodies had been found along Ocean Parkway to the vehicle Mr. Heuermann had in his driveway.
Mr. Heuermann, who is being held without bail at a Suffolk County jail, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he met women who were working as escorts, then killed them and wrapped them in burlap to bury them along a stretch of barrier island on the South Shore.
Since his arrest on July 13, hundreds of wide-eyed people from across Long Island and beyond have come each day to the home, about five miles from Gilgo Beach, where Mr. Heuermann lived with his wife and two grown children. They have clustered outside police tape on the edge of his block.
The site on the otherwise unremarkable corner of First and Michigan Avenues in this sleepy bedroom community allows a vantage into the red house, a crime scene that for days has been searched by investigators, while Mr. Heuermann's family has not been seen at home. His wife, Asa Ellerup, has filed for divorce, her lawyer, Robert A. Macedonio, confirmed on Wednesday.
Some bike over or walk the dog from nearby blocks; some trek from distant towns or other states. Once-near-empty streets are lined with cars from sunup to sundown, parked by true-crime addicts, serial killer aficionados and some people obsessed specifically with the Gilgo Beach murders.
"It's part of history," said Lidia Feldman, 26, who lives several towns away. Her 2-year-old daughter cheerfully rode her plastic toy car into the yellow crime-scene tape.
"It sends chills down your spine," said Ms. Feldman.
Some couldn't care less about Gilgo Beach, the red house or the arsenal of guns being carried out of it by investigators in white jumpsuits. One group of women showed up Tuesday evening to announce they were there only to meet police officers to date.
This offer was met with a mix of grins and stern stares from a phalanx of officers standing sentry.
Some parents viewed the house as an educational site. Mayra Urema of Farmingdale brought her daughter Veronica Medina, 14, because, she said, "I wanted to teach my daughter that there's scary people in this world."
As for herself, Ms. Urema said. "I've been following this story since Day 1."'
She stared past the crime scene tape and murmured, "I'd love to go inside there, just to see."
Onlookers seemed both horrified and fascinated.
"Coming here makes it real for me," said Lori Gargiulo, who mentioned her own coincidental connections to notorious crimes. The serial killer Joel Rifkin was a classmate at East Meadow High School, she said, and Colin Ferguson, who shot 25 people, six fatally, on a Long Island Rail Road train in 1993, was a co-worker at a burglar alarm company in Syosset.
For Michael Iavarone, of Huntington, visiting this neighborhood of modest, well-kept houses in neat rows drove home the idea that "this guy was living amongst the people."
Mr. Iavarone, a co-owner of the champion racehorse Big Brown and a surpassingly flashy internet personality, looked toward the red house, absorbed in watching investigators cart out evidence.
"I feel horrible for the neighbors," he said. "It's become a tourist spot."
Marianne Patino, 59, who lives in Babylon, likened the Heuermann house to the Dutch colonial two miles away made famous by the "Amityville Horror" films, which were based on the true story of a young man who killed six members of his family in 1974.
"This will be the next 'Amityville Horror house,' it will stay in history," she said -- a prospect dreaded by neighbors. Decades after the Amityville crimes, gawkers still drive by and take photos, to the consternation of the current owners.
On Tuesday, a reporter who visited the original Amityville house was met by a woman on a balcony who shouted, "private property!"
Nick Marsi and Jake Goodhart, both 18-year-olds from Hauppauge, had parked in front of the house to chat about the films. They enjoy exploring serial killer points of interest, they said.
The young men said they were unaware of the Gilgo Beach slayings, but were amazed to learn that the suspect lived only two miles away.
"Sounds awesome," Mr. Marsi said.
They drove off.
Back at the Massapequa Park house, Bernadette Paredes, 53, an office manager from Levittown, had brought her 18-year-old daughter, Brooke, who had watched a Netflix movie, "Lost Girls," based on the Gilgo Beach case.
"It was just weird to watch it and come here and see it in real life," Brooke Paredes said. "It's creepy."
Her mother took photographs for Facebook.
"I guess now I'm cool," she said. "I got to see Rex's house."

A Town's Rabbit Dilemma Grows Exponentially Worse: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a former resident abandoned a pair of pet rabbits that bred dozens more, residents on a small island in Wilton Manors, Fla., have begun efforts to save and re-home the growing colony.
Residents of a suburb outside Fort Lauderdale, Fla., don't quite know what to do about their new neighbors: dozens of domesticated rabbits, and counting.
An estimated 75 rabbits have made their home on Jenada Isles, a small community of about 80 households within the suburb of Wilton Manors, after a former resident moved away a couple of years ago and left behind a pair of pet lionhead rabbits that bred. Officials and residents are weighing solutions that would spare the rabbits from getting euthanized and still keep them out of lawns, roads and the Florida heat.
One resident concerned about the rabbits' safety showed up to a community meeting in May with three pet rabbits in a stroller, according to the city, which was unable to identify the man.
Jenada Isles is technically an island within the suburb, surrounded by canals, which has contained the rabbit colony and allowed them to multiply in a small space.
Two years ago, Courtney Turney encountered the rabbits when her 100-pound hound mix dragged her across a neighbor's lawn. "In Florida, we don't have bunnies, so I wasn't expecting a bunny," she said, but "the dog saw it and took after it -- and that's the first time I noticed them."
Now, "there's a lot," said Ms. Turney, who has lived in the neighborhood for nearly three years. "They're absolutely adorable," she added. Rabbits are known to reproduce rapidly; female rabbits typically have between four and eight litters annually, experts say.
The rabbits dash across streets and burrow in yards. Some have eaten through wires and gotten in the way of cyclists and motorists, a spokesperson for Wilton Manors said, concerns residents have shared with the city.
This spring, plans for the rabbits' removal became a subject of debate in city forums.
At a city commission meeting in April, local leaders discussed options proposed by Gary Blocker, the chief of police in Wilton Manors. Chief Blocker suggested the city contract a trapping service. Chris Caputo, a commissioner, said he was concerned that if the trappers "have no place to put them, either we need to find homes for them ourselves or they're going to be euthanized." He added, "We're going to have residents upset about that as well."
In a Facebook post, Mr. Caputo called the trapping effort a "Bunny Blitz."
The possibility that the bunnies would be euthanized struck fear in some residents, including Alicia Griggs, who has lived on Jenada Isles for 39 years. She said on Monday that while the city had agreed instead to hire a rescue organization, "it's been three months now and they're still dragging their feet."
Concerned by the rabbits' inability to survive in rising temperatures or fend for themselves against predators, Ms. Griggs started a fundraiser and began coordinating with local rescue organizations.
"I'm trying to help get something accomplished before they die," said Ms. Griggs, who took in four rabbits to foster on Sunday evening. To stop the breeding, all of the rabbits must be caught. They need health assessments, to be spayed or neutered and to be fostered until they can be adopted, said Ms. Griggs, who added that she never imagined she would learn this much about rabbits.
Central to the chaos is that no local rescue organization is large enough to capture and house all of the rabbits from the island, said Dylan Warfel, a board member at Penny and Wild Smalls of South Florida, a rabbit and guinea pig rescue organization that has begun efforts to rescue the animals with the hope that funding from the city will eventually come through.
While some neighbors argue that the presence of the rabbits is a delight and they should simply be left alone, "they're not wild animals," Ms. Warfel said. "They're supposed to be in the pet trade. They shouldn't be outside in the first place." Many of the rabbits are sick or in pain from ear mites, she said, adding, "They need to be moved now, not in two months."
As one city leader put it at the April commission meeting: "It's a problem because the rabbits are proliferating: The longer we wait, the more there are."
In Florida, where it is a misdemeanor to neglect a pet, some residents said they hoped to see the city hold their former neighbor accountable for the island's current predicament. A representative for the city said in an email that "there has been no proof of criminal activity associated with this issue, and we will continue to assess whether criminal activity is associated with these circumstances."
In an emailed statement, Chief Blocker said, "The safety of this rabbit population is of utmost importance to the city."
"Any decision to involve ourselves will be certain to see these rabbits placed into the hands of people with a passion to provide the necessary care and love for these rabbits," he added.
On Friday, Chief Blocker emailed a status update to the residents of Jenada Isles that said that discussions with a rescue organization would continue and that next steps included identifying prospective funding and receiving approval from Wilton Manors and a written agreement for the services provided.
"If anyone has interest in fostering rabbits, please let us know and we will place you on a list," he wrote.
"I don't think it's a simple solution," Ms. Turney said, because "you can leave no bunny behind." What unites the community, she said, is "that nobody wants the bunnies harmed."
"I am guilty of feeding the bunnies," she said, "which is not illegal, I learned."

Hong Kong to Rule on Protest Song Ban: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The government wants to prohibit "Glory to Hong Kong," saying it defames China's national anthem, in a case that could force Google to restrict access to the song.
A Hong Kong judge said on Friday that he would rule next week on a government request to ban a popular pro-democracy song from the internet, in a case that could force Google and other companies to restrict access to the song.
At issue is "Glory to Hong Kong," which was the anthem of the 2019 protests that ended with Beijing taking tighter control over Hong Kong. The authorities argue that the song is an insult to China's national anthem and could make people believe that Hong Kong is an independent nation. The government has banned it from schools and lashed out when it was played, apparently by mistake, at sports competitions.
On Friday Judge Anthony Chan, after hearing three hours of legal arguments, said he would issue his decision next Friday. The government is seeking an injunction to prohibit the publication or distribution online of "Glory to Hong Kong." Anyone violating the injunction could face prison for contempt of court.
Tech companies are watching the case closely because it has raised the specter of more government control of online speech in Hong Kong.
"The business community should take notice -- the courts won't be able to protect them as long as the Hong Kong government can plausibly claim that national security interests are in play," said Thomas E. Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University.
Google has resisted the government's public requests that "Glory to Hong Kong" not show up in search results or on its sibling service, YouTube. But that could change if a court ordered it to abide by the request. Like most tech companies, Google has a policy of removing or restricting access to material that is deemed illegal by a court in certain countries or places.
Google, which is owned by Alphabet, said it would not comment on the case, as did Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Google and Facebook established offices in Hong Kong over a decade ago, and today each has up to several hundred employees in the city. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
The authorities in Hong Kong have increasingly cracked down on what they consider dissent and threats to national security, targeting individuals with arrests, bounties and prosecution.
At the same time, the government is working to pass legislation by early next year that would target what it considered subversive content and close "internet loopholes," a move that could have more far-reaching consequences and codify the ban into law.
Hong Kong has long attracted foreign businesses seeking access and proximity to China, away from its censorship controls. It has been the only Chinese territory with unfettered access to services such as Google and Facebook, which pulled out of China years ago.
When Google refused a request to remove the song in December, Hong Kong's security chief called the company's decision "unthinkable."
In court on Friday, Benjamin Yu, a lawyer for the government arguing why the song should be banned, said it had been used to "stir up emotions." He pointed to the arrest of a harmonica player who had played the song outside the British Consulate when mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II last year.
Abraham Chan, a lawyer acting as friend of the court to present opposing arguments, said banning the song because of national security could disrupt the free flow of information.
"You can't simply say, 'Don't worry about the chilling effects,"' he said.
The Hong Kong authorities have arrested more than 250 people under an expansive national security law that Beijing imposed on the city in 2020, aimed at stamping out opposition to the ruling Communist Party.
In contrast to "slow-grinding" criminal cases against individuals, an injunction could give the government a quick path to restricting content on online platforms, said Kevin Yam, a legal researcher and former Hong Kong lawyer based in Melbourne.
No company or individual was named as a direct defendant in the government's injunction application, which included 32 links to "Glory to Hong Kong" on YouTube.
But many fear that a court injunction against "Glory to Hong Kong" could be a step toward more official control over the internet in Hong Kong, where the internet remains mostly free of censorship despite Beijing's heavier hand in governing the territory.
American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter were blocked from mainland China in 2009. A year later, Google shut down its China services and rerouted users to its search engine in Hong Kong, then a bastion of political freedom on Chinese soil.
Since the national security law was put in place, requests to tech companies by the Hong Kong authorities to remove content on the internet have soared.

U.S. Seeks To Sharpen Tools to Stop Tech Mergers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The proposed road map for regulatory reviews, last updated in 2020, includes a focus on tech platforms for the first time.
The Biden administration's top antitrust officials unveiled tougher guidelines against tech mergers on Wednesday, signaling their deepening scrutiny of the industry despite recent court losses in their attempts to block tech deal-making.
Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice, released draft guidelines for merger reviews that for the first time include a focus on digital platforms and how dominant companies can use their scale to harm future rivals.
The guidelines -- which generally provide a road map for whether regulators block or approve deals -- show the Biden administration's commitment to an aggressive antitrust agenda aimed at curtailing the power of companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon.
The guidelines, which aren't enforced by law, follow a losing streak in the courts. A ruling last week prevented the F.T.C. from delaying the closing of Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard. In January, a court sided against the F.T.C. in its lawsuit to stop Meta's purchase of Within, a virtual reality app maker.
The forceful antitrust posture is a pillar of President Biden's agenda to stamp out economic inequality and encourage greater competition. "Promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics," a senior administration official said in a call with reporters.
The new guidelines would apply to all deals across the economy. But they highlight obstacles to competition among digital platforms, including how an acquisition of a nascent rival may be intended to kill off future competition. Such deals, known as killer acquisitions, are prevalent in the tech industry and at the heart of an F.T.C. antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has accused Meta of buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to prevent future competition.
The F.T.C. and Justice Department also said they would look at how companies used their scale, including their large number of users, to ward off competition. These so-called network effects have helped companies like Meta and Google maintain their dominance in social media and internet search.
The agencies also laid out ways in which mergers involving "platform" businesses, the model used by Amazon's online store and Apple's App Store, could harm competition. An acquisition could hurt competition by giving a platform control over a significant stream of data, the draft guidelines said, echoing concerns that tech giants use their vast troves of information to squash rivals.
"As markets and commercial realities change, it is vital that we adapt our law enforcement tools to keep pace so that we can protect competition in a manner that reflects the intricacies of our modern economy," Mr. Kanter said in a statement. "Simply put, competition today looks different than it did 50 -- or even 15 -- years ago."
While they lack the force of law, the guidelines can influence how judges look at challenges to mergers and acquisitions. The effort to update the guidelines has been closely watched by businesses and corporate lawyers that navigate regulatory scrutiny of megadeals.
The guidelines were last updated in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Biden ordered the Justice Department and the F.T.C. to update them again as part of a broader effort to improve competition across the economy. The agencies will take public comment on the proposals and could make amendments before final guidelines are adopted.
"These guidelines contain critical updates while ensuring fidelity to the mandate Congress has given us and the legal precedent on the books," Ms. Khan said in a statement.
While the F.T.C. experienced the recent court losses, it has forced some companies, including the chip-maker Nvidia and the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to abandon some large deals. The Justice Department blocked the publisher Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster, using an unusual argument that the merger would harm authors who sold the publication rights to their books.

A Sheriff Unscathed Despite Sex Abuse Claims: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2012, three months after Eddie Scott became sheriff of Clay County, Miss., a claim by a woman he had helped put behind bars threatened to tarnish his earliest days in office.
The woman said in an April court filing that, while chief deputy less than three years earlier, he had coerced her into a sexual relationship after she was arrested. Promising to use his influence in their rural community to keep her out of prison, she said, the lawman drove her to a hog farm to have sex in his patrol car on at least five occasions.
She laid out her allegations in state circuit court in October 2012 and asked a judge to overturn her prison sentence. To back up her story, the 26-year-old showed suggestive letters with a return address of the Clay County Sheriff's Office and signed by then-Chief Deputy Scott, who was 47.
"Hey Sexy," he wrote to her in prison nine months before his election to the top job. "Got my blood pumping hard after reading the last two letters. Can't stop thinking of how tight it is. I want all of that and more if you can."
The revelations could have led to an internal investigation, a criminal inquiry or a public reckoning for the newly installed sheriff. Instead, powerful officials in Clay County took no action.
Judge Jim Kitchens ruled against the woman. Sheriff Scott's predecessor, Laddie Huffman, had known of the allegations before retiring but did not report them to state or federal law enforcement agencies. There is no record of any internal investigation or disciplinary review.
The court file for the woman's case -- the only public record of the allegations -- went missing at the Clay County Courthouse, likely for years. It was placed in the wrong filing cabinet, lost among hundreds of cases, until reporters pressed for it this summer while investigating other allegations against Sheriff Scott.
In interviews, Sheriff Scott would not directly answer whether he had ever had sex with the woman. When asked about his relationship with her, he called it a "mistake." He denied coercing her.
"What she didn't tell was, she was coming up to the office with her tits hanging out," he said. "I never put myself in that position anymore."
But an investigation by The New York Times and the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting at Mississippi Today, which included dozens of interviews and a review of court records and exclusively obtained internal documents, found that during his 11 years in office, Sheriff Scott has repeatedly been accused of using the power of his position to harass women, coerce them into sex and retaliate against those who criticize him or allege abuse.
In rural communities like Clay County -- dominated by farmland and economic hardship -- some sheriffs rule like kings. They can arrest anyone they choose, smear reputations and hand out reprieves and other favors. They have enormous latitude to hold people in jail as long as they please and they answer to no one, typically facing little press or prosecutorial scrutiny.
Three months ago, The Times and Mississippi Today told the story of another sheriff's office, less than 40 miles away. Former Noxubee County Sheriff Terry Grassaree rose in the ranks of his Mississippi department and kept his elected office for years despite similar accusations of abuse. He was voted out in 2019 and now faces federal charges of bribery.
But in Clay County, Sheriff Scott remains in power even after repeated allegations of misconduct.
A local woman said the sheriff had repeatedly forced her into sex during her eight months in jail starting in 2017. When she began telling people after her release, she said, a sheriff's deputy arranged to have drugs planted in her car -- an allegation corroborated by a secretly recorded conversation with a man who said he had planted them.
In a court filing last year, a man claimed that Sheriff Scott had pursued a sexual relationship with his girlfriend and helped her avoid a lengthy prison sentence when the couple's child died in 2019 with meth in his system. Prosecutors charged the parents with child neglect. While prosecutors sought only probation in the mother's case, they offered the father a plea deal that called for 10 years in prison.
Also last year, a woman who once worked for the sheriff sued him, claiming he had subjected her to months of sexual harassment, including texts commenting on her breasts. After she filed her complaint, Sheriff Scott fired her boyfriend, a captain in the office.
At least five people who accused the sheriff of misconduct, or who were potential witnesses in the cases, said he had retaliated against them, efforts they believe were intended to silence them or discredit their allegations.
In 2021, the F.B.I. began investigating allegations against the sheriff. They interviewed nearly a dozen witnesses, including Sheriff Scott and staff members in his office. No charges have been filed.
Officials familiar with the allegations and how they have been investigated, including federal prosecutors, declined to comment. Sheriff Huffman, citing poor health, said he did not remember any of the allegations. Judge Kitchens did not respond to a request for comment.
In multiple interviews, including one on camera with reporters, Sheriff Scott, now 58, has denied harassing women, coercing them into sex or retaliating against anyone. He said he has had to defend his reputation from "con artists" and "drug users" who were inventing accusations to avoid jail time or somehow benefit financially.
The sheriff said he was the victim in all of this, and that he had been under attack. "It was a coordinated hit on me," he said.
In a statement late Wednesday in response to this story, Sheriff Scott reiterated his innocence and called the article "completely slanted, one sided and without any basis in fact."
"I have cooperated fully with all authorities, news media and any others regarding questions concerning these allegations and will continue to do so," Scott wrote.
A Popular Figure
Sheriff Scott and his siblings grew up milking cows on their family farm in Montpelier, Miss., a rural crossroads along Highway 46 marked by a single gas station and the Baptist church his family attended.
After high school, he married, had children and worked at Bryan Foods, a meat processing company and one of the area's biggest employers. Then he was called to serve on a Clay County grand jury and became fascinated with police work, he said.
In 1999, he became a full-time deputy for the Clay County Sheriff's Office. He fought the drug trade just as meth was emerging as the scourge of rural America and he eventually became an investigator, responsible for solving the county's occasional murders. He rose to chief deputy, second in command to Sheriff Huffman.
The logical heir when Sheriff Huffman retired, he won his first election in 2011 and took office the next year.
Today, Sheriff Scott is one of Clay County's most popular figures and the face of area law enforcement. His brother, Terry, is listed as senior investigator on the Clay County Sheriff's Office website; his son James serves on the Mississippi Highway Patrol's SWAT team; and his sister, Tanya, has worked as the nurse for the county jail.
On the 137-acre spread where his family once raised cows, Sheriff Scott hosts fish fries and crawfish boils, where he swaps stories and swigs cold beer with fellow law enforcement officers and some of the county's most powerful officials.
Sheriff Scott has covered his office walls with images of John Wayne, whom the sheriff considers his hero. The actor and the characters he played symbolize everything good and decent in America, Sheriff Scott said. "They don't build them like him anymore."
In his office, he keeps a Christmas card from former President Donald J. Trump, whom he has met several times. Beside it is a Bible that, he said, reminds him of his childhood.
"Back when we were kids, we all went to church and learned the difference between right and wrong," he said. "And we're not seeing that now."
A New Allegation
Sheriff Scott's public persona clashes with what a woman named Amber Jones says she experienced after she failed three drug tests and was arrested for violating probation in May 2017.
That summer, Ms. Jones, then 21, was called down from her cell at the Clay County Detention Center to the sheriff's office, where Sheriff Scott asked if she would like to help out filing paperwork.
She had spent weeks in a dirty jail cell without seeing the sun, she recalled. She told him yes and became a trusty, an inmate with special privileges, working for the jail records administrator, Patty Stange.
One day in the office, Ms. Jones recalled, Sheriff Scott held out a hand to her and said, "If you take this splinter out of my finger, I'll give you an eight-hour home pass."
Desperate to see her family, she agreed, and a few days later, the sheriff himself checked her out of jail to take her home, she said. A mile down the road, the sheriff stopped the car by a small brick house and told her she had to change out of her jail clothes.
Ms. Jones said she felt uneasy as the sheriff led her inside, through a bedroom to a bathroom. He gave her a T-shirt and left her alone to change.
But he eventually returned and came up behind her, Ms. Jones recalled, touching her and commenting on her tattoos. Without another word, the sheriff pulled her to the bed and forced her to have sex, she said.
Ms. Jones said she felt that she had no choice -- he was the sheriff. "I felt like I was worthless, like I didn't have any control over my own body," she said. "There was nothing I could do to stop it."
After she visited her brother and returned to jail, she said, the sheriff called her to his office and told her she didn't have to worry about getting pregnant because he had been "fixed."
For the rest of Ms. Jones's eight months in jail, this pattern continued, she said: Sheriff Scott offered her home passes to arrange sexual encounters.
Her accusations were detailed in a federal lawsuit filed last year by a former employee of the Clay County Sheriff's Office, Caitlyn Wilson. The suit claims that Sheriff Scott sexually harassed Ms. Wilson, and it cites Ms. Jones's allegations as evidence of the sheriff's mistreatment of women. In sworn testimony last month, Sheriff Scott declined to say whether he had ever had sex with Ms. Jones, citing his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. The case is set for trial next year.
In interviews for this article, Sheriff Scott denied taking Ms. Jones out of jail or having sexual contact with her. "Amber is a sweet, likable girl on the face," he said. "But we learned that she's one of the biggest con artists that ever walked the face of the earth."
Had he taken her out of the jail, he said, their exit would have been recorded on surveillance video and sign-out sheets. When reporters asked to review such materials, Sheriff Scott said the computer system that logged inmates' whereabouts was broken.
Sign-out sheets were kept among thousands of pages of jail records stacked in lopsided piles on an office floor. A review of the only records available revealed that Ms. Jones had received at least one home pass.
Ms. Jones's description of the house where she said the sheriff took her for sex matches that of a place Sheriff Scott said he used for storage: a one-story brick home about a mile from the jail. Sheriff Scott said it was widely known that he used the house and that lots of people let themselves in and out using a key he kept under the doormat.
Ms. Jones shared account records showing that past midnight on Jan. 25, a week after she left jail, Sheriff Scott sent her a friend request on Snapchat, the disappearing-photo app. She also shared copies of text messages between them.
In the texts, Sheriff Scott asked Ms. Jones for "updates," his code for nude photographs, she said. She felt forced to send them, she said, because her brother was in jail for drug possession.
In one text exchange from 2019, Ms. Jones asked the sheriff if he had heard anything about her criminal record being expunged. A "good update" would "help me remember," he replied, adding a smiling emoji. In another exchange, the sheriff wrote that Ms. Jones owed him an "update" and sent her an emoji with a tongue sticking out.
Sheriff Scott said he couldn't remember what he had meant by "update," but denied that it involved nude pictures.
The only photos he received from Ms. Jones over Snapchat, he said, were "body shots" that he had requested from her as part of an investigation into jail inmates tattooing one another. Sheriff Scott said he had provided those photos to the F.B.I.
Two women, including another female inmate, had seen her in the house where she said the sheriff took her for sex.
On one occasion, she said, the sheriff drove her and the other jailed woman there, had them remove their clothing and gave them boxer shorts to put on. Ms. Jones's were Superman-themed, with a cape to cover the otherwise-bare back, she said; the other woman received a "Duck Dynasty" pair.
Sheriff Scott posed the women together and snapped a photo from behind, according to Ms. Jones. The other woman, visibly upset, bolted for the bathroom, she said.
A few minutes later, Ms. Jones said she heard a knock at the door: It was Ms. Stange, the jail records administrator.
Ms. Stange said in a statement that she drove the women back from the house to the jail and they seemed in good spirits. She said she had no knowledge of "any sexual misconduct of Sheriff Scott with any female inmates."
The second woman declined to comment. But in a Facebook post last year, she appeared to confirm that she had been present for the picture. Replying to a post by Ms. Jones describing the events, the woman recalled that she had said, "Oh, hell no," and walked out of the room.
When asked about this under oath, Sheriff Scott took the Fifth.
'I Knew I Was Being Set Up'
For years after her release from jail, Ms. Jones said she tried to put these abuses behind her. She stopped getting messages from the sheriff after blocking his number near the beginning of 2020, she said.
Then, in September 2021, a woman who had worked for the Clay County Sheriff's Office came forward with new accusations that threatened to bring attention to years of alleged sexual misconduct by Sheriff Scott.
Caitlyn Wilson, a former investigative assistant who alleged sexual harassment, filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint that said Sheriff Scott had made sexual advances toward her and threatened to fire her after she rebuked him. She made reference to other women whose similar experiences had not yet been made public.
"My situation has been exacerbated," her complaint said, citing multiple women either in jail or employed by the county who had "made claims that the Sheriff was having sex with them. It appears to be well-known within the County that the Sheriff suffers from a sexual addiction, and this sexual addiction has affected my work performance and is causing me extreme fear and anxiety."
The E.E.O.C. did not weigh in on the merits of Ms. Wilson's complaint, but determined she had the right to sue.
In the lawsuit she filed in May 2022, Ms. Wilson described a group chat in which Sheriff Scott had sent several employees a steady stream of sexually explicit text messages.
His messages, reviewed by reporters, referred to women as "hookers," "heifers" and "hos." In one text, the sheriff suggested Ms. Wilson and Ms. Stange should "tag team" to give him oral sex. In others, he called himself a stallion and said women "liked to be hammered."
Pictures the sheriff sent, which he called "humorous memes on the humor channel" under oath as part of the lawsuit, compared women to dogs that needed to be trained and joked about date rape.
Ms. Wilson said she decided to file her complaint after Sheriff Scott rubbed his crotch against her as he walked past her one day in the office. "I felt very violated," she said in an interview. "I was just so shocked and surprised because he was my boss."
Sheriff Scott denied touching Ms. Wilson inappropriately, saying he was running a high fever that day. "I was as sick as a dog," he said. "Grabbing a woman was the last thing on my mind."
He told reporters that none of his texts included sexual content and said under oath that anyone in the group chat could have stopped participating at any time.
When Ms. Wilson filed her complaint, Sheriff Scott assigned one of his own deputies to investigate. The final report concluded that the allegations were "unsubstantiated and punitive" and dismissed Sheriff Scott's texts as adult humor shared among willing participants.
As the deputy investigated, Ms. Wilson said, she found herself increasingly isolated at work. She was barred from carrying her gun at the office and told to eat lunch at her desk. Most of her co-workers stopped talking to her, she said.
In December 2021, three months after Ms. Wilson filed her initial complaint, Sheriff Scott suspended her then-boyfriend, Jeremy Bell, a captain who had worked in the office for five years. According to a personnel report signed by Sheriff Scott, Mr. Bell had violated department policy by driving his patrol car outside of Clay County to visit Ms. Wilson's house in a neighboring town. He was fired two days after Christmas.
It was around this time that Ms. Jones, who had not heard from Sheriff Scott for months, found herself under the scrutiny of local law enforcement again, she said.
Several weeks after Ms. Wilson submitted her complaint citing allegations that women in the jail had been forced to have sex with Sheriff Scott, Ms. Jones was pulled over by a narcotics officer from West Point, a town of about 10,000 people in Clay County.
The officer discovered a bag of diabetic needles filled with meth under her passenger seat and arrested her. Ms. Jones believes the drugs were planted there.
"I knew I was being set up," she said.
Frustrated and facing time behind bars, Ms. Jones decided two months later to post on a Facebook page called Mississippi Corruption, where she detailed for the first time her allegations against the sheriff.
"I was fixing to go to prison for a really long time for something that I didn't even do, just because he was mad over his mistakes, over things that he had done," she said.
A few months later, in April 2022, Ms. Jones received a video from her friend Madison Ray, she said. Ms. Ray said she had secretly recorded a conversation with Joshua Fulgham, a local diabetic man with prior drug arrests, because she suspected someone had planted the drugs while they were all hanging out the night before Ms. Jones's arrest.
The recording, on Ms. Ray's cellphone, captures him explaining how and why he placed the drugs in Ms. Jones's car. "I put dope under that seat like Kyle told me to," he says. "I didn't even have to use mine. Kyle gave it to me."
According to Ms. Wilson's lawsuit, Mr. Fulgham is referring to Deputy Kyle Eaves, who used to work for Sheriff Scott. "The apparent purpose of Deputy Sheriff Eaves causing drugs to be planted upon Jones is to intimidate Jones or to cause her to be arrested so that she will lack credibility in claiming an involuntary sexual relationship with Defendant Scott," the complaint states.
After the video spread around town, Mr. Fulgham was arrested on drug possession charges, taken to the jail and made a trusty. About six months later, he made a video at the Clay County jail and had it posted on Facebook. He accused Ms. Jones of being a liar out to get Sheriff Scott, but never recanted his previous statements.
"She needs help and rehab, just like me," Mr. Fulgham said in the video, "and she needs to leave the sheriff alone."
The sheriff sent a copy of the video to reporters and pointed to it as proof that Ms. Jones and others were lying. "Seems like their plan [is] coming to light," he said.
Neither Mr. Fulgham nor Mr. Eaves responded to requests for comment.
About six months after the video was made, another potential witness in Ms. Jones's case changed his story too.
Her former boyfriend, Edward Adam Todd, had been arrested by Clay County deputies and was facing up to 50 years in prison for two burglary charges.
After initially backing up Ms. Jones's allegations, Mr. Todd later told investigators that he had lied to get the sheriff in trouble, according to transcripts of his April sentencing hearing.
The court transcript shows that Judge Kitchens praised Mr. Todd for his change of heart, saying his statements "cleared a local member of law enforcement that had been accused of something that probably turns out that was not true."
At the hearing, the prosecutor suggested a seven-year prison sentence for Mr. Todd, citing his help to law enforcement. Judge Kitchens further reduced his sentence, cutting it to four years.
Instead of being transferred to prison to serve his sentence, Mr. Todd has remained at the Clay County jail, where he could not immediately be reached for comment.
Back on the Ballot
Sheriff Scott believes that he will be vindicated and that voters will see through the allegations to re-elect him in the deciding Democratic primary election on Aug. 8.
He has won his previous elections easily. But this time, he faces an unexpected opponent who is an experienced law enforcement officer in Clay County: his own chief deputy, Ramirez Williams.
In February, Chief Deputy Williams announced his run for sheriff. The next month, Sheriff Scott demoted him to work the graveyard shift as a jailer.
When asked if Mr. Williams's candidacy played a role in his demotion, the sheriff replied, "Not necessarily," and declined to comment further.
Sheriff Scott insists he will leave office on his own terms, regardless of what becomes of the accusations against him.
He said he believes the federal investigation is over and he cooperated with their review, even voluntarily meeting with federal authorities to answer questions. "I wasn't going to let a bunch of drugheads run me out of office," he said.
The sheriff said he had been burned by extending compassion to people behind bars, but had no plans to stop. "You can't turn your back," he said. "One of these days, I might be in the same shape."
He chuckled. "You never know."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
In 2012, three months after Eddie Scott became sheriff of Clay County, Mississippi, a claim by a woman he had helped put behind bars threatened to tarnish his earliest days in office.
The woman said in an April court filing that, while chief deputy less than three years earlier, he had coerced her into a sexual relationship after she was arrested. Promising to use his influence in their rural community to keep her out of prison, she said, the lawman drove her to a hog farm to have sex in his patrol car on at least five occasions.
She laid out her allegations in state circuit court in October 2012 and asked a judge to overturn her prison sentence. To back up her story, the 26-year-old showed suggestive letters with a return address of the Clay County Sheriff’s Office and signed by then-Chief Deputy Scott, who was 47.
“Hey Sexy,” he wrote to her in prison nine months before his election to the top job. “Got my blood pumping hard after reading the last two letters. Can’t stop thinking of how tight it is. I want all of that and more if you can.”
The revelations could have led to an internal investigation, a criminal inquiry or a public reckoning for the newly installed sheriff. Instead, powerful officials in Clay County took no action.
Judge Jim Kitchens ruled against the woman. Sheriff Scott’s predecessor, Laddie Huffman, had known of the allegations before retiring but did not report them to state or federal law enforcement agencies. There is no record of any internal investigation or disciplinary review.
The court file for the woman’s case — the only public record of the allegations — went missing at the Clay County Courthouse, likely for years. It was placed in the wrong filing cabinet, lost among hundreds of cases, until reporters pressed for it this summer while investigating other allegations against Scott.
In interviews, Scott would not directly answer whether he had ever had sex with the woman. When asked about his relationship with her, he called it a “mistake.” He denied coercing her.
“What she didn’t tell was, she was coming up to the office with her tits hanging out,” he said. “I never put myself in that position anymore.”
But an investigation by The New York Times and the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting at Mississippi Today, which included dozens of interviews and a review of court records and exclusively obtained internal documents, found that during his 11 years in office, Scott has repeatedly been accused of using the power of his position to harass women, coerce them into sex and retaliate against those who criticize him or allege abuse.
In rural communities like Clay County — dominated by farmland and economic hardship — some sheriffs rule like kings. They can arrest anyone they choose, smear reputations and hand out reprieves and other favors. They have enormous latitude to hold people in jail as long as they please and they answer to no one, typically facing little press or prosecutorial scrutiny.
Three months ago, the Times and Mississippi Today told the story of another sheriff’s office, less than 40 miles away. Former Noxubee County Sheriff Terry Grassaree rose in the ranks of his Mississippi department and kept his elected office for years despite similar accusations of abuse. He was voted out in 2019 and now faces federal charges of bribery.
But in Clay County, Scott remains in power even after repeated allegations of misconduct.
A local woman said the sheriff had repeatedly forced her into sex during her eight months in jail starting in 2017. When she began telling people after her release, she said, a sheriff’s deputy arranged to have drugs planted in her car — an allegation corroborated by a secretly recorded conversation with a man who said he had planted them.
In a court filing last year, a man claimed that Scott had pursued a sexual relationship with his girlfriend and helped her avoid a lengthy prison sentence when the couple’s child died in 2019 with meth in his system. Prosecutors charged the parents with child neglect. While prosecutors sought only probation in the mother’s case, they offered the father a plea deal that called for 10 years in prison.
Also last year, a woman who once worked for the sheriff sued him, claiming he had subjected her to months of sexual harassment, including texts commenting on her breasts. After she filed her complaint, Scott fired her boyfriend, a captain in the office.
At least five people who accused the sheriff of misconduct, or who were potential witnesses in the cases, said he had retaliated against them, efforts they believe were intended to silence them or discredit their allegations.
In 2021, the FBI began investigating allegations against the sheriff. They interviewed nearly a dozen witnesses, including Scott and staff members in his office. No charges have been filed.
Officials familiar with the allegations and how they have been investigated, including federal prosecutors, declined to comment. Huffman, citing poor health, said he did not remember any of the allegations. Kitchens did not respond to a request for comment.
In multiple interviews, including one on camera with reporters, Scott, now 58, has denied harassing women, coercing them into sex or retaliating against anyone. He said he has had to defend his reputation from “con artists” and “drug users” who were inventing accusations to avoid jail time or somehow benefit financially.
The sheriff said he was the victim in all of this, and that he had been under attack. “It was a coordinated hit on me,” he said.
In a statement late Wednesday in response to this story, Scott reiterated his innocence and called the article “completely slanted, one-sided and without any basis in fact.”
“I have cooperated fully with all authorities, news media and any others regarding questions concerning these allegations and will continue to do so,” Scott wrote.
A Popular Figure
Scott and his siblings grew up milking cows on their family farm in Montpelier, Mississippi, a rural crossroads along Highway 46 marked by a single gas station and the Baptist church his family attended.
After high school, he married, had children and worked at Bryan Foods, a meat processing company and one of the area’s biggest employers. Then he was called to serve on a Clay County grand jury and became fascinated with police work, he said.
In 1999, he became a full-time deputy for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office. He fought the drug trade just as meth was emerging as the scourge of rural America and he eventually became an investigator, responsible for solving the county’s occasional murders. He rose to chief deputy, second in command to Huffman.
The logical heir when Huffman retired, he won his first election in 2011 and took office the next year.
Today, Scott is one of Clay County’s most popular figures and the face of area law enforcement. His brother, Terry, is listed as senior investigator on the Clay County Sheriff’s Office website; his son James serves on the Mississippi Highway Patrol’s SWAT team; and his sister, Tanya, has worked as the nurse for the county jail.
On the 137-acre spread where his family once raised cows, Scott hosts fish fries and crawfish boils, where he swaps stories and swigs cold beer with fellow law enforcement officers and some of the county’s most powerful officials.
Scott has covered his office walls with images of John Wayne, whom the sheriff considers his hero. The actor and the characters he played symbolize everything good and decent in America, Scott said. “They don’t build them like him anymore.”
In his office, he keeps a Christmas card from former President Donald Trump, whom he has met several times. Beside it is a Bible that, he said, reminds him of his childhood.

Desperate to see her family, she agreed, and a few days later, the sheriff himself checked her out of jail to take her home, she said. A mile down the road, the sheriff stopped the car by a small brick house and told her she had to change out of her jail clothes.
Jones said she felt uneasy as the sheriff led her inside, through a bedroom to a bathroom. He gave her a T-shirt and left her alone to change.
But he eventually returned and came up behind her, Jones recalled, touching her and commenting on her tattoos. Without another word, the sheriff pulled her to the bed and forced her to have sex, she said.
Jones said she felt that she had no choice — he was the sheriff. “I felt like I was worthless, like I didn’t have any control over my own body,” she said. “There was nothing I could do to stop it.”
After she visited her brother and returned to jail, she said, the sheriff called her to his office and told her she didn’t have to worry about getting pregnant because he had been “fixed.”
For the rest of Jones’ eight months in jail, this pattern continued, she said: Scott offered her home passes to arrange sexual encounters.
Her accusations were detailed in a federal lawsuit filed last year by a former employee of the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, Caitlyn Wilson. The suit claims that Scott sexually harassed Wilson, and it cites Jones’ allegations as evidence of the sheriff’s mistreatment of women. In sworn testimony last month, Scott declined to say whether he had ever had sex with Jones, citing his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. The case is set for trial next year.
In interviews for this article, Scott denied taking Jones out of jail or having sexual contact with her. “Amber is a sweet, likable girl on the face,” he said. “But we learned that she’s one of the biggest con artists that ever walked the face of the earth.”
Had he had taken her out of the jail, he said, their exit would have been recorded on surveillance video and sign-out sheets. When reporters asked to review such materials, Scott said the computer system that logged inmates’ whereabouts was broken.
Sign-out sheets were kept among thousands of pages of jail records stacked in lopsided piles on an office floor. A review of the only records available revealed that Jones had received at least one home pass.
Jones’ description of the house where she said the sheriff took her for sex matches that of a place Scott said he used for storage: a one-story brick home about a mile from the jail. Scott said it was widely known that he used the house and that lots of people let themselves in and out using a key he kept under the doormat.

It appears to be well-known within the County that the Sheriff suffers from a sexual addiction, and this sexual addiction has affected my work performance and is causing me extreme fear and anxiety.”
The EEOC did not weigh in on the merits of Wilson’s complaint, but determined she had the right to sue.
In the lawsuit she filed in May 2022, Wilson described a group chat in which Scott had sent several employees a steady stream of sexually explicit text messages.
His messages, reviewed by reporters, referred to women as “hookers,” “heifers” and “hos.” In one text, the sheriff suggested Wilson and Stange should “tag team” to give him oral sex. In others, he called himself a stallion and said women “liked to be hammered.”
Pictures the sheriff sent, which he called “humorous memes on the humor channel” under oath as part of the lawsuit, compared women to dogs that needed to be trained and joked about date rape.
Wilson said she decided to file her complaint after Scott rubbed his crotch against her as he walked past her one day in the office. “I felt very violated,” she said in an interview. “I was just so shocked and surprised because he was my boss.”
Scott denied touching Wilson inappropriately, saying he was running a high fever that day. “I was as sick as a dog,” he said. “Grabbing a woman was the last thing on my mind.”
He told reporters that none of his texts included sexual content and said under oath that anyone in the group chat could have stopped participating at any time.
When Wilson filed her complaint, Scott assigned one of his own deputies to investigate. The final report concluded that the allegations were “unsubstantiated and punitive” and dismissed Scott’s texts as adult humor shared among willing participants.
As the deputy investigated, Wilson said, she found herself increasingly isolated at work. She was barred from carrying her gun at the office and told to eat lunch at her desk. Most of her co-workers stopped talking to her, she said.
In December 2021, three months after Wilson filed her initial complaint, Scott suspended her then-boyfriend, Jeremy Bell, a captain who had worked in the office for five years. According to a personnel report signed by Scott, Bell had violated department policy by driving his patrol car outside of Clay County to visit Wilson’s house in a neighboring town. He was fired two days after Christmas.
It was around this time that Jones, who had not heard from Scott for months, found herself under the scrutiny of local law enforcement again, she said.
Several weeks after Wilson submitted her complaint citing allegations that women in the jail had been forced to have sex with Scott, Jones was pulled over by a narcotics officer from West Point, a town of about 10,000 people in Clay County.
The officer discovered a bag of diabetic needles filled with meth under her passenger seat and arrested her. Jones believes the drugs were planted there.
“I knew I was being set up,” she said.
Frustrated and facing time behind bars, Jones decided two months later to post on a Facebook page called Mississippi Corruption, where she detailed for the first time her allegations against the sheriff.
“I was fixing to go to prison for a really long time for something that I didn’t even do, just because he was mad over his mistakes, over things that he had done,” she said.
A few months later, in April 2022, Jones received a video from her friend Madison Ray, she said. Ray said she had secretly recorded a conversation with Joshua Fulgham, a local diabetic man with prior drug arrests, because she suspected someone had planted the drugs while they were all hanging out the night before Jones’ arrest.
The recording, on Ray’s cellphone, captures him explaining how and why he placed the drugs in Jones’ car. “I put dope under that seat like Kyle told me to,” he says. “I didn’t even have to use mine. Kyle gave it to me.”
According to Wilson’s lawsuit, Fulgham is referring to Deputy Kyle Eaves, who used to work for Scott. “The apparent purpose of Deputy Sheriff Eaves causing drugs to be planted upon Jones is to intimidate Jones or to cause her to be arrested so that she will lack credibility in claiming an involuntary sexual relationship with Defendant Scott,” the complaint states.
After the video spread around town, Fulgham was arrested on drug possession charges, taken to the jail and made a trusty. About six months later, he made a video at the Clay County jail and had it posted on Facebook. He accused Jones of being a liar out to get Scott, but he never recanted his previous statements.
“She needs help and rehab, just like me,” Fulgham said in the video, “and she needs to leave the sheriff alone.”
The sheriff sent a copy of the video to reporters and pointed to it as proof that Jones and others were lying. “Seems like their plan [is] coming to light,” he said.
Neither Fulgham nor Eaves responded to requests for comment.
About six months after the video was made, another potential witness in Jones’ case changed his story too.
Her former boyfriend, Edward Adam Todd, had been arrested by Clay County deputies and was facing up to 50 years in prison for two burglary charges.
After initially backing up Jones’ allegations, Todd later told investigators that he had lied to get the sheriff in trouble, according to transcripts of his April sentencing hearing.
The court transcript shows that Kitchens praised Todd for his change of heart, saying his statements “cleared a local member of law enforcement that had been accused of something that probably turns out that was not true.”
At the hearing, the prosecutor suggested a seven-year prison sentence for Todd, citing his help to law enforcement. Kitchens further reduced his sentence, cutting it to four years.
Instead of being transferred to prison to serve his sentence, Todd has remained at the Clay County jail, where he could not immediately be reached for comment.
Back on the Ballot
Scott believes that he will be vindicated and that voters will see through the allegations to re-elect him in the deciding Democratic primary election on Aug. 8.
He has won his previous elections easily. But this time, he faces an unexpected opponent who is an experienced law enforcement officer in Clay County: his own chief deputy, Ramirez Williams.
In February, Williams announced his run for sheriff. The next month, Scott demoted him to work the graveyard shift as a jailer.
When asked if Williams’ candidacy played a role in his demotion, the sheriff replied, “Not necessarily,” and declined to comment further.
Scott insists he will leave office on his own terms, regardless of what becomes of the accusations against him.
He said he believes the federal investigation is over and he cooperated with their review, even voluntarily meeting with federal authorities to answer questions. “I wasn’t going to let a bunch of drugheads run me out of office,” he said.
The sheriff said he had been burned by extending compassion to people behind bars, but had no plans to stop. “You can’t turn your back,” he said. “One of these days, I might be in the same shape.”
He chuckled. “You never know.”

Full text: The number of Japanese businesses in North Brooklyn has grown in recent years. The food is worth your time.
Exploring the restaurants of Greenpoint's Little Tokyo
This is me resisting the urge to use the "a [BLANK] grows in Brooklyn" cliché. I'll say, instead, that there's something afoot in Greenpoint, Brooklyn: a spate of Japanese restaurants and businesses that opened in the past few years in an industrial section of the neighborhood.
I'm not the first to spot this. In February, Devorah Lev-Tov, a freelance reporter for The Times, wrote a deep dive on the rise of this "Little Tokyo." As she points out, many of the newer businesses are Japanese-owned and attract people looking for a North Brooklyn alternative to Japan Village in Sunset Park. But what of the food?
For bento boxes, mushroom skewers and yuzu ricotta ...
To start, Rule of Thirds, which opened just weeks before the pandemic, managed to make it to the other side with a creative menu of Japanese-inspired dishes. This isn't your sobo's restaurant, but the founding team did cut its teeth at the beloved two-in-one restaurant Okonomi + Yuji Ramen, in Williamsburg.
Unlike that intimate, 12-seat restaurant, Rule of Thirds is downright huge. It has a brunch and dinner menu that runs from small plates to skewers to entrees, so it's a great place for large groups. Here's my ideal dinner order: a heavy yes to the crispy maitake mushroom skewers with herby gremolata, and to the mazemen (brothless ramen noodles) with yuzu ricotta to start.
I'm still dreaming about the summer tomatoes dressed in kimizu sauce (egg yolk and rice vinegar) and scattered with puffed rice and smoked trout roe. That was my first taste of this year's tomato bounty, and I have to say, we're in for a treat. I decided against the pork tonkatsu, because I always seem to go for pork. But next time I'll make that my entree order and close it all out again with the delectable grilled mochi cake.
Then there's Acre, a Japanese-owned lunch counter that's nothing short of delightful. This restaurant serves exactly the kind of balanced, food-pyramid-friendly meals I crave after a week of over-the-top dining: bento boxes, garden salads, miso soup and Japanese egg salad sandwiches. This is where I got my tonkatsu fix, and it also makes a mean iced latte and has a little gift shop up front.
For a splurge (like nori-wrapped Wagyu beef tartare) ...
If you're looking for something more upscale, consider House Brooklyn or Restaurant Yuu. Both are French-inspired, omakase-style restaurants, though House Brooklyn is the more intimate of the two, serving just 16 diners over two seatings for $ 180 per person. It's hidden at the back of 50 Norman Avenue, which is also home to Cibone, a design store, and Dashi Okume, where you can get ready-made dashi broth or have a custom blend made. (We really do have it all here.)
House is closed for the month of July and already sold out for August, but the eight-week-old Restaurant Yuu is a very worthy alterative. I usually find fine dining to be a bit cold and overly formal, but this 18-seat restaurant is the opposite. The service is professional but warm, and I got a real kick out of watching each of the 18 well-executed courses come together before my eyes -- like nori-wrapped Wagyu beef tartare topped with sea urchin from Hokkaido and an exceptional eel and foie gras dish. (Note: I was informed that the entire menu was about to change after my dinner, but all the more reason to go back.) I also signed up for the $ 100 nonalcoholic pairing, all tea-based, and especially loved the restaurant's take on an espresso martini with milky oolong. At $ 250 per person without drinks, it's a splurge, but I can say with my whole chest that it's worth it.

Asylum Seekers' U.K. Backers and Opponents Unite in Fury: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of those protesting the Bibby Stockholm's arrival in southern England wanted better treatment for refugees. Others opposed bringing migrants to the area. None wanted the barge.
It was a rough reception for the Bibby Stockholm, a hulking metal barge intended to house up to 500 asylum seekers, as it pulled into its new berth in Portland, on England's picturesque southern coast, on Tuesday.
Protesters holding signs reading "No to the barge" and "No floating prison" gathered at the dock as television crews filmed them. While there were deeply divided political opinions on display -- some denouncing the planned living conditions and advocating refugee rights, others protesting against the imminent arrival of migrants in their town -- the demonstrators were united in wanting the barge gone.
The barge will be docked in the port for at least 18 months, according to the government, and will eventually house adult male asylum seekers who have entered Britain by crossing the English Channel on small boats. From next week, about 50 asylum seekers will be moved onboard the vessel according to the Home Office, before the number is increased over the next few months.
The barge showed up in Portland at a time when the political rhetoric around asylum seekers in Britain has grown increasingly heated. Late on Monday night, lawmakers passed the Illegal Migration Bill, which will allow for people who arrive in Britain on small boats to be detained and sent to the central African nation of Rwanda or to another "safe" third country.
The government has described the law as essential to halting arrivals across the English Channel and via other illegal routes. But legal experts have warned that aspects of the new legislation could break international laws protecting refugees.
Most of those who arrive by small boat are fleeing war-torn home countries. Last year, small boat arrivals accounted for 45 percent of the overall asylum claims in Britain, and 60 percent of those people will eventually receive refugee status, according to an analysis from the Refugee Council, a charity that supports people seeking asylum.
Laura Kyrke-Smith, executive director of the aid group International Rescue Committee U.K., said in a statement on Tuesday that the passage of the Illegal Migration Bill was "damaging for Britain and devastating for people seeking safety from conflict and persecution."
"The bill dismantles people's right to seek asylum in the U.K., a right established in the wake of the Second World War, which has offered vital protection and hope in the decades since, and earned those who uphold it great respect," she said.
The plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal in London last month, but Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would seek permission to take its case to the Supreme Court.
Even before the Bibby Stockholm's arrival, there had already been a great deal of local and national opposition, with Portland residents rallying in Facebook groups.
Sharon Dowell, a resident of nearby Weymouth, said in a Facebook message that she worried that the residents of the barge would be left "hanging around with absolutely nothing to do in groups," in an area that relies heavily on tourism. She said that many local people had received no answers to any of their "genuine concerns."
"The point is the barge is a small cramped space, they cannot work due to their asylum claims," Ms. Dowell said. "They are going to be bored and frustrated and will end up just loitering around."
She also expressed frustration that locals had to wait around two weeks to see health care providers, and that many in the area were "living hand to mouth," while free transportation and accessible health care were being put in place for the asylum seekers.
Chris Loder, a Conservative lawmaker for West Dorset, said he had concerns for the safety of the vessel which was originally designed to house around 250 people instead of being used to accommodate 500, and sent a letter to the Home Office asking for a safety risk assessment.
"The Home Office has been so gray in all of this. They've not been providing information," he said, adding that there were a variety of opinions locally but, "The concern really is that given it's such an unknown, they don't know how it's likely to affect them."
Dorset Council, the local authority for Portland, said it had no input in decision to park the barge there, which had been made by the owners of Portland Port and the government, and it has been clear that it opposes the location.
Portland Town Council has also been vocal in its opposition to the arrival of the vessel, with Jim Draper, the council's chair, noting in a statement this spring that it would be "inappropriate to house refugees, some of the most vulnerable people in the world, on board a ship in Portland Port."
Mr. Draper, a member of Britain's opposition Labour Party, elaborated in an email on Tuesday that he feared that the far right would instigate "violent confrontation with the refugees." He added that he felt the barge was being used by the government as a political tool to keep immigration on the agenda "so people forget about Johnson's lies and the ghastly mess this government has made out of the economy," referring to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Both local authorities say that the port, on a tiny rugged island reached by a causeway from Dorset's picturesque Jurassic Coast, and the surrounding area lack the infrastructure for 500 additional people. The Home Office said in a statement that it had "worked closely with local councils and stakeholders to minimize the impact of the site and vessel on local services and the community."
In a fact sheet, the government said that the facility was "designed to be as self-sufficient as possible in order to minimize" the impact on local communities and services.
The government has also said it would provide some 3,500 pounds, or almost $ 4,600, per occupied bed in the vessel to Dorset Council, as well as providing additional funding to local health and police services this year.
This would amount to around £1.75 million, or around $ 2.29 million, if the anticipated 500 people are moved on board. Dorset Council said that it also received a one-off payment of £377,000, to "help provide asylum seekers with activities, volunteering opportunities and English-speaking lessons."
The British government says it has plans for two more barges, though it is unclear where they will be docked.
This is not the first time that Britain has used a ship to accommodate people receiving housing from the government. The Scottish government contracted two cruise ships to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees beginning last year. But this week, the final people were moved off those vessels and into longer-term accommodation as the contracts ended.
The Bibby Stockholm, the other potential vessels and former military sites are part of a larger plan to move asylum seekers out of hotels, which the Home Office said currently held about 51,000 asylum seekers at a daily cost of around £6 million.
The new sites, it said, would be cheaper. Last week, the first 46 asylum seekers were moved to a former military facility in Wethersfield, about 50 miles northeast of London, with more people expected to arrive there in the coming weeks. The Home Office said it aimed to house 1,700 people there by this autumn.

Meta Unveils Its New A.I. With Pledge To Share It: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company said it would give outside programmers access to the latest version of its core artificial intelligence technology.
The largest companies in the tech industry have spent the year warning that development of artificial intelligence technology is outpacing their wildest expectations and that they need to limit who has access to it.
Mark Zuckerberg is doubling down on a different tack: He's giving it away.
Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, said on Tuesday that he planned to provide the code behind the company's latest and most advanced A.I. technology to developers and software enthusiasts around the world free of charge.
The decision, similar to one that Meta made in February, could help the company reel in competitors like Google and Microsoft. Those companies have moved more quickly to incorporate generative artificial intelligence -- the technology behind OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot -- into their products.
"When software is open, more people can scrutinize it to identify and fix potential issues," Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to his personal Facebook page.
The latest version of Meta's A.I. was created with 40 percent more data than what the company released just a few months ago and is believed to be considerably more powerful. And Meta is providing a detailed road map that shows how developers can work with the vast amount of data it has collected.
Researchers worry that generative A.I. can supercharge the amount of disinformation and spam on the internet, and presents dangers that even some of its creators do not entirely understand.
Meta is sticking to a long-held belief that allowing all sorts of programmers to tinker with technology is the best way to improve it. Until recently, most A.I. researchers agreed with that. But in the past year, companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that is working closely with Microsoft, have set limits on who has access to their latest technology and placed controls around what can be done with it.
The companies say they are limiting access because of safety concerns, but critics say they are also trying to stifle competition. Meta argues that it is in everyone's best interest to share what it is working on.
"Meta has historically been a big proponent of open platforms, and it has really worked well for us as a company," said Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president of generative A.I. at Meta, in an interview.
The move will make the software "open source," which is computer code that can be freely copied, modified and reused. The technology, called LLaMA 2, provides everything anyone would need to build online chatbots like ChatGPT. LLaMA 2 will be released under a commercial license, which means developers can build their own businesses using Meta's underlying A.I. to power them -- all for free.
By open-sourcing LLaMA 2, Meta can capitalize on improvements made by programmers from outside the company while -- Meta executives hope -- spurring A.I. experimentation.
Meta's open-source approach is not new. Companies often open-source technologies in an effort to catch up with rivals. Fifteen years ago, Google open-sourced its Android mobile operating system to better compete with Apple's iPhone. While the iPhone had an early lead, Android eventually became the dominant software used in smartphones.
But researchers argue that someone could deploy Meta's A.I. without the safeguards that tech giants like Google and Microsoft often use to suppress toxic content. Newly created open-source models could be used, for instance, to flood the internet with even more spam, financial scams and disinformation.
LLaMA 2, short for Large Language Model Meta AI, is what scientists call a large language model, or L.L.M. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard are built with large language models.
The models are systems that learn skills by analyzing enormous volumes of digital text, including Wikipedia articles, books, online forum conversations and chat logs. By pinpointing patterns in the text, these systems learn to generate text of their own, including term papers, poetry and computer code. They can even carry on a conversation.
Meta is teaming up with Microsoft to open-source LLaMA 2, which will run on Microsoft's Azure cloud services. LLaMA 2 will also be available through other providers, including Amazon Web Services and the company HuggingFace.
Dozens of Silicon Valley technologists signed a statement of support for the initiative, including the venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and executives from Nvidia, Palo Alto Networks, Zoom and Dropbox.
Meta is not the only company to push for open-source A.I. projects. The Technology Innovation Institute produced Falcon LLM and published the code freely this year. Mosaic ML also offers open-source software for training L.L.M.s.
Meta executives argue that their strategy is not as risky as many believe. They say that people can already generate large amounts of disinformation and hate speech without using A.I., and that such toxic material can be tightly restricted by Meta's social networks such as Facebook. They maintain that releasing the technology can eventually strengthen the ability of Meta and other companies to fight back against abuses of the software.
Meta did additional "Red Team" testing of LLaMA 2 before releasing it, Mr. Al-Dahle said. That is a term for testing software for potential misuse and figuring out ways to protect against such abuse. The company will also release a responsible-use guide containing best practices and guidelines for developers who wish to build programs using the code.
But these tests and guidelines apply to only one of the models that Meta is releasing, which will be trained and fine-tuned in a way that contains guardrails and inhibits misuse. Developers will also be able to use the code to create chatbots and programs without guardrails, a move that skeptics see as a risk.
In February, Meta released the first version of LLaMA to academics, government researchers and others. The company also allowed academics to download LLaMA after it had been trained on vast amounts of digital text. Scientists call this process "releasing the weights."
It was a notable move because analyzing all that digital data requires vast computing and financial resources. With the weights, anyone can build a chatbot far more cheaply and easily than from scratch.
Many in the tech industry believed Meta set a dangerous precedent, and after Meta shared its A.I. technology with a small group of academics in February, one of the researchers leaked the technology onto the public internet.
In a recent opinion piece in The Financial Times, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global public policy, argued that it was "not sustainable to keep foundational technology in the hands of just a few large corporations," and that historically companies that released open source software had been served strategically as well.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what you all build!" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his post.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eric Ulrich, who was the commissioner of New York City's Buildings Department, resigned in November amid an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office.
A criminal investigation into the former commissioner of New York City's Buildings Department has reached its final stages and charges are expected as soon as this week, according to three people with knowledge of the inquiry.
The commissioner, Eric Ulrich, resigned in November shortly after investigators with the Manhattan district attorney's office seized his cellphone and then interviewed him the next day. The inquiry continued after his resignation, with the prosecutors focusing on crimes related to bribery that occurred when Mr. Ulrich was still in office.
As part of the inquiry, prosecutors have examined whether he received an apartment rental at a below-market rate, the people with knowledge said, as well as a sofa that was given to him or provided at a discount by someone who had business before the department.
A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Ulrich, Samuel M. Braverman, said that until he knew what the indictment contained, he would not comment.
"Anything anyone says is just a guess, and probably without merit, so I will wait for the indictment," said Mr. Braverman, who practices white-collar defense at the law firm Anderson Kill.
The progress of the investigation was first reported by The Daily News.
The investigation into Mr. Ulrich, 38, is the latest stain on a department that has long been plagued by corruption scandals. The agency inspects all buildings in New York City to ensure they are abiding by regulations and codes, and reviews and approves plans for new developments.
In the 1960s, Mayor John V. Lindsay's Buildings Department commissioner was so frustrated by allegations of corruption and graft that he suggested its inspectors be given uniforms without pockets.
Mr. Ulrich was appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in May 2022 to lead the department in spite of his acknowledged alcohol and gambling addictions and a letter he wrote four years earlier on behalf of a constituent with mob ties. Initially, prosecutors working for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, were thought to be examining Mr. Ulrich's potential ties to gambling and organized crime, and it is unclear when they began focusing on potential bribery.
When Mr. Ulrich resigned last year, the mayor declined to comment on the investigation.
Mr. Adams said he respected the decision and wished Mr. Ulrich and his family well but had no comment about the investigation, saying that he did not "take reports that are in the media as what actually took place."
In a Facebook post in January, Mr. Ulrich announced that he had recently become a licensed insurance broker.

A Better Twitter? Maybe.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Meta launched its new app Threads on July 5, it introduced the biggest threat that Twitter has faced since the platform became a dominant space for online conversation about a decade ago. With Twitter facing a raft of changes under Elon Musk's chaotic leadership and a shiny new alternative available, could that app finally become obsolete? What would this mean for America's political conversation and for the future of disinformation? Should we even want a replacement?
Three Times Opinion writers discussed Threads and the future of social media for the podcast "Matter of Opinion."
"Matter of Opinion" is available at NYTimes.com and through any podcast player. Episodes are released on Thursdays. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Michelle Cottle: You can complain about gatekeepers infinitely, but I do think that there is a real issue as we deal, in a new generation of A.I. and disinformation, when there are no gatekeepers in terms of who's out in the public square, like rallying folks around this stuff. And we just saw a court case where the Biden administration has been ordered not to contact social media companies. And that is a hurdle to getting them to deal with disinformation, Covid disinformation, things like this.
You can always take it too far, but what you're looking at is increasing means of communicating stuff that's just absolutely not true, destructive, violence-promoting, "Let's all go storm the Capitol." At the same time as you're just kind of throwing up your hands and being like, "Oh well, we'll just have to let that go. There's nothing to be done about it."
Lydia Polgreen: Well, technology has always changed the way that we communicated. You know, I think about the role of Radio Mille Collines in the Rwandan genocide as a place where they drummed up support and got people to go out and murder their neighbors. That's the same thing that happened on Facebook in places like Myanmar. So in some ways, this is an old story and a new story. But we are going into a really interesting time where social media, I think, is going to be a huge factor -- the 2024 presidential election.
Cottle: Interesting is one word for it.
Polgreen: Maybe terrifying is a better word. One of the things that I've been thinking about -- and I'm curious what you guys think about this -- is, what does it mean for our politics, and for 2024, that we're going to be looking at, presumably, a much more fragmented social media landscape, particularly around journalism and politics?
Carlos Lozada: I think it's great. I am all on board with the fragmentation of that illusion of the public square that Twitter gave us. It was just like, talking to ourselves, yet while thinking you were talking to everyone. Nothing I hated more than when someone on Twitter would say, "Hey, read the room." You know, we're in different rooms! We're not even in the same house sometimes, so like, shut up. I don't think that was healthy. I think some fragmentation of that is healthy.
Cottle: I will take the more contrarian view, which is that the fragmentation of the media landscape and letting people sit inside their echo chambers has been a problem up until this point, and I don't foresee it getting much better. And it also, again -- and I know this is like my obsession -- we have not figured out at all how to deal with misinformation. It's almost impossible to tell the fakes apart anymore. You can put Ron DeSantis' head on whoever you want. You can make people say whatever you want.
And if you're policing one or two major sites, that's one thing. But you're going to be policing dozens of these sites. And I think what is going to have to happen is you're going to have to go downstream and start teaching people how to deal with misinformation before they're ever on these sites.
Lozada: I trust fragmentation more than I trust monopolization, though.
Polgreen: That's what I was going to just say. To me, what you're describing actually sounds a lot more of what the paranoid, conspiratorial landscape looked like pre-social media. I mean, you had radio programs, and all of these conspiracy theory newsletters, like literally letters that would arrive in your mail. But they were all, I think, segmented against one another. You'd have the right-wing conspiracy theories and the left-wing conspiracy theorists, and they all had their own, "platforms," whether it was a radio show, or some people would record things and send them out on tapes. There's a huge and very varied history in the United States of the ways in which conspiratorial disinformation material moves around. And I think that rather than having a central clearinghouse for it where anyone can come and go and get it, having it fragmented on lots of different platforms feels, to me, a lot more manageable, in a way that those types of theories have a harder time getting into the bloodstream of the body politic, because they're sort of stuck in these cul de sacs.
Cottle: I don't know. Twitter was not the primary source of the folks who decided they wanted to trash the Capitol, right?
Polgreen: Well, no. But I think what's interesting as well, and this is a thing that's come up in a lot of the conversations that Meta executives have had about Threads. And of course, they are just so thrilled with themselves at having launched the fastest growing social media app ever in the world. I think Threads is now up to about 100 million users. But I listen to Adam Mosseri, who's the head of Instagram, be interviewed by our colleagues on "Hardfork," The New York Times technology podcast, and they're saying very explicitly that we do not see this as a platform for news and for journalism and politics. And Meta, as a whole, I think has been moving very hard in a direction away from news and politics, because who wants the hassle? It's brought a lot of unwanted scrutiny. So they're really leaning in -- and the reason that this is built off of Instagram, I think, is because they're leaning into entertainment and sports and influencers and beauty and those kinds of things. And yes, journalists will be there, and yes, politicians will be there just like they are on Instagram and Facebook now, but I think as a company, Meta is running as fast and as far as it can away from news and politics.
Cottle: Maybe. Although with the presidential race coming up, Mark Zuckerberg does not have a great track record on putting anything above his money-grubbing. So I will remain vaguely hopeful, but I'm not going to count on it.
Lozada: You know, they fail, but then a new one comes along. Like remember Friendster? One of my favorite moments was in 2009, there was a book that came out called "Stealing Myspace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America." And it was published just as the site was cratering, and Twitter and Facebook were becoming dominant.
I logged onto Threads and then immediately deleted my account because I got all these qualms. But it's hard to imagine our giving up entirely on these digital instant gratification machines that reward us for pomposity and popularity.
Cottle: There's no way it's going away. I mean, once you've introduced something like this, it's going to spiral, and the best that you can hope for is that each iteration learns something from the previous one. I see no sign that we're doing that right now, but that's the best you can hope for.

Full text: A reader ponders her next move after being left out of vacation plans with four other women.
I am part of a friend group with four other women. They are going on an amazing international trip and didn't invite me. I have traveled successfully with one of the women and less successfully with the organizer of the trip. (That led to some distance between us, which we have since repaired.) I am really hurt and deflated by my exclusion. I love to travel, but my partner can't afford trips like this, so I rely on my friends as travel partners. I also like and respect these women, even if they're not my closest friends. But this experience makes me feel that I'm not important to any of them. What's my best move? Talk to the organizer? Confront each of them? Or back away from the group?
HOME ALONE
I know you want a specific outcome here: to board that plane in a party of five. That's probably not happening, though. (I'm sorry. I know it hurts to be excluded.) But if you look beyond this one trip, you may see other opportunities and -- more important -- decide these women are still your friends.
Logistically, traveling as a foursome is much easier than as a quintet. Tables for four are more plentiful in restaurants than tables for five (which are really tables for six). Four people can fit in one cab and share two hotel rooms. What's more, traveling well with other people often boils down to personal rhythms: When do we like to wake up? How active are we? How much time alone do we need? These factors, and even your bad trip with the organizer, say little about the quality of relationships, though. Your friends' (possibly pragmatic) decision is not evidence of dislike.
Now, you say your partner can't afford international travel. So, why not plan an amazing domestic trip? You also hint at closer friends. Hello? They sound promising. There's certainly no harm in telling the international travelers that you would be keen to join them next time. Honor your hurt feelings, but don't blow this one episode out of proportion, OK?
How Soon Should Other People Start Saving for My Kids' College?
I am planning our annual backyard party to celebrate my children's birthdays: My son is turning 7, and my daughter is turning 4. We are inviting a dozen families. I would like to let our guests know about our 529 college savings plans for the kids and the option of contributing to them as an alternative to buying gifts. My children don't need any more toys, and it pains me to see a $ 50 toy ignored when that same $ 50 could help pay their tuition someday. Is there a polite way to let guests know about this?
MOM
I applaud your foresight: Planning for the ever-rising costs of college with a tax-advantaged 529 savings plan is a smart move. Let me note, too, that I am not the party czar. You get to make this call for yourself. In your place, I would probably feel comfortable letting family and very close friends know about the accounts.
But I don't think a backyard birthday party for small children is the right venue for soliciting contributions to college savings plans. I may be out of step here: I would not be giving children $ 50 gifts, either. (Put me down for a book or a fun craft project at $ 20 a pop.) Personally, I would save the 529 option for more momentous occasions: elementary-school graduations and other rites of passage.
Save It for the Scrapbook, Will Ya?
I remember when expecting friends to look through a stack of vacation photos was considered rude. Isn't it just as rude, if not more so, to push an iPhone in a friend's face to make her look at vacation pictures? "Look at our hotel lobby in Naples!" "Look what we had for lunch in Rome!" How do I get out of this situation without ruining friendships?
FRIEND
If only this annoyance were limited to travel photos! I am frequently shown pictures of ordinary kitchen renovations, run-of-the-mill brunches and children in every activity. (And don't forget the dead time while friends search their camera rolls for that perfect shot.) Still, criticizing people for common behavior, even nicely, rarely succeeds.
Here's my script: "Please put your phone away! I look at screens all day long. I'm interested in you. Tell me more about your trip. You can send me the photos later." Note: It sometimes works.
No Plus One? But What if He Doesn't Shed?
A friend of ours asks -- every time we invite him over -- if he can bring his cat. Is he for real? We don't want his cat at our house. How bad is it that we say no every time? We can't truthfully claim to have allergies, but we will do so if it helps.
HOSTS
You mean, bring the cat in a carrier? I have never heard of bringing a free-range cat to a social event. Still, the ordinary rules apply: As hosts, you are entitled to create your guest list. It may be hard to refuse your friend repeatedly, but you are doing nothing wrong. Just say, "We'd rather not have your cat." Even if your friend refuses your invitations, everyone will live to purr another day.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

Full text: In early July, Meta -- the company behind Instagram and Facebook -- debuted an app, Threads, which quickly claimed the title of most rapidly downloaded app in history. Threads, a text-based conversation platform, is aimed as a direct rival to Twitter, which has struggled in recent months under the leadership of Elon Musk. With many predicting Twitter's imminent demise, we are looking back at some of the defunct platforms of the past -- like Friendster, MySpace and Orkut -- and how they paved the way for the current generation. Here are a few things to read and listen to.
READ 'Hatching Twitter' This 2013 book by Nick Bilton tells the story of Twitter's founding and rise. Though only a decade old, "Hatching Twitter" feels like a missive from a different era in Silicon Valley culture and may prove to be a timely read if the app does go belly up.
READ 'Writing on the Wall' This 2014 book by the journalist Tom Standage offers a sweeping history of human communication -- from Roman scrolls to text messages -- that contextualizes modern social media in a long tradition of connection.
LISTEN 'Main Accounts: The Story of MySpace' This podcast, hosted by the writer Joanne McNeil, takes a deep dive into what it calls the "incredibly influential and incredibly messy" history of MySpace and how the bygone platform transformed the internet.
LISTEN 'StartUp' In 2017 the tech podcast "StartUp" dedicated two episodes to the (meteoric) rise and fall of Friendster, offering a play-by-play analysis of the platform, an early-aughts Facebook prequel. The show features interviews with Friendster's founder, Jonathan Abrams.

Pence Collects Just $1.2 Million, Aides Say, a Worrying Sign for His 2024 Campaign: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The notably low figure raised new doubts about Republican voters' enthusiasm for the former vice president, as well as questions about whether he will qualify for the first G.O.P. debate.
Former Vice President Mike Pence has raised a paltry $ 1.2 million for his presidential campaign, according to two campaign aides, a sum that raises dire questions about Republicans' appetite for Mr. Pence in 2024.
Now Mr. Pence's campaign is fighting to qualify for the first televised Republican presidential debate next month in Milwaukee. An aide said he had not yet received donations from 40,000 donors, the threshold required to make the debate stage.
Mr. Pence, who entered the race on June 5, was always a long-shot candidate in a contest dominated by his onetime running mate, former President Donald J. Trump. Adding to Mr. Pence's challenges, he is also competing against other candidates, such as Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who appeal to evangelical voters.
Mr. Pence's repeated defense of his actions to certify Mr. Trump's defeat before Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, has alienated him from Mr. Trump's loyal base without appearing to win many converts from the wing of the Republican Party that wants to move on from the former president.
Unlike other candidates who have employed online gimmicks to secure 40,000 donors, Mr. Pence has invested little in seeking out contributors on the internet. His campaign has spent just $ 14,230 in advertising on Facebook and Google, according to data collected by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a marketing and communications agency, a figure that is one-fortieth of what has been spent on those platforms by Vivek Ramaswamy, a political newcomer who joined the race in February.
In an admission of its struggle to raise money online, the Pence campaign plans to spend a large bulk of what it has raised on a robust direct-mail program aimed at helping him accrue enough donors to qualify for the first debate.
The super PAC supporting Mr. Pence, Committed to America, had raised an additional $ 2.7 million during the fund-raising reporting period that ended June 30, an aide said. For a fund-raising vehicle that can accept unlimited contributions, such a total is quite small.
Other Republican presidential candidates have announced far larger fund-raising sums from the three-month reporting period; some of them, unlike Mr. Pence, were in the race for the entire quarter.
Mr. Trump said his campaign and his joint fund-raising committee had raised $ 35 million in the second quarter. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida announced he had raised about $ 20 million. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, raised $ 4.3 million for her campaign and an additional $ 3 million for her affiliated committees. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said his campaign had raised $ 6.1 million.
Even Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, who is largely self-funding his own hopeful campaign that began the same day as Mr. Pence's, said on Friday that he had raised $ 1.6 million from donors, in addition to $ 10 million of his own money he has given to his campaign.
Mr. Burgum has been using gimmicks like offering $ 20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people to donate at least $ 1 to his campaign, or the chance to win a Yeti cooler for a low-dollar donation, all in the hopes of making the debate stage.

Restrictions On Social Media For Biden Staff Are Paused: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A Fifth Circuit panel temporarily lifted a judge's order that had blocked the administration from contacting platforms about most of their content.
A federal appeals court on Friday paused a judge's order that had blocked much of the Biden administration from talking to social media sites about content.
The case could have significant First Amendment implications and affect the conduct of social media companies and their cooperation with government agencies.
In its three-sentence order, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said the preliminary injunction issued this month by a federal judge in Louisiana would be put aside "until further orders of the court." The appeals court also called for expedited oral arguments in the case.
In the lawsuit, Missouri, Louisiana and five individuals said that President Biden's campaign, his administration and outside groups pressured social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube to take down content that it objected to. That content included conservative claims about the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 presidential election, and a story about Hunter Biden, the president's son.
The plaintiffs secured a victory on July 4 when Judge Terry A. Doughty of U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana found that they were likely to be able to prove that the Biden administration engaged in an illegal effort to silence speech on the social media platforms.
"If the allegations made by the plaintiffs are true," Judge Doughty wrote, "the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States history."
Judge Doughty, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, said White House and administration officials had used private communications and public pronouncements to pressure the tech giants to remove content related to the pandemic and the Covid vaccines.
The judge's preliminary injunction blocked several agencies -- including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security -- from urging the platforms to take down "protected free speech." The order said the government agencies could still discuss content related to categories including criminal activity, threats to national security and foreign election interference.
Legal scholars have said the broad nature of the injunction may make it difficult for the government to follow it. The Department of Justice appealed the order the day after it was issued.
The case proceeds amid a pitched partisan battle over online speech. Republicans have for years accused Silicon Valley companies of disproportionately removing posts from the accounts of conservative publishers and personalities. Democrats have said the tech platforms are not taking enough content down, allowing false, hateful and violent messages to spread widely.
Republican lawmakers in Texas and Florida passed laws in 2021 barring social media sites from taking down certain political content.
The tech industry has challenged those laws on First Amendment grounds, saying companies have a right to moderate their platforms as they see fit. Many experts believe those legal challenges will ultimately reach the Supreme Court.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of us is a Twitter addict; the other not so much. In the end, we were both unsure how people might use Threads in the long run.
When we -- Brian X. Chen and Mike Isaac, both longtime tech journalists -- got an assignment from our editor last week to review Threads, the new social network from Meta, it was like a blast from the past.
Both of us have written about social networks for over a dozen years. In the last half dozen of those years, the social media landscape has been largely static -- with the exception of the rise of the short-video app TikTok -- and was dominated by Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.
The arrival of Threads, which was spun out of Instagram and is aimed as a prime place for public, real-time conversations, shakes up that scene. While the new app could end up a fad, it could also be a potent threat to Twitter, which has retained its crown as a hub of conversation for more than a decade.
But how many of us will hang out on Threads? We wondered how we would take to it since one of us -- Brian -- is a casual Twitter user, and the other -- Mike -- is a longtime Twitter addict, which might affect our experience with Meta's new app. Here's what we found about Threads' pros and cons and whether it might become a part of your life.
BRIAN Hello, Mike! It's been a while since we did a collaborative review. Years ago we nerded out on the new PlayStation and Xbox releases. And now we're back together -- why, again?
MIKE Yes, we're back, this time to peruse the hottest social app of the moment, Threads, which is made by Meta. After playing with it for a few days, I'm starting to wonder if I can kick my Twitter addiction by replacing it with a "friendlier" social network crafted by Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief.
So far, I'm enjoying it. But it definitely feels like a stripped-down version of Twitter. No hashtags, heavy on the influencers -- and the worst part is, a lot of the people in my replies don't seem to get my jokes that usually do well on Twitter.
Brian, I'm worried that all the people coming to Threads from Instagram just don't know how to post.
BRIAN Well, that's the interesting thing. Threads is a Twitter clone, but Meta is introducing the concept to never-tweeters who have been on Instagram. So there's going to be an awkward phase of acclimating.
But let me back up for a second. Threads is a free app you download from the Apple or Google app store. To set it up, you connect it with your Instagram account. Threads then invites you to follow all your friends on Instagram.
From there, it shows a timeline of posts, and you can compose short memos that get published for the public to see. You can embed photos, too, but the focus is text, just like on Twitter.
What are the differences from Twitter that you immediately noticed?
MIKE It feels like Twitter, but on easy mode.
For one, Threads is algorithmically curated, just like Facebook or Instagram. That means when you come in, you see a bunch of different posts based on your interests, whether they were posted five hours ago or five minutes ago. (Is it posted, or is it threaded? Have we decided on the verbiage yet?)
That's a departure from what we're used to with Twitter, where the marquee feature is the reverse chronological timeline. That means you see every single post from people you follow in reverse order, which made Twitter indispensable for breaking news and live events.
With Threads, I think the algorithmic curation is intentional on Instagram's part. They have said they want to make Threads "friendly" as people enter. It feels a bit sterile to me, but I'm also not being bombarded with hate speech and racist tirades, which I consider a big plus.
BRIAN To me, Meta's interest-based algorithm is a major turnoff. It's made my Threads feed a pile of posts from accounts I don't follow, primarily influencers and brands advertising their products. I see very few posts from my actual friends.
To be fair, Twitter's timeline isn't great, either. The quality is deteriorating because of changes that affect what people read on the site, including the requirement to pay $ 8 a month for a Twitter Blue subscription for your posts to show up on others' timelines.
One other big difference between Threads and Twitter: The character limit on Threads is 500 characters, whereas on Twitter it's 280 characters for free accounts.
Are more characters a good thing?
MIKE I don't think so. Brevity is the soul of wit, right? A banger of a tweet comes in short form, in my opinion, not writing a blog post inside of what's supposed to be a brief message.
Twitter has tested this paid Twitter Blue option where people can post insanely long tweets of 10,000 characters. I feel like that's getting away from the original point of Twitter's short-form messages. But maybe I'm just a curmudgeon.
I'm curious: How has it been for you on Threads, overlapping your Twitter-self with your Instagram following?
It's been a jarring experience for me. I'm very different on my Insta than on Twitter. On Insta, I'm usually posting things I've cooked that week or the latest concert I've attended. Twitter is more my space for writing about work and the tech industry, while occasionally posting snippets from my personal life. Threads feels like a hybrid of both -- at least for the moment.
BRIAN It's been tricky for me, too, so I haven't posted much. Like many people, I converted my Instagram into a private account years ago because I didn't want the public to see photos of my family. It became a "friends-only" network.
With Threads, I now have to think again about what I would share publicly. It's a trip.
MIKE Totally hear you. I'm still going to try it, but I'm curious if you think this is going to be the next big thing? Especially given that you're somewhat less active on Twitter than I am.
BRIAN I don't place bets on tech products as if they are horses. But based on my reporting about how everyday people -- who use tech but don't obsess over it -- engage with social networks, they probably won't post much on Threads.
The truth is Twitter isn't a social network, and neither is Threads. Both are broadcasting platforms for big brands, celebrities, politicians and media outlets to share information with their followers.
This type of network isn't conducive to how people actually socialize in communities. In social clubs, people congregate in smaller groups around shared interests. They don't crowd into an enormous conference room and shout like we do on Twitter and now Threads.
MIKE Absolutely. I have a decent Twitter following that mostly knows what it's going to get from me and understands when I'm joking. But I'm very aware that when a tweet of mine goes viral and travels outside that sphere of people who know me, I am 100 percent going to get misinterpreted -- and probably insulted. We call that "context collapse."
BRIAN Meta knows this, too. You reported a few years ago that Mark Zuckerberg said people were increasingly shifting away from the big social media platform toward smaller, more siloed networks. Those included private Facebook groups and messaging apps.
MIKE Shout out to the private Slack and Discord groups I'm in that only contain a handful of close friends.
BRIAN And that all makes sense. People have learned that it's not a great idea to share lots of personal information in the public sphere.
Also, if I want to talk to you, why would I @ you publicly rather than message you? That's probably the biggest thing Threads lacks compared with Twitter -- direct messaging -- which makes Threads an inferior product at the moment. But it's a matter of time until that's added, since that feature is already part of Instagram.
MIKE I do think there's a sort of performative element to talking in the public sphere, where my conversations with you take on a different tone and meaning -- sort of like we're talking onstage in front of an audience. There's something fun about that. But it often can get very unfun very quickly. Messaging, as you note, helps circumvent that.
BRIAN For engaging with brands and influencers, text has also already lost the battle. The growing popularity of TikTok and Instagram's Reels is evidence that casual tech users, especially young people, would rather see videos of the celebrities and influencers they follow and not read their bite-size text.
At the end of the day, comparing Twitter and Threads is tough since Threads is part of Instagram, which is much larger than Twitter. If the features improve, I could see myself switching to Threads from Twitter eventually because of Instagram's sheer size, which could bring me more followers. (I'm @bxchen on Threads, by the way.) But like others, I probably won't spend much time hanging out with friends there.
What about you?
MIKE Right now I'm doing the inconvenient juggling act of trying to post different things to six different networks, and it is not exactly fun. But I assume at least something will die off eventually and I can stop churning out the posts. At least, I hope so.
See you on ... Threads, I guess?
BRIAN You need to follow me back first, Mike.

These Hot Ice Cream Spots Will Keep You Cool: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's hot, sticky and sweltering. Time for ice cream.
Well, folks, it's miserable out there. The heat, the humidity, the bugs, the wildfire smoke, the impending threat of El Niño.
But at least we have ice cream.
Yes, it's finally that time of the year for my annual newsletter about the undisputed champion of summer (after mosquitoes). Here's my new list of frosty options for those days when nothing will cool you down except a frozen treat. Be sure, too, to check out last year's dispatch, as most of the recommendations still stand.
A combination ice cream and natural-wine shop
New York is the land of weird mash-ups. The hot dog shops that also sell papaya juice. A wonderful bakery tucked into an otherwise nondescript office building. And don't forget the ice cream shop/natural-wine bar.
That last label belongs to Caleta, on the border of the East Village and Alphabet City. Right across the street from Tompkins Square Park, this is an ideal place to drop by for an inspired scoop of Bad Habit ice cream. The flavors change constantly, but are always reliably interesting, whether it's coconut stracciatella, a not-too-sweet cafe con leche or burnt cheesecake.
You could stop right there, with a cone or a pint to go, of which there are plenty. But if you're feeling hungry, you can take a seat at the bar and try one or a few glasses of a sparkling red from the Czech Republic or an orange wine from Spain while noshing on warm sourdough bread with salted butter or a heaping plate of smoked prosciutto. In other words, exactly the type of low-lift meal that defines the season.
Go hard on soft serve
When the soft-serve wars begin, where will you stand? As a Mister Softee loyalist? With Ray Alvarez and his Candy Store? Upon mountains of boba milk tea soft serve from Xing Fu Tang? Or by the side of Morgenstern's Bananas and its dairy-free soft serve?
Unlike at the original Morgenstern's, the list of options at this offshoot is relatively short and (all) sweet. And if you hate bananas, you'll be happy to know that there are plenty of creative and classic alternatives, including coffee hazelnut, a chocolate option that's richer than any other chocolate soft serve I've ever had, and coconut Thai tea. There's also a fridge stocked with seltzer and water, a useful antidote for that thirsty feeling you always get after a scoop or three.
An oldie but very goodie
If all those newfangled flavors have you in a twist, I always reserve a space in my recommendations for a classic, no-fuss option. This year that honor goes to Eddie's Sweet Shop in Forest Hills, Queens. For some, this old-school soda fountain's existence may be old news (it is, after all, the city's oldest ice cream parlor), but in a city that is constantly in flux, it bears repeating just how amazing this place is.
Eddie's gets pretty busy on weekends, with families jockeying for a table or a seat at the counter, where they can enjoy vanilla ice cream and sundaes served in delicate sterling silver dishes. If you don't plan on staying, though, I recommend very, very politely pushing your way to the front of the line and letting the cashier know you're just here for a cone -- there's no real discernment between those who are dining in or dining out. But then again, you have to be a little pushy to make it here anyway.

U.S. and E.U. Seal a Deal on Sharing Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A deal to ensure that data from Meta, Google and scores of other companies can continue flowing between the United States and the European Union was completed on Monday, after the digital transfer of personal information between the two jurisdictions had been thrown into doubt because of privacy concerns.
The decision adopted by the European Commission is the final step in a yearslong process and resolves -- at least for now -- a dispute about American intelligence agencies' ability to gain access to data about European Union residents. The debate pitted U.S. national security concerns against European privacy rights.
The accord, known as the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, gives Europeans the ability to object when they believe their personal information has been collected improperly by American intelligence agencies. An independent review body made up of American judges, called the Data Protection Review Court, will be created to hear such appeals.
Didier Reynders, the European commissioner who helped negotiate the agreement with the U.S. attorney general, Merrick B. Garland, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, called it a "robust solution." The deal sets out more clearly when intelligence agencies are able to retrieve personal information about people in the European Union and outlines how Europeans can appeal such collection, he said.
"It's a real change," Mr. Reynders said in an interview. "Protection is traveling with the data."
President Biden issued an executive order laying the groundwork for the deal in October, requiring American intelligence officials to add more protections for the collection of digital information, including by making them proportionate to the national security risks.
The trans-Atlantic agreement was a top priority for the world's biggest technology companies and thousands of other multinational businesses that rely on the free flow of data. The deal replaces an accord known as Privacy Shield, which the European Union's highest court invalidated in 2020 because it did not include enough privacy protections.
The lack of an agreement had created legal uncertainty. In May, a European privacy regulator pointed to the 2020 judgment when fining Meta 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion) and ordering it to stop sending information about Facebook users in the European Union to the United States. Meta, like many businesses, moves data from Europe to the United States, where it has its headquarters and many of its data centers.
Other European privacy regulators ruled that services provided by American companies, including Google Analytics and MailChimp, could violate Europeans' privacy rights because they moved data through the United States.
The issue traces back to when Edward Snowden, a former U.S. national security contractor, released details of how America's foreign surveillance apparatus tapped into data stored by American tech and telecommunications companies. Under laws such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, U.S. intelligence agencies may seek access to data about international users from companies for national security purposes.
After the disclosure, an Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems, began a legal challenge arguing that Facebook's storage of his data in the United States violated his European privacy rights. The European Union's top court agreed, striking down two previous trans-Atlantic data-sharing pacts.
On Monday, Mr. Schrems said he planned to sue again.
"Just announcing that something is 'new,' 'robust' or 'effective' does not cut it before the Court of Justice," Mr. Schrems said in a statement, referring to the European Union's top court. "We would need changes in U.S. surveillance law to make this work -- and we simply don't have it."
Members of the European Parliament criticized the agreement. The Parliament had no direct role in the negotiations, but passed a nonbinding resolution in May that said the agreement failed to create adequate protection.
"The framework does not provide any meaningful safeguards against indiscriminate surveillance conducted by U.S. intelligence agencies," said Birgit Sippel, a European lawmaker from the Socialists and Democrats group who specializes in civil liberties issues. "This lack of protection leaves Europeans' personal data vulnerable to mass surveillance, undermining their privacy rights."
Mr. Reynders said people should wait to test the new policy in practice.
He said the new framework would establish a system through which Europeans could raise concerns with the American government. First, Europeans who suspect that an American intelligence agency is unfairly collecting their data must file a complaint with their national data protection regulator. After further review, the authorities will take the matter to American officials in a process that could eventually reach the new review panel.
Ms. Raimondo said this month that the U.S. Department of Justice had established that the European Union's 27 countries would have access to the tools that allowed them to complain about abuses of their rights. She said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had also confirmed that intelligence agencies added the safeguards established in Mr. Biden's order.
"This represents the culmination of months of significant collaboration between the United States and the E.U. and reflects our shared commitment to facilitating data flows between our respective jurisdictions while protecting individual rights and personal data," Ms. Raimondo said in a recent statement.

G.O.P. Candidate Offers $20 Gift Cards for $1 Donations: [National Desk]

Author: Huynh, Anjali

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The candidate, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the first primary debate.
How much is a dollar worth?
To Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, quite a lot.
Mr. Burgum is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the party's first primary debate on Aug. 23 -- the requirement that only candidates with at least 40,000 individual donors to their campaigns will be allowed on the stage.
A long-shot contender at the bottom of recent polls, Mr. Burgum is offering $ 20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donate at least $ 1 to his campaign. And one lucky donor, as his campaign advertised on Facebook, will have the chance to win a Yeti Tundra 45 cooler that typically costs more than $ 300 -- just for donating at least $ 1. The unusual offer was earlier reported by FWIW, a newsletter that tracks digital politics.
Mr. Burgum's push to prioritize donors over actual dollars is a sign of some candidates' desperation to make the debate stage and to seize some of the national spotlight from the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, and his top rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican candidate, recently ended a campaign ad with a direct plea that flashed on the screen to "Donate today, get Chris Christie on the debate stage."
Mr. Burgum's campaign acknowledged that its requests were directly tied to the debate and spun the gift-card giveaways into attacks on President Biden.
"Doug knows people are hurting because of Bidenflation, and giving Biden Economic Relief Gift Cards is a way to help 50,000 people until Doug is elected President to fix this crazy economy for everyone," said Lance Trover, a spokesman for the Burgum campaign.
Mr. Trover added that the efforts allowed the campaign to "secure a spot on the debate stage while avoiding paying more advertising fees to social media platforms who have owners that are hostile to conservatives."
Kyle Tharp, the author of the FWIW newsletter that reported on the solicitations, said that as part of his reporting process, he had donated $ 1 to the Burgum campaign. He did not receive any follow-up information about how he would receive the gift card, he said. The campaign later clarified on Twitter that 50,000 donors would receive a Visa or Mastercard gift card to their mailing address.
The campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how many donors had contributed so far.
The campaign's donations-for-cash strategy could raise potential legal concerns, said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer. Voters who make donations in exchange for gift cards, he said, might be considered straw donors because part or all of their donations are being reimbursed by the campaign.
"Federal law says 'no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person,"' Mr. Ryan said. "Here, the candidate is making a contribution to himself in the name of all these individual donors."
Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in election law, said that typically, campaigns ask the Federal Election Commission when engaging in new forms of donations.
The Burgum campaign's maneuver, he said, "certainly seems novel" and "raises concerns about whether it violates the prohibition on straw donations."
But some of the legal uncertainty, Mr. Hasen added, stems from the fact that "functionally, campaigns spend a lot of money to get small donations, especially in cases like this where they're trying to reach a debate threshold."
Mr. Burgum isn't alone in using his immense wealth -- he's a billionaire former software executive -- to bolster his campaign.
Perry Johnson, a businessman who also announced a hopeful bid for the Republican presidential nomination and who ran for Michigan governor last year, has spent $ 80,000 to $ 90,000 on ads promoting $ 1 hats that read, "I identify as 'Non-Bidenary,"' Facebook records show. His campaign said in a recent ad that it had reached 10,000 donors.
To qualify for the first presidential debate, candidates must have a minimum of 200 unique donors per state or territory in 20 states and territories, according to the Republican National Committee, which set the rules. They must also garner at least 1 percent in multiple national or early-voting state polls recognized by the committee.

In Real Estate, Women Bring a Reckoning: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Debra Kamin interviewed real estate agents who have been sexually harassed while on the job and left with little recourse.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was a series of posts shared to different real estate Facebook groups that startled Debra Kamin, a real estate reporter for The New York Times, earlier this year.
In one post, a female real estate agent said she was receiving phone calls and lewd voice mail messages from a man who had seen her picture on a "For Sale" sign. She wondered whether she should go to the police. In another post, a woman said she had lost a listing after refusing a client's sexual advances. She asked others whether she should tell her brokerage firm. Other women shared stories of receiving unsolicited nude photos and FaceTime calls from potential clients.
Women offered words of encouragement and advice in comments on each post. "I was really struck by these women who felt that they had to turn to one another for support," Ms. Kamin said in an interview. "It showed how sexual advances are considered as much a part of the job as showing houses."
Ms. Kamin began researching other incidents of sexual harassment and violence in the industry. She found an article that described the 2014 murder of Beverly Carter, an Arkansas real estate agent who was kidnapped and killed by a man who pretended to be a potential client.
In February, Ms. Kamin brought her findings to Nikita Stewart, the editor of the Real Estate desk, who agreed that Ms. Kamin should report on the dangers that female real estate agents face while on the job. For the article, which was published last weekend, Ms. Kamin interviewed several real estate agents who have faced sexual harassment and discussed the effect it has had on their careers and mental health. She also spoke with Beverly Carter's son, Carl Carter, who launched a nonprofit dedicated to real estate agent safety.
In an interview, Ms. Kamin shared how the unique nature of the business of selling homes can leave agents vulnerable to assault. This interview has been edited.
You wrote in your article that many real estate agents work independently. How does that contribute to issues in the industry?
Big brokerages like Re/Max or Compass have individual franchises. These franchises are very small and have just a handful of agents, so employee laws that apply to a company with more than 50 employees do not apply.
Most of the agents who work for those franchises are also not full-time employees; they are not on the payroll or covered by employee laws, so they can't make a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. They work for themselves and pay their taxes, but they still have to split their commissions and work through the brokerages for their day-to-day work. Many brokerages have protocols in place that encourage their agents to take safety courses and report troubling incidents, so it's not like they're ignoring the issue. But agents are still very much on their own if they're harassed.
How did you find your sources?
I posted in a couple of Facebook groups. A lot of women responded, but didn't want to go on the record -- which I totally understood.
I also have some contacts in the real estate industry that I work with as sources; I asked them to ping their networks. A few female real estate agents that I had worked with sent out messages to internal WhatsApp groups for women in the industry. The agents forwarded me all their responses. I had some days when I was just reading through reports of sexual harassment and assault. I had to take breaks and clear my head.
I would have an initial chat with the women who were willing to talk. I would make sure they felt comfortable and ask them to walk me through what they experienced. A couple of women had to obtain the police reports; with sexual harassment and assault reporting, often only the victim is able to access the records, for privacy reasons.
It was a lot of responsibility because I was asking them to relive something really terrible.
How did you speak with sources about such sensitive subjects?
It was kind of intuitive; I tried to talk to them the same way I would talk to a friend who came to me and said something had happened. I let them know that I was grateful that they were willing to share their story with me and they could stop at any time. I let them know that I understood that I was asking them to relive something difficult. And then I mostly just tried to listen. That was the most important thing.
Were there any people who declined to speak on the record and changed their mind later?
That did not happen, though I had an interesting experience with one of the women who I interviewed, Sara Ghodsi. She said she was happy to talk to me, but that what happened to her wasn't a big deal and she was fine. Then we started talking and she said that she had been assaulted while she was viewing a home to potentially sell. The client grabbed her and forcefully kissed her. She felt really scared because they were alone in the house, so she went on with the presentation and acted like it was fine -- which is something a lot of women do.
She finished the presentation and later filed a police report. She kept insisting to me that she was fine. During a phone interview, I heard her have a bit of an epiphany when she realized she was traumatized: She admitted that she hadn't made a real estate sale in over a year because she's afraid to show homes alone. I found myself walking her through the understanding that she was carrying around real trauma.
What do the real estate agents you spoke with think it would take for the industry to change?
Many agents said the only way things will change is if the entire industry makes shifts together. Brokerages need to require universal background checks from potential clients to view homes, for example, because otherwise clients will simply go elsewhere if an individual agent tries to put measures into place. They also suggested that organizations like the National Association of Realtors make safety training mandatory and contingent for membership. There needs to be industrywide standards.

The Blob That Threatened Florida . . . Is Disappearing: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The blob, known as the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, shrank in the Gulf of Mexico by 75 percent last month, scientists said.
For months, Florida's usually picturesque coast was plagued by a rotting tangle of seaweed, known as sargassum. Then, as quickly as the stinking mass arrived, it began to disappear.
Beachgoers rejoiced, posting pictures of white sands and sparkling waters to social media. Scientists said they had expected the sargassum in the Gulf of Mexico to wane eventually -- but not so fast, or by so much.
"That is a surprise," said Chuanmin Hu, a professor of oceanography at the University of South Florida, noting that there was still "a lot of sargassum" in the Tropical Atlantic. "The good news is the sargassum season for Florida is very likely over for this year. But for the Eastern Caribbean, it's not over yet," he said.
Last month, the amount of sargassum in the Gulf of Mexico dropped by a staggering 75 percent, Dr. Hu and colleagues at the University of South Florida Optical Oceanography Lab noted in a bulletin published last week.
Sargassum -- a type of macroalgae that is naturally abundant in the Sargasso Sea -- has long been seen floating in mats across the North Atlantic. But in 2011, scientists began to observe extraordinary accumulations of the seaweed extending in a belt from West Africa to the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, according to a 2019 study.
The immense bloom has continued to grow almost every year.
In March, scientists said they expected the blob to come ashore in Florida and elsewhere along the Gulf of Mexico. At sea, the blob provides habitat for fish, crabs and sea turtles, but on land it began to rot, emitting toxic fumes and fouling the region's beaches over the busiest summer months.
"Avoid touching or swimming near seaweed," the city of Deerfield Beach, Fla., warned residents on Facebook, noting research that suggested the bloom may contain bacteria. In Miami-Dade County, tractors with rear-mounted blades traversed 17 miles of coastline daily to "mix and blend" the seaweed, the county said.
Like other plants, sargassum has a natural life cycle, Dr. Hu said, and scientists expected it to decrease in the Gulf of Mexico by around September.
But scientists don't know why the decline was so rapid. One theory is that strong winds caused by recent tropical storms could have dissipated the sargassum into smaller clumps, or sunk it to the ocean floor, Dr. Hu said, making it hard to see from a satellite. "There could be other reasons, we just don't know," he added.
While floating sargassum can benefit marine animals by providing shade and shelter, it begins to die once it comes ashore, degrading water quality and polluting beaches, scientists say. The decaying algae also releases hydrogen sulfide, a colorless gas that smells like rotten eggs, and can cause respiratory problems in humans. Some types of bacteria may colonize rafts of sargassum and marine plastics, which, once ashore, can pose a risk to public health, according to a recent study published by researchers from Florida Atlantic University.
Sarah Collier, who works for Seabird Key, a private island vacation rental in Key West, said that her community had been on edge since hearing of the sargassum blob earlier this year. "It's such a relief," she said of news that it was dissipating in the Gulf of Mexico, noting that she had not personally seen more seaweed than usual.
But while tour operators, holidaymakers and locals in Florida are enjoying sargassum-free beaches, the situation is not as rosy further south.
The beaches of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands, the Lesser Antilles Islands, Barbados and Trinidad will likely remain threatened by seaweed for the next one to two months, Dr. Hu said.
He and his colleagues predict that over the next two to three months, the amount of sargassum in the Gulf of Mexico will remain minimal, and that it will either decrease or remain stable in the Caribbean Sea. While that's good news for the residents of Florida's east coast, as well as the Florida Keys, sargassum is still likely to wash ashore in parts of the Caribbean, they said in the bulletin, noting that it was "difficult to predict exact timing and location for individual beaching events."

Full text: Michelle Evans and Eric Koch did not think second marriages were in their future -- until a mutual friend urged them to connect.
The Brady Bunch have nothing on Michelle Lynn Evans and Eric Randolph Koch: Between the two of them, they have eight children and 48 years of marriage with former partners. While Ms. Evans had no intention of marrying again, and Dr. Koch remained ambivalent as well, Facebook and a mutual friend, Susan Ramos, changed all that.
"Susan is like my adopted mom," Ms. Evans, 51, said. "She was always encouraging me to date. She felt like I was too young to spend the rest of my life alone." Ms. Ramos encouraged Ms. Evans to reach out to a man she admired -- Ms. Ramos's dentist. After a year of nudging, Ms. Evans finally sent a Facebook request to Dr. Koch on Sept. 22, 2021.
When Dr. Koch, 61, received her friend request, he thought "she's a nice-looking lady" and realized that Ms. Ramos was a mutual friend. So he accepted Ms. Evans's request.
The two began exchanging messages over Facebook. Since texting felt "very sterile" to Dr. Koch, he asked Ms. Evans for her number instead.
Dr. Koch called her almost immediately. They talked for three hours.
"The first time we talked, her voice was so sweet and genuine," Dr. Koch said. "I was kind of hooked at that point. I was like, 'When can we talk again?' It wasn't unusual for us to talk three or four times a day."

Because of their schedules, it took them three weeks to meet in person. For their first date, they went to see the singer Steven Curtis Chapman on Oct. 13, 2021. When he picked her up that night, "it wasn't just her, but her kids as well" at the door, he said. "I assured them I wouldn't keep her out too late."
Not one to kiss on the first date, he held out his hand for her to shake at the end of the evening. But Ms. Evans said that she was a hugger: "So we hugged and said good night." It would be two more months before their first kiss.
They were both eager to get to know each other first. Dr. Koch has four children from his previous 28-year marriage, two by birth and two by adoption, while Ms. Evans was previously married for almost 20 years and also has four children. "I had really set my bar really high," she said. At the time, she recalled thinking, "If this is going to be real, we are going to have to start by being friends."
Ms. Evans is a registered radiologic technologist. She works for Urgent Doc, an urgent care center, in Livingston, Texas, and occasionally covers shifts at Dedicated Medical Center & Urgent Care in Woodville, Texas. She holds an associate degree in science from John A. Logan College in Carterville, Ill.; another associate degree in radiology from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Ill.; and a bachelors in applied arts and science from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. Ms. Evans was raised in Marion, Ill.
Dr. Koch practices general dentistry in Jasper, Texas, and has a satellite practice in Tyler, Texas. He holds a doctorate from the Houston School of Dentistry at the University of Texas Health Science Center. Dr. Koch grew up in Beaumont, Texas.
After their first phone call, they went on to have daily conversations. "Talking to him every day about everything was what made us become close," Ms. Evans said. "After three months, he told me he didn't want to see anyone else -- that it was just me he wanted to be with, and I told him I felt the same way."
Dr. Koch proposed twice -- first on Jan. 9, 2022, when he was hospitalized for pneumonia related to Covid-19. "We were in a hospital room, and I was thinking about how this woman would not leave my side," Dr. Koch said. He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
The couple kept the engagement a secret until six months later, when Dr. Koch formally proposed with a ring. However, they did not move in together until after their honeymoon.
The two were wed in front of 100 people at Our Lady of the Pines Catholic Church in Woodville on June 24 by Reverend Ronald Foshage, a priest from St. Michael's Catholic Church in Jasper. A reception followed in the church's family center.
"She finally walked in, and I thought I was going to faint," Dr. Koch said. "I had a drop in blood pressure, and then I was just weeping."
Many of their children served as members of the wedding party, including maid of honor and best man. Ms. Evans's youngest son walked her down the aisle.
"It was such a joining of families," Ms. Evans said, adding, "This marriage is my forever."

Full text: After ending a yearslong extramarital affair, a reader worries about a coming dinner party that will be attended by both the former lover and the reader's spouse.
I had an extramarital affair for several years. It ended recently -- abruptly and unpleasantly -- and I blocked all digital and telephonic communication with my ex to ensure that I don't weaken and get involved again. The affair was fulfilling sexually and emotionally, but it was also taboo: We are both otherwise happily married and socialize together as couples. Now, I am apprehensive about future encounters. Recently, we all juggled our calendars to attend a small, upcoming dinner party at a third couple's home. How should I handle this? I don't want to reach out and ask for a truce; my emotions are still too raw -- with hurt and anger not far from the surface. I don't know how to justify canceling the dinner to my spouse, but I'm afraid I may lose it if I go.
SPOUSE
It is not my place to judge you, but it's not my job to drive your getaway car, either. (I would see this differently if you had an open marriage.) I get the awkwardness of the upcoming dinner. Still, after years of lying to your spouse about this affair -- by omission or commission -- you would seem to be well equipped to extricate yourself from dinner on your own.
I agree with you about cutting off contact with your ex -- less to spare you discomfort or temptation than to avoid continued disrespect of your spouse, who is apparently unaware of your yearslong betrayal. Practically, you and your ex have formed a mutual-destruction alliance: Neither of you can unmask the other without unmasking yourself. There is a kind of safety in that.
But I urge you to reckon with the deeper issues here: You have broken faith with your spouse. For years, you have misled your partner about your sexual and emotional fidelity. (Indeed, you still seem profoundly involved with your ex.) If monogamy does not suit you, tell your spouse. This dinner is a mere footnote compared with your dishonesty in your marriage. I suggest working with a therapist to decide if -- and how -- you can repair the damage.
Your Best Advocate at Work? She's Sitting at Your Desk.
I am thinking of leaving my job as an executive assistant after 12 years. Originally, I had my own office, but I was moved to a cubicle -- temporarily, I was told -- about 10 years ago. Now, I sit in a suite with two offices that have been empty for years. When I asked the human resources director if I could move into one of them, she asked why I needed it. I told her I have confidential files that would be safer in a locked office. She offered me a file cabinet that locked instead, and said she wants to save the offices for future employees who may need them. This shows a clear lack of respect for me and my position. Your thoughts?
EMPLOYEE
I know it can be hard to speak up for ourselves. But when the H.R. director asked why you needed an office, why did you give her that malarkey about confidential files instead of being straight with her? You were promised an office years ago, and empty offices seem to abound.
I don't know if your company is consolidating space, on a hiring spree or concerned about the precedent of giving private offices to executive assistants. When we want something from our employers, though, we have to make the case for it. You didn't. (And your employer solved the problem you raised with the files.) I suggest trying again -- but more candidly this time.
The Going Rate for Hospitality
My wife's sister came to stay with us for her annual weeklong visit. We look forward to it! She stays in our guest room, and we provide most meals. When we incur small expenses on her behalf, we are happy to cover them. After she left, we found $ 80 on the night stand in her bedroom. We assume it was to compensate us for the extra costs of her visit. We appreciate her intent, but how can we let her know the cash was unwanted without embarrassing her, or seeming ungrateful?
BROTHER-IN-LAW
I can imagine how finding cash on the night stand could make you feel like a chambermaid in your own home. You or your wife can certainly tell her sister that payment isn't necessary: "We love your visits! A simple 'thank you' is plenty."
Still, it can be even more gracious to meet people where they are. If your sister-in-law wants to reimburse you by covering the cost of her meals and local transportation, why not let her? No need to control what makes other people feel comfortable.
Answer Me!!! (S'il Vous Plaît)
I am hosting an anniversary party in two weeks, and I am deeply annoyed at having to drag RSVPs out of my friends. I am sending cheerful texts and follow-up emails, but I find it galling. How do I reframe this so I enjoy the party when it comes?
HOST
It would be terrifically convenient if other people prioritized the things we care about. But they don't. They don't mean to be rude; they're just distracted by the onslaught of their own priorities. Stop typing and call them! In 20 minutes, you can probably knock off most of the stragglers.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

The Modern Farmhouse Is Here to Stay: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: In a divided country, a clean look and a neutral color palette is the aesthetic comforting communities around the country.
Drive through any American suburb and odds are you'll spot a modern farmhouse in its natural habitat. The style is hard to miss: white board and batten vertical siding, large black frame windows, and gables. A covered porch, with a swing or maybe Adirondack chairs. A tin roof. And of course, house numbers in sans serif font.
Love it or hate it, the modern farmhouse is the millennial answer to the baby boomer McMansion.
This post-agrarian look is the defining style of the current era -- dominating renovations, new construction and subdivisions in communities with no connection to farming, with interiors that have open concept floor plans, wide plank wood floors, plenty of shiplap, and kitchens with apron sinks and floating shelves made of reclaimed wood. Even multifamily homes are getting the modern farmhouse treatment, falling into the barndominium category, as they embrace vertical siding, gables and tin roofs, giving a folksy nod to apartment complexes.
In May, the wallpaper designer Hovia declared modern farmhouse the most popular interior design style in the country, a sentiment echoed by architects, designers and home builders who say they regularly field requests from clients eager for a clean look with a neutral color palette that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary.
"When it comes down to it, those are very classic materials," said Leanne Ford, an interior designer who has hosted two HGTV shows with her brother and is known for her affinity for white on white. "The porch, the board and batten, the swing, those are all beautiful things that have stood the test of time and are still stunning. Those are going to live a long and happy life and still be beautiful in 5 or 10 or 20 years."
Toss all those elements together and you have an aesthetic that is seemingly everywhere, as homes of all stripes -- a split-level ranch, a four square, a craftsman bungalow -- routinely get the modern farmhouse treatment.
In 2020, when Lauren and Jeffrey Sachs decided it was time to leave Manhattan for the suburbs, they landed on a 4,500-square-foot modern farmhouse on a leafy street of colonial revivals in Verona, N.J. In its previous life, the house had been a modest, two-bedroom cape with cedar shingles and black shutters. But the previous owners had torn the house down, leaving only a single wall, and reinvented it as an archetype of modern farmhouse design.
"I knew exactly what I wanted," said Sonia Sun, 48, the previous owner who steered the two-year renovation, plucking ideas from Google searches and design magazines. "I wanted something that would mesh with the neighborhood."
But by the time the work was done and the house was livable, her children had "meshed" in the town where they were living while they remodeled, and so they stayed in Morris County, in a six-bedroom colonial craftsman style home. If she ever gave the house an update, she would give it the modern farmhouse treatment. "Definitely Studio McGee, 100 percent," she said, referring to the popular design studio. "I love her and Joanna Gaines, baby."
The Gaines Effect
Modern farmhouse, a contemporary style that bears a passing resemblance to a traditional farmhouse, first entered the American lexicon a decade ago on "Fixer Upper," the HGTV sensation that catapulted the hosts, Chip and Joanna Gaines, onto the national stage, and persuaded homeowners to decorate their walls with enormous clocks and word art proclaiming the banal -- Family! Eat! Coffee!
The Gaineses turned Waco, Texas, into an unlikely design destination as the city's old farmhouses were wrestled into the modern era, busy floral wallpaper stripped away to reveal virgin shiplap, the lowly building material reinvented as the main attraction.
It didn't take long for the style to overtake contemporary homes and consume Instagram feeds as kitchens bathed in white shaker cabinets and heavily veined countertops became standard. The look evolved, led by a new generation of celebrity designers with their own renovation shows and home furnishing lines, like Shea McGee of Studio McGee, who whitewashed brick and embraced blond, beige and wicker. While many designers and design critics predicted the look would have peaked by now, its staying power proves we're a long way from the summit.
Pottery Barn Kids advertises a modern farmhouse crib, on sale for $ 600, and Home Depot sells a modern farmhouse outdoor playhouse for $ 299. At Jessica Cloe Miniatures, the $ 450 six-room modern farmhouse dollhouse kit with board and batten siding is sold out, but you can still buy plenty of rustic side tables, soaker tubs and wooden trays writ small. Even Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian channeled the vibe for the exteriors of the side-by-side mansions they built in the Santa Monica mountains.
The National Association of Home Builders does not track the popularity of the style. But Deryl Patterson, the president of Housing Design Matters, which designs homes for builders, says the look accounts for more than a quarter of her company's work. "If a builder says, 'I need three elevations,' one will always be modern farmhouse," she said.
Mark Canale, a home builder outside Philadelphia, and a developer of a nine-house subdivision of modern farmhouses, heeded the advice of local real estate agents who told him that the demand was insatiable. "You have to build what satisfies everybody," he said, estimating that the appetite is large enough that, with enough land, he could sell three times as many homes in the same motif.
Ms. Sachs, 32, a stay-at-home mother, and Mr. Sachs, 36, who owns a commercial finance business, doubled down on modern farmhouse soon after they moved into the $ 1.351 million home. They added a brick walkway and cedar posts and beams on the porch. They replaced the garage doors with carriage-style ones. After spotting a tin roof on a cottage in the Hamptons, Ms. Sachs installed one on her house. "Honestly, I just thought it was fancy," she said, leaning against the leathered granite island in her kitchen one sunny afternoon. For Ms. Sachs, midcentury modern feels too cold, and the Italianate style she grew up with felt too ornate and uncomfortable. By contrast, modern farmhouse feels like home. "I feel like it's very evergreen," she said. "It's never really going to go out of style."
'Fetishism for Folksiness'
Fans of the style often describe it as classic and timeless, but the architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange begs to differ. "It's basically modernism in drag," she said of a style that manages to hide modernist elements -- big open windows and open floor plans -- behind creature comforts like gables and covered porches. Americans are drawn to the look, she said, because it has all the trappings of modernism without actually looking particularly modern. "Americans aren't really comfortable buying modern houses," she said. "That is a rich person's architecture."
Thomas Mellins, an architectural historian and a curator of the "House & Home" exhibition at National Building Museum, finds it fitting that Americans, who gravitate to styles that reflect larger cultural trends, chose this moment to land on a look that makes you think of "Little House on the Prairie," but only if the Ingalls family lived in the suburbs and worked in finance.
Consider the McMansion, the ultimate ode to excess, often derided for ill-conceived turrets, arches, columns and gables. The style dominated the early 2000s, as Americans embarked on a house spending spree fueled by reckless lending practices from banks doling out subprime mortgages. When the market came to a crash in 2008, the McMansion came down with it. The split-level ranch had a postwar heyday when Americans were so enamored with their cars they found a way to bring them inside.
And Americans' on-again off-again love affair with colonial revival rears its head during periods of heightened nationalism, like in the 1920s. "Immigration is cut off in 1921 and in 1924 and that is the moment colonial revival gets really popular again," said Mr. Mellins, an adjunct associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "There is a dark side to that. One could see a kind of xenophobia and a fear of the other and so you want to express your Americanness."
Now, at a moment when populism has taken hold amid deep political divisions, the style of the day is one that imagines a romanticized and fantastical agrarian past -- a real farmhouse doesn't have a walk-in shower with a waterfall showerhead or a sliding barn door to hide a well-appointed laundry room with a weathered placard that says "wash and dry." As the country grapples with existential questions about its identity and its future, the house of choice makes you think about spinning wool into yarn.
"There is an American fetishism for folksiness and rural life, and there is a longing for rural life that comes into the modern farmhouse," said Kate Wagner, the creator of the McMansion Hell blog. "It is alienating living in an exurb when the only thing you encounter is a huge strip mall. You have to make up for this barren, alienating landscape by devising some kind of homeliness in your house."
Ari Katz and Shari Sperling were so inspired by country life that they decided to bring it to their tightly-packed suburban neighborhood of split-level ranches in West Orange, N.J., a five-minute drive from the Sachses' house. "If I wasn't Jewish, I would probably be living in Montana," said Mr. Katz, who is orthodox and so lives within walking distance of his synagogue. "So I'm trying to bring Montana here, I'm trying to do our part to bring the West here. That was really our whole goal with this house."
Mr. Katz, 42, and Dr. Sperling, 43, spent half of 2021 and about $ 750,000 renovating their split-level ranch, adding another floor and giving the exterior the full modern farmhouse treatment, replete with white board and batten siding, black frame windows, a stone foundation and four wooden columns made of western redcedar, the official tree of British Columbia. The couple recently sold their dermatology practice where Dr. Sperling is a dermatologist and Mr. Katz is the general manager.
Sit on a black Adirondack chair on the front porch and the smell of fresh cedar is inescapable. When the wood first arrived from Canada, "it literally smelled like a national park," said Mr. Katz, gazing out at the elementary school across the street on a drizzly morning. During the long construction period, Mr. Katz happened upon a cast iron bison at an antique shop in Manhattan. He bought it, named it Monty and it now sits on the porch, too.
'The People Against Modern Farmhouse'
Modern Farmhouse is not without its critics. Among them is Kathryn Grabowski-Khairullah, who, in 2021, bought her first home outside Detroit and was soon bombarded with rustic décor options as she tried to decorate. "At first I fell victim to some of it," she said. "There was a lot of pressure to change everything and conform everything into this style because it was all I was seeing."
It didn't take long for Ms. Grabowski-Khairullah, 34, who works in arts administration, to rebel against what she saw as home décor's answer to fast fashion -- a style that felt cheap, redundant and soulless. "Everything was devoid of color," she said. "Everybody had to have white shaker cabinets, everybody had to have white subway tile and only white subway tile, everybody had to have a giant hood over their stove."
Looking for a place to commiserate, she started a Facebook group, "The People Against Modern Farmhouse," which soon amassed 165,000 members who post memes and photographs ripe for ridicule. "Most of us in the group have been waiting for it to go away," said Ms. Grabowski-Khairullah, who finally landed on her own aesthetic, a sort of "Golden Girls" revivalism. "It's just so kitschy that it's ridiculous," she said of her 1980s furnishings that she plucked mostly from Facebook Marketplace. "Everything is seashells and bows and pink."
But for modern farmhouse devotees, the minimalist palette is the point. "I'm not a huge color person, you're not going to see a lot of color in my house," said Jeniffer Diaz, who has spent three years stripping the oranges, pinks and browns from her ranch-style house in Palmetto Bay, a Miami suburb. "That's my vibe."
The house, from 1977, had vaulted ceilings with wood beams and tan tile floors when she bought it. Ms. Diaz, 31, a stay-at-home mother, and Manny Diaz, 30, who owns a trucking company, spent about $ 200,000 renovating the house they bought in 2020 for $ 560,000. They replaced the tan, green and stone facade with white stucco and concrete board siding and replaced the shingle roof with a metal one.
Inside, they painted the wood-slatted ceiling white and the beams black. They gut renovated the bathrooms, swapping out a pink vanity with scalloped sinks for a white one with brass hardware. The kitchen now has black cabinets, white appliances and open wood shelves. "Pinterest is my best friend," Ms. Diaz said.
The result is a house that may hail from the midcentury, but when you step inside, you'll know immediately that you are in the home of the moment.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY LISA PETROLE/MAGNOLIA NETWORK, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS); Colonial revival has come in and out of fashion since the 1880s. Americans turn to it during periods of heightened nationalism, like in the 1920s when the federal government curtailed immigration. At these moments, the country looks nostalgically at the colonial style of pre-revolutionary America and reimagines it.; Americans embraced modern architecture, building homes with larger rooms and cleaner lines, in postwar America. They were also falling in love with their cars. Cue the split-level ranch, a style that so thoroughly embraces car culture that it manages to bring the beloved automobile into the house.; The McMansion first appeared in American suburbs in the 1980s, filling subdivisions with supersized, poorly constructed, convoluted homes. The style had its heyday in the early 2000s, at a time when banks were doling out subprime mortgages, fueling an overheated housing market that collapsed in 2008.

'24 Hopefuls Join Threads, But 3 Names Are Missing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The bulk of the G.O.P. field is there, with some notable holdouts: Donald J. Trump, the front-runner, and his top rival, Ron DeSantis.
While the front-runners in the 2024 presidential race have yet to show up on Threads, the new Instagram app aimed at rivaling Twitter, many of the long-shot candidates were quick to take advantage of the platform's rapidly growing audience.
"Buckle up and join me on Threads!" Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a caption accompanying a selfie of himself and others in a car that he posted on Thursday -- by that morning, the app had already been downloaded more than 30 million times, putting it on track to be the most rapidly downloaded app ever.
But President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida remain absent from the platform so far.
And that may be just fine with Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, who told The Times's "Hard Fork" podcast on Thursday that he does not expect Threads to become a destination for news or politics, arenas where Twitter has dominated the public discourse.
"I don't want to lean into hard news at all. I don't think there's much that we can or should do to discourage it on Instagram or in Threads, but I don't think we'll do anything to encourage it," Mr. Mosseri said.
The app, released on Wednesday, was presented as an alternative to Twitter, with which many users became disillusioned after it was purchased by Elon Musk in October.
Lawyers for Twitter threatened legal action against Meta, the company that owns Instagram, Facebook and Threads, accusing it of using trade secrets from former Twitter employees to build the new platform. Mr. Musk tweeted on Thursday, "Competition is fine, cheating is not."
Mr. Trump has not been active on Twitter recently either, despite Mr. Musk's lifting the ban that was put on Mr. Trump's account after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The former president has instead kept his focus on Truth Social, the right-wing social network he launched in 2021.
But many of the G.O.P. candidates have begun making their pitches on Threads.
Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and former governor of South Carolina, made a video compilation of her campaign events her first post on the app. "Strong and proud. Not weak and woke," she wrote on Thursday. "That is the America I see."
Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota posted footage of his July 4 campaign appearances in New Hampshire, alongside a message on Wednesday that said he and his wife were "looking forward to continuing our time here."
And Will Hurd, a former Texas congressman, made a fund-raising pitch to viewers on Wednesday.
"Welcome to Threads," he said in a video posted on the app. "I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation here with you on the issues, my candidacy, where I'll be and everything our campaign has going on."
Francis Suarez, the Republican mayor of Miami, and Larry Elder, a conservative talk radio host, also shared their campaign pitches on the platform, as did two candidates running in the Democratic primary: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading vaccine skeptic, and Marianne Williamson, a self-help author. Even Cornel West, a professor and progressive activist running as a third-party candidate, has posted.
Former Vice President Mike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy, a tech entrepreneur, also established accounts -- but have yet to post.
Among the holdouts: Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, both Republicans.
The White House has not said whether Mr. Biden will join Threads. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said on Thursday that the administration would "keep you all posted if we do."

Latest Jobs Data Sends Wall St. in a Spin: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell Thursday after reports suggested the job market remained much more resilient than expected.
The S&P 500 lost 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 0.8 percent.
While a sturdy labor market keeps the economy out of a long-feared recession, it could also push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer in its campaign to defeat high inflation. That in turn could mean more pressure down the line on the economy and financial markets.
A report from ADP Research Institute suggested hiring by private employers was much stronger last month than economists expected, with nearly twice as many jobs created than forecast.
The ADP report can be volatile and "isn't necessarily a good predictor of the monthly jobs report" that is more comprehensive and due from the government on Friday, said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
But it also paired with a separate report showing the number of workers applying for unemployment last week remained low relative to history, even if it was a bit higher than expected.
Other reports on Thursday offered a nuanced picture. One said employers advertised fewer job openings in May than expected. That could mean less upward pressure on inflation. A separate report meanwhile said growth in U.S. services industries remained hot and accelerated in June.
If the Friday jobs report is strong like the ADP report, it could mean counterintuitive pain for stocks because it would push the Fed to keep the brakes on the economy in hopes of getting inflation under wraps.
"Whether it's that big of a number" as what the ADP report suggested "or even half of that, it would still be showing that the labor market is very strong and the Fed has not done enough to get inflation down," said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
"Even with some of this nuanced economic data, the bottom line is the labor market is always a lagging indicator" and later to crack under the weight of higher interest rates than other parts of the economy, she said. "We still expect the labor market to get weaker."
She expects a recession to hit within the next 12 months.
Yields jumped in the bond market as traders ramped up bets for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer than previously expected. Hopes for a potential cut to interest rates by early next year diminished.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.04 percent from 3.94 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, climbed to 4.99 percent from 4.95 percent, back to where it was in early March, before the failures of several banks rattled confidence across financial markets.
On Wall Street, Exxon Mobil was one of the heaviest weights on the market after it tumbled 3.7 percent. It warned of a hit to its profit during the spring because of changes in gas prices and industry margins, among other items.
JetBlue Airways sank 7.2 percent after it said it will end a partnership with American Airlines in the northeastern United States after losing a court fight over the deal. JetBlue will focus instead on salvaging its proposed purchase of Spirit Airlines. American Airlines fell 2.4 percent.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, wavered between small gains and losses after unveiling its new app Threads, a rival to Twitter, which has had a bumpy ride under new owner Elon Musk. Meta ended the day down 0.8 percent.

Instagram Unveils Rival To Twitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Here's what to know about Instagram's new app for public conversations and how it differs from Twitter.
After months of speculation and secrecy, Mark Zuckerberg's long-rumored competitor app to Twitter is here.
The new app, Threads, was unveiled on Wednesday as a companion to Instagram, the popular photo-sharing network that Mr. Zuckerberg's company, Meta, bought more than a decade ago. If Instagram executives get their way, Threads will also replace rival Twitter, with some techies referring to it as a "Twitter killer."
The rollout of Threads ramps up the rivalry between Mr. Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, who bought Twitter last year. Mr. Musk has changed the experience of Twitter by tinkering with its algorithm and other features, and most recently imposed temporary limits on how many tweets people could read when using the app, inciting outrage.
Many tech companies have tried capitalizing on Twitter's turmoil in recent months. But Threads has a leg up, backed by Meta's deep pockets and Instagram's enormous user base of more than two billion monthly active users around the world.
In a post to his Threads account on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said: "I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it. Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn't nailed it. Hopefully we will." He said that Threads achieved 5 million sign-ups within four hours of its launch.
Mr. Musk weighed in, saying he was not impressed by Threads and claiming he had canceled his Instagram account. "It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram," he wrote on Twitter.
Here's what to know about Threads.
What is Threads and how does it work?
Built by Instagram, Threads is positioned as an app where people can have real-time, public conversations with one another. Threads also helps boost Instagram, which is a marquee app in Meta's family of products.
"The idea is to hopefully build an open, friendly space for communities," Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said in an interview.
Instagram has tied Threads closely to itself. Those interested in signing up for the new app are required to have an Instagram account for now. A user's Instagram handle must also be their Threads user name.
And people will be able to directly import the list of those they follow on Instagram to Threads if they wish. Instagram's verified users will also be verified on the new app. Users can set their Threads account to be private or public.
How is Threads similar to or different from Twitter?
Threads looks nearly identical to Twitter in many ways. Users can post mostly text-based messages to a scrolling feed, where people who follow them and whom they follow can reply. People can also post photos or video to the app.
But Threads is also different from Twitter. It does not currently support direct messaging, a feature that Twitter offers. Instagram said it may add features to Threads if new users ask for them.
How did Instagram come up with Threads?
Instagram has made a concerted effort to simplify its app over the past few years, Mr. Mosseri said. As part of that effort, he said, Threads was spun out into a separate app. That way, Instagram would not be too cluttered by trying to make public conversations work inside its existing app.
The choice to create a new app was also hard to resist, Mr. Mosseri added, especially at a tumultuous moment in the social media landscape.
"There was an opportunity or demand for more people to play in the public space," he said, referring to the changes around Twitter under Mr. Musk. Mr. Mosseri added that the chance to challenge Twitter came about "not just because of the ownership, but because of product changes and decisions" that Mr. Musk and others made to how the social platform works.
Instagram began its effort to take on Twitter late last year, with dozens of engineers, product managers and designers pitching ideas on what a rival app could look like. Among the notions Meta's workers talked over at the time was a more extensive rollout of a feature called Instagram Notes, where people can share short messages on the site, and a text-focused app using Instagram's technology.
Ultimately, Mr. Mosseri said, he and other managers decided they should "make a bet" on a messaging app and leaned into building what became Threads.
How will Threads work with other apps?
Instagram's goal is to ultimately have Threads work across multiple apps in what it calls the Fediverse, which is shorthand for a federated universe of services that share communication protocols. Other apps like Mastodon, another social network, also function in this way.
This might sound like a lot of tech speak. What it means, essentially, is that Instagram wants to make it easier for Threads to operate seamlessly with other platforms, which could appeal to creators and influencers so they do not have to start from scratch on each app.
If a creator builds up a sizable number of followers on Threads, for instance, they could ostensibly take those followers with them to other platforms that are built on the same technology. That would make it less risky for creators and could free them from feeling like they are "stuck" on one platform, Mr. Mosseri said.
Has Instagram cloned other apps?
Mr. Zuckerberg's Meta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, has an extensive history of trying to stamp out social media rivals, partly by copying their features. Mr. Zuckerberg is fiercely competitive and has long wanted to own a product that accomplishes what Twitter does.
That strategy does not always guarantee success. Facebook's early attempts to clone the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat, for example, did not initially gain much traction.
Even so, Meta has continued to imitate rivals. In 2020, Meta released a TikTok copycat called Reels, which focuses on short videos and has since become widely used.
Where will Threads be available?
Threads is available for download for free from Apple's App Store and the Google Play store in the United States and roughly 100 other countries beginning on Wednesday. It has plans to expand further.
But Meta said Threads will not initially be available in the European Union, one of the company's largest markets. A new E.U. law called the Digital Markets Act is taking effect in the coming months and limits how the largest tech companies share data across services. Meta said it was waiting to get more specifics about the law's implementation before introducing Threads across the 27-nation bloc.

Disinformation Researchers Fret About Fallout From Judge's Order: [National Desk]

Full text: They said a restriction on government interaction with social media companies could impede efforts to curb false claims about vaccines and voter fraud.
A federal judge's decision this week to restrict the government's communication with social media platforms could have broad side effects, according to researchers and groups that combat hate speech, online abuse and disinformation: It could further hamper efforts to curb harmful content.
Alice E. Marwick, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was one of several disinformation experts who said on Wednesday that the ruling could impede work meant to keep false claims about vaccines and voter fraud from spreading.
The order, she said, followed other efforts, largely from Republicans, that are "part of an organized campaign pushing back on the idea of disinformation as a whole."
Judge Terry A. Doughty granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday, saying the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with other parts of the government, must stop corresponding with social media companies for "the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free speech."
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri, who accused Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites of censoring right-leaning content, sometimes in league with the government. They and other Republicans cheered the judge's move, in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, as a win for the First Amendment.
Several researchers, however, said the government's work with social media companies was not an issue as long as it didn't coerce them to remove content. Instead, they said, the government has historically notified companies about potentially dangerous messages, like lies about election fraud or misleading information about Covid-19. Most misinformation or disinformation that violates social platforms' policies is flagged by researchers, nonprofits, or people and software at the platforms themselves.
"That's the really important distinction here: The government should be able to inform social media companies about things that they feel are harmful to the public," said Miriam Metzger, a communication professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an affiliate of its Center for Information Technology and Society.
A larger concern, researchers said, is a potential chilling effect. The judge's decision blocked certain government agencies from communicating with some research organizations, such as the Stanford Internet Observatory and the Election Integrity Partnership, about removing social media content. Some of those groups have already been targeted in a Republican-led legal campaign against universities and think tanks.
Their peers said such stipulations could dissuade younger scholars from pursuing disinformation research and intimidate donors who fund crucial grants.
Bond Benton, an associate communication professor at Montclair State University who studies disinformation, described the ruling as "a bit of a potential Trojan horse." It is limited on paper to the government's relationship with social media platforms, he said, but carried a message that misinformation qualifies as speech and its removal as the suppression of speech.
"Previously, platforms could simply say we don't want to host it: 'No shirt, no shoes, no service,"' Dr. Benton said. "This ruling will now probably make platforms a little bit more cautious about that."
In recent years, platforms have relied more heavily on automated tools and algorithms to spot harmful content, limiting the effectiveness of complaints from people outside the companies. Academics and anti-disinformation organizations often complained that platforms were unresponsive to their concerns, said Viktorya Vilk, the director for digital safety and free expression at PEN America, a nonprofit that supports free expression.
"Platforms are very good at ignoring civil society organizations and our requests for help or requests for information or escalation of individual cases," she said. "They are less comfortable ignoring the government."
Several disinformation researchers worried that the ruling could give cover for social media platforms, some of which have already scaled back their efforts to curb misinformation, to be even less vigilant before the 2024 election. They said it was unclear how relatively new government initiatives that had fielded researchers' concerns and suggestions, such as the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, would fare.
For Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, the decision on Tuesday underscored other issues: the United States' "particularly fangless" approach to dangerous content compared with places like Australia and the European Union, and the need to update rules governing social media platforms' liability. The ruling on Tuesday cited the center as having delivered a presentation to the surgeon general's office about its 2021 report on online anti-vaccine activists, "The Disinformation Dozen."
"It's bananas that you can't show a nipple on the Super Bowl but Facebook can still broadcast Nazi propaganda, empower stalkers and harassers, undermine public health and facilitate extremism in the United States," Mr. Ahmed said. "This court decision further exacerbates that feeling of impunity social media companies operate under, despite the fact that they are the primary vector for hate and disinformation in society."

Suspect Charged With Killing 5 In Philadelphia Mass Shooting: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People who lived with the suspect told investigators that he was wearing a bulletproof vest around the house in the days before five people were gunned down.
As the streets outside his home echoed with pops, Darryl Steplight thought it was fireworks on the eve of the Fourth of July. He quickly learned otherwise. A man in body armor, and carrying an AR-15-style rifle, had opened fire at random in the neighborhood, killing five and wounding two, including a 2-year-old.
The man who was arrested and charged with carrying out the rampage was Kimbrady Carriker, whom Mr. Steplight had met just last week.
The encounter was unremarkable, Mr. Steplight said, except for one curious detail: Mr. Carriker, who was wearing a green military-style vest, had introduced himself as a "town watchman."
On Wednesday, two days after the mass shooting in southwest Philadelphia, the city was trying to understand what had touched off such an inexplicable outburst of violence. In the morning, Mr. Carriker, 40, was arraigned, appearing by video in a white jumpsuit and offering terse responses as a magistrate read out the charges, including murder, attempted murder and reckless endangerment. He was ordered held without bond.
At a news conference in the afternoon, prosecutors said that people who lived with Mr. Carriker had told investigators that he had been "exhibiting abnormal behavior" and "getting more and more agitated" in recent days, even wearing his bulletproof vest around the house. A search of his home, said Robert Wainwright, an assistant district attorney, turned up a will that Mr. Carriker had written, dated June 23. Mr. Wainwright did not say what was in the will.
The authorities said that when Mr. Carriker was arrested he had an AR-15-style rifle and a so-called ghost gun, made from untraceable parts, though investigators had yet to determine how he obtained the firearms.
Prosecutors said the ghost gun was not fired during the shooting, and that a handgun and ammunition were found during the search of Mr. Carriker's home. Mr. Carriker did not have a license to possess guns, prosecutors said.
Mr. Wainwright said at least one of the seven people who shared a house with Mr. Carriker had recognized that he was becoming more disturbed. But another prosecutor, Joanne Pescatore, said "their way of dealing with it was just to avoid it and not interfere with him."
Pennsylvania does not have a "red flag" law, which allows families or law enforcement to seek a court order temporarily seizing guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. But officials encouraged people to report troubling behavior anyway, suggesting that Mr. Carriker might have gotten help had the authorities known of his behavior. After a 2004 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a gun without a license, Mr. Carriker had apparently spent his life largely off the radar of local law enforcement.
He was, however, a familiar figure to his neighbors on the block of two-story rowhouses where he had been living. They remembered him as friendly and at times helpful. "He never gave us a problem, he was always a nice guy," said Bernard Mason, 53, who lives across the street. "We saw him a couple of times in full heels and a dress and didn't think nothing of it, that's his thing."
Mr. Carriker appeared in women's clothing in some photos on his Facebook page, possibly contributing to confusion over his gender identity in the initial hours after his arrest. The district attorney's office said on Wednesday that they had seen no information to suggest that he considers himself anything but male.
It was on social media that Mr. Carriker's state of mind may have been most visible to people outside his home. His Facebook page suggests a libertarian-shaded politics, with memes disparaging President Biden alongside posts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and through it all support for unrestricted gun rights.
In the days leading up to the mass shooting, his Facebook activity -- posts about being followed by evil spirits, alongside articles about efforts to address gun violence in Philadelphia -- may have reflected the agitation that the prosecutors described.
"But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat," read a post from last Saturday, two days before the shooting. It was followed by an excerpt from the book of Isaiah: "To save you, I will send an army against Babylon," read one verse. "I will break down the city gates; and the shouts of her people will turn into crying."

Disinformation Vs. Free Speech: A New Frontier: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The case, which could alter how the government battles disinformation, is a flashpoint in a broader effort by conservatives to document what they contend is a liberal conspiracy to silence their views.
Two months after President Biden took office, his top digital adviser emailed officials at Facebook urging them to do more to limit the spread of "vaccine hesitancy" on the social media platform.
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, officials held "weekly sync" meetings with Facebook, once emailing the company 16 "misinformation" posts. And in the summer of 2021, the surgeon general's top aide repeatedly urged Google, Facebook and Twitter to do more to combat disinformation.
The examples are among dozens of interactions described in a 155-page ruling by a federal judge in Louisiana, who on Tuesday imposed temporary but far-reaching limits on how members of Mr. Biden's administration can engage with social media companies. The government appealed the ruling on Wednesday.
The case is a flashpoint in the broader effort by conservatives to document what they contend is a liberal conspiracy by Democrats and tech company executives to silence their views. It taps into fury on the right about how social media companies have treated stories about the origins of Covid, the 2020 election and Hunter Biden, the president's son.
The final outcome could shape the future of First Amendment law in a rapidly changing media environment and alter how far the government can go in trying to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous information, particularly in an election or during emergencies like a pandemic.
The government's actions at the heart of the case were intended largely as public health measures. But Tuesday's order instead viewed the issue through the filter of partisan culture wars -- asking whether the government violated the First Amendment by unlawfully threatening the social media companies to censor speech that Mr. Biden's administration found distasteful and potentially harmful to the public.
The case was brought by two Republican attorneys general and five individuals who campaigned against masks, argued that vaccines did not work, opposed lockdowns and pushed drugs that medical experts denounced as ineffective, like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
And it is being overseen by Judge Terry A. Doughty, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump and has previously expressed little skepticism about debunked claims from vaccine skeptics. In one previous case, Judge Doughty accepted as fact the claim that "Covid-19 vaccines do not prevent transmission of the disease."
Judge Doughty was confirmed by the Senate in 2018, by a vote of 98 to 0, to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, which has been seen in recent years as favorable to right-wing lawsuits. He ruled against the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for Head Start preschool programs last year, saying that the "liberty interests of individuals mandated to take the Covid-19 vaccine outweigh any interest generated by the mandatory administration of vaccines."
The judge's preliminary injunction is already having an impact. A previously scheduled meeting on threat identification on Thursday between State Department officials and social media executives was abruptly canceled by officials, according to two people familiar with the decision, which was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
Administration officials said the Justice Department was examining the judge's lengthy order to determine what activities must be halted when it comes to communicating their concerns about the spread of information.
"The court's order, which prevents the government from even speaking with tech companies about their content moderation policies, deals a huge blow to vital government efforts to harden U.S. democracy against threats of misinformation," Leah Litman and Laurence H. Tribe wrote in the Just Security blog on Wednesday.
"Each step in the reasoning of the decision manages to be more outlandish than the last," the pair wrote.
White House officials pledged to abide by the judge's injunction, which will remain in place while the case moves forward unless a higher court reverses the order.
"But we're not going to apologize for promoting responsible actions to protect public health, safety and security when confronted by challenges like a deadly pandemic or foreign attacks on our elections," said Sharon Yang, a White House spokeswoman. "We're also not going to apologize for believing that social media platforms have a responsibility -- a critical responsibility -- to take account of the effects their platforms have on the American people."
The vast reach of the ruling could make it difficult for the administration to comply, several legal experts said.
It allows the government to continue to notify the platforms about certain content, including posts concerning criminal activity, threats to national security and foreign election interference. But a subset of that content may also be protected by the First Amendment, the type of speech the judge's order says the administration cannot discuss with the companies.
And the line between the two could be blurry, said Genevieve Lakier, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, who called the judge's rulings "pretty significant departures from precedent."
"The result is this incredibly broad injunction that seems to prevent huge swaths of the executive branch from communicating with the platforms about speech," she said.
"Are government officials supposed to figure out for themselves what's the serious enough threat that they can communicate about it to the platforms, or not serious and then they cannot?" she said. "How are they going to draw this line?"
In his order, Judge Doughty described what he called a campaign by officials in the White House and at government agencies to pressure social media companies.
In one instance, the judge wrote that aides to Jill Biden, the first lady, repeatedly cajoled Twitter executives to remove a video that was edited to make her seem profane toward a group of children. Twitter took the video down.
In another case, Judge Doughty wrote that a top Biden official requested that Twitter remove a parody account linked to Finnegan Biden, Hunter Biden's daughter and President Biden's granddaughter. He wrote that 45 minutes after the request, Twitter suspended the account.
After Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, urged social media companies to "take action against misinformation superspreaders" in July 2021, the companies took down information posted by 17 accounts linked to the "Disinformation Dozen," a group of people who frequently distributed false anti-vaccination claims.
Judge Doughty said the decision by the social media companies came after multiple emails, calls and meetings over weeks between Mr. Murthy's top aides and senior executives at several of the social media companies.
"The public and private pressure from the White House apparently had its intended effect," the judge wrote. "All 12 members of the 'Disinformation Dozen' were censored, and pages, groups and accounts linked to the Disinformation Dozen were removed."
He also described regular meetings between the companies and the F.B.I.'s San Francisco field office, where he wrote that as many as eight agents were responsible for forwarding concerns about social media posts to seven tech companies several times a month.
For several pages, Judge Doughty refers to the F.B.I.'s investigation into Hunter Biden's laptop, suggesting a link between the government's contacts with social media companies and the decision by some of the platforms to remove information about the story.
"The F.B.I. additionally likely misled social media companies into believing the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, which resulted in suppression of the story a few weeks prior to the 2020 presidential election," the judge wrote in his order.
Conservatives have already begun to seize on that kind of language to fuel their broader political allegations against Mr. Biden and Democrats. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted: "Big loss for the censorship industrial complex."
But they are charges that the president and his aides reject as wrong and misleading.
Administration officials argued in the case that they did not unlawfully pressure the social media companies. Instead, they said the government had a responsibility to combat the spread of incorrect information through discussions with the companies.
And they say -- backed up by evidence from several of the social media companies -- that the platforms have made independent decisions about what information to promote or delete, without any government control.
Internal files released by Twitter last year document instances when the company rejected requests from the government.
But in Tuesday's ruling, Judge Doughty found that efforts by the administration amounted to coercion of the platforms that violated the First Amendment by essentially deputizing private companies on behalf of the government.
The judge said that pressure went beyond aggressively encouraging the platforms to take down posts -- which, he said, would itself violate the First Amendment -- and amounted to coercion of some of the biggest companies in America by the "most powerful office in the world."
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor of cybersecurity law at the United States Naval Academy, said the government would have to figure out how widely Judge Doughty's prohibitions should be applied.
"The bigger issue for clarity is who does this actually apply to -- and does it apply to them in their personal capacity, their official capacity or both," he said. "Does he want an office assistant at the C.D.C. to not be able to voice his views on his own time?"

Here to Help; How to Help Teens Cut Back on Social Media: [Personal Tech]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Public health experts have sounded alarms over the potential risks. But if you've already given your child full access, here's how to cut back.
Jason Mahr's eldest son was 13 years old when Mr. Mahr and his wife gave him access to social media, a decision the 44-year-old father of five regretted immediately.
It became "like an addiction," said Mr. Mahr, a student coach and former youth pastor who lives in Woodstock, Ga. His son was quickly swept up in seeking the approval of others online, Mr. Mahr said. He has since been more deliberate about how and when he lets his younger children start using social media, but backpedaling with his eldest has been difficult.
Recently, the warnings around teens' social media use have grown particularly loud, as both the U.S. surgeon general and the American Psychological Association have issued reports about the risk of harm to adolescents' mental health. Yet for many families, that ship has sailed. Survey results from Pew Research found that 95 percent of teens said they had access to a smartphone, while 35 percent said they were using at least one of the top five social media platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook) "almost constantly."
Jean Twenge, a psychologist who has spent years warning about the effects of social media on teenagers' mental health -- and a mother of teens herself -- said parents should "be confident in setting some reasonable limits," but empathized with how challenging that can feel, in the absence of better regulations for children on social media sites. "This is what so many parents are struggling with, and it's too bad we have to."
For those looking to walk back their teens' social media use, these three strategies can help.
1. Come up with boundaries together.
The American Academy of Pediatrics offers a free tool that can help you devise a family media plan, even if that is not something you've had as a family before.
"The problem is slightly different for each kid, so the solution will also look a little different," said Dr. Nina Vasan, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine and the founder and executive director of Brainstorm, Stanford's lab for mental health innovation. She has collaborated on a social media safety plan with her colleagues at Stanford that is under review for publication in an academic journal. The plan emphasizes the importance of making such decisions collaboratively.
Ask your child about what kinds of changes feel doable. For example, maybe your teen feels OK with paring down the number of platforms he or she uses. Or perhaps your children are more open to the idea of establishing a maximum amount of time they're allowed to spend every day on social media platforms, or on screens altogether.
Installing apps that allow parents to block certain websites and set time limits on devices can help you enforce these boundaries, according to the Stanford social media safety plan.
2. Propose a social media vacation.
Experts stress that social media is not inherently bad, and that it can help young people connect with others and express themselves. But it's also a good idea to talk to kids about the potentially harmful effects of too much social media, said Lisa Damour, a psychologist and frequent contributor to The New York Times.
If your child is showing signs of problematic social media use, you may consider instituting a complete break to recalibrate your child's behavior. For some teens, that recalibration might take a few weeks; for others, it might take a few months, Dr. Vasan said.
If that does not feel doable or necessary, you could have your teen abstain from social media use one day a week, and see how that goes. Parents can take a break, too, and talk to their teens about how they are coping, Dr. Vasan said. It may also help to get another family onboard: "For example, talk to the parents of your kids' closest friends and come to a collective agreement to help the kids simultaneously decrease their social media use," she said.
Expect pushback, added Dr. Vasan, who reiterated the importance of giving teens a sense of agency: "Tell them they need to cut down, but they can choose how they will cut down."
3. Hold firm around protecting sleep and other healthy habits.
Research has shown that teens who use smartphones around bedtime -- or who have a device in the bedroom overnight, but do not use it -- get less sleep and have poorer quality sleep than children with no access. Parents should explain to their children why smartphones cannot be in the bedroom, Dr. Twenge said.
Dr. Twenge recommends sticking with a consistent strategy, like having a charging station where all family members -- adults included -- keep their phone overnight. Parental controls that let parents simply turn their children's phones off overnight may not be appropriate for older teens who drive or frequently have sleepovers, she said, but they can be a good option for younger adolescents.
In general, parents should maintain firm boundaries around sleep, opportunities for physical activity and in-person socialization, Dr. Damour said, adding, "I think parents can say to teenagers: I'm not necessarily against technology. I am for the activities that we know are essential for healthy development."
As for Mr. Mahr, he and his wife apologized to their eldest son, telling him they made a mistake by giving him access to platforms he wasn't developmentally ready for. Now 21, their son has come to appreciate his parents' perspective, telling them he wishes he wasn't given access in the first place.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to drift lower from its highest level since April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.2 percent.
Other markets around the world fell more sharply after the latest discouraging signal from China's economy. Growth in China's services industry slowed by more than economists expected last month. It's the latest evidence that the world's second-largest economy is stumbling in its recovery following the removal of anti-Covid restrictions.
The U.S. economy has remained stronger than many investors feared, defying predictions for a recession because of a job market that has remained remarkably solid despite much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation.
A report on Wednesday showed growth for U.S. factory orders held steady in May, although economists had expected to see an acceleration.
Hope is rising that inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to soon stop its interest rate increases, which undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy. At its last meeting, the Fed decided to hold rates steady, the first time in more than a year that it refrained from hiking rates.
Some Fed officials wanted to raise rates at that last meeting, according to minutes from the June meeting released Wednesday. The vote was unanimous, though, to hold the federal funds rate steady within a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, up from virtually zero early last year.
Much of Wall Street expects the Fed to raise rates later this month. Less certain is whether a second hike will hit by the end of the year, as the Fed has been hinting. In the end, that may not matter much, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
"The move from zero to 5 percent is all that matters," he said. "The Fed has either gone too far and damaged the economy, and we just haven't seen it yet, or they haven't.
"We'll see that in due time," he added, saying that one or two more increases of a quarter of a percentage point won't have that much of an impact by themselves.
That could leave the U.S. stock market stuck in a holding pattern as everyone waits to see if the long-predicted recession happens. The upcoming earnings reporting season could offer some clues, with companies telling investors how much profit they earned during the spring.
Mr. Mayfield said he is particularly interested to hear from companies that sell directly to consumers to see whether the main pillar holding up the U.S. economy is weakening at all.
Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.94 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, held steady at 4.94 percent.
On Wall Street, shares of UPS fell 2.1 percent as the company tried to reach a deal with the Teamsters union representing about 340,000 of its workers. Their current contract expires at the end of the month, and Teamsters members last month voted in favor of a strike authorization.
Companies that do a lot of business in the China region were also weak. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which get significant chunks of revenue from Macau, both fell at least 4.6 percent.
On the winning side was Meta Platforms. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is poised to unveil a new app that appears to mimic Twitter. It rose 1.9 percent, adding to a stellar year where it has already soared 144.6 percent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped 1.6 percent in Hong Kong and 0.7 percent in Shanghai after discouraging economic data from China.

Ruling Puts Social Media at Crossroads of Disinformation and Free Speech

WASHINGTON — Two months after President Joe Biden took office, his top digital adviser emailed officials at Facebook urging them to do more to limit the spread of “vaccine hesitancy” on the social media platform.
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, officials held “weekly sync” meetings with Facebook, once emailing the company 16 “misinformation” posts. And in the summer of 2021, the surgeon general’s top aide repeatedly urged Google, Facebook and Twitter to do more to combat disinformation.
The examples are among dozens of interactions described in a 155-page ruling by a federal judge in Louisiana, who on Tuesday imposed temporary but far-reaching limits on how members of Biden’s administration can engage with social media companies. The government appealed the ruling Wednesday.
The case is a flashpoint in the broader effort by conservatives to document what they contend is a liberal conspiracy by Democrats and tech company executives to silence their views. It taps into fury on the right about how social media companies have treated stories about the origins of COVID, the 2020 election and Hunter Biden, the president’s son.
The final outcome could shape the future of First Amendment law in a rapidly changing media environment and alter how far the government can go in trying to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous information, particularly in an election or during emergencies like a pandemic.
The government’s actions at the heart of the case were intended largely as public health measures. But Tuesday’s order instead viewed the issue through the filter of partisan culture wars — asking whether the government violated the First Amendment by unlawfully threatening the social media companies to censor speech that Biden’s administration found distasteful and potentially harmful to the public.
The case was brought by two Republican attorneys general and five individuals who campaigned against masks, argued that vaccines did not work, opposed lockdowns and pushed drugs that medical experts denounced as ineffective, like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
And it is being overseen by Judge Terry A. Doughty, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and has previously expressed little skepticism about debunked claims from vaccine skeptics. In one previous case, Doughty accepted as fact the claim that “COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent transmission of the disease.”
Doughty was confirmed by the Senate in 2018, by a vote of 98-0, to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, which has been seen in recent years as favorable to right-wing lawsuits. He ruled against the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for Head Start preschool programs last year, saying that the “liberty interests of individuals mandated to take the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any interest generated by the mandatory administration of vaccines.”
The judge’s preliminary injunction is already having an impact. A previously scheduled meeting on threat identification on Thursday between State Department officials and social media executives was abruptly canceled by officials, according to two people familiar with the decision, which was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
Administration officials said the Justice Department was examining the judge’s lengthy order to determine what activities must be halted when it comes to communicating their concerns about the spread of information.
“The court’s order, which prevents the government from even speaking with tech companies about their content moderation policies, deals a huge blow to vital government efforts to harden U.S. democracy against threats of misinformation,” Leah Litman and Laurence H. Tribe wrote in the Just Security blog on Wednesday.
“Each step in the reasoning of the decision manages to be more outlandish than the last,” the pair wrote.
White House officials pledged to abide by the judge’s injunction, which will remain in place while the case moves forward unless a higher court reverses the order.
“But we’re not going to apologize for promoting responsible actions to protect public health, safety and security when confronted by challenges like a deadly pandemic or foreign attacks on our elections,” said Sharon Yang, a White House spokeswoman. “We’re also not going to apologize for believing that social media platforms have a responsibility — a critical responsibility — to take account of the effects their platforms have on the American people.”
The vast reach of the ruling could make it difficult for the administration to comply, several legal experts said.
It allows the government to continue to notify the platforms about certain content, including posts concerning criminal activity, threats to national security and foreign election interference. But a subset of that content may also be protected by the First Amendment, the type of speech the judge’s order says the administration cannot discuss with the companies.
And the line between the two could be blurry, said Genevieve Lakier, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, who called the judge’s ruling “pretty significant departures from precedent.”
“The result is this incredibly broad injunction that seems to prevent huge swaths of the executive branch from communicating with the platforms about speech,” she said.
“Are government officials supposed to figure out for themselves what’s the serious enough threat that they can communicate about it to the platforms, or not serious and then they cannot?” she said. “How are they going to draw this line?”
In his order, Doughty described what he called a campaign by officials in the White House and at government agencies to pressure social media companies.
In one instance, the judge wrote that aides to first lady Jill Biden repeatedly cajoled Twitter executives to remove a video that was edited to make her seem profane toward a group of children. Twitter took the video down.
In another case, Doughty wrote that a top Biden official requested that Twitter remove a parody account linked to Finnegan Biden, Hunter Biden’s daughter and the president’s granddaughter. He wrote that 45 minutes after the request, Twitter suspended the account.
After Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, urged social media companies to “take action against misinformation superspreaders” in July 2021, the companies took down information posted by 17 accounts linked to the “Disinformation Dozen,” a group of people who frequently distributed false anti-vaccination claims.
Doughty said the decision by the social media companies came after multiple emails, calls and meetings over weeks between Murthy’s top aides and senior executives at several of the social media companies.
“The public and private pressure from the White House apparently had its intended effect,” the judge wrote. “All 12 members of the ‘Disinformation Dozen’ were censored, and pages, groups and accounts linked to the Disinformation Dozen were removed.”
Doughty also described regular meetings between the companies and the FBI’s San Francisco field office, where he wrote that as many as eight agents were responsible for forwarding concerns about social media posts to seven tech companies several times a month.
For several pages, Doughty refers to the FBI’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s laptop, suggesting a link between the government’s contacts with social media companies and the decision by some of the platforms to remove information about the story.
“The FBI additionally likely misled social media companies into believing the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, which resulted in suppression of the story a few weeks prior to the 2020 presidential election,” the judge wrote in his order.
Conservatives have already begun to seize on that kind of language to fuel their broader political allegations against Biden and Democrats. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted: “Big loss for the censorship industrial complex.”
But they are charges that the president and his aides reject as wrong and misleading.
Administration officials argued in the case that they did not unlawfully pressure the social media companies. Instead, they said the government had a responsibility to combat the spread of incorrect information through discussions with the companies.
And they say — backed up by evidence from several of the social media companies — that the platforms have made independent decisions about what information to promote or delete, without any government control.
Internal files released by Twitter last year document instances when the company rejected requests from the government.
But in Tuesday’s ruling, Doughty found that efforts by the administration amounted to coercion of the platforms that violated the First Amendment by essentially deputizing private companies on behalf of the government.
The judge said that pressure went beyond aggressively encouraging the platforms to take down posts — which, he said, would itself violate the First Amendment — and amounted to coercion of some of the biggest companies in America by the “most powerful office in the world.”
Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor of cybersecurity law at the U.S. Naval Academy, said the government would have to figure out how widely Doughty’s prohibitions should be applied.
“The bigger issue for clarity is who does this actually apply to — and does it apply to them in their personal capacity, their official capacity or both,” he said. “Does he want an office assistant at the CDC to not be able to voice his views on his own time?”

Judge Restricts U.S. Pressuring Of Social Sites: [National Desk]

Full text: The order came in a lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, who claim the administration is trying to silence its critics.
A federal judge in Louisiana on Tuesday restricted the Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms about broad swaths of content online, a ruling that could curtail efforts to combat false and misleading narratives about the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.
The order, which could have significant First Amendment implications, is a major development in a fierce legal fight over the boundaries and limits of speech online.
It was a victory for Republicans who have often accused social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube of disproportionately taking down right-leaning content, sometimes in collaboration with government. Democrats say the platforms have failed to adequately police misinformation and hateful speech, leading to dangerous outcomes, including violence.
In the ruling, Judge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana said that parts of the government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could not talk to social media companies for "the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech."
In granting a preliminary injunction, Judge Doughty said that the agencies could not flag specific posts to the social media platforms or request reports about their efforts to take down content. The ruling said that the government could still notify the platforms about posts detailing crimes, national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections.
"If the allegations made by plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States' history," the judge said. "The plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the government has used its power to silence the opposition."
Courts are increasingly being forced to weigh in on such issues -- with the potential to upend decades of legal norms that have governed speech online.
The Republican attorneys general of Texas and Florida are defending first-of-their-kind state laws that bar internet platforms from taking down certain political content, and legal experts believe those cases may eventually reach the Supreme Court. The high court this year declined to limit a law that allows the platforms to escape legal liability for content that users post to the sites.
The ruling on Tuesday, in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri, is likely to be appealed by the Biden administration, but its impact could force government officials, including law enforcement agencies, to refrain from notifying the platforms of troublesome content.
Government officials have argued they do not have the authority to order posts or entire accounts removed, but federal agencies and the tech giants have long worked together to take action against illegal or harmful material, especially in cases involving child sexual abuse, human trafficking and other criminal activity. That has also included regular meetings to share information on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
The White House said the Justice Department was reviewing the ruling and evaluating its next steps.
"Our consistent view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take account of the effects their platforms are having on the American people, but make independent choices about the information they present," the White House said in a statement.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Twitter did not have a comment, and Google did not respond to a request for comment.
Jeff Landry, the Louisiana attorney general, said in a statement that the judge's order was "historic." Missouri's attorney general, Andrew Bailey, hailed the ruling as a "huge win in the fight to defend our most fundamental freedoms." Both officials are Republican.
"What a way to celebrate Independence Day," Mr. Bailey said on Twitter.
The issue of the government's influence over social media has become increasingly partisan.
The Republican majority in the House has taken up the cause, smothering universities and think tanks that have studied the issue with onerous requests for information and subpoenas.
The judge's order bars government agencies from communicating with some of those outside groups, including the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project and the Stanford Internet Observatory, in order to induce the removal of protected speech online. Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which was involved in leading the two other projects, declined to comment.
Since acquiring Twitter last year, Elon Musk has echoed Republican arguments, releasing internal company documents to chosen journalists suggesting what they claimed was collusion between company and government officials. Though that remains far from proven, some of the documents Mr. Musk disclosed ended up in the lawsuit's arguments.
The defendants, the social media companies and experts who study disinformation have argued that there is no evidence of a systematic effort by the government to censor individuals in violation of the First Amendment. David Rand, an expert on misinformation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his understanding was that the government had at most a limited impact on how social media platforms engaged with misinformation.
At the same time, emails and text messages made public in the case that Judge Doughty ruled on have shown instances where officials complained to social media executives when influential users spread disinformation, especially involving the coronavirus pandemic.
The states said in their lawsuit that they had a "sovereign and proprietary interest in receiving free flow of information in public discourse on social-media platforms."
In addition to the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, the case was brought by four other plaintiffs: Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, epidemiologists who questioned the government's handling of the pandemic; Aaron Kheriaty, a professor dismissed by the University of California, Irvine, for refusing to have a coronavirus vaccination; Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation; and Jim Hoft, founder of Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. The four additional plaintiffs said social media sites removed some of their posts.
Although the lawsuit named as defendants President Biden and dozens of officials in 11 government agencies, some of the instances cited took place during the Trump administration.
Judge Doughty, who was appointed to the federal court by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, has been sympathetic to conservative cases, having previously blocked the Biden administration's national vaccination mandate for health care workers and overturned its ban on new federal leases for oil and gas drilling.
He allowed the plaintiffs extensive discovery and depositions from prominent officials like Anthony S. Fauci, then the nation's top infectious disease expert, who told the plaintiffs' lawyers that he was not involved in any discussions to censor content online.
Some experts in First Amendment law and misinformation criticized the Tuesday ruling.
"It can't be that the government violates the First Amendment simply by engaging with the platforms about their content-moderation decisions and policies," said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "If that's what the court is saying here, it's a pretty radical proposition that isn't supported by the case law."
Mr. Jaffer added that the government has to balance between calling out false speech without stepping into informal coercion that veers toward censorship. "Unfortunately Judge Doughty's order doesn't reflect a serious effort to reconcile the competing principles," he said.
Judge Doughty's ruling said the injunction would remain in place while proceedings in the lawsuit continued unless he or a higher court ruled differently.

E.U. Court Rejects Meta's Appeal on How It Harvests Users' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Meta's ability to harvest data about users in order to sell personalized ads was thrown into question on Tuesday after the European Union's highest court upheld a decision by German antitrust regulators that the company had abused its dominance in social media.
The ruling in the closely watched case by the European Court of Justice cleared the way for Germany's top antitrust enforcer, the Bundeskartellamt, to block Meta from combining data collected about users across its different platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as from outside websites and apps, unless it gets explicit permission from users.
The decision undercuts Meta's business model, which relies on selling targeted advertising based on the massive amounts of data it gathers about its users as they use Meta services and browse the wider internet.
Why It Matters: Emboldening tougher oversight of Big Tech
The decision provides fresh momentum for supporters of tougher regulation of the world's largest technology companies. Although the ruling applies only to Meta services in Germany, it is expected to influence other antitrust authorities in the European Union.
A new E.U. antitrust law, called the Digital Markets Act, takes effect in the coming months and gives regulators new powers to encourage competition in the tech sector.
In particular, Tuesday's court ruling gives authorities in the European Union a firmer legal basis to examine how data-collection practices could undercut competition, which is a new direction for antitrust enforcement.
The court said regulators investigating antitrust cases can also examine whether a company is breaking the European Union's data protection law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.
Background: A new spin on antitrust law
In 2019, German regulators used a novel interpretation of antitrust law to determine that Meta's data-gathering practices were a violation of not just competition rules, but also the G.D.P.R. The authorities said Meta needed to get permission from users and could not just collect endless amounts of data simply because a user had signed up to use one of the company's services.
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, said Meta's policies amounted to a false choice, forcing people to either use Meta services and share their data, or stay off the company's ubiquitous social media sites altogether.
After the company appealed the decision, it eventually landed before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Mr. Mundt has long pushed for regulators to be tougher against Facebook and other tech giants. He has argued that Facebook uses the data it collects from users to strengthen its position over rivals, harming competition.
What's Next
In a statement, Meta said it was "evaluating the Court's decision and will have more to say in due course."
The company will now have to make changes in Germany to comply with the ruling. That is likely to include a new menu that gives users more choice about how their data is collected.
But the decision also has implications for other online platforms that collect large amounts of data for digital advertising, including Amazon, Google and TikTok.
"When large internet companies use the very personal data of consumers, this usage can also be deemed abusive under competition law," Mr. Mundt, the German antitrust regulator, said in a statement on Tuesday. "The judgment will have far-reaching effects on the business models used in the data economy."
Andreas Mundt, Germany's top antitrust regulator, championed a theory that weighs the accumulation of data as a form of anticompetitive behavior. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JANN HÖFER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B5.

Full text: The "oops, all French" edition.
Happy Independence Day! This is by far one of my favorite days to be in the city. The fireworks (both legal and illegal), the big "we outside" energy, the ample parking. You love to see it. So make the most of the holiday, even if it's just lazing around and catching up on "Love Island UK" to remind you why we wanted independence in the first place.
But today we're talking about this month's batch of reader questions. We have a query about where to take a son and brand-new son-in-law for a celebratory dinner in Brooklyn; another about lunch options near the Museum of Modern Art; and a reader who wants to know where to find a great baguette. Unintentionally, this newsletter is a bit French!
As always, please send your own questions or responses to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see them featured here.
A Brooklyn celebration
My son and his longtime partner surprised me with the wonderful news of their City Hall marriage last week! Since we didn't have a formal wedding or reception, I would like to surprise them with a celebratory dinner at someplace special. They are longtime residents of Brooklyn and always take me to delightful restaurants when I visit them from Georgia. My new son-in-law is a pescatarian, but my son has no restrictions. Please help, I don't know where to start. -- Paula R.
Paula, you're such a cool parent, and mazel! Here's wishing those crazy kids every happiness. If you want to really impress them with your sudden expertise in Brooklyn restaurants -- no need to credit me -- consider taking them to dinner at the aptly named Place des Fêtes, in Clinton Hill. There are good options for pescatarians: The chilled section of the menu is all seafood, including mussels en verde and sardine toast with smoked butter. (Halibut in brown butter for an entree?) And it's on one of my favorite streets in all of Brooklyn, Greene Avenue, which will make for a perfect post-dinner summertime walk.
A post-MoMA lunch
My school buddies are coming in from D.C. to visit and we are going to MoMA to see Georgia O'Keeffe. We are six and I always take them somewhere off the beaten path. What would you suggest for lunch? Believe it or not, we all eat anything! -- Madly W.
Do you have time for a very quick story? When I was in grad school, one of my professors took us to Le Bernardin to meet the chef Eric Ripert, who was really warm and friendly. Mr. Ripert recommended we head to La Bonne Soupe, on West 55th Street (and just two blocks north of MoMA), for lunch. So I'm going to pay his kindness forward and advise you to do the same, even if it's not exactly off the beaten path: It's an exceedingly charming French restaurant that isn't overly fussy, makes a mean French onion soup and croque madame, and its new owner hired a new, French-born chef to zhuzh the menu up without disturbing any of the charm that's made it a go-to lunch option since 1973.
Where do they keep the good baguettes?
Where in Manhattan can I buy French baguettes as good as those in France? Or, "ça n'existe pas?" -- Anthony L.
Bien sûr, we have great baguettes here! Downtown, I'd recommend checking out Le Fournil, in the East Village. It's run by Jean-François Hebert, a man with a name and a pedigree (Félix and Cafe du Soleil) you can trust. Uptown, you might consider Julien Boulangerie, home of New York's cube croissant, but also a very, very good baguette. They have three locations on the Upper East Side and one in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

Federal Judge Limits Biden Officials’ Contacts With Social Media Sites

A federal judge in Louisiana on Tuesday restricted the Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms about broad swaths of content online, a ruling that could curtail efforts to combat false and misleading narratives about the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.
The order, which could have significant First Amendment implications, is a major development in a fierce legal fight over the boundaries and limits of speech online.
It was a victory for Republicans who have often accused social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube of disproportionately taking down right-leaning content, sometimes in collaboration with government. Democrats say the platforms have failed to adequately police misinformation and hateful speech, leading to dangerous outcomes, including violence.
In the ruling, Judge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana said that parts of the government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI, could not talk to social media companies for “the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free speech.”
In granting a preliminary injunction, Doughty said that the agencies could not flag specific posts to the social media platforms or request reports about their efforts to take down content. The ruling said that the government could still notify the platforms about posts detailing crimes, national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections.
“If the allegations made by plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States’ history,” the judge said. “The plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the government has used its power to silence the opposition.”
Courts are increasingly being forced to weigh in on such issues — with the potential to upend decades of legal norms that have governed speech online.
The Republican attorneys general of Texas and Florida are defending first-of-their-kind state laws that bar internet platforms from taking down certain political content, and legal experts believe those cases may eventually reach the Supreme Court. The high court this year declined to limit a law that allows the platforms to escape legal liability for content that users post to the sites.
The ruling Tuesday, in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri, is likely to be appealed by the Biden administration, but its impact could force government officials, including law enforcement agencies, to refrain from notifying the platforms of troublesome content.
Government officials have argued they do not have the authority to order posts or entire accounts removed, but federal agencies and the tech giants have long worked together to take action against illegal or harmful material, especially in cases involving child sexual abuse, human trafficking and other criminal activity. That has also included regular meetings to share information on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
The White House said the Justice Department was reviewing the ruling and evaluating its next steps.
“Our consistent view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take account of the effects their platforms are having on the American people, but make independent choices about the information they present,” the White House said in a statement.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Twitter did not have a comment, and Google did not respond to a request for comment.
Jeff Landry, the Louisiana attorney general, said in a statement that the judge’s order was “historic.” Missouri’s attorney general, Andrew Bailey, hailed the ruling as a “huge win in the fight to defend our most fundamental freedoms.” Both officials are Republican.
“What a way to celebrate Independence Day,” Bailey said on Twitter.
The issue of the government’s influence over social media has become increasingly partisan.
The Republican majority in the House has taken up the cause, smothering universities and think tanks that have studied the issue with onerous requests for information and subpoenas.
The judge’s order bars government agencies from communicating with some of those outside groups, including the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project and the Stanford Internet Observatory, in order to induce the removal of protected speech online. Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, which was involved in leading the two other projects, declined to comment.
Since acquiring Twitter last year, Elon Musk has echoed Republican arguments, releasing internal company documents to chosen journalists suggesting what they claimed was collusion between company and government officials. Although that remains far from proven, some of the documents Musk disclosed ended up in the lawsuit’s arguments.
The defendants, the social media companies and experts who study disinformation have argued that there is no evidence of a systematic effort by the government to censor individuals in violation of the First Amendment. David Rand, an expert on misinformation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his understanding was that the government had at most a limited impact on how social media platforms engaged with misinformation.
At the same time, emails and text messages made public in the case that Doughty ruled on have shown instances where officials complained to social media executives when influential users spread disinformation, especially involving the coronavirus pandemic.
The states said in their lawsuit that they had a “sovereign and proprietary interest in receiving free flow of information in public discourse on social-media platforms.”
In addition to the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, the case was brought by four other plaintiffs: Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, public health researchers who questioned the government’s handling of the pandemic; Aaron Kheriaty, a professor dismissed by the University of California, Irvine, for refusing to have a coronavirus vaccination; Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation; and Jim Hoft, founder of Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. The four additional plaintiffs said social media sites removed some of their posts.
Although the lawsuit named as defendants President Joe Biden and dozens of officials in 11 government agencies, some of the instances cited took place during the Trump administration.
Doughty, who was appointed to the federal court by former President Donald Trump in 2017, has been sympathetic to conservative cases, having previously blocked the Biden administration’s national vaccination mandate for health care workers and overturned its ban on new federal leases for oil and gas drilling.
He allowed the plaintiffs extensive discovery and depositions from prominent officials like Anthony Fauci, then the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who told the plaintiffs’ lawyers that he was not involved in any discussions to censor content online.
Some experts in First Amendment law and misinformation criticized the Tuesday ruling.
“It can’t be that the government violates the First Amendment simply by engaging with the platforms about their content-moderation decisions and policies,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “If that’s what the court is saying here, it’s a pretty radical proposition that isn’t supported by the case law.”
Jaffer added that the government has to balance between calling out false speech without stepping into informal coercion that veers toward censorship. “Unfortunately Judge Doughty’s order doesn’t reflect a serious effort to reconcile the competing principles,” he said.
Doughty’s ruling said the injunction would remain in place while proceedings in the lawsuit continued unless he or a higher court ruled differently.

Judge Faces Hearing Over TikTok Videos: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The New Jersey judge, Gary Wilcox, posted the videos using an alias. In some, he wore judicial robes. At least one was recorded from bed.
For two years, a judge in New Jersey used a pseudonym to post TikTok videos of himself lip-syncing lyrics from popular rap songs.
In some, he was wearing judicial robes or shown walking through a courthouse, according to the state's Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct. Others included explicit references to violence, sex and misogyny. At least one was taken in bed.
On Monday, the court system said it had filed a complaint against the Superior Court judge, Gary N. Wilcox, who will now face a hearing that could lead to discipline ranging from a reprimand to dismissal from the bench.
The complaint argues that Judge Wilcox's decision to post the TikTok videos showed "poor judgment and demonstrated disrespect for the judiciary and an inability to conform to the high standards of conduct expected of judges."
The case, which will likely involve free speech arguments, was filed a day after the New Jersey Supreme Court issued a potentially precedent-setting decision related to privacy protections when using social media. The court ruled that the police needed to prove more than basic probable cause to continuously monitor Facebook to investigate crimes, concluding that the surveillance was the "functional equivalent" of tapping a person's phone.
Judge Wilcox, who presides over criminal cases in Bergen County, N.J., was admitted to the New Jersey bar more than three decades ago and has been a Superior Court judge since 2011. His lawyer, Robert Hille, said that he was reviewing the complaint and would be filing a response.
"I don't think that at the end of the day anybody is going to believe there was any desire to do any harm here," Mr. Hille said. "Hindsight is 20-20."
According to the complaint, he used an alias, "Sal Tortorella," to post roughly 40 publicly available videos on TikTok from 2021 to March 2023. Eleven were deemed inappropriate by the judicial conduct committee.
Several were recorded in his court chambers and included songs that contained "profanity, graphic sexual references to female and male body parts, and/or racist terms," according to the committee.
In one video cited in the complaint, which appears to have been removed from TikTok, Judge Wilcox recorded himself wearing a "Beavis and Butt-Head" T-shirt while walking through a courthouse as "Get Down" by the rapper Nas plays in the background.
The complaint noted that the song contains explicit lyrics about a criminal case and a courtroom shooting, as well as drug and gang references, including the killing of a doctor who treated a rival gang member.
Another video showed Judge Wilcox in a car, wearing a T-shirt bearing the words "Freedom of Speech," while mouthing lyrics about spilling cognac on a " $ 200 suit."
"You think you can run up on me and whip my monkey ass? Come on. Come on!" he lip-synced in another video, which was recorded in a judge's chambers in front of law books.
Many of the songs cited in the complaint are from mainstream musicians. One video included "Jump" from the artist Rihanna; others featured "Sure Thing" by the R&B singer Miguel and "Touch It" by the rapper Busta Rhymes.
Judge Wilcox is in his 50s, and will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 2034, according to a spokeswoman for the courts.
Alexander Shalom, a senior lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, noted that there was often a distinction between conduct that an employer can mandate and speech that was constitutionally protected.
"Judge Wilcox is entitled to due process," said Mr. Shalom, who has interceded in other prominent free-speech cases in New Jersey. "As he goes through that process, there will be lots of significant issues raised about free speech and free expression and what actually does impugn the stature of the judiciary."
He said the A.C.L.U., which is not involved in the case, would be watching as the case progresses and would be "eager to delve into those issues."
The complaint against Judge Wilcox comes as New Jersey's Superior Court has so many judicial vacancies that civil and matrimonial trials have been halted in six counties.
Lawmakers have stressed the value of a diverse bench as they approve the slow trickle of Superior Court nominees. And on Friday, Michael Noriega become the first former public defender to be confirmed to serve on the New Jersey Supreme Court, a step the governor said restored "representation from the Hispanic community at the highest level of our judiciary."
Mr. Hille said the focus on appointing judges from varied backgrounds was a noble pursuit.
"The idea of diversity is that you have a link to the community, so you have developed a frame of reference," said Mr. Hille, who made clear he was speaking generically and not about Judge Wilcox's case.
"These are mainstream performers," he said about the music cited in the complaint. "This is music that's out there in the public. And clearly it elicits a different response depending on who is listening."

Coast Guard Rescues Man Lost in Pacific: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: An American man's rowboat had capsized in the Pacific. Low on battery, he put out a call for help.
After his 23-foot rowboat lost battery power in mid-May as he tried to circle the globe, Aaron Carotta spent more than a month at the mercy of ocean currents that pulled him across the Pacific.
Then, when a giant wave knocked his vessel upside down, he inflated a leaky life raft and immediately activated an emergency satellite beacon. He didn't have much time to wait for help: Water was pooling at his ankles, he was shivering with hypothermia, and a shark was circling nearby.
But a few hours later, a United States Coast Guard plane came into view -- the first aircraft that Mr. Carotta, 45, had seen in more than 80 days -- and set a rescue in motion.
"It was a sight for sore eyes," Mr. Carotta said on Tuesday, a day after a merchant ship that had plucked him out of the water dropped him off in Hawaii. He had set off from Panama in February on a mission to circumnavigate the globe.
Newer satellite technologies, especially Starlink internet systems operated by the rocket company SpaceX, have dramatically improved the odds that people lost at sea will be found. In March, for example, a Starlink connection helped rescuers find the crew of a sailboat that had capsized after colliding with a whale in the Pacific.
But older satellite rescue technologies can still be highly effective, as they were in Mr. Carotta's case. In 2021 alone, nearly 2,500 people were rescued as a result of maritime notifications through the international satellite network known as Cospas-Sarsat. The network is used by search and rescue authorities around the world, and its notifications are automatic and instantaneous.
"That's the beauty of the system," said Douglas Samp, who oversees the Coast Guard's search and rescue operations in the Pacific.
Mr. Carotta's life as an adventurer began around 2008, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer and quit his job as a real-estate appraiser "with the hopes of finding a more purposed path," as he later wrote. He beat cancer and spent six years traveling to dozens of countries, doing charity work and supporting himself as a freelance television producer and presenter.
After a series of personal and professional setbacks, Mr. Carotta, who is from Louisiana, decided to take on ambitious, water-based expeditions. One was a 5,000-mile solo canoe trip from Montana to Florida. Another was his planned circumnavigation of the globe, which he called a spiritual journey that would take three to five years and help to recalibrate his life to "see level."
But a few weeks after he entered open ocean, the solar panels powering his onboard battery stopped working. He fixed the problem -- enough to upload a final video to Facebook from his phone in mid-May, through a Starlink connection -- but the battery eventually died. That left him with just an iPhone, a GPS tracker and an emergency satellite beacon.
He decided not to set off the beacon, as he knew it would trigger an international rescue effort and put pressure on the Coast Guard's resources. So when his other devices lost power, he navigated with only a compass.
The device indicated that he was on track to drift into French Polynesia a few weeks later, so he kept drifting in silence. He stuck to a daily routine that he described as "eat, pray, fish."
"I just kept rowing," Mr. Carotta said. "Like, 'no problem. I'm in a rowboat. I got this."'
But as days passed, concern over Mr. Carotta's silence grew among people who were following his journey on social media, said his friend, Alison Dawn. They were worried in part because Mr. Carotta had expressed concern in his May Facebook post that a "rogue" wave might capsize his rowboat, Smiles.
In late May, another friend, Rachel Palmer, who lives in New Zealand, decided to notify search and rescue authorities.
"As a friend, what do you do?" she said in an interview on Wednesday. "You have to do something."
After an initial international search for him was suspended, another began weeks later, once Mr. Carotta activated his emergency satellite beacon on June 15.
A Coast Guard aircraft, which had been in the area on another rescue mission, flew four hours to Mr. Carotta's location, about 1,400 miles northeast of Tahiti, the agency said. Around sunset, it dropped survival equipment for him but took off for Honolulu to refuel before conducting a rescue.
Ocean currents prevented Mr. Carotta, who was wearing only swim trunks, from reaching the equipment, and he didn't want to risk swimming because of the circling shark. So he spent the night bobbing in rough seas, bailing water and battling the cold by curling into a ball on the life raft's floor.
"The hypothermia was the deadly factor," he said.
The next day, a merchant ship that had been alerted to his position by the Coast Guard pulled up alongside his raft. Its crew hoisted him aboard with a crane.
"While I can't quote scripture verses, offer a homily to a parish or claim a perfect past," Mr. Carotta wrote Tuesday on Facebook, from Honolulu, "I hope this story of a simple effort with human power demonstrates a true effort to a purposed life, one others can try themselves in their own life, with their own ocean and boat."

Full text: After getting an initial thumbs up that may have been in jest, a reader wonders how to make a sensitive request that is more likely to be taken seriously.
My wife and I are women in our early 30s, and we would like to have a baby soon. One of my best friends has a very handsome husband. I mentioned to her that we would like to conceive our baby using his sperm. She seemed to agree -- but did so as if in jest. What is the best way to broach this subject again, but more seriously this time? Should we ask in person because of the intimate nature of the request? Or should we write an email, so they have time to process and respond without pressure?
SARA
Flashing yellow light! I urge you and your wife to slow down. Do you really want to complicate your relationship with a close friend and her husband simply because he's handsome and hanging around? Even assuming he has other qualities that are (arguably) more important than his looks -- intelligence, good health or a killer fashion sense -- you seem to be placing too great a premium on convenience here.
You don't say whether you want the husband to play any role in your child's life. If so, there are many issues to decide with your wife before speaking to anyone. (A good family lawyer can help with that.) And if you don't want the biological father involved, why use the husband of a close friend? You would put him in the awkward position of seeing the child without saying anything about their relationship. There are plenty of good-looking, anonymous donors at sperm banks who have been screened for medical conditions.
Now, you may see this request as less freighted than I do. If you decide to proceed, make a date to meet the couple in person. (Yes, an email is too remote for so sensitive a question.) Make a clear proposal for them to consider. Be prepared to answer their questions, but tell them you don't expect an immediate answer. It's a big ask, and I would avoid making it until you've considered every angle.
It Takes a Fuselage to Raise a Child
I was seated on an airplane in front of two boys in their early teens. They fought for most of the flight, kicking my seat repeatedly. I tolerated it. After the plane landed, one of them kicked my seat so hard I saw stars! I stood up and said loudly, "Would you please stop kicking my seat?" The kid replied, "I only kicked it four or five times." As the family filed out, the mother said to me nastily, "Next time, be polite." Was I wrong to speak up?

When I was a boy, a thousand years ago, nearly any adult could discipline a child who was misbehaving, and our parents generally expected us to fall in line. This may have been your experience, too. Still, I am surprised you haven't noticed that many parents object to strangers' correcting their children these days.
Next time, speak to the parent sooner: "Your son is kicking my seat. Can you ask him to stop, or switch seats with him, please?" The situation may not end any better, but you may be less aggravated if you act faster. If the parent is unable or unwilling to control her child, ask the flight attendant to reseat you.
An Aspiring Member of the Clean Tray Club
My mother is 91 and lives alone. Several caring relatives bring her food regularly. The problem: She doesn't like a lot of it and won't eat it -- particularly food brought by one relative. I hate the thought of wasting food and this relative's time and money. There are a few things on her trays my mother will eat. I think we should tell our relative politely, but my mother thinks that would be rude. Thoughts?
DAUGHTER
Here's my take: A one-time gift of homemade food we don't care for -- a tray of lasagna or brownies -- can often be rerouted, without a word to the chef (other than thanks). A friend, neighbor or service provider may take it.
Here, though, your relative is trying to be part of your mother's care team. Let her! Thank her for the trays, singling out the items your mother likes and telling the relative that your mother has lost the taste for certain other things. I don't think a reasonable person would be upset. Still, defer to your mother: She is older, not incompetent. If she wants to keep quiet, encourage her to donate unwanted food to programs for the hungry -- perhaps through a faith community or senior center.
A Doggy Bag Earnestly Meant for Takeaway
I take my dog running with me. Shortly after we start out, she does her business. I put the poop in a bag, but there are no trash receptacles in our neighborhood. So, I leave the bag on the sidewalk, intending to pick it up on my way home. More often than not, though, the bag is gone! One of my neighbors must pick it up. I feel embarrassed, but I don't want to start a conversation about this. Advice?
DOG MOM
Start a conversation about this. I get the problem, but silence here is bad citizenship. If you know who is collecting the bags, thank your helpful neighbor. Explain your predicament and commitment to picking them up on your way home. If you aren't sure about your good Samaritan, attach a Post-it note to the bags: "I promise to pick this up in 30 minutes."

Rip Currents in Gulf Have Claimed 11 Lives. Here's How to Escape.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts advise swimmers to pay attention to warning flags and beach forecasts and to not panic if they find themselves in a rip current.
At least 11 people have drowned after getting caught in rip currents that have been wreaking havoc along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in recent weeks, as rising temperatures have pushed swimmers into cooler waters.
Seven of those deaths occurred off Panama City Beach, Fla., according to the National Weather Service, which tracks surf-zone deaths across the United States. All of the victims have been male.
Sheriff Tommy Ford of Bay County, Fla., which includes Panama City Beach, expressed frustration in a Facebook post this week about sheriff's deputies, firefighters and lifeguards risking their lives to save strangers. They were "cursed and given the finger, while trying to warn visitors of the life-threatening dangers," he said.
"I have seen strangers die trying to save their children and loved ones, including two fathers on Father's Day," Sheriff Ford wrote. He urged beachgoers to take personal responsibility as "the only way to ensure that no one else dies."
In another swimming-related episode, Ryan Mallett, a former N.F.L. quarterback, drowned on Tuesday in Destin, Fla., after emergency medical workers responded to assist six swimmers who struggled to make it back to shore. He was 35. No rip currents were reported in the area, officials said in a statement, but some of the things people can do to escape a rip current can also be used to avoid drowning in calming waters as well.
What is a rip current?
Rip currents are riverlike channels that move away from the shore at high speeds and typically extend from near the shoreline to past the line of breaking waves. Rip currents form as waves disperse along the beach, causing water to become trapped between the beach and a sandbar or another shallow spot, and also near the underwater parts of structures like jetties and piers.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, rip currents typically reach speeds of one to two feet per second; some have been measured as fast as eight feet per second. High winds and large waves can also increase the chances that a rip current will form.
Rip currents can be spotted from the shore, especially at lower tide. They typically appear as darker, narrow gaps of water between areas of breaking waves and white water. If you aren't sure if what you are seeing is a rip current, ask the nearest lifeguard.
What's going on in Florida?
Florida's deadly spate of drownings can be attributed in part to a long period of onshore flow, when the prevailing wind is pointed toward the shore, said Wright Dobbs, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee. An offshore flow has been moving in over the past few days, he said, and lighter wind speed over the next few days could generally ease the risk of rip currents, he said.
But that onshore flow "played havoc" on the sandbars along a stretch of the Florida shoreline known as the Emerald Coast, which includes Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island, increasing the rip current risk, Mr. Dobbs said. "We're still seeing them take a while to recover," he said. "Folks still need to be very vigilant."
Mr. Dobbs, who grew up in the area, said the Gulf experiences rip currents year-round. But the number of deaths is "more than we normally see."
Daryl Paul, the beach safety director for Panama City Beach, said the city is fully staffed with 10 lifeguards to patrol its nine miles of beach year-round. Ahead of the busy Independence Day holiday weekend, he said, he plans to more than double that number, with cross-trained firefighters on standby. Lifeguard stations will also be pulled closer to the shoreline.
Mr. Paul said the forecast and tide schedule suggest that rip currents will form in the afternoon on Tuesday, July 4. Lifeguards will try to keep swimmers in the shallows of the sandbars.
"We have a saying," he said. "Knee-deep is too deep."
If you get caught in a rip current, don't panic.
If you are caught in a rip current, you likely won't notice at first, but the current will bring you out to sea quickly. The first rule is not to panic; doing so will only exhaust you, as you try to swim back to shore.
Because rip currents move perpendicular to shore, the best way to get out of a rip current is to let the current carry you until the force weakens, and then swim parallel to the shore until you're able to swim to safety.
Rip current safety begins before swimmers enter the water. Panama City Beach encourages swimmers to take note of warning flags: green for calm conditions, yellow for moderate surf, and red for high surf and strong currents. When a double red flag is flown, the water is closed to the public.
The Weather Service recommends two steps to ensuring a safe beach day. First, check water conditions before going to the beach by looking at a local beach forecast. Just because it's a sunny day doesn't mean it's safe to swim. And second, swim at a beach with lifeguards.

Man Accused Of Stabbing 3 In Classroom: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A professor and two students at the University of Waterloo were treated for their injuries. A 24-year-old recent graduate was charged with assault.
A recent graduate of the University of Waterloo in Ontario was charged with assault on Thursday, accused of stabbing a professor and two students in a gender studies class in what the police described as a "hate-motivated incident."
Geovanny Villalba-Aleman, 24, an international student who graduated in 2022, was charged with aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose and mischief, the Waterloo Regional Police said in a statement and a news conference. He appeared in court for a bail hearing on Thursday, where the police asked that he remain in custody.
It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.
"The accused targeted a gender-studies class and investigators believe this was a hate-motivated incident related to gender expression and gender identity," the statement said.
The police said that on Wednesday, at about 3:40 p.m., about 40 students were in a classroom when the suspect came in and stabbed three people: a 38-year-old female professor; a 20-year-old female student and a 19-year-old male student. All three were taken to the hospital with "serious but non-life-threatening" injuries, the police said.
In what he described as a "shocking attack," James Rush, a vice president of the university, said in a statement on Thursday that the stabbing took place during a lecture in a class called Philosophy 202 -- Gender Studies. According to the university's website, the class examines "the construction of gender in the history of philosophy through contemporary discussions." Questions that the class raises include: "What is gender? How do we 'do' gender? How can we 'undo' gender -- and do we want to?"
Chief Mark Crowell of the Waterloo Regional Police said at a news conference that the suspect had entered the classroom and spoke briefly to the professor, apparently to confirm the subject matter of the class. Then, he stabbed her with two knives, stabbed the other two students and attempted to stab a third.
Students in the room either fled or tried to intervene, throwing objects at the suspect, Chief Crowell said. Mr. Villalba-Aleman then left the room and tried to blend in as a victim, but witnesses identified him to the police. He was arrested in the building, he said.
The University of Waterloo has about 42,000 students and is one of the world's best technology schools, requiring engineering and computer science students to mix studies with work. BlackBerry and other onetime start-ups have grown out of student projects at the university.
On its Facebook page on Thursday, the university said members of its community would gather on campus "in recognition of the shocking attack and trauma we endured yesterday."
The Facebook page became a platform for people to vent their anger over the attack. Some questioned why the school's emergency alert system had not worked and why students were allowed to attend classes in other parts of campus, uninformed that an attack had occurred. Others wrote about the attack in the broader context of gender-based violence, even before the police identified a motive.
Mr. Rush said in his statement that the campus's emergency alert system, despite tests concluded the same day as the attack, "did not activate as quickly as we would all have expected."
"I acknowledge that many people will speculate about the motivation for this attack; we must be patient and have confidence in the judicial process," Mr. Rush said before the charges were announced. "I urge you to focus your energy on supporting one another during this very traumatic time."
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack on Twitter on Thursday, calling the stabbings "horrifying and unacceptable."
There have been other gender-related attacks at Canadian universities, including in 1989, when a man who blamed women for his financial and career problems fatally shot 14 female students and employees at the École Polytechnique, an engineering school in Montreal.
Chief Crowell said the suspect aimed to "purposely target the subject matter of gender identity and gender expression."
"We have seen and heard across Canada there is a disturbing trend" of hate-motivated incidents during Pride Month, he said.

Supreme Court Puts First Amendment Limits on Bans to Online Threats: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The case concerned Billy Counterman, a Colorado man who became obsessed with a singer-songwriter, sending her disturbing messages on Facebook.
The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the First Amendment imposes limits on laws that make it a crime to issue threats on the internet, saying that prosecutors must prove that a Colorado man who had sent disturbing messages to a singer-songwriter had acted recklessly in causing emotional harm.
"The state must show that the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence," Justice Elena Kagan wrote for five justices in the 7-to-2 decision.
Justice Kagan acknowledged that "true threats," like libel, incitement, obscenity and fighting words, are not protected by the First Amendment. But she said the risk of chilling protected speech warranted imposing an added burden on prosecutors.
"The speaker's fear of mistaking whether a statement is a threat; his fear of the legal system getting that judgment wrong; his fear, in any event, of incurring legal costs -- all those may lead him to swallow words that are in fact not true threats," she wrote.
The case arose from the fixation of the defendant, Billy Counterman, with a singer-songwriter identified in court papers as C.W. He sent her many messages on Facebook, opening new accounts when she blocked him.
"You're not being good for human relations," one message said. "Die. Don't need you."
Another asked, "Was that you in the white Jeep?"
Justice Kagan wrote that "the messages put C.W. in fear and upended her daily existence," adding, "She stopped walking alone, declined social engagements and canceled some of her performances, though doing so caused her financial strain."
Mr. Counterman was prosecuted under a Colorado law that made it a crime to send repeated communications that would cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress and did cause such harm. He was convicted and sentenced to four and a half years in prison.
The Supreme Court vacated the conviction and returned the case to the lower courts, where prosecutors may decide whether to retry the defendant under the more demanding standard.
Lawyers for Mr. Counterman had argued that the law violated the First Amendment because it did not require proof that he intended to cause the distress.
"The notion that one could commit a 'speech crime' by accident is chilling," they wrote in a Supreme Court brief. "Imprisoning a person for negligently misjudging how others would construe the speaker's words would erode the breathing space that safeguards the free exchange of ideas."
Lawyers for the state responded that it was enough to look at the words in question, how they were conveyed and the response they elicited. The speaker's subjective intent, they said, does not matter.
Justice Kagan analyzed the question by examining how the Supreme Court had treated other categories of unprotected speech, notably libel. Noting that public figures must show at least reckless disregard of the truth -- meaning subjective awareness of probable falsity -- to prevail in libel cases, she said something similar was required in true-threats prosecutions.
In the context of threats, she wrote, quoting an earlier opinion, recklessness "means that a speaker is aware 'that others could regard his statements as' threatening violence and 'delivers them anyway."'
But she added that prosecutors were not required to prove that Mr. Counterman intended the harm.
"As with any balance," she wrote, "something is lost on both sides: The rule we adopt today is neither the most speech-protective nor the most sensitive to the dangers of true threats."
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Justice Kagan's majority opinion.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined for the most part by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, agreed with Justice Kagan's bottom line but for different reasons. She said she would analyze the case as involving stalking rather than threats.
Justice Clarence Thomas issued a brief dissent that repeated his call to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 libel decision interpreting the First Amendment to make it hard for public officials to prevail in libel suits.
"It is thus unfortunate," he wrote, "that the majority chooses not only to prominently and uncritically invoke New York Times, but also to extend its flawed, policy-driven First Amendment analysis to true threats, a separate area of this court's jurisprudence."
In a second dissent, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justice Thomas, wrote that an objective standard was sufficient in true-threats prosecutions.
"The bottom line is this," she wrote, quoting phrases from Justice Kagan's opinion. "Counterman communicated true threats, which, 'everyone agrees, lie outside the bounds of the First Amendment's protection.' He knew what the words meant. Those threats caused the victim to fear for her life, and they 'upended her daily existence.' Nonetheless, the court concludes that Counterman can prevail on a First Amendment defense. Nothing in the Constitution compels that result."
Justice Barrett suggested that Justice Kagan's position in the case, Counterman v. Colorado, No. 22-138, was unprincipled.
"The reality," she wrote, "is that recklessness is not grounded in law, but in a Goldilocks judgment: Recklessness is not too much, not too little, but instead 'just right."'
Responding in a footnote, Justice Kagan did not appear offended. "In law, as in life," she wrote, "there are worse things than being 'just right."'

Food Near Forest Hills Stadium to Fuel Up for Fun: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: If you're headed to a concert at this former tennis complex, here are a few options for food.
There are a few summer inevitabilities: A heat wave that will test the limits of your window air-conditioner. Sweating on a subway platform. One of your favorite bands or musicians playing a show at Forest Hills Stadium.
Concerts are a boon for restaurants in that tree-lined section of Queens, and, if you're not a local, you may find yourself wandering among the area's Tudor-style buildings in the coming months searching for a quick bite or an entire meal.
If you need a preshow pick-me-up ...
Compared with performances at venues like Kings Theater or the Bowery Ballroom, most shows at Forest Hills start on the earlier side, with doors opening between 3 and 6 p.m. depending on the show -- great news for anyone who prefers to pregame with iced coffee and loves getting to bed before midnight.
Try Forest Cafe, open since October, a charming coffee shop outfitted in blond wood and hanging paper lights about a five-minute walk from the stadium. This is where you can get that iced latte or cold brew, or a matcha-based drink without the grainy texture that makes most examples disappointing. I wouldn't necessarily rely on them for food -- on a recent visit they were sold out of everything at 2 p.m. -- but if you're lucky, you might be able to grab a gochujang tamago sandwich or a croffle (croissant-waffle) drizzled with Nutella.
If you're running late ...
Familiarize yourself with Forest Hill's main drag, Austin Street, one block south of the Forest Hills-71st Avenue subway station. This commercial strip is teeming with popular chains like Shake Shack, Bareburger and a Boston Market. But if there's one I'd recommend, it's Oh K-Dog.
That K stands for Korean, and the specialty is made-to-order corn dogs encrusted in a deep-fried, slightly sweet, rice flour-based batter. The hot dog itself is no Nathan's or Sabrett, but it doesn't matter much as you bite into a perfectly crisp exterior drizzled with your choice of toppings, or -- my favorite variation -- a rice-cake corn dog. Take yours to go on the way to the stadium, or stick around and watch K-pop music videos on the restaurant's TV.
If you have time before the show ...
For a proper sit-down meal you can fly through with relative ease, walk over to Tengri Tagh, a tiny restaurant, also on Austin Street, that specializes in Uyghur cuisine. This location, open since May, is the restaurant's second. (The original is on West 37th Street near Seventh Avenue in Manhattan.)
Tengri Tagh exemplifies hospitality. When I visited (anonymously) on a hot Sunday afternoon, Kudusi Simayi, an owner, handed me and my friend two ice-cold Coca-Colas on the house. The portions at Tengri Tagh are as generous as the service, so it's best to choose one menu item to split between two people. A nonnegotiable order is the handmade noodles with Uyghur stir-fried lamb, featuring pleasantly chewy lagman noodles surrounded by thinly sliced halal lamb, tomatoes, green peppers and cloud ear mushrooms in a sauce that is spicy enough to awaken the senses without overwhelming them. In other words, it's worth visiting whether you have concert tickets or not.
In other news ...
Two things: I made a mistake two weeks ago and said that the original Frenchette Bakery is closing; it is not. They're simply adding a second location. The other thing is that the jerk chicken cart I mentioned in last week's newsletter is called Wadadli Jerk and you can, and should, enjoy their Caribbean cuisine six days a week at their newish brick and mortar space at 419 Putnam Avenue in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.
This week, Pete Wells reviews the new Superiority Burger, finding many of the restaurant's decisions seem to stem from the question, "Wouldn't it be cool if ..." The attention to detail, Pete writes, pays off: "Sitting in a booth at Superiority Burger for an hour or so gives you a stronger sense of place than reading some novels."
Openings: Nasrin's Kitchen is bringing Iranian cooking to a space on West 57th Street; and Cecchi's Bar and Grill on West 13th Street is leaning into old-school fine dining (think chicken à la king and crab Louis) starting on Saturday.
In her latest, Tejal Rao looks at the new season of the hit show "The Bear," and how "it conveys an unexpected optimism about the restaurant industry and the people who make it run."
The pandemic -- and a sudden hyperawareness of how illnesses spread -- nearly spelled the end for the buffet. But in the face of inflation and rising food costs, the wallet-friendly buffet is making a comeback, reports Kim Severson.

Montana Derailment Sends at Least 7 Freight Cars Into the Yellowstone River: [Correction]

Full text: Cars carrying molten sulfur or asphalt plunged into the river after a Montana Rail Link train derailed and a bridge collapsed on Saturday, officials said.
Ten cars from a freight train plunged into the Yellowstone River in Montana on Saturday after a derailment and a bridge collapse, causing asphalt and molten sulfur cargo to spill into the water, the authorities said.
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality tested the water along waterways and treatment facilities in Yellowstone and Stillwater Counties on Sunday and "found no negative impacts," said David Stamey, the chief of emergency services in Stillwater County.
Officials were investigating whether the derailment or the bridge collapse happened first, as well as how much of the cargo had spread into the river.
What led up to the derailment was not immediately known, officials said.
The train cars, operated by Montana Rail Link, derailed around 6:45 a.m. local time as they headed west in Stillwater County, the county's Disaster and Emergency Services Department said on Facebook.
State officials and Montana Rail Link on Sunday were coordinating cleanup efforts, Mr. Stamey said.
Andy Garland, a Montana Rail Link spokesman, said no one was injured. Mr. Garland said that two other cars were carrying sodium hydrosulfide but neither landed in the water or been breached.
Wendy Buckley, the president and chief executive of STARS HazMat Consulting, a firm that serves manufacturers, distributors and carriers of hazardous materials, said that the primary hazard from hot asphalt and molten sulfur was their high temperatures.
When hot sulfur mixes with water, it can create sulfuric acid, which can kill fish, Ms. Buckley said. But if sulfuric acid was created, it would be "extremely diluted being that it's in a river," so the long-term effects would be "very minimal," she said.
If the asphalt, a petroleum product, was in a very liquid state when it breached, it would be more likely to spread and affect the river, Ms. Buckley said. Officials said that the material was moving slowly, so the environmental effects would likely also be minimal, she said.
"This stuff is only hazardous because it's really hot," Ms. Buckley said, adding, "This is not ideal by any means, but it is not a crisis either."
The derailment happened between Reed Point and Columbus, in an area about an hour west of Billings.
Video of the scene showed the collapsed bridge with rail cars peeking above the flowing water. It was not immediately clear when the bridge was constructed or when it was last inspected.
Mr. Garland said Montana Rail Link was "committed to addressing any potential impacts to the area as a result of this incident and working to understand the reasons behind the accident."
The derailment in Montana came about four months after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in eastern Ohio, igniting a fire that covered the town of East Palestine in smoke. That derailment prompted concerns about residents' health and the environment.

In A.I., the Race to Block Child Predators: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A.I. companies have an edge in blocking the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse material. They've seen how social media companies failed.
Dave Willner has had a front-row seat to the evolution of the worst things on the internet.
He started working at Facebook in 2008, back when social media companies were making up their rules as they went along. As the company's head of content policy, it was Mr. Willner who wrote Facebook's first official community standards more than a decade ago, turning what he has said was an informal one-page list that mostly boiled down to a ban on "Hitler and naked people" into what is now a voluminous catalog of slurs, crimes and other grotesqueries that are banned across all of Meta's platforms.
So last year, when the San Francisco artificial intelligence lab OpenAI was preparing to launch Dall-E, a tool that allows anyone to instantly create an image by describing it in a few words, the company tapped Mr. Willner to be its head of trust and safety. Initially, that meant sifting through all of the images and prompts that Dall-E's filters flagged as potential violations -- and figuring out ways to prevent would-be violators from succeeding.
It didn't take long in the job before Mr. Willner found himself considering a familiar threat.
Just as child predators had for years used Facebook and other major tech platforms to disseminate pictures of child sexual abuse, they were now attempting to use Dall-E to create entirely new ones. "I am not surprised that it was a thing that people would attempt to do," Mr. Willner said. "But to be very clear, neither were the folks at OpenAI."
For all of the recent talk of the hypothetical existential risks of generative A.I., experts say it is this immediate threat -- child predators using new A.I. tools already -- that deserves the industry's undivided attention.
In a newly published paper by the Stanford Internet Observatory and Thorn, a nonprofit that fights the spread of child sexual abuse online, researchers found that, since last August, there has been a small but meaningful uptick in the amount of photorealistic A.I.-generated child sexual abuse material circulating on the dark web.
According to Thorn's researchers, this has manifested for the most part in imagery that uses the likeness of real victims but visualizes them in new poses, being subjected to new and increasingly egregious forms of sexual violence. The majority of these images, the researchers found, have been generated not by Dall-E but by open-source tools that were developed and released with few protections in place.
In their paper, the researchers reported that less than 1 percent of child sexual abuse material found in a sample of known predatory communities appeared to be photorealistic A.I.-generated images. But given the breakneck pace of development of these generative A.I. tools, the researchers predict that number will only grow.
"Within a year, we're going to be reaching very much a problem state in this area," said David Thiel, the chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, who co-wrote the paper with Thorn's director of data science, Dr. Rebecca Portnoff, and Thorn's head of research, Melissa Stroebel. "This is absolutely the worst case scenario for machine learning that I can think of."
Dr. Portnoff has been working on machine learning and child safety for more than a decade.
To her, the idea that a company like OpenAI is already thinking about this issue speaks to the fact that this field is at least on a faster learning curve than the social media giants were in their earliest days.
"The posture is different today," said Dr. Portnoff.
Still, she said, "If I could rewind the clock, it would be a year ago."
'We trust people'
In 2003, Congress passed a law banning "computer-generated child pornography" -- a rare instance of congressional future-proofing. But at the time, creating such images was both prohibitively expensive and technically complex.
The cost and complexity of creating these images has been steadily declining, but changed last August with the public debut of Stable Diffusion, a free, open-source text-to-image generator developed by Stability AI, a machine learning company based in London.
In its earliest iteration, Stable Diffusion placed few limits on the kind of images its model could produce, including ones containing nudity. "We trust people, and we trust the community," the company's chief executive, Emad Mostaque, told The New York Times last fall.
In a statement, Motez Bishara, the director of communications for Stability AI, said that the company prohibited misuse of its technology for "illegal or immoral" purposes, including the creation of child sexual abuse material. "We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes," Mr. Bishara said.
Because the model is open-source, developers can download and modify the code on their own computers and use it to generate, among other things, realistic adult pornography. In their paper, the researchers at Thorn and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that predators have tweaked those models so that they are capable of creating sexually explicit images of children, too. The researchers demonstrate a sanitized version of this in the report, by modifying one A.I.-generated image of a woman until it looks like an image of Audrey Hepburn as a child.
Stability AI has since released filters that try to block what the company calls "unsafe and inappropriate content." And newer versions of the technology were built using data sets that exclude content deemed "not safe for work." But, according to Mr. Thiel, people are still using the older model to produce imagery that the newer one prohibits.
Unlike Stable Diffusion, Dall-E is not open-source and is only accessible through OpenAI's own interface. The model was also developed with many more safeguards in place to prohibit the creation of even legal nude imagery of adults. "The models themselves have a tendency to refuse to have sexual conversations with you," Mr. Willner said. "We do that mostly out of prudence around some of these darker sexual topics."
The company also implemented guardrails early on to prevent people from using certain words or phrases in their Dall-E prompts. But Mr. Willner said predators still try to game the system by using what researchers call "visual synonyms" -- creative terms to evade guardrails while describing the images they want to produce.
"If you remove the model's knowledge of what blood looks like, it still knows what water looks like, and it knows what the color red is," Mr. Willner said. "That problem also exists for sexual content."
'Open questions'
Thorn has a tool called Safer, which scans images for child abuse and helps companies report them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs a federally designated clearinghouse of suspected child sexual abuse material. OpenAI uses Safer to scan content that people upload to Dall-E's editing tool. That's useful for catching real images of children, but Mr. Willner said that even the most sophisticated automated tools could struggle to accurately identify A.I.-generated imagery.
That is an emerging concern among child safety experts: That A.I. will not just be used to create new images of real children but also to make explicit imagery of children who do not exist.
That content is illegal on its own and will need to be reported. But this possibility has also led to concerns that the federal clearinghouse may become further inundated with fake imagery that would complicate efforts to identify real victims. Last year alone, the center's CyberTipline received roughly 32 million reports.
"If we start receiving reports, will we be able to know? Will they be tagged or be able to be differentiated from images of real children?" said Yiota Souras, the general counsel of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
At least some of those answers will need to come not just from A.I. companies, like OpenAI and Stability AI, but from companies that run messaging apps or social media platforms, like Meta, which is the top reporter to the CyberTipline.
Last year, more than 27 million tips came from Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram alone. Already, tech companies use a classification system, developed by an industry alliance called the Tech Coalition, to categorize suspected child sexual abuse material by the victim's apparent age and the nature of the acts depicted. In their paper, the Thorn and Stanford researchers argue that these classifications should be broadened to also reflect whether an image was computer-generated.
In a statement to The New York Times, Meta's global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, "We're working to be purposeful and evidence-based in our approach to A.I.-generated content, like understanding when the inclusion of identifying information would be most beneficial and how that information should be conveyed." Ms. Davis said the company would be working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to determine the best way forward.
Beyond the responsibilities of platforms, researchers argue that there is more that A.I. companies themselves can be doing. Specifically, they could train their models to not create images of child nudity and to clearly identify images as generated by artificial intelligence as they make their way around the internet. This would mean baking a watermark into those images that is more difficult to remove than the ones either Stability AI or OpenAI have already implemented.
As lawmakers look to regulate A.I., experts view mandating some form of watermarking or provenance tracing as key to fighting not only child sexual abuse material but also misinformation.
"You're only as good as the lowest common denominator here, which is why you want a regulatory regime," said Hany Farid, a professor of digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley.
Professor Farid is responsible for developing PhotoDNA, a tool launched in 2009 by Microsoft, which many tech companies now use to automatically find and block known child sexual abuse imagery. Mr. Farid said tech giants were too slow to implement that technology after it was developed, enabling the scourge of child sexual abuse material to openly fester for years. He is currently working with a number of tech companies to create a new technical standard for tracing A.I.-generated imagery. Stability AI is among the companies planning to implement this standard.
Another open question is how the court system will treat cases brought against creators of A.I.-generated child sexual abuse material -- and what liability A.I. companies will have. Though the law against "computer-generated child pornography" has been on the books for two decades, it's never been tested in court. An earlier law that tried to ban what was then referred to as virtual child pornography was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2002 for infringing on speech.
Members of the European Commission, the White House and the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee have been briefed on Stanford and Thorn's findings. It is critical, Mr. Thiel said, that companies and lawmakers find answers to these questions before the technology advances even further to include things like full motion video. "We've got to get it before then," Mr. Thiel said.
Julie Cordua, the chief executive of Thorn, said the researchers' findings should be seen as a warning -- and an opportunity. Unlike the social media giants who woke up to the ways their platforms were enabling child predators years too late, Ms. Cordua argues, there's still time to prevent the problem of AI-generated child abuse from spiraling out of control.
"We know what these companies should be doing," Ms. Cordua said. "We just need to do it."

Social Media Is Said to Harm Teens, but Proving It Is Hard: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Parents, scientists and the surgeon general are worried. But there isn't even a shared definition of what social media is.
There have been increasingly loud public warnings that social media is harming teenagers' mental health -- most recently from the United States surgeon general -- adding to many parents' fears about what all the time spent on phones is doing to their children's brains.
While many scientists share the concern, there is little research to prove that social media is harmful -- or to indicate which sites, apps or features are problematic. There isn't even a shared definition of what social media is. It leaves parents, policymakers and other adults in teenagers' lives without clear guidance on what to be worried about.
"We have some evidence to guide us, but this is a scenario where we just need to know more," said Jacqueline Nesi, a psychologist at Brown who studies the topic.
What counts as social media when it comes to teenagers' health?
The surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, warned last month that social media carried a "profound risk of harm," but he didn't name any apps or websites. His report acknowledged that "there isn't a single, widely accepted scholarly definition of social media."
Most studies look at platforms with user-generated content, where people can interact. But that raises a lot of questions. Does it matter if teenagers see posts from people they know or don't know? Does it make a difference if they post or just view? Do multiplayer games count? Dating apps? Group texts?
YouTube illustrates the challenge. It's the most popular site among teenagers by far: 95 percent use it, and almost 20 percent say they do so "almost constantly," Pew Research Center found. It has all the features of social media, yet it hasn't been included in most studies.
Some researchers speculated that YouTube may not have as many detrimental effects, because teenagers often consume it passively, like TV, and don't post or comment as often as they do on other apps. Or, researchers said, it may carry the same risks -- it offers endless scrolling and algorithmic recommendations, similar to TikTok. There is no clear data either way.
What don't we know?
Reviews of the existing studies on social media use and adolescents' mental health have found the bulk of them to be "weak," "inconsistent," "inconclusive," "a bag of mixed findings" and "weighed down by a lack of quality" and "conflicting evidence."
Research has not yet shown which sites, apps or features of social media have which effects on mental health. "We don't have enough evidence to tell parents to get rid of a particular app, or cut it off after a particular number of hours," said Sophia Choukas-Bradley, a psychologist and director of the Teen and Young Adult Lab at the University of Pittsburgh.
It's also hard to prove that social media causes poor mental health, versus being correlated with it. Most studies measure time spent on social media and mental health symptoms, and many, though not all, have found a correlation. But other researchers say measuring time spent isn't enough: In these studies, it's unclear if time on social media is the problem, or if it's time away from other things like exercising or sleeping. And the studies obscure, for instance, if someone is spending hours on screens to escape mental duress or to seek support from friends.
A few studies have tried novel approaches around these problems. One, early in Facebook's rollout in the mid-2000s, compared college campuses that had received access to it with those that hadn't, and found that its arrival had a negative effect on students' mental health.
A carefully designed study, Project Awesome at the University of Amsterdam and Erasmus University in Rotterdam, looks at both the average effects of social media on 1,000 teenagers it surveys and how they differ by individual, and follows adolescents over time. It has found that time spent on social media is less of a factor than teenagers' moods while using it.
Other studies have used brain scans to show that when adolescents looked at likes or frequently checked feeds, it activated brain sensitivity to social rewards and punishments.
What else does the research show?
"We most often find a small, negative correlation" between social media use and mental health, said Amy Orben, a psychologist who leads the Digital Mental Health Group at the University of Cambridge. "But we don't know what's underlying that. It could be that those who feel worse start using more social media, it could be that social media makes them feel worse, or it could be socioeconomic status or something else causing that link."
Overall, research finds that social media is not inherently beneficial or harmful, and its effects depend on individuals and what they see.
"We can't say, 'Don't do X, Y is fine, stay away from Z,"' said Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media. "Unlike TV or movies, it's impossible to know what children will see on social media ahead of time. Sometimes it's hair dye or dance videos, but sometimes it's white supremacy or eating disorder content."
Teenagers with certain vulnerabilities -- such as those with low self-esteem, poor body image or social struggles -- seem to be most at risk. One experiment found that exposure to manipulated images directly led to worse body image, particularly for girls more prone to compare themselves with others. Another found that using social media to compare oneself to others and seek approval was associated with depressive symptoms, especially for teens who struggle socially.
Social media often has positive and negative effects on the same person. Project Awesome found that its use is associated with higher levels of both depression or anxiety and happiness or well-being.
In a Common Sense report, teenage girls with symptoms of depression were more likely than girls without symptoms to say social media made other people's lives seem better than theirs -- and also more likely to say it enhanced their social connections. They found mental health resources on social media, as well as harmful suicide-related content. Overall, the largest share of girls said the effects of social media features were neutral.
Why isn't there more solid research?
Academic research takes a long time -- often years to get funding, develop studies, hire staff, recruit participants, analyze data and submit for publication. Recruiting minors is even harder. By the time a study is out, teenagers have often moved on to a different platform -- much of the research about specific platforms, for example, is on Facebook, which most teens no longer use. Tech companies have also not shared enough data to help researchers understand their products' impacts, the surgeon general's report said.
How could future studies be more conclusive?
Experts said they would like to see research that examines specific types of social media content, and things like how social media use in adolescence affects people in adulthood, what it does to neural pathways and how to protect youth against negative effects.
Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge, psychologists who have expressed great concern about social media's effect on teenagers, have proposed an experiment in which entire middle schools are randomly assigned to avoid social media or not.
What should parents do in the meantime?
Experts agreed that waiting for research wasn't an option. They also mostly agreed that some level of social media use was beneficial. "There are harmful negative developmental implications to not using social media at all, given this is where the social interaction happens," Professor Choukas-Bradley said.
Researchers said social media rules should depend on individual teenagers' maturity and their challenges, and said addressing the risks should also be the responsibility of tech companies and policymakers, not just parents. They agreed on a few steps parents could take now:
Set limits, especially around bedtime.
Don't give a young teenager a smartphone right away. Start with a smartwatch or a phone without internet.
Talk to your teenagers: Have them show you what they're seeing, ask them how it makes them feel and discuss privacy and safety.
Make a family screen time plan that takes into account which activities increase stress versus provide long-term satisfaction.
Model responsible internet use yourself.
It's not about monitoring certain apps, said Caleb T. Carr, a professor of communication at Illinois State: "Instead, parents should engage with their kids. Just like parents did pre-social media, talk about being good humans and citizens, talk about respect for others and themselves, and talk about how their day was."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A federal judge is deciding whether Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard can move forward. If it can, it would be the largest consumer technology deal in decades. If the judge delays the deal, Microsoft's lead lawyer said, the company may abandon it.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft last year to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing that the acquisition would harm competition by bringing together Microsoft's Xbox console and game streaming service with Activision's popular games, like Call of Duty. This month, the agency filed another suit in federal court, asking a judge to prevent the deal from going forward before the F.T.C. has the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
Microsoft says the Activision deal would be good for consumers, allowing them to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, for example.
The company wants to close the transaction by July 18. If the federal judge sides with the F.T.C. and sends the case to the in-house court, Microsoft's lead lawyers said, that will set off a "three-year administrative nightmare" that will sink the deal.
The clash is just the latest chapter in the F.T.C.'s campaign to curb the power of big tech companies. Under Lina Khan, its chair, the agency has sued Meta, Facebook's parent company, and Amazon over issues related to competition and consumer protections. These legal challenges haven't always been successful -- and the suit against Microsoft will be another test of the F.T.C.'s ability to deliver on its mandate.
"As you get closer to your destination, as you try to find that destination, you slow down even further."
Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, discussing the central bank's plans to continue raising interest rates but at a more moderate pace.
"It's going to quickly reverse all the progress that was made during the repayment pause."

"You can interrupt each other without being rude when you're in person. In a Zoom conversation, you have to let somebody finish their thought."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A reader is unsure how to respond to a child's wish to go by a different name after learning that the child's mother decided not to honor the request.
Our 14-year-old child has a great circle of friends. I am often their chauffeur. The kids and I have friendly conversations in the car. Recently, one of them informed the group they would like to be called a different name -- one that is typically associated with a different gender. The kids have obliged their friend, and I would be happy to, as well. But my wife told me that the child's mother said she wasn't going along with this request, though she didn't say that other people shouldn't. How should I proceed? I don't want to alienate anyone or damage friendships.
PARENT
I get your reluctance to come between parent and child. Here, though, it seems pretty low-risk to skirt the culture wars on transgender issues and chart a path of kindness. As a young teen, this friend is still a child -- but not a baby. We don't know whether the requested name change came after years of suffering or as an experiment. And the mother didn't ask anyone to adhere to her position. So, I would respect the child's wishes and create a family car in which everyone feels accepted.
Now, let's acknowledge that we know nothing about the child's mother other than what your wife reported to you. She may be working hard to accept her child, rejecting her child or waiting to see how things play out. Let's have compassion for parents who fall short -- every one of them does -- and for children who may be hurt by them.
As for you, be an ally. You are so peripheral to whatever drama is unfolding here that it's nearly impossible for you to go wrong. Be warm to the child when loved ones may not be. And be supportive of the mother as she processes what may be distressing news for her. Let's hope she rises to the challenge. If she doesn't, and you feel well placed to intervene, get back in touch.
Whether Hapless or Heartless, No Good Explanation
My boyfriend made an offhand remark that if I had looked the way I look now when we first met (a year and a half ago), he wouldn't have been interested in me. I was hurt and shocked. Initially, he made excuses, claiming that he was talking about my lifestyle since I started working long hours at a big law firm and that he was trying to motivate me to be healthier. But his remark was about how I look, and he knows I'm well aware of the five to 10 pounds I've gained. Eventually, he apologized. Still, I'm having a hard time getting over this. It shook my sense of security. He's usually a thoughtful guy and tells me I'm beautiful. Should I try harder to let this go?
GIRLFRIEND
Honestly, I don't see how you can let this go. Either your boyfriend's remark was true (and he is suggesting a weight cap for you regardless of the circumstances of your life) or it was mean (and meant to throw you off balance). It seems highly unlikely to me that he landed a direct hit by accident.
So, that leaves his apology -- which had better be good. Unless he is able to communicate how and why he hurt you, promise it will not happen again and ask sincerely for your forgiveness, dump him and don't look back. Many of us say hurtful things to our partners. When we do, it's on us to restore their faith in us. If your boyfriend can't do that, this relationship is unlikely to be a healthy one.
I Hugged Someone I'm Meh About: A Story of Survival
I am a grandmother who moved to be closer to my son, his wife and my grandkids. When we greet each other, we do so with a hug. When parting, we often say, "I love you." The issue: My daughter-in-law's mother, who lives nearby, is not the sort of person I like. She has a victim mentality and no life. She greets me with hugs, too. She thinks we're family. I think of her as someone to be tolerated. How should I handle her icky greetings?
IN-LAW
The audacity of this woman, playing the victim card when you are the true victim here -- forced to treat an extended family member like everyone else in the household!
You are in charge of who hugs you, of course. But are you really willing to create awkwardness and hurt feelings in your son's home for what seems like a "Mean Girls" flex? You're not under oath here! Maybe if you treated this other grandmother more kindly, she would feel more secure and act less like a victim.
Thank Goodness (And Nobody Else)
I keep granola bars in my car to give to people who are begging at stoplights. Often, the recipients say, "God bless you." As an atheist, I grimace. Religious people don't have a monopoly on acts of kindness. I would like to respond, "Let's leave God out of this." Can I turn this into a didactic moment?
ELIZABETH
Your gesture with the granola bars is so lovely and generous. Can't you let the needy recipients thank you in their own way and leave it at that? Also: Look up "didactic" in the dictionary. It often conveys a heavy-handed, patronizing manner that's better avoided.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

An obscure term recently used by the world's most valuable company in a product launch, probably in hopes that it inspires, rather than answers, questions.
This month, Apple unveiled its first headset for what most people would call augmented reality, virtual reality or, if you prefer, mixed reality. But none of those words are uttered in the nine-minute video about the device on Apple's website. Instead, it refers to "spatial computing," a "spatial operating system," "spatial experiences" and "spatial audio."
There's a reason Apple has eschewed the established terminology in favor of more obscure phrasing. And it's not because its device is doing something drastically different from headsets like Meta's Quest Pro or Microsoft's HoloLens, according to Marcus Collins, an advertising executive and the author of "For the Culture: The Power Behind What We Buy, What We Do and Who We Want to Be."
When it comes to spatial computing, Mr. Collins said, "no one knows what that is -- and that provides Apple the opportunity to define it."
Mr. Collins used an NFT as an example: If someone tells you about "a digitized receipt of membership," he said, you might ask follow-up questions like: What is that? How does it work? But if someone simply says, "I'm launching an NFT," you might refer to what you already know about nonfungible tokens and be more likely to say, "No thanks, I'm good."
It's not the first time Apple has strategically renamed a category. Before the App Store, for instance, people didn't talk about apps; they talked about "software programs." Nor is it the only tech giant to try the strategy. In 2013, Facebook used "graph search" to describe its version of, well, search. (It didn't become widely accepted.)
Jim Prosser, a communications consultant who has led teams at Twitter, SoFi and Google, said the intended audience for "spatial computing" might be investors and the news media more than consumers.
"They are pitching a product to people," he said. "For tech press, industry analysts and investors, they're pitching a concept."
The concepts of V.R. and A.R. have some baggage, including decades of sci-fi connotations, products by other companies that have not sold well and in the case of Google Glass, a derisive nickname for its users.
So are we heading into the era of "spatial computing"? As with all new buzzwords, that's not ultimately up to corporate marketing arms. It's up to people who might use it.
"We decide what is acceptable, what's not acceptable," Mr. Collins said. "That's how culture works."

U.A.W. Leader Rips Biden Over Battery Plant Plans
The president of the United Auto Workers, Shawn Fain, on Friday harshly criticized the Energy Department's plan to lend $ 9.2 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor and South Korea's SK On to build three U.S. battery plants.
Fain called the loan a massive "giveaway" with "no consideration for wages, working conditions, union rights or retirement security" that would help create low-paying jobs adding, "Why is Joe Biden's administration facilitating this corporate greed with taxpayer money?"
The wages of workers at battery JV plants are expected to be a key issue in contract talks that start next month with the Detroit Three automakers.
The $ 9.2 billion low-cost government loan for the BlueOval SK joint venture is the biggest ever from the government auto lending program that will help finance construction of three plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. SK is a unit of South Korea's SK Innovation. REUTERS

Dutch to Close Gas Field After Years of Shaking
Extraction from one of the world's largest natural gas fields will end in October, the Dutch government announced Friday, turning off a lucrative source of revenue that also sparked unrest by causing a string of earthquakes.
"The gas tap will be turned off on Oct. 1. That means an end to extraction after 60 years," Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.
Faced with mounting anger from residents whose homes were repeatedly rattled by the shallow tremors, the government had already wound down extraction from the field which held 2,800 billion cubic meters of gas.
Thousands of households are still waiting for their homes to be strengthened after years of shaking. Thousands more are awaiting compensation.
Groninger Bodem Beweging, an organization that represents residents in the region, called the announcement "a step in the right direction," but added it would not be celebrating yet and will continue to push for a definitive end this year with no possibility of more extraction. ASSOCIATED PRESS
SOCIAL MEDIA
Malaysia Says It Will Take Legal Action Against Meta
Malaysia's government said Friday it will take legal action against Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, for failing to remove undesirable and harmful content from its social media platform.
The Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission said Facebook has recently been plagued by "a significant volume of undesirable content" relating to sensitive issues on race, religion and royalty as well as defamation, impersonation, online gambling and scam advertisements.
The commission said efforts to reach out to Meta to remove harmful content were of no avail.
The commission said it will not tolerate abuse of online platforms for "malicious cyber activities, phishing, or any content that threatens racial stability, social harmony and defies respect for the rulers." Malaysia has nine ethnic Malay state rulers, whose role is largely ceremonial but held in esteem among the country's Malay majority. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Shahzada Dawood, 48, Father and Businessman: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Dawood, a British Pakistani businessman, was the vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a conglomerate owned by one of the richest families in Pakistan.
Shahzada Dawood, a British Pakistani businessman who was among the five people aboard a submersible journeying deep into the Altantic to view the Titanic, was killed when the vessel imploded during its descent to the ocean floor, the authorities said Thursday. He was 48.
His 19-year-old son, Suleman, who was with him on the Titan submersible, was also killed.
Mr. Dawood was the vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a business conglomerate headquartered in the Pakistani port city of Karachi that is involved in agriculture, energy and telecommunications. His family is known as one of the wealthiest business families in the country.
His work focused on renewable energy and technology, according to a statement from his family.
Mr. Dawood was born on Feb. 12, 1975, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. He studied law as an undergraduate at Buckingham University in Britain and later received a master's degree in global textile marketing from Philadelphia University, now part of Thomas Jefferson University. In 2012, he was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
His son was a business student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and had just completed his first year, a spokesman for the school said. Like his father, he was a fan of science fiction and enjoyed solving Rubik's Cubes and playing volleyball, according to a statement from Engro.
"The relationship between Shahzada and Suleman was a joy to behold; they were each other's greatest supporters and cherished a shared passion for adventure and exploration of all the world had to offer them," the family's statement said.
The pair's shared passion for science and discovery, friends and family said, led them to embark on the expedition to the wreck of the Titanic.
Travel and science were "part of his DNA," said Ahsen Uddin Syed, a friend of the elder Mr. Dawood who used to work with him at Engro.
A lover of "Star Trek" and "Star Wars," Mr. Dawood was also fond of nature and often traveled to faraway places and shared pictures of his adventures, Mr. Sayed said.
His Instagram profile is like a memory book of his love of travel and nature; it is blanketed with photos of birds, flowers and landscapes, including a sunset in the Kalahari Desert, the ice sheet in Greenland, penguins in the Shetlands and a tiny bird in London with the caption "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."
"Don't adventures ever have an end?" Mr. Dawood wrote in a Facebook post last year from a trip to Iceland, quoting Bilbo Baggins from "The Fellowship of the Ring." "I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story."
Khalid Mansoor, another former colleague of Mr. Dawood's, said that Mr. Dawood was a passionate champion of the environment. He was also a trustee at the SETI Institute, an organization devoted to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
In his role at Engro, the company statement said, Mr. Dawood advocated "a culture of learning, sustainability and diversity." He was also involved in his family's charitable ventures, including the Engro Foundation, which supports small-scale farmers, and the Dawood Foundation, an education-focused nonprofit.
"Shahzada's and Suleman's absence will be felt deeply by all those who had the privilege of knowing this pair," his family's statement read.
Mr. Dawood is survived by a daughter, Alina, and his wife, Christine.

Reddit's Chief Says He's Ready for It to 'Grow Up': [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For the past 11 years, Bucky has put time and effort into stewarding and guiding dozens of communities on Reddit, the sprawling internet message board.
As a "moderator" of roughly 80 different topic-based forums, Bucky -- who goes by "BuckRowdy" on Reddit and who asked that his full name not be used to prevent online harassment -- and others like him are essential to growing and maintaining the social media site, which is one of the internet's biggest destinations for online discussion.
Until two weeks ago, when Bucky revolted.
Reddit had just introduced changes that sharply increased its fees for independent developers who build apps using the company's data. Steve Huffman, Reddit's chief executive, positioned the move partly as a way to shore up the company's finances as it heads toward a long-awaited initial public offering.
But the changes made it so expensive for some third-party developers that a handful who build tools for Reddit's moderators had to shut down or significantly alter their apps. In protest, Bucky and other moderators closed down hundreds of forums on the site, effectively making Reddit unusable for many of its 57 million daily visitors. At one point, the site went offline entirely.
"It is really demoralizing," Bucky said. Being a Reddit moderator and dealing with users is already difficult, he said. "'I take all this abuse for you, and keep your website clean, and this is how you repay us?"'
Reddit, an 18-year-old site that was part of an early wave of social networking, has been trying to "grow up," Mr. Huffman has said in interviews. What is unclear is whether Reddit's community will let it.
Reddit, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent years tried to turn from a rough-and-tumble internet message board into a full-fledged social media business by adding executives and strengthening its advertising capabilities. The 2,000-person company -- which has repeatedly been mentioned as an I.P.O. candidate -- has raised more than $ 1.3 billion and is valued at more than $ 10 billion, according to Crunchbase and Reddit's public statements.
Other social media companies also made similar changes as they grew up. In 2012, Twitter tweaked its rules for how developers could use its data before it went public, outraging users and strangling some popular third-party apps. Facebook has similarly made platform changes that have irked developers and caused backlashes.
But this month's uprising at Reddit stands out because it shows the outsize power of the site's community. The day after moderators closed down hundreds of Reddit forums, users spent 16 percent less time on the site, according to estimates from Similarweb, an analytics company.
"Reddit is basically entirely community led," said Adrian Horning, a Reddit user and data scientist who built a bot that "scrapes" the site's data as a response to the fee changes. "The power regular users have is just inherent in the platform."
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Huffman said his goal had been to make Reddit better for newcomers and veteran users and to build a lasting business. He said he regretted that developers were surprised by the company's pricing changes and wished he had been more upfront about how the changes would affect them. He added that there was general anxiety over Reddit's changes as part of a natural "maturation process."
"We have the same love for Reddit, and the same fear of losing Reddit, that many of our users do," he said.
Mr. Huffman and Alexis Ohanian founded Reddit in 2005 as a site with a countercultural attitude toward the internet and its advertising-based economy. Reddit espoused free speech at any cost, zero ads and an insular culture that laid a foundation for Web 2.0's meme culture.
Its community has long been rambunctious, getting Reddit into hot water many times. In 2013, it was the site where internet sleuths searched for -- and misidentified -- the Boston Marathon bombing suspect. A year later, it became a dumping ground for nude photos that were hacked from celebrities' cellphones.
But as the site grew and venture investment poured in, its leaders saw the potential for Reddit to build a business. The company had several chief executives, including the former venture capitalist Ellen Pao, before Mr. Huffman -- who had left the company for six years -- was brought back in 2015.
Mr. Huffman eventually embraced the idea that Reddit could make money from advertising, a model he once loathed. He accepted and expanded upon rule changes instituted by Ms. Pao to contain some of the toxic content that people posted to the site. By 2021, he had confidentially filed paperwork to take Reddit public.
But when interest rates soared and the stock market wobbled last year, Mr. Huffman put Reddit's I.P.O. plans on hiatus. Since then, he has systematically worked to improve the site, grow the number of users and bolster the company's bottom line.
In April, Mr. Huffman announced that he planned to restrict access to Reddit's "application programming interface," which is known in industry parlance as A.P.I. The A.P.I. is the main gateway for outsiders to use the company's data for different purposes.
In an interview at the time, Mr. Huffman said he wanted to charge big companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook for access to Reddit data, which has been used to train so-called large language models that are at the heart of artificially intelligent systems.
But Mr. Huffman did not detail how the pricing for the A.P.I. access would change and who would be affected. Then in May, Reddit began telling developers its much higher pricing plans for such access. Early this month, one developer of a popular app, Apollo, announced that he was closing down the app because Reddit's changes would cost him more than $ 20 million in annual fees to operate it.
Many Redditors were deeply upset that Mr. Huffman had appeared to kill off a beloved app in service of building its business. Old-timers were also angry that the heady days of Reddit's anticapitalist roots seemed to be officially over.
Mr. Huffman defended the decision, noting that it costs Reddit millions of dollars to support apps like Apollo, which send no money back to the company and do not display ads from Reddit's advertising partners.
To express their unhappiness, dozens of "super mods" soon restricted access to hundreds of Reddit's most popular communities. To kill advertising across those communities, which are known as subreddits, moderators posted pornography and other explicit material to force the forums to be labeled "18+" forums, which are generally not advertiser friendly. Other forms of protest included a move by one subreddit, r/pics, to allow only photos of John Oliver to be shared in the forum. (Mr. Oliver embraced the Reddit protest, eventually sharing photos of himself as well.)
Mr. Huffman said he did not plan to change course. He said Reddit was enforcing its code of moderator conduct, which prohibits moderators from closing their subreddits and posting pornography and depictions of violence in their forums (unless the forums are designated for such topics of discussion). Reddit also said it would replace moderators who did not abide by the rules after being warned.
Bucky said the protests, which have simmered down this week, have now evolved into more general frustrations that have built up over time.
"Any time we see this kind of blowup, there's a simmering rage underneath the surface that comes back up," he said.
For now, subreddits seem to be returning online slowly, though there are still efforts to resist the changes. Bucky said he was active in the "Save3rdPartyApps" subreddit, which was formed to organize protests on the site that are allowed under Reddit's rules.
Reddit is now further away from a public offering than it was last year, Mr. Huffman said, but will continue building its business. He added that the community revolt was a part of what made Reddit Reddit and said he and his team planned to continue engaging with top moderators who were upset with the changes.
"For better or for worse, this is a very uniquely Reddit moment," he said. "This could only happen on Reddit."

Honoring an Ousted Leader With Flowers Gets Scores Arrested in Myanmar: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People across Myanmar wore flowers on Monday to show support for the jailed civilian leader. Since then, the ruling military has been rounding them up.
In military-ruled Myanmar, there seemed to be a new criminal offense this week: wearing a flower in one's hair on June 19.
Pro-democracy activists say more than 130 people, most of them women, have been arrested for participating in a "flower strike" marking the birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader who was ousted by Myanmar's military in a February 2021 coup. Imprisoned by the junta since then, she turned 78 on Monday.
The protest -- a clear, if unspoken, rebuke of the junta -- drew nationwide support, and many shops were reported to have sold all their flowers. Most of the arrests occurred on Monday, but they continued through the week as the military tracked down participants and supporters.
In some cities and towns, soldiers seized women in the streets for holding a flower or wearing one in their hair. Some were beaten, witnesses said. The police have also been rounding up people who took to Facebook to post a birthday greeting or a photo of themselves with a flower.
Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called the campaign the latest example of the "paranoia and intolerance" of Myanmar's military rulers.
"It's astonishing the junta hasn't figured out that such tactics are backfiring by redoubling people's determination to fully and finally push the military out of power, regardless of the cost," Mr. Robertson said.
The junta is facing an increasingly well-armed resistance from pro-democracy forces allied with rebel ethnic armies. The military has responded with brutal attacks on civilians, including airstrikes on public gatherings. More than 19,000 political prisoners are in custody, according to Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights group.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi received the Nobel Peace Prize as a dissident in 1991, and she is still widely admired in Myanmar, though her defense of the military's bloody crackdown on Rohingya Muslims when she led the civilian government tarred her image as an international human rights icon.
She spent 15 years under house arrest for advocating for democracy during an earlier period of military rule; this time, she is being held in a prison in Naypyidaw, the capital, serving a 33-year sentence on corruption and other charges her supporters say were trumped up. Her son, Kim Aris, said this week that she was being held in isolation.
In the southern city of Mawlamyine, one supporter of the flower strike said she was arrested in a florist's shop on Monday along with the owner and seven other customers, all women, moments after she arrived to buy a flower.
Taken to a police station, they were forced to sign a statement saying they had been wrong to participate in the demonstration and pledging not to discuss politics or Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi in the future, said the woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of being arrested again.
She and the other customers were released later in the day, the woman said on Thursday, but the florist was still in custody and her shop had been closed.
In London on Monday, Mr. Aris went to the Myanmar Embassy, where he tried to leave flowers and a birthday card addressed to his mother. The staff refused to open the door, so he attached the bouquet to a railing and pushed the card through a gap by the door frame.
In a video, he called on the junta to consider his mother's "advancing years" and let her return to the family home in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, where she spent years under house arrest. At the least, he said, she could be reunited with her dog.
"Even though she is well practiced at being alone, it is not something she should have to accept," he said.
Many of those arrested since Monday were targeted in a pro-military Telegram channel called Han Nyein Oo, which posts personal information about people who criticize the junta. Often, they are arrested within minutes.
U Kyee Myint, 78, a veteran human rights lawyer, has been in hiding since being named in the channel. He said by telephone that the arrests this week showed "that Myanmar is ruled by madmen and cowards."
"I am afraid that the girls who were arrested because they were found with flowers in their hair will be tortured in the infamous interrogation centers," he said.
A jewelry salesman in Mandalay, U Myint Naing, said that on Tuesday, the Telegram channel posted a call for the arrest of his 34-year-old son for writing "Happy Birthday Mother Su" on Facebook, alongside a photo of himself wearing a red rose over his ear. Hours later, he said, soldiers came to their door and arrested his son.
The soldiers said they were taking him to one of the junta's many interrogation centers, which are notorious for torture. He has not been heard from since, Mr. Myint Naing said.
"This was just a birthday wish for someone he loves," he said. "He is not harming anyone. How can the military be afraid of one person with a flower?"

Teresa Taylor, 60, Drummer for Butthole Surfers and a Face of Generation X: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In addition to playing with the audacious Texas band, she helped define the image of an aimless generation with her role in the 1990 film "Slacker."
Teresa Taylor, a drummer for the Texas acid-punk band Butthole Surfers who became an emblem of Generation X aimlessness and anomie with a memorable appearance in Richard Linklater's 1990 film "Slacker," died on Sunday. She was 60.
Her death was announced on Monday in a Twitter post by the band. The post said the cause was lung disease but did not say where she died.
Cheryl Curtice, her partner and caregiver, wrote on Facebook that Ms. Taylor "passed away clean and sober, peacefully in her sleep, this weekend."
Ms. Taylor, also known as Teresa Nervosa, addressed her long battle with what she called an "end stage" lung condition, which she did not identify, in a 2021 Facebook post.
"I don't have cancer or any harsh treatments," she wrote, detailing her daily use of an oxygen tank in a small apartment that had a television set mounted on a swivel fed by "mega cable," where she said she lived with her cat, Snoopy. "I know I smoked like a chimney and this is to be expected," she added. "My spirits are up."
As an irony-suffused iconoclast playing with one of the most irony-suffused and iconoclastic bands of its era, Ms. Taylor might have served as a handy mascot for a famously disaffected cohort even if she had not made a mark in the movie that gave a nickname to a generation.
She was born on Nov. 10, 1962, in Arlington, Texas, to Mickey and Helen Taylor. Her father worked for IBM as a mechanical engineer.
In her youth, she honed her skills with the drumsticks performing with marching bands in Austin and Fort Worth alongside King Coffey, who would later join her as part of Butthole Surfers' distinctive twin-drummer approach, playing in unison on separate kits.
She never considered drumming as a career. "It was like, because you were a girl, you didn't think of having any future in it," she was quoted as saying in the 2007 book "Women of the Underground: Music," by Zora von Burden.
She eventually dropped out of high school and met the singer Gibby Haynes and the guitarist Paul Leary, who had founded Butthole Surfers in San Antonio in 1981, while renting them space in the downtown Austin warehouse where she was living. In 1983, they invited her to join the band on a tour of California.
During Ms. Taylor's tenure, which lasted much of the 1980s, the band never scored a hit record. although it eventually found success atop Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart with the song "Pepper" in 1996. But mainstream acceptance was very much not the point -- as their name made clear.
Mixing a taste for Dadaism and Nietzsche with a cyclone-force howl, Butthole Surfers proved audacious even by punk standards. Concerts featured transgressive elements like naked dancers, bullhorns, garbage fires and morbid films of surgeries. "Their live shows were an assault on the senses," the music site Rock and Roll True Stories observed in a 2021 retrospective.
With its hand-grenade musical approach and black humor (the band's 1987 album, "Locust Abortion Technician," featured a cover image of eerily joyful clowns in greasepaint inspired by the costumes of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy), the band attracted an ardent cult following among Gen X ironists and hollow-eyed nihilists (not to mention Kurt Cobain of Nirvana).
As the decade drew to a close, Ms. Taylor left the band after experiencing seizures, which she attributed to the strobe lights the band used onstage. In 1993, she had surgery for a brain aneurysm.
Despite her exit from the band she had made her name with, her biggest taste of fame was yet to come.
In "Slacker," she made a memorable appearance playing an addlebrained opportunist wandering the streets trying to sell a jar from a medical laboratory with purported pop-culture significance. "I know it's kind of cloudy," her character insists, "but it's a Madonna Pap smear."
The film was an artfully ragged series of vignettes about young eccentrics, played largely by nonprofessionals, knocking around Austin. Premiering in the early days of "Seinfeld," it was a movie about nothing that captured the spirit of twentysomethings who, according to the clichés of the day, cared about nothing and aspired to nothing.
With her indelible appearance on the movie's poster and other packaging materials, Ms. Taylor became a face of her generation -- a slack-jawed youth, her skinny arms thrust into her pockets in a gesture both bored and rebellious.
"We talked about doing a drugged-out freak kind of character going on about Madonna," Ms. Taylor said in a 2001 interview with The Austin American-Statesman, recalling her experiences on set. "I had a rock-star attitude and a big ego. I demanded a hat and sunglasses for the scene. I did not want my face to be seen. And it became an image."
Ms. Taylor would go on to work at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired in Austin, according to The Austin Chronicle, and was writing a memoir about her time with the band.
Information about survivors was not immediately available.
As the years rolled by, her rock-star swagger may have faded, but not, it seemed, her sense of irony. "I am the ultimate slacker," she told The American-Statesman. "I'm on disability for depression, I get a check every month and I watch a lot of TV."

North Korean Defector Finds Audience on Right: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "The first thing my mom taught me as a young girl living in North Korea was don't even whisper, because birds and mice could hear me," Yeonmi Park told the audience that had come to hear her speak in Queens.
"This is what dictators do: they plant a spike everywhere, a distrust between people, a distrust between family, even. The teachers tell their children," she went on, "'If your parents say one wrong thing, come to tell the teacher."'
It was a story that Ms. Park has told often, on television sets and conference stages and in a best-selling memoir, over the decade she has spent as one of the world's most famous defectors from the Kim family's isolated totalitarian state.
But in recent years, she has added a new postscript.
"And now," she told the crowd in Long Island City last weekend, "I see the same thing in America."
Conservative pundits and politicians have long warned that liberal economics and cultural politics would set the United States on the road to leftist authoritarianism. But until two years ago, they had never had an ally quite like Ms. Park. A refugee from the world's most infamous surviving Stalinist state, Ms. Park, 29, claims to back up those worst fears with firsthand experience: comparing calls to dismantle racism in math instruction, for instance, with lessons she received as a child in North Korean schools.
Describing her own recent experience as an undergraduate at Columbia University, Ms. Park told the Fox News host Mark Levin in an interview last month that the school's pedagogy "is exactly what the North Korean regime used to brainwash people." Left-wing indoctrination in American educational institutions, she said, "is, I think, the biggest threat that our nation, and our civilization is facing."
She now denounces Hillary Clinton, with whom she once shared a conference stage, as an "absolute faker and liar," and rails against transgender-oriented marketing campaigns: "Political correctness has erased women," she wrote recently on Facebook.
Underscoring it all is the warning that these complaints add up to something vastly more sinister than the sum of their Fox News chyrons. "I think so many people in America think that somehow America is immune to tyranny, and somehow a dictatorship begins like North Korea," she said at the Queens event, hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA. "It didn't begin there. It began with amazing promises of equity. They promised a socialist paradise to us."
"And with that promise," she added, "they took everything, one by one, from us." The crowd gave her two standing ovations.
Ms. Park's transformation from celebrity defector to loud critic of liberal identity politics is extraordinarily rare. Very few of the tens of thousands of people who have fled North Korea wade into domestic politics in the countries where they have taken refuge.
But in an American political climate that rewards hyperbole and alarm, Ms. Park, who became a U.S. citizen in 2021, has found a lucrative niche.
Her second book, "While Time Remains," a self-described "warning for Americans" published in February, has already outpaced the hardcover sales of her best-selling 2015 memoir. She is a regular guest on popular right-leaning TV networks and podcasts, and speaker at conservative universities and think tanks.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This spring, she became a contributor to Turning Point USA, appearing at its conferences alongside figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and James O'Keefe, the right-wing activist recently ousted from Project Veritas.
Her recent trajectory has drawn winces from some past allies and supporters, who worry about the toll that her dive into the American culture wars may take on her effectiveness as a human rights advocate. And some observers of her career, noting her history of reinvention and questions raised about the accuracy of her account, have lifted an eyebrow at her latest act.
"She's an amazing entertainer," said Jay Song, a professor of Korean studies at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne in Australia, who studies the experiences of North Korean defectors. "She's very smart. She's always picking up on keywords."
A Celebrity Defector
In a recent interview, Ms. Park, who now lives in New York, described her own politics as less strident than they often appear in her media appearances. "I support gay marriage, I'm very socially liberal," she said. "I never thought I was a conservative." Asked whether she identifies as such now, she said no.
She likened the initial idea for her second book to Alexis de Tocqueville. "He comes from France to America -- to American democracy," she said. "So, like, what if a North Korean sees America and analyzes America?"
Ms. Park has lived most of her adult life in the glare of media scrutiny, in one form or another. Five years after escaping North Korea with her mother in 2007, at age 13, she was cast on "Now On My Way to Meet You," a popular variety show on South Korean television starring young women who had defected.
The program, which premiered in 2011, made North Koreans newly visible in South Korean popular culture. Ms. Park was one of its biggest stars, an effervescent personality who described her North Korean family as relatively affluent and was nicknamed "the Paris Hilton of North Korea."
"I think a lot of South Koreans learned a lot from that show," said Jean H. Lee, a journalist who reported from both North and South Korea for The Associated Press. "But it also created the celebrity defector culture."
In 2014, Ms. Park was invited to speak at the One Young World conference in Dublin, where she revealed a far darker story of her life in North Korea and of her escape.
Amid sobs, she said her mother had been raped by the human trafficker who brought them across the border into China, and described a flight on foot across the Gobi Desert into Mongolia. Later, she would say that she herself had been sold as a teenager to a Chinese husband. She had to work in an adult online chat room, she said, before she and her mother escaped from China.
A video of her short speech -- a horrific story delivered by a slight 21-year-old woman, wearing a traditional hanbok dress and trembling with emotion -- went viral, making Ms. Park an international humanitarian celebrity. Within months she had a book deal with Penguin Random House for a memoir written with Maryanne Vollers, Hillary Clinton's ghostwriter.
There were some noted inconsistencies among the stories Ms. Park had told to her South Korean audience and the ones she now told. Mary Ann Jolley, an Australian journalist, published a detailed account of conflicting and implausible details, from the government atrocities she described to the geographical details of her escape, her father's death in China and her experience in detention in Mongolia.
Ms. Park has disputed some of Ms. Jolley's criticisms but acknowledged others. Some were a result of language difficulties, she said, or the effects of trauma. She said others stemmed from liberties producers took with her identity on the show in South Korea.
"It was not a documentary," she said. "It was an entertainment show."
Ms. Park also said she resisted for years publicly divulging her full experience in China because of the stigma attached to it in conservative South Korea. "If I say I was a slave for two years as a kid, there's no respected family that would take me as their daughter," she said.
North Korea experts are quick to point out that Ms. Park's inconsistencies, while prominent, were not wholly unique. Ms. Song, who has interviewed numerous North Korean defectors, noted that the country's refugees are often unreliable narrators of their own experiences. Inside the country, she said, many learned to say whatever they needed to say to survive -- "whatever works for them to find a safe haven," she said.
But Ms. Lee said that the early questions surrounding Ms. Park's account of her escape, as well as her history of self-promotion, limited her impact in North Korea policy circles.
"It's a shame, because she has important things to say about what life is like in North Korea," she said. "But I think it's been clouded by a desire for attention or a platform."
Disenchanted With the Gala Circuit
When she wrote her first book, Ms. Park and her publisher were mindful of the skepticism Ms. Jolley's article generated, she said. Both she and Ms. Vollers have said they corroborated as much of the story as possible with interviews with family members and fellow defectors.
"In Order to Live" has sold more than 130,000 copies in hardcover and paperback combined, according to Circana BookScan. Ms. Park was showered with media attention, and she fielded invitations to private retreats hosted by Jeff Bezos and took selfies with Scarlett Johansson. She attended the Met Gala with Joe Gebbia, an Airbnb founder, and shared a speaking stage (at an event in partnership with The New York Times) with Mrs. Clinton, who looked her in the eye after her speech and "promised she would do everything in her power to help the women of North Korea," Ms. Park later wrote. (Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said neither Mrs. Clinton nor her staff who were present at the time recalled Mrs. Clinton saying that.)
In her new book, however, Ms. Park writes about being disenchanted by her brush with elites. They were more interested in emotional gratification than in action, she came to believe.
She began studying at Columbia University in 2016 and majored in human rights, in hopes of becoming a professional advocate. But some people who encountered her at the time recalled that she seemed to struggle with the transition from celebrity dissident to more policy-focused activism.
She tried to lend her star power to a group called Freedom for North Korea, which raised money for a sister organization in South Korea that rescued North Korean refugees from China -- her personal passion. But Jin Park, a former human rights activist who worked with her in the group at the time, said Ms. Park was unsuccessful in the role and soon moved on.
"We thought that she could be a good fund-raiser because of her connections and networks," he said. "I think she tried, but getting people's money is not as easy as it sounds." (Ms. Park says she quickly learned she was too busy for the role at the time.)
Peter Rosenblum, a professor of human rights law who taught Ms. Park in her senior seminar, recalled being unimpressed by her as a student. But he said he was sympathetic to her situation, as someone who seemed to be trapped by the persona that she had been cast in at a very young age.
"In the human rights world, you spend a career studying how people deploy victims' stories, and the degrading effect of having to be a professional victim," Mr. Rosenblum said. "I saw her very much as that person: the celebrity victim who was going to get her degree but hadn't had the time and space to become a real student."
By the end of her time at Columbia, Ms. Park says, she was disengaged from school and barely there, commuting to her classes from Chicago, where she was living with her then-husband -- an American trading firm executive whom she has since divorced -- and young son.
And at Columbia, she now says, she was quickly put off by a campus culture she describes as obsessed with safe spaces and pronouns.
"My classmates were almost like giant adult babies," she said.
In her book, she writes that she was criticized for her enjoyment of Jane Austen novels and Western classical music. She describes the First Amendment as "a law Columbia teaches its students to hate" -- though she does not mention that she studied at Columbia with Lee Bollinger, the university president and a prominent First Amendment scholar known for his expansive view of freedom of speech and for defending conservative and far-right speakers' prerogative to appear on campus. Ms. Park declined to comment on the contents of the class. Columbia declined to comment.
Shortly after graduating in 2020, Ms. Park was assaulted and robbed of her wallet while out walking with her son in Chicago. As she used her cellphone to record her assailant, a Black woman, she said another woman shouted at her for doing so and called her a racist. (The assailant was later arrested and pleaded guilty to unlawful restraint, according to court records.)
The incident, she wrote, was a turning point in her own politics, "a sign of how far advanced the woke disease really was in America by that point, and how inhumane it was making otherwise normal people." She began to seek out allies who felt similarly.
After reading a book by Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and popular conservative media personality, she sought out his daughter, Mikhaila, a podcaster and social-media lifestyle influencer, who invited her on her podcast. Hearing that Mr. Peterson was a collector of Soviet art, Ms. Park sent him a North Korean postcard she had saved.
Mr. Peterson invited her on his podcast, where she described her experience at Columbia. The interview led to a flurry of conservative media attention and, shortly thereafter, a $ 500,000 book deal with Threshold Editions, Simon & Schuster's conservative imprint. Mr. Peterson wrote the book's foreword.
'It's a Free Society'
Ms. Park maintains that her recent outspokenness has cost, not made, her money. The advance for "While Time Remains," while significant, was well short of the $ 1.1 million she received for her previous book. Invitations for well-paying corporate speaking events that used to make up much of her income have slowed to a trickle, she said.
She now earns $ 6,600 a month from Turning Point USA, she said, and maintains a busy itinerary of talks before other conservative audiences who are more eager to hear her warnings about "cancel culture" and "woke" identity politics. After a recent talk in Brookfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, a local school board member, Sam Hughes, posted on Facebook about the power of Ms. Park's presentation.
"The North Korean regime created schools not to teach children how to think, but what to believe," Mr. Hughes wrote, warning about the dangers "groupthink and collectivism." Considering his district's equity programs, "North Korea's example should come to mind," he wrote.
Jihyun Park, a North Korean defector and a Conservative Party politician in Britain, who knows Ms. Park, said that Ms. Park's trajectory rang true to her. North Koreans have particularly important insights into the perils of taking Western liberal democracy for granted, she said.
"The U.K. teaches me English and their culture, I've taught them freedom and democracy," she said. In the United States, "Yeonmi also does this," she said.
Ms. Song is more skeptical. She described Ms. Park as a perceptive reader, and reflector, of cultural and political expectations. "Her story in South Korea was a mirror of what South Korea was back then," Ms. Song said. "Now," she said, "it's a mirror of the contemporary U.S. politics, U.S. society."
Ms. Park, for her part, suggested that her latest turn might not be her last.
"I might write a completely different book in five years," she said. "I might say everything that I wrote in the second book was dumb. But that's O.K."
She laughed. "It's a free society," she said.

Microsoft Could Abandon Its Deal With Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Explosion and Fire in Paris Injure Dozens, Some Badly: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The origin of the explosion, which gutted a building in the Fifth Arrondissement and injured about 40 people, is still unclear.
Rescue workers combed through debris in central Paris on Thursday, a day after a powerful explosion ripped through a building on the Left Bank and injured about 40 people, several of them critically.
The authorities in Paris said that one person was still unaccounted for after the blast, which rocked the French capital on Wednesday evening and damaged much of the building, which was on Rue Saint-Jacques, in the Fifth Arrondissement, leaving a pile of charred wooden beams and stone rubble.
Official information about the identities of the victims was not immediately available. But the building was home to a small fashion and arts school known as the Paris American Academy, and on its Facebook page, the school said that its president, Peter Carman, had been hospitalized in Paris after the explosion and was in critical condition and under anesthesia.
The medical status of three professors was still unknown, but most of the students appeared to be safe, the school said.
The building also hosted the headquarters of the General Secretariat for Catholic Education, an institution that promotes Roman Catholic teaching in France.
The explosion started a blaze that hundreds of firefighters quickly brought under control. Most of the injuries were minimal, but the Paris prosecutor's office said on Thursday that six people were still in critical condition.
François Braun, the French health minister, told the BFMTV news channel that some victims suffered blunt-force trauma after they were thrown back by the blast, while others were injured by the flames.
"The most serious victims have extremely serious burns," Mr. Braun said.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the explosion, whose origin was unclear. Foul play is not a leading theory, but the authorities have not confirmed suspicions that a gas leak was responsible.
Many apartment buildings in Paris use gas for heating and other purposes, and although deadly explosions because of leaks are uncommon, they are not unheard-of.
In 2016, an explosion caused by a gas leak in the Sixth Arrondissement tore off the roof of an apartment building and wounded 17 people.
Three years later, a gas explosion destroyed a bakery in the Ninth Arrondissement. That blast killed four people, including two firefighters, and injured dozens of others, raising questions about the safety of the French capital's gas infrastructure and leading to a protracted investigation to determine the exact causes of the leak.
Reports by court-mandated experts in 2019 and 2020 faulted the Paris city government and the building's property management company for failing to properly maintain the building and the sidewalk in front. Those reports said that a gas pipe had ruptured after the ground in front of the building started to sink, creating a dangerous pocket of gas.
The city government and the building's property management company were both charged with manslaughter, but the case is continuing, and it is unclear if they will face trial. Last year, the city asked for a new report by a different group of experts, who have not yet revealed their findings.
Jean-Pierre Lecoq, the mayor of the neighboring Sixth Arrondissement, told Le Figaro on Wednesday that Paris's gas network was "fragile" and very disparate, alternating between newly renovated sections and aging, dilapidated ones.
Different authorities are also in charge of maintenance -- street pipes are handled by the city, for instance, while those inside a building are usually handled by property management -- adding to uncertainty about the overall state of the network.
Under rainfall on Rue Saint-Jacques on Thursday, security forces were holding a perimeter around the area of the blast, which rattled Parisians, with the initial noise and chaos reviving memories of the deadly terrorist attacks that struck the city in 2015.
Some people who lived in several neighboring apartment buildings had still not been able to return after being evacuated as a precaution.
Florence Berthout, the mayor of the Fifth Arrondissement, told BFMTV that three children were among those lightly injured but that 12 students who were supposed to have been at the site had left that afternoon to visit an exhibit with their professor.
The Paris American Academy is a small school established in 1965 for students pursuing a career in arts or fashion. It describes itself as the French capital's "first bilingual design school, located in the Paris Latin Quarter."
Nine students at the academy were from Kent State University, in Ohio, and were in Paris for a monthlong fashion class. All of those students are safe and will return to the United States a few days early, the university said in a statement.
"We are thankful and relieved to know that our Kent State students are safe and accounted for," said Todd Diacon, the university's president. "This incident occurred later in the day and the students had left the building for an off-site activity. Our thoughts are with the other individuals who were injured in the explosion."
Other French cities have also been hit by deadly gas-related explosions. In April, eight people were killed in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille after a violent blast destroyed a residential building.

A North Korean Dissident Defects to the American Right

“The first thing my mom taught me as a young girl living in North Korea was don’t even whisper, because birds and mice could hear me,” Yeonmi Park told the audience that had come to hear her speak in Queens, New York.
“This is what dictators do: They plant a spike everywhere, a distrust between people, a distrust between family, even. The teachers tell their children,” she went on, “‘If your parents say one wrong thing, come to tell the teacher.’”
It was a story that Park has told often, on television sets and conference stages and in a bestselling memoir, over the decade she has spent as one of the world’s most famous defectors from the Kim family’s isolated totalitarian state.
But in recent years, she has added a new postscript.
“And now,” she told the crowd in Long Island City last weekend, “I see the same thing in America.”
Conservative pundits and politicians have long warned that liberal economics and cultural politics would set the United States on the road to leftist authoritarianism. But until two years ago, they had never had an ally quite like Park. A refugee from the world’s most infamous surviving Stalinist state, Park, 29, claims to back up those worst fears with firsthand experience: comparing calls to dismantle racism in math instruction, for instance, with lessons she received as a child in North Korean schools.
Describing her own recent experience as an undergraduate at Columbia University, Park told Fox News host Mark Levin in an interview last month that the school’s pedagogy “is exactly what the North Korean regime used to brainwash people.” Left-wing indoctrination in U.S. educational institutions, she said, “is, I think, the biggest threat that our nation and our civilization is facing.”
She now denounces Hillary Rodham Clinton, with whom she once shared a conference stage, as an “absolute faker and liar” and rails against transgender-oriented marketing campaigns: “Political correctness has erased women,” she wrote recently on Facebook.
Underscoring it all is the warning that these complaints add up to something vastly more sinister than the sum of their Fox News chyrons. “I think so many people in America think that somehow America is immune to tyranny, and somehow a dictatorship begins like North Korea,” she said at the Queens event, hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA. “It didn’t begin there. It began with amazing promises of equity. They promised a socialist paradise to us.
“And with that promise,” she added, “they took everything, one by one, from us.” The crowd gave her two standing ovations.
Park’s transformation from celebrity defector to loud critic of liberal identity politics is extraordinarily rare. Very few of the tens of thousands of people who have fled North Korea wade into domestic politics in the countries where they have taken refuge.
But in an American political climate that rewards hyperbole and alarm, Park, who became a U.S. citizen in 2021, has found a lucrative niche.
Her second book, “While Time Remains,” a self-described “warning for Americans” published in February, has already outpaced the hardcover sales of her bestselling 2015 memoir. She is a regular guest on popular right-leaning TV networks and podcasts, and speaker at conservative universities and think tanks.
This spring, she became a contributor to Turning Point USA, appearing at its conferences alongside figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and James O’Keefe, the right-wing activist recently ousted from Project Veritas.
Her recent trajectory has drawn winces from some past allies and supporters, who worry about the toll that her dive into the American culture wars may take on her effectiveness as a human rights advocate. And some observers of her career, noting her history of reinvention and questions raised about the accuracy of her account, have lifted an eyebrow at her latest act.
“She’s an amazing entertainer,” said Jay Song, a professor of Korean studies at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne in Australia, who studies the experiences of North Korean defectors. “She’s very smart. She’s always picking up on keywords.”
A Celebrity Defector
In a recent interview, Park, who now lives in New York, described her own politics as less strident than they often appear in her media appearances. “I support gay marriage. I’m very socially liberal,” she said. “I never thought I was a conservative.” Asked whether she identifies as such now, she said no.
She likened the initial idea for her second book to Alexis de Tocqueville. “He comes from France to America — to American democracy,” she said. “So, like, what if a North Korean sees America and analyzes America?”
Park has lived most of her adult life in the glare of media scrutiny, in one form or another. Five years after escaping North Korea with her mother in 2007, at age 13, she was cast on “Now On My Way to Meet You,” a popular variety show on South Korean television starring young women who had defected.
The program, which premiered in 2011, made North Koreans newly visible in South Korean popular culture. Park was one of its biggest stars, an effervescent personality who described her North Korean family as relatively affluent and was nicknamed “the Paris Hilton of North Korea.”
“I think a lot of South Koreans learned a lot from that show,” said Jean H. Lee, a journalist who reported from both North and South Korea for The Associated Press. “But it also created the celebrity defector culture.”
In 2014, Park was invited to speak at the One Young World conference in Dublin, where she revealed a far darker story of her life in North Korea and of her escape.
Amid sobs, she said her mother had been raped by the human trafficker who brought them across the border into China, and described a flight on foot across the Gobi Desert into Mongolia. Later, she would say that she herself had been sold as a teenager to a Chinese husband. She had to work in an adult online chat room, she said, before she and her mother escaped from China.
A video of her short speech — a horrific story delivered by a slight 21-year-old woman wearing a traditional hanbok dress and trembling with emotion — went viral, making Park an international humanitarian celebrity. Within months, she had a book deal with Penguin Random House for a memoir written with Maryanne Vollers, Clinton’s ghostwriter.
There were some noted inconsistencies among the stories Park had told to her South Korean audience and the ones she now told. Mary Ann Jolley, an Australian journalist, published a detailed account of conflicting and implausible details, from the government atrocities she described to the geographical details of her escape, her father’s death in China and her experience in detention in Mongolia.
Park has disputed some of Jolley’s criticisms but acknowledged others. Some were a result of language difficulties, she said, or the effects of trauma. She said others stemmed from liberties producers took with her identity on the show in South Korea.
“It was not a documentary,” she said. “It was an entertainment show.”
Park also said she resisted for years publicly divulging her full experience in China because of the stigma attached to it in conservative South Korea. “If I say I was a slave for two years as a kid, there’s no respected family that would take me as their daughter,” she said.
North Korea experts are quick to point out that Park’s inconsistencies, while prominent, were not wholly unique. Song, who has interviewed numerous North Korean defectors, noted that the country’s refugees are often unreliable narrators of their own experiences. Inside the country, she said, many learned to say whatever they needed to say to survive — “whatever works for them to find a safe haven,” she said.
But Lee said that the early questions surrounding Park’s account of her escape, as well as her history of self-promotion, limited her impact in North Korea policy circles.
“It’s a shame, because she has important things to say about what life is like in North Korea,” she said. “But I think it’s been clouded by a desire for attention or a platform.”
Disenchanted With the Gala Circuit
When she wrote her first book, Park and her publisher were mindful of the skepticism Jolley’s article generated, she said. Both she and Vollers have said they corroborated as much of the story as possible with interviews with family members and fellow defectors.
“In Order to Live” has sold more than 130,000 copies in hardcover and paperback combined, according to Circana BookScan. Park was showered with media attention, and she fielded invitations to private retreats hosted by Jeff Bezos and took selfies with Scarlett Johansson. She attended the Met Gala with Joe Gebbia, an Airbnb founder, and shared a speaking stage (at an event in partnership with The New York Times) with Clinton, who looked her in the eye after her speech and “promised she would do everything in her power to help the women of North Korea,” Park later wrote. (Nick Merrill, a spokesperson for Clinton, said neither Clinton nor her staff who were present at the time recalled Clinton saying that.)
In her new book, however, Park writes about being disenchanted by her brush with elites. They were more interested in emotional gratification than in action, she came to believe.
She began studying at Columbia University in 2016 and majored in human rights, in hopes of becoming a professional advocate. But some people who encountered her at the time recalled that she seemed to struggle with the transition from celebrity dissident to more policy-focused activism.
She tried to lend her star power to a group called Freedom for North Korea, which raised money for a sister organization in South Korea that rescued North Korean refugees from China — her personal passion. But Jin Park, a former human rights activist who worked with her in the group at the time, said Yeonmi Park was unsuccessful in the role and soon moved on.
“We thought that she could be a good fundraiser because of her connections and networks,” he said. “I think she tried, but getting people’s money is not as easy as it sounds.” (Park said she quickly learned she was too busy for the role at the time.)
Peter Rosenblum, a professor of human rights law who taught Park in her senior seminar, recalled being unimpressed by her as a student. But he said he was sympathetic to her situation, as someone who seemed to be trapped by the persona that she had been cast in at a very young age.
“In the human rights world, you spend a career studying how people deploy victims’ stories, and the degrading effect of having to be a professional victim,” Rosenblum said. “I saw her very much as that person: the celebrity victim who was going to get her degree but hadn’t had the time and space to become a real student.”
By the end of her time at Columbia, Park said, she was disengaged from school and barely there, commuting to her classes from Chicago, where she was living with her then-husband — an American trading firm executive whom she has since divorced — and young son.
And at Columbia, she now says, she was quickly put off by a campus culture she describes as obsessed with safe spaces and pronouns.
“My classmates were almost like giant adult babies,” she said.
In her book, she writes that she was criticized for her enjoyment of Jane Austen novels and Western classical music. She describes the First Amendment as “a law Columbia teaches its students to hate” — though she does not mention that she studied at Columbia with Lee Bollinger, the university president and a prominent First Amendment scholar known for his expansive view of freedom of speech and for defending conservative and far-right speakers’ prerogative to appear on campus. Park declined to comment on the contents of the class. Columbia declined to comment.
Shortly after graduating in 2020, Park was assaulted and robbed of her wallet while out walking with her son in Chicago. As she used her cellphone to record her assailant, a Black woman, she said another woman shouted at her for doing so and called her a racist. (The assailant was later arrested and pleaded guilty to unlawful restraint, according to court records.)
The incident, she wrote, was a turning point in her own politics, “a sign of how far advanced the woke disease really was in America by that point, and how inhumane it was making otherwise normal people.” She began to seek out allies who felt similarly.
After reading a book by Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist and popular conservative media personality, she sought out his daughter, Mikhaila, a podcaster and social media lifestyle influencer, who invited Park on her podcast. Hearing that Peterson was a collector of Soviet art, Park sent him a North Korean postcard she had saved.
Jordan Peterson invited Park on his podcast, where she described her experience at Columbia. The interview led to a flurry of conservative media attention and, shortly thereafter, a $500,000 book deal with Threshold Editions, Simon & Schuster’s conservative imprint. Peterson wrote the book’s foreword.
‘It’s a Free Society’
Park maintains that her recent outspokenness has cost, not made, her money. The advance for “While Time Remains,” while significant, was well short of the $1.1 million she received for her previous book. Invitations for well-paying corporate speaking events that used to make up much of her income have slowed to a trickle, she said.
She now earns $6,600 a month from Turning Point USA, she said, and maintains a busy itinerary of talks before other conservative audiences who are more eager to hear her warnings about cancel culture and “woke” identity politics. After a recent talk in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, a local school board member, Sam Hughes, posted on Facebook about the power of Park’s presentation.
“The North Korean regime created schools not to teach children how to think, but what to believe,” Hughes wrote, warning about the dangers of “groupthink and collectivism.” Considering his district’s equity programs, “North Korea’s example should come to mind,” he wrote.
Jihyun Park, a North Korean defector and a Conservative Party politician in Britain who knows Yeonmi Park, said that Yeonmi Park’s trajectory rang true to her. North Koreans have particularly important insights into the perils of taking Western liberal democracy for granted, she said.
“The U.K. teaches me English and their culture; I’ve taught them freedom and democracy,” she said. In the United States, “Yeonmi also does this,” she said.
Song is more skeptical. She described Yeonmi Park as a perceptive reader and reflector of cultural and political expectations. “Her story in South Korea was a mirror of what South Korea was back then,” Song said. “Now,” she said, “it’s a mirror of the contemporary U.S. politics, U.S. society.”
Park, for her part, suggested that her latest turn might not be her last.
“I might write a completely different book in five years,” she said. “I might say everything that I wrote in the second book was dumb. But that’s O.K.”
She laughed. “It’s a free society,” she said.

South Korea to Eliminate Hard Problems on Exam: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The exam is notorious for extremely difficult problems, some of which seem to have little to do with the test topic. Even the president has complained.
Although the standardized test topic was the Korean language, the students had to answer questions about equity capital and risk-weighted bank assets. Problems on the "society" portion of the exam challenged them to decipher three-dimensional hypothetical analyses of Piaget's theory of cognitive development.
For years, high school seniors in South Korea taking the annual college entrance exam known as the College Scholastic Ability Test, or the CSAT, have faced what are commonly called "killer questions" -- extremely difficult problems that are seemingly incongruous with the section titles they fall under and that are sometimes outside the scope of the public education system curriculum.
The test, notorious not just for its rigor, has also long kept the private education industry booming. So-called cram schools are typically filled with students until well past midnight, and the stakes that come with acing the CSAT have fueled an intense rat race among students to enter the nation's best universities. Hundreds of thousands of students sit for the nine-hour exam, typically held every November.
But this week, after government officials complained about "killer questions," the head of the organization that administers the exam stepped down.
"I decided to take responsibility and resign," Lee Gue-min, the president of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, said in a statement on Monday. "We apologize for causing concern to the students and parents who have been having a hard time preparing for the exam."
Mr. Lee, whose term was set to run through February 2025, stepped down just days after government officials had raised concerns over the test including material not covered by the public school curriculum. Last week, President Yoon Suk Yeol asked that material not covered in public school be removed from the exams.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Education announced that it would drop the "killer questions" as a way to reduce families' reliance on private schooling and the financial burden that comes with that. The changes are set to take effect with this year's CSAT.
South Korea's private education sector has flourished over the past few decades, thanks to cram schools. Last year, families spent a whopping 26 trillion won -- around $ 20 billion -- on private education, a 10 percent increase from the year before, according to government statistics.
The exam has also been openly criticized by academics, who echo the government's concerns. "I was dumbfounded and angry," Kim Kwang-doo, a professor of economics at Sogang University in Seoul, wrote on Facebook in response to a CSAT problem. "Is there a high school student who could solve problems that are this difficult without the help of top instructors at private academies?"
The government's push to lighten the burden of private education costs might be a welcome move to some, but those in the private academy business say the effort might not make a difference.
Students attend private academies to prepare for test questions of all levels of complexity, not just the "killer" ones, said Kang Ho-nam, the executive vice president of a private math tutoring service based in Seoul that uses artificial intelligence.
"By changing the exam so close to the date, students will be even more anxious, leading to their continued enrollment in private academies," he said, adding that the CSAT was a comprehensive exam.
By eliminating the most difficult questions that students might typically get wrong, test takers will be subject to bigger point penalties for making mistakes on easier questions, suggested Koo Yong-hyun, a former private tutor who has helped prepare more than 50 students over the past decade for the CSAT. "Killer questions ensure that the efforts of the top students don't go to waste," he said.

Full text: Watching in real time as a neighborhood changes while trying to cling to its identity.
There's nothing better than finding your neighborhood in New York City. The place where you feel the most comfortable in your skin, where you feel immersed in the community and held close by its warmth. For me, as a Black woman, that is Bed-Stuy, where I've lived since 2015.
The Times would have me render it with the full name, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, but to me it is decidedly Bed-Stuy.
This is the best way I can illustrate how my section of this historically Black community has grown and changed: Along the first street I lived on, the trees were young and spindly, barely able to provide shade at the height of summer. Eight years later, they're taller and stronger, with lush canopies.
The restaurant scene has grown more lush, too. I remember when the only option near my apartment was BKLYN Blend, the Black-owned smoothie shop and restaurant. In the years since, it has taken over a small storefront next door and added a coconut stand.
I've watched as Tompkins Avenue has flourished into a rich collection of shops, bars and restaurants. On summer Sundays, when Open Streets shuts off the avenue to cars, it can become a party.
The neighborhood is teeming with Black-owned businesses. On Tompkins, the center of the action is the stretch between the coffee shop Sincerely, Tommy and the bar Bed-Vyne Brew. (On weekends, you can eat jerk chicken fresh off the grill from a vendor right outside Bed-Vyne.) The newish Brown Butter Creamery sits between them; its sister restaurant, Brown Butter Craft Bar & Kitchen, is down the street.
Nearby there's the family-owned Doctor's Cave Café. The menu changes constantly, and it's always good. The Council, on Nostrand Avenue, comes from the folks behind the Nigerian restaurant Dept of Culture, and makes a nice quick breakfast if you're looking for one. The Royal Rib House, open since 1968, might be one of the closest things Bed-Stuy has to a legacy restaurant.
That richness didn't happen by accident; it was created with purpose. During the restless summer of 2020, I would pass signs in the neighborhood reading, "What if Bed-Stuy was a Black utopia?" As a transplant, I feared it was a dream that maybe I didn't have the right to cling to, but wanted to nonetheless.
This spring, while looking for a new apartment, I realized how much change had taken place. Not just in the ever-rising rents but in this neighborhood's increasing appeal to people who have been priced out of neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Clinton Hill. I might qualify as someone who has contributed to the gentrification of Bed-Stuy, but I also look like I belong.
I was terrified that I might be priced out of that utopian dream. But I found a rent-stabilized apartment blocks away from my old place. I'm incredibly thankful.
I often find myself filled with anxiety. When a new restaurant or business opens in this corner of Bed-Stuy, I wonder: Is it Black-owned? If not, are the owners forming relationships and engaging with the Black community? Are they hiring people who reflect the neighborhood's history?
I sometimes see self-imposed segregation: One neighborhood split into two. Walk up Lewis Avenue past Peaches on a weekend morning and it's spilling over with Black and brown customers. Two and a half blocks up at Saraghina Pizzeria, it's a different story. I flit between both, depending on my cravings, but I feel a need to protect one.
Yes, I want to live in a Black utopia -- and in some respects, I already do. I'm creating it for myself by living here. I want the trees of Bed-Stuy to continue to grow fuller, but I don't want curb appeal to come at the expense of the neighborhood's identity.
I want to feel enveloped in Blackness without worrying that it is at risk. I want to hide this neighborhood away; I want everyone to know how special it is.

Tornado Kills at Least 1 in Mississippi as Heat Spikes: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The circumstances surrounding the death were not yet known. Weather officials believe multiple tornadoes may have struck the state overnight.
At least one person was killed and 19 others were injured after a tornado slammed central Mississippi overnight and destroyed up to 30 structures, the authorities said.
A tornado struck the town of Louin, about 70 miles east of Jackson, around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, said Eric Carpenter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson. Mr. Carpenter said that it was possible that multiple tornadoes had hit the area overnight but that survey crews were assessing the damage Monday morning.
Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said on Monday on Twitter that another tornado had hit the city of Moss Point, in the southern part of the county. "Please take caution," he said.
No injuries or deaths had been reported, the mayor of Moss Point, Billy Knight, Sr., said in an interview. Eight people were trapped inside a bank after its roof collapsed, but all of them had been rescued and were not injured, he said, adding that a church, high school and part of a baseball stadium had also sustained significant damage. "We've got a lot of devastation," Mayor Knight said. "The step now is that we're making sure all our people are safe."
Several of the city's roads were "impassable due to standing water, downed trees, and power lines," The Moss Point Police Department said on Facebook. Killed in the earlier tornado in Louin was George Jean Hayes, 67, who was transported from Jasper County to the Southern Central Regional Medical Center in Laurel, according to Don Sumrall, the Jones County coroner. Ms. Hayes was pronounced dead at 2:18 a.m. Monday.
That tornado damaged between 20 and 30 structures, according to Randy Johnson, the sheriff in Jasper County, which covers Louin.
"We had some mobile homes totally destroyed. Roofs off houses," Mr. Johnson said, adding "You know, just what you'd expect out of a strong tornado."
Most of the people with injuries at medical center in Laurel were in stable condition or had been discharged from the emergency room, Becky Collins, a hospital spokeswoman said, adding that more victims might arrive at the hospital later in the morning.
Gov. Reeves said on Twitter that emergency crews were conducting search-and-rescue missions in the region, using drones in "areas where it is impossible to get by vehicle due to downed power lines."
As of Monday evening, more than 370,000 customers across the South were without electricity, including more than 180,000 in Oklahoma and more than 29,000 in Mississippi, according to poweroutage.us, which compiles data from utilities. A tornado warning remained in effect for Tammany Parish in southeastern Louisiana. A flash flooding warning was also in effect for the parish, as well as for parts of Mississippi. More than 30 million people, mostly in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi were under an excessive heat warning.
In the damaged areas, residents -- many of whom were without power -- also had to endure excessive heat, Mr. Carpenter said, with the heat index near 105 degrees, and even higher in other places.
While people in Mississippi are used to high summer temperatures, during this time of year the heat index is usually somewhere in the 90s, Mr. Carpenter said.
"It's been really hot," he said, and with people outside, trying to clean up without power, "the heat is definitely a concern."
The temperatures are expected to go down to normal in the next couple of days. For now, some severe thunderstorm warnings remain in effect, as well as river flood warnings, because of the high amount of rainfall.
"Normal summer weather is hot anyway, what we're dealing with now is extra hot," Mr. Carpenter said.
Video and images of the damage in Louin showed fields destroyed, homes leveled and debris scattered on roads. One video circulating on social media showed emergency responders rescuing people from damaged homes in the middle of the night.
"It's been a very interesting weather pattern, especially for June," Mr. Carpenter said. "In this situation, the jet stream is unusually strong over the area and it's creating a springlike situation."
Mr. Carpenter said the fronts hitting the central part of the state have been consistent and have brought a barrage of chaotic weather, including flash flooding.
Sunday night's tornado occurred less than a week after severe storms swept across parts of the South, killing five people across three states.
"We're reaching the end of this crazy pattern," Mr. Carpenter said. "What we got last night we're hoping is the last really significant event we have to contend with."

G.O.P. Strikes At Researchers Into Deception: [National Desk]

Full text: A legal campaign against universities and think tanks seeks to undermine the fight against false claims about elections, vaccines and other hot political topics.
On Capitol Hill and in the courts, Republican lawmakers and activists are mounting a sweeping legal campaign against universities, think tanks and private companies that study the spread of disinformation, accusing them of colluding with the government to suppress conservative speech online.
The effort has encumbered its targets with expansive requests for information and, in some cases, subpoenas -- demanding notes, emails and other information related to social media companies and the government dating back to 2015. Complying has consumed time and resources and already affected the groups' ability to do research and raise money, according to several people involved.
They and others warned that the campaign undermined the fight against disinformation in American society when the problem is, by most accounts, on the rise -- and when another presidential election is around the corner. Many of those behind the Republican effort had also joined former President Donald J. Trump in falsely challenging the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
"I think it's quite obviously a cynical -- and I would say wildly partisan -- attempt to chill research," said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, an organization that works to safeguard freedom of speech and the press.
The House Judiciary Committee, which in January came under Republican majority control, has sent scores of letters and subpoenas to the researchers -- only some of which have been made public. It has threatened legal action against those who have not responded quickly or fully enough.
A conservative advocacy group led by Stephen Miller, the former adviser to Mr. Trump, filed a class-action lawsuit last month in U.S. District Court in Louisiana that echoes many of the committee's accusations and focuses on some of the same defendants.
Targets include Stanford, Clemson and New York Universities and the University of Washington; the Atlantic Council, the German Marshall Fund and the National Conference on Citizenship, all nonpartisan, nongovernmental organizations in Washington; the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco; and Graphika, a company that researches disinformation online.
In a related line of inquiry, the committee has also issued a subpoena to the World Federation of Advertisers, a trade association, and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media it created. The committee's Republican leaders have accused the groups of violating antitrust laws by conspiring to cut off advertising revenue for content researchers and tech companies found to be harmful.
The committee's chairman, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Trump, has accused the organizations of "censorship of disfavored speech" involving issues that have galvanized the Republican Party: the policies around the Covid-19 pandemic and the integrity of the American political system, including the outcome of the 2020 election.
Much of the disinformation surrounding both issues has come from the right. Many Republicans are convinced that researchers who study disinformation have pressed social media platforms to discriminate against conservative voices.
Those complaints have been fueled by Twitter's decision under its new owner, Elon Musk, to release selected internal communications between government officials and Twitter employees. The communications show government officials urging Twitter to take action against accounts spreading disinformation but stopping short of ordering them to do, as some critics claimed.
Patrick L. Warren, an associate professor at Clemson University, said researchers at the school have provided documents to the committee, and given some staff members a short presentation. "I think most of this has been spurred by our appearance in the Twitter files, which left people with a pretty distorted sense of our mission and work," he said.
Last year, the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana sued the Biden administration in U.S. District Court in Louisiana, arguing that government officials effectively cajoled or coerced Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms by threatening legislative changes. The judge, Terry A. Doughty, rejected a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March.
The current campaign's focus is not government officials but rather private individuals working for universities or nongovernmental organizations. They have their own First Amendment guarantees of free speech, including their interactions with the social media companies.
The group behind the class action, America First Legal, named as defendants two researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, Alex Stamos and Renée DiResta; a professor at the University of Washington, Kate Starbird; an executive of Graphika, Camille François; and the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, Graham Brookie.
If the lawsuit proceeds, they could face trial and, potentially, civil damages if the accusations are upheld.
Mr. Miller, the president of America First Legal, did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement last month, he said the lawsuit was "striking at the heart of the censorship-industrial complex."
The researchers, who have been asked by the House committee to submit emails and other records, are also defendants in the lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana. The plaintiffs include Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation, and Jim Hoft, the founder of the Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. The court in the Western District of Louisiana has, under Judge Doughty, become a favored venue for legal challenges against the Biden administration.
The attacks use "the same argument that starts with some false premises," said Jeff Hancock, the founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab, which is not a party to any of the legal action. "We see it in the media, in the congressional committees and in lawsuits, and it is the same core argument, with a false premise about the government giving some type of direction to the research we do."
The House Judiciary Committee has focused much of its questioning on two collaborative projects. One was the Election Integrity Partnership, which Stanford and the University of Washington formed before the 2020 election to identify attempts "to suppress voting, reduce participation, confuse voters or delegitimize election results without evidence." The other, also organized by Stanford, was called the Virality Project and focused on the spread of disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.
Both subjects have become political lightning rods, exposing the researchers to partisan attacks online that have become ominously personal at times.
In the case of the Stanford Internet Observatory, the requests for information -- including all emails -- have even extended to students who volunteered to work as interns for the Election Integrity Partnership.
A central premise of the committee's investigation -- and the other complaints about censorship -- is that the researchers or government officials had the power or ability to shut down accounts on social media. They did not, according to former employees at Twitter and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, who said the decision to punish users who violated platform rules belonged solely to the companies.
No evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts, even when the groups flagged problematic content.
"We have not only academic freedom as researchers to conduct this research but freedom of speech to tell Twitter or any other company to look at tweets we might think violate rules," Mr. Hancock said.
The universities and research organizations have sought to comply with the committee's requests, though the collection of years of emails has been a time-consuming task complicated by issues of privacy. They face mounting legal costs and questions from directors and donors about the risks raised by studying disinformation. Online attacks have also taken a toll on morale and, in some cases, scared away students.
In May, Mr. Jordan, the committee's chairman, threatened Stanford with unspecified legal action for not complying with a previously issued subpoena, even though the university's lawyers have been negotiating with the committee's lawyers over how to shield students' privacy. (Several of the students who volunteered are identified in the America First Legal lawsuit.)
The committee declined to discuss details of the investigation, including how many requests or subpoenas it has filed in total. Nor has it disclosed how it expects the inquiry to unfold -- whether it would prepare a final report or make criminal referrals and, if so, when. In its statements, though, it appears to have already reached a broad conclusion.
"The Twitter files and information from private litigation show how the federal government worked with social media companies and other entities to silence disfavored speech online," a spokesman, Russell Dye, said in a statement. "The committee is working hard to get to the bottom of this censorship to protect First Amendment rights for all Americans."
The partisan controversy is having an effect on not only the researchers but also the social media giants.
Twitter, under Mr. Musk, has made a point of lifting restrictions and restoring accounts that had been suspended, including the Gateway Pundit's. YouTube recently announced that it would no longer ban videos that advanced "false claims that widespread fraud, errors or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. presidential elections."

FRONT PAGE
A picture caption with an article on June 13 about NATO members conducting major air exercises in Germany as a signal of allied strength against Russia's invasion of Ukraine misidentified a fighter jet. The jet shown is a Saab Gripen, not a Eurofighter Typhoon.
INTERNATIONAL
An article on Sunday about the Taliban's reliance on the WhatsApp messaging platform misstated the parent company of WhatsApp. It is Meta, not Facebook.
An article on Monday about Ukraine's capture of Piatykhatky in the Zaporizhzhia region referred incorrectly to the advance. It is among the first villages recaptured in the region since the start of its counteroffensive, not the first.
ARTS
An art review of two exhibitions of the painter Bob Thompson's work referred incorrectly to one of the spaces, 52 Walker. It was established to focus on artists of all backgrounds, not only Black artists.
An article on Saturday about Art Basel and conditions in the art market incorrectly described Art Basel's Feature section. It has been presented at previous fairs; it is not new.
An article on Friday about Noah Horowitz, the new chief of Art Basel, misstated the nature of the relationship between Art Basel and the art fairs S.E.A. Focus and Art Week Tokyo. Art Basel offered consulting services to those organizations; it did not invest in them.
An article on Saturday about cutbacks at the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles misstated the year that Michael Ritchie stepped down as the Center Theater Group's artistic director. He retired in December 2021, not 2022.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on June 9 about the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson referred incorrectly to his parents. They were distant cousins, not first cousins.
An obituary on June 7 about the actor Peter Simonischek misstated the name of the character he played in the movie "Toni Erdmann." It is Winfried, not Winifried.
An obituary on June 2 about the sociologist Amitai Etzioni referred incorrectly to the Moral Majority. It was founded in 1979 and dissolved in 1989; it did not exist in the 1950s.

Targets include Stanford, Clemson and New York universities and the University of Washington; the Atlantic Council, the German Marshall Fund and the National Conference on Citizenship, all nonpartisan, nongovernmental organizations in Washington; the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco; and Graphika, a company that researches disinformation online.
In a related line of inquiry, the committee has also issued a subpoena to the World Federation of Advertisers, a trade association, and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media it created. The committee’s Republican leaders have accused the groups of violating antitrust laws by conspiring to cut off advertising revenue for content researchers and tech companies found to be harmful.
The committee’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a close ally of Trump, has accused the organizations of “censorship of disfavored speech” involving issues that have galvanized the Republican Party: the policies around the COVID-19 pandemic and the integrity of the American political system, including the outcome of the 2020 election.
Much of the disinformation surrounding both issues has come from the right. Many Republicans are convinced that researchers who study disinformation have pressed social media platforms to discriminate against conservative voices.
Those complaints have been fueled by Twitter’s decision under its new owner, Elon Musk, to release selected internal communications between government officials and Twitter employees. The communications show government officials urging Twitter to take action against accounts spreading disinformation but stopping short of ordering them to do, as some critics claimed.
Patrick L. Warren, an associate professor at Clemson University, said researchers at the school have provided documents to the committee, and given some staff members a short presentation. “I think most of this has been spurred by our appearance in the Twitter files, which left people with a pretty distorted sense of our mission and work,” he said.
Last year, the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana sued the Biden administration in U.S. District Court in Louisiana, arguing that government officials effectively cajoled or coerced Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms by threatening legislative changes. The judge, Terry A. Doughty, rejected a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March.
The current campaign’s focus is not government officials but rather private individuals working for universities or nongovernmental organizations. They have their own First Amendment guarantees of free speech, including their interactions with the social media companies.
The group behind the class action, America First Legal, named as defendants two researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, Alex Stamos and Renée DiResta; a professor at the University of Washington, Kate Starbird; an executive of Graphika, Camille François; and the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, Graham Brookie.
If the lawsuit proceeds, they could face trial and, potentially, civil damages if the accusations are upheld.
Miller, the president of America First Legal, did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement last month, he said the lawsuit was “striking at the heart of the censorship-industrial complex.”
The researchers, who have been asked by the House committee to submit emails and other records, are also defendants in the lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana. The plaintiffs include Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation, and Jim Hoft, the founder of the Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site. The court in the Western District of Louisiana has, under Doughty, become a favored venue for legal challenges against the Biden administration.
The attacks use “the same argument that starts with some false premises,” said Jeff Hancock, the founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab, which is not a party to any of the legal action. “We see it in the media, in the congressional committees and in lawsuits, and it is the same core argument, with a false premise about the government giving some type of direction to the research we do.”
The House Judiciary Committee has focused much of its questioning on two collaborative projects. One was the Election Integrity Partnership, which Stanford and the University of Washington formed before the 2020 election to identify attempts “to suppress voting, reduce participation, confuse voters or delegitimize election results without evidence.” The other, also organized by Stanford, was called the Virality Project and focused on the spread of disinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
Both subjects have become political lightning rods, exposing the researchers to partisan attacks online that have become ominously personal at times.
In the case of the Stanford Internet Observatory, the requests for information — including all emails — have even extended to students who volunteered to work as interns for the Election Integrity Partnership.
A central premise of the committee’s investigation — and the other complaints about censorship — is that the researchers or government officials had the power or ability to shut down accounts on social media. They did not, according to former employees at Twitter and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, who said the decision to punish users who violated platform rules belonged solely to the companies.
No evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts, even when the groups flagged problematic content.
“We have not only academic freedom as researchers to conduct this research but freedom of speech to tell Twitter or any other company to look at tweets we might think violate rules,” Hancock said.
The universities and research organizations have sought to comply with the committee’s requests, though the collection of years of emails has been a time-consuming task complicated by issues of privacy. They face mounting legal costs and questions from directors and donors about the risks raised by studying disinformation. Online attacks have also taken a toll on morale and, in some cases, scared away students.
In May, Jordan threatened Stanford with unspecified legal action for not complying with a previously issued subpoena, even though the university’s lawyers have been negotiating with the committee’s lawyers over how to shield students’ privacy. (Several of the students who volunteered are identified in the America First Legal lawsuit.)
The committee declined to discuss details of the investigation, including how many requests or subpoenas it has filed in total. Nor has it disclosed how it expects the inquiry to unfold — whether it would prepare a final report or make criminal referrals and, if so, when. In its statements, though, it appears to have already reached a broad conclusion.
“The Twitter files and information from private litigation show how the federal government worked with social media companies and other entities to silence disfavored speech online,” a spokesperson, Russell Dye, said in a statement. “The committee is working hard to get to the bottom of this censorship to protect First Amendment rights for all Americans.”
The partisan controversy is having an effect on not only the researchers but also the social media giants.
Twitter, under Musk, has made a point of lifting restrictions and restoring accounts that had been suspended, including the Gateway Pundit’s. YouTube recently announced that it would no longer ban videos that advanced “false claims that widespread fraud, errors or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. presidential elections.”

The Titanic Truthers of TikTok: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The finer details of what happened to the RMS Titanic differ depending on who is telling the story.
The iceberg that collided with the luxury liner was spotted at 11:40 p.m., according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, or 11:35 p.m., which is what an exhibition about the ship in New York claims. The Royal Museums Greenwich in Britain says the doomed vessel cost 1,503 people their lives, while the Smithsonian in the United States claims that 1,522 passengers and crew died.
Historians have attributed the variance to factors like imperfect ticketing lists and rushed head counts transmitted using weak signals. The broad strokes, however, are not in question. All credible experts agree that on April 15, 1912, less than a week into its maiden voyage, the Titanic ended up at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean.
More than a century later, on TikTok, a far different version has been circulating. In a post that garnered more than 11 million views before it was removed earlier this year, one user wrote: "the titanic never sank!!!"
On the short-form video app, long-established facts about the crash are being newly litigated as musty rumors merge with fresh misinformation and manipulated content -- a demonstration of TikTok's potent ability to seed historical revisionism about even the most deeply studied cases.
One 32-second post opens with a dramatic black-and-white drawing of the Titanic, its stern straining above waves studded with people, set to a spooky synthesizer tune. A man in a hoodie and a backward baseball cap, crudely green-screened into the frame, makes a familiar argument (accompanied by an emoji of a screaming face): "The Titanic NEVER actually sank." Looking into the camera, he repeats the so-called and exhaustively disproved "swap" theory -- that the ruins on the seabed belong to the Titanic's older and decrepit sister ship, the Olympic, scuttled in an attempt at insurance fraud.
Another video presents a conspiracy theory that the wreck was a "hit job" ordered by the financier J.P. Morgan -- whose real name was John Pierpont Sr. -- to eliminate opponents of the Federal Reserve.
Titanic skepticism has irritated scholars of the ship since it sank. Then, in December, came the 25th anniversary of the 1997 film "Titanic," the costly and heartthrob-minting epic that laid a swooning romance over a fictionalized depiction of the disaster.
The celebration included a rerelease of the film in theaters just before Valentine's Day. There was also a flurry of news reports about James Cameron, the director, working with scientists and stunt people to resolve a persistent debate about a pivotal scene in the movie, which centered on how many star-crossed lovers could survive on a door floating in freezing ocean water. (Tests showed that two could have, in fact, managed.)
Mr. Cameron's experiments seemed to add fuel to a raft of TikTok conspiracy theories about the actual Titanic -- many of them patched together from a grab bag of suppositions and misinterpreted evidence and posted in quippy online installments.
"It becomes kind of deflating to see a lot of this junk coming out," said Charles A. Haas, a founder of the Titanic International Society who has spent six decades studying the ill-fated vessel. He co-wrote five books on the topic, dived down to the wreck site twice and debunked more conspiracy theories than he cares to count. "I feel like one of the very few voices crying out against the sound of a hurricane."
The Titanic International Society, one of several historical organizations worldwide dedicated to Titanic study, has Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts but no presence on TikTok. Mr. Haas attributed the decision in part to the fear that TikTok's reputation as "kind of a wild and woolly place" would taint any serious research shared on the platform.
"If you have a wonderful piece of filet mignon and you wrap it in smelly fish, the filet mignon after a while doesn't smell so good either," he said.
TikTok is just the latest recycling bin for false narratives about the Titanic, which began circulating almost as soon as the ship had sunk.
A month after the wreck, The Washington Post raised the possibility that the tragedy stemmed from the "ancient malice" of a mummified Egyptian priestess, who cursed an editor after he dared to tell her story to fellow Titanic passengers. Others have tried, unconvincingly, to pin the high death toll on Winston Churchill, a German submarine, sabotage-minded Catholic shipbuilders or decks that could be electromagnetically sealed to prevent passengers below from escaping. The Freemasons were accused of orchestrating a cover-up.
Such conspiracy theories are a fount of deep and familiar exasperation for Mr. Haas, fueled by years of weary disbelief that tall tales about an extensively documented disaster can continue to find audiences through books, so-called documentaries and now, a video app.
"The sad part is that many of the people following this sort of thing are teenagers, and they are woefully unwilling to do digging," he said.
TikTok, which claims to have 150 million American users and is particularly popular with youths, has become an especially powerful vector for misinformation, past and present. A period of violent dictatorship in the Philippines decades ago was recently recast on TikTok as a rosy time of economic growth. A pawnshop owner on the app claimed last year to have an album of previously unseen images of the Rape of Nanjing in 1937, but later said that the disturbing photos, which drew nearly 52 million views, were actually "reproduction souvenirs" from Shanghai.
Like other social media platforms, TikTok has tried to tamp down some harmful historical falsehoods, such as efforts to deny the Holocaust, while working to combat more modern lies about elections, health hacks and other topics. (The company, which is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, has also been fighting for its future in the United States amid national security concerns.)
"Our priority is to protect our community, which is why we remove misinformation that will cause significant harm and work with independent fact checkers to help assess the accuracy of content on our platform," said Ben Rathe, a spokesman for TikTok. According to its guidelines, the company prevents some videos with conspiracy theories from showing up in feeds, like those that claim "covert or powerful groups" carried out events. But the app doesn't block these videos altogether.
While many of the young users on TikTok can recognize and poke fun at conspiracy theories, the generation also struggles with understanding the past. Proficiency in U.S. history among eighth graders has declined every year since 2014, according to one federal gauge. Another poll last year asked whether NASA astronauts had landed on the moon -- nearly half of the participants who were born after 1997 said they had not or that they were unsure.
In a recent survey of young Americans who use TikTok for more than an hour a day, 17 percent "couldn't say definitively that the Earth is round," according to the Reboot Foundation, a Paris-based nonprofit that promotes media literacy and critical thinking.
"Fundamentally, a 14-year-old is probably taught at school that the Earth is round and probably believes it, but with the frequency of watching videos over and over, they start questioning it," said Helen Lee Bouygues, who started the Reboot Foundation to help fight misinformation. She said the group saw that "the longer young adults were on TikTok, the more that they believe what they see."
Misinformation experts say that TikTok's algorithm and the personalized feeds it creates for users can make it particularly powerful for spreading conspiracy theories. To show content to users, the system relies less on social connections and followers, like on Twitter and Facebook, and more on engagement, said Megan Brown, a senior research engineer at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics.
"If someone is spending time on a video, it doesn't matter if they really believe J.P. Morgan sank the Titanic, or if they believe, hey, this is a funny video, someone is talking about J.P. Morgan sinking the Titanic," Ms. Brown said. "This is the same signal as far as TikTok is concerned, so they recommend more of that content."
Mr. Morgan, whose White Star Line owned the Titanic, figures prominently in Titanic lore. TikTok videos repeat decades-old claims that the millionaire backed out of a planned trip on the Titanic minutes or hours before it set sail because he intended to use the ship to assassinate powerful enemies onboard who opposed his efforts to create a centralized banking system. (In some tellings, TikTok creators have recast the villains as the wealthy Rothschild family or even the Catholic order of the Jesuits.)
Experts point out that the historical record and common sense do not support such assertions. Evidence suggests that Mr. Morgan failed to make his date with the Titanic because he was dealing with an unexpected situation involving his European art collection. The businessman would also have had to ensure that the Titanic would strike an iceberg with catastrophic force, and that his opponents were not among the more than 700 people who survived the crash.
Of course, history is not set in stone -- especially when record-keeping was less technologically advanced -- and experts often disagree. Parks Stephenson, a Navy veteran who has visited the wreckage multiple times and advised Mr. Cameron on a 2003 documentary about the ship, conflicts with many fellow Titanic scholars in his belief that the iceberg damaged the ship's bottom rather than its side.
The consensus, though, is this: The Titanic sank in a terrible accident and many people died. Acknowledging the ship's true fate allows the tragedy to become a valuable tool, Mr. Stephenson said: a way to understand communications failures, improvements in safety regulations, oceanic science, underwater forensics and hubris and heroism in times of crisis.
"On a grand scale, the study of history keeps you from repeating the mistakes that were made in the past and, continually, moving forward," said Mr. Stephenson, who is now the executive director of the USS Kidd Veterans Museum.
Titanic conspiracy theories may seem relatively harmless, especially in a modern environment where online lies have enabled real-world harm, such as an attack on the Capitol or a gunman in a pizzeria. Untrue rumors about a 111-year-old shipwreck fall into something of a gap for social media companies, which are already struggling to address contemporary falsehoods with content moderators.
Ms. Brown said that the concern was a longer-term erosion of the truth and the idea that "people who believe in at least one conspiracy theory tend to believe in at least more than one."
Hooking someone with one false narrative makes it easier to snare them with another, she said: "Hey, if you heard this about the Titanic, then you won't believe this other cover-up."
In the absence of TikTok intervention, some users have taken matters into their own hands.
Rafael Avila, 33, a tech consultant for IBM, is known in his spare time as "Titanic Guy" on TikTok, where he has amassed more than 600,000 followers since 2020 and frequently posts videos debunking conspiracy theories about the shipwreck.
"These theories have always been around inside the Titanic community, but they've sort of been on the fringe," said Mr. Avila, who lives in Toronto and has been obsessed with the Titanic since childhood. TikTok changed that, he said. "When the first couple of videos were made about the Olympic theory, the Federal Reserve theory, the algorithm picked up on that, seeing that people were engaging with that, and then it started exploding."
While Mr. Avila had joined the app to share his passion for the Titanic story, he quickly added debunking videos to his repertoire, using TikTok's easy-to-use editing tools -- like the ability to "stitch" or "duet" videos that promote bogus ideas to fact-check them. Now, his followers often tag him whenever a Titanic conspiracy theory video goes viral, so he can roll up his sleeves and film the facts. The TikTok videos with the truth don't receive as many views as the intrigue-filled conspiracy theories, but they can still attract millions of eyeballs, he said.
"My community of Titanic nerds look to me to correct the record, so I've taken it on as my responsibility," he said. "It's the internet, people can say whatever they want."

Full text: After her sister-in-law spent the money from the sale of her parents' house on upgrades to her own, a reader bristles at being made to feel she must chip into costs for their care.
My husband's elderly parents moved in with my sister-in-law. Their house was sold, and my sister-in-law used the proceeds to add a bedroom and upgrade a bathroom for them at her house. (There was an extra bedroom in the house, but no bathroom on that floor.) My husband asked my sister-in-law not to make these improvements; he suggested hiring aides to come to the house, instead. But she went ahead and spent all the money. Now, my father-in-law has been diagnosed with dementia and needs lots of additional care. We are being made to feel that we have to pitch in financially. How would you approach this dilemma?
WIFE
I happen to have plenty of experience helping an older parent who is unable to stay in her home. The loss of independence can be difficult for everyone. So, my impulse here is to focus on the people -- not the architectural upgrades.
For starters, I see your sister-in-law's invitation to her parents as a loving one. Taking in older relatives requires a substantial amount of work. If you or anyone else offered to do so, you don't mention it. And unless your husband's proposal was for round-the-clock help -- which costs a fortune -- asking older people (who feel the need to move in with relatives) to climb stairs unassisted every time they need the bathroom is probably unsafe.
Now, it's hard to believe that adding a single bedroom and upgrading a bathroom ate up all the proceeds of your in-laws' home sale. But that's beside the point now. Even if your father-in-law were to move to a memory-care facility, your mother-in-law would still need a place to live -- which she has, thanks to your sister-in-law. So, help or don't help with the new expenses. That's your call. But don't base your decision on complaints about your sister-in-law's home improvements. Her behavior seems sound enough to me.
Going All Out for the Big 0-5
Our daughter is turning 5. We've rented a covered pavilion at a public park for her birthday party. The guest list of children alone is pushing 50, and you can safely double that number if you include their adult companions. I feel strongly that we should invite every child in her class, so no one feels left out. My partner agrees, but he wants to limit food to light refreshment for budgetary reasons, and he insists we include a "no presents" request on the invitation. I'm torn: I don't want guests to be hungry, and I find that "no presents" invitations make some people uncomfortable and come off as snooty. ("We don't need your gift.") Advice?
MOM
Is it possible that you haven't been to many children's parties yet? As much as I applaud your desire to be inclusive, placing a 5-year-old at the center of 100 guests seems ill advised. Your daughter may be overwhelmed. There's good reason for the rule of thumb about limiting the number of party guests to a young child's age plus one or two. Still, you know the birthday girl best.
As for food, "light refreshment" seems fine, especially if the party lasts for a sensible two hours. (Any longer than that is inviting meltdowns!) And I agree that some guests may feel uncomfortable with a "no gift" request. That's their problem. It's not snooty in the least, and hardly an argument for hauling 50 presents home. If there's still time here, think smaller.
Smuggling Your Fix Across State Lines
I visit a close friend in another state twice a year. She is an herbal tea drinker and doesn't keep coffee or coffee-making supplies in her house. But I am chemically dependent on my morning coffee. (Without it, I develop headaches and feel groggy.) Normally, I would slip out to buy a coffee, but my friend lives in the suburbs and the nearest coffee place is quite a distance away. Would it be OK to ask her gently to stock coffee for my visit? I don't want to be rude, and she's mindful of her fixed income.
FRIEND
Making guests feel comfortable is certainly an important part of hosting. But keep in mind the full roster of your host's duties: providing meals, laundering sheets and towels, and cleaning the guest bathroom. I'd skip the special requests if I were you. There are good brands of instant coffee on the market these days. (Just add boiling water!) Pack some in your overnight bag and solve your (extremely relatable) caffeine problem on your own.
Generosity Can Be Its Own Gift
When I got married a few years ago, my cousin attended the wedding but didn't give us a gift. Now it is she who is getting married -- at an exotic location, no less. I intend to go, but I'm not sure what to do about a gift: get over it or match the nonexistent present I received.
COUSIN
Which image of yourself do you like better: holding a grudge for years against a cousin who celebrated your wedding with you but didn't give a gift, or behaving generously toward her? If you're not sure how to answer the question, skip the wedding. Her joyful day is not for you. And if you choose the grudge: I understand your feelings, but your choice is making you small. Be bigger when you can.

In Tunisia, Mourning Hard-Fought Freedom Rapidly Slipping Away: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When reflecting on their Arab Spring revolution, Tunisians often say that freedom of expression was the only concrete achievement. As the country slides back toward autocracy, that, too, is being quickly eroded.
Mosaïque FM, Tunisia's most popular radio station, comes to life each morning around 5:30 a.m. with the martial strains of the national anthem. Next comes a voice crooning a verse from the Quran, then music and news, followed by the political show "Watch What They Say," which has chronicled the floundering of the country's young democracy and its recent U-turn toward autocracy.
The show's host, Hajer Tlili, says she specializes in catching politicians out in their inconsistencies and hypocrisies. But lately, it has been Ms. Tlili who has had to consider what she says.
The director of Mosaïque, an independent station, was jailed from February to May. One of its reporters has been sentenced to five years in prison; two more have been interrogated over criticizing the government.
"Every day I've thought, 'I could be next,"' said Ms. Tlili, 36. "But I've kept working as usual. I love my job. I can't go back to dictatorship again."
It was the first time she had felt that way, she said, since her earliest days in journalism, just after Tunisia overthrew its longtime dictator in 2011, inspiring a wave of uprisings across the Arab world.
That ushered in a decade-long experiment with democracy that many called the greatest achievement of the Arab Spring. Young Tunisians like Ms. Tlili flung themselves into politics, activism and media in a frothy rush of excitement, like champagne spraying.
But the years without autocracy have started to seem like a blip.
President Kais Saied sidelined the North African country's democratic institutions two years ago, re-establishing one-man rule. More than 20 journalists now face prison time, and other Tunisians have been jailed for antigovernment Facebook posts.
In April, books critical of Mr. Saied were pulled from a government-sponsored book fair. In May, a young rapper was arrested over a satirical song about drug laws and police corruption, set to a twinkly tune from "Babar," the cartoon about the elephant.
The president's crackdown on post-revolutionary gains has gone beyond free speech.
Mr. Saied has largely stripped the judiciary of its independence, arrested opposition figures and rewritten the constitution to increase the powers of his own office. But the gradual curbing of free speech stands out because, when asked to assess their revolution, Tunisians often say that freedom of expression was the only concrete achievement to come from it.
"I grew up in freedom. I was raised on freedom. It's the only thing we got out of the revolution, freedom of expression," said Youssef Chelbi, the 27-year-old rapper who was arrested over the "Babar" song. "I don't know what I did wrong."
Mr. Saied ordered him released after a public outcry. Still, the chill persists: Rising numbers of Tunisians feel uncomfortable discussing politics, according to recent polls.
Yet even Ms. Tlili and her radio station colleagues acknowledge that many listeners might care less about being able to speak out than about putting bread on the table. The years of democracy delivered mostly economic setbacks and dysfunction, if plenty of freedom to complain about democracy's failures.
When Mr. Saied took over in 2021, many Tunisians cheered. But now, as the economy teeters, people are "lost about which is more important, eating or thinking," said Elyes Gharbi, the host of Mosaïque's popular "Midi Show," which offers political commentary.
Anyone who grew up during the pre-2011 dictatorship of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali remembers how it was. Tunisians kept quiet about politics, even around friends. News outlets signed pledges not to cover politics. The business press knew better than to write about how the Ben Ali family had looted economic assets. Religion, too, was off limits.
"When you have a dictatorship, people tend to become small and respectful and to say that authority is needed," said Aymen Boughanmi, a political analyst and "Midi Show" regular.
Founded in 2003, Mosaïque rose to become Tunisia's most popular independent station by broadcasting only music and shows about entertainment, culture and sports. One minute of news played every hour.
Mr. Ben Ali's toppling in 2011 burst a dam.
Three days afterward, the website Business News, which, true to its name, had never touched politics, published an impassioned mea culpa. It apologized for Tunisian journalists' "participation in the plot of silence, for our self-censorship and our servility," adding, "It must be hoped that, in the future, Tunisian journalists and media will no longer bend their backs to any power."
Almost overnight, politics consumed the programming at Mosaïque. It devoted hours of coverage to the latest efforts to set up national elections, form political parties and draft a new constitution.
Ms. Tlili had joined Mosaïque the year before the uprising, but senior colleagues were no more experienced in political journalism. After the revolution, they packed their schedules with training programs, eager to learn.
"Suddenly," she said, "it was a new country."
For all the heady early optimism, government security services held onto some old habits, occasionally arresting people over Facebook posts.
The Tunisian media, for its part, often fell short of the standards Business News had laid out. Struggling with lethargic advertising revenue, many outlets took funding from political parties, compromising their independence.
Mosaïque was one of the few exceptions, thanks to the revenue it kept pulling in with a mix of politics, news, entertainment and music. Successive governments sometimes grumbled about its coverage, Ms. Tlili said, but its director shrugged at the angry calls, and the news churned on.
Things were quick to revert once Mr. Saied seized full power in 2021, as if pre-revolution muscle memory was kicking in. Outlets soon stopped inviting opposition politicians and critical pundits to appear. Government ministers stopped taking journalists' questions. Business News reporters began self-censoring, said the site's editor in chief, Nizar Bahloul.
But there was something new this time, a toxicity poisoning social media.
Saied supporters tore into anyone who criticized the president and published personal information about political opponents. Facebook pages and bot accounts linked to the president's circle have mounted coordinated smear campaigns against critics, said Zyna Mejri, the founder of Falso, a Tunisian fact-checking platform.
The president's office did not respond to a request for comment.
Online, Saied supporters labeled Mosaïque journalists "corrupt." The sense of siege escalated one night in February when security officers arrested the station's director, Noureddine Boutar.
His journalists said they felt personally responsible: The charges centered on accusations of financial impropriety, but his lawyers said he was targeted for the station's political coverage.
Days after the arrest, at a glum staff meeting, a lawyer delivered a message from the boss: Keep doing your jobs.
Judging by the audience numbers, independent commentary was good business.
Mosaïque remains No. 1. In a country of about 11 million people, more than a million listen daily to the "Midi Show," one of the few programs anywhere in Tunisia to regularly discuss the country's autocratic backsliding.
When its host, Mr. Gharbi, and the commentator Haythem El Mekki, a "Midi" fixture, were interrogated by security services last month after criticizing police recruitment methods on air, some listeners showed up in solidarity outside where they were being questioned, the "Midi" journalists said.
"If we still have this big mass of people following us," Mr. El Mekki said, "it's proof of trust."
But Mosaïque is not the opposition, Mr. Gharbi insists.
"We're just saying how we think things are going every day," and whether the authorities are improving Tunisians' lives or not, he said recently.
At that time, the journalists were hopeful.
They could still face prosecution. But Mr. Boutar had just been ordered released after three months in prison. The staff greeted one another the next morning with "praise be to God" and "congratulations."
Just before noon, Mr. Gharbi did a little dance before settling into the host's chair.
"It's great to be in the studio," he said later, "and not in jail."

Full text: The company has reached out to regulators about its plans, which could set off privacy and safety concerns for parents and watchdogs.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, plans to lower the recommended age for using its Quest headset to 10 from 13, the company said in a blog post on Friday, a move that could set off new privacy and safety concerns with parents and global watchdogs.
The company is discussing its plans with regulators, two people with knowledge of Meta's conversations said, and is trying to assuage immediate concerns over whether younger children using the headset could be subject to greater risk.
Meta said it would require a preteen's parental approval to set up an account, and that young users would only see apps and content rated for the preteen age group. The Quest headset allows people to enter the so-called metaverse, an immersive online world, and to play virtual reality games and do other tasks.
Over the past year, Meta has slowly moved the age restrictions for its virtual reality apps lower to reach younger audiences. In April, the company said it would allow people under 18 to use Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality-based social network, which appears to have many young users. Horizon Worlds will remain restricted to users 13 and older, as reported earlier by The Verge.
In its blog post, Meta said it was making the age change to the Quest headset "to give families even more ways to use and enjoy Meta Quest." It added that it was committed to "building safe, positive experiences for young people."
Technology use by teenagers and children has long been a contentious issue. Last month, the United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued a public warning about the risks of social media to young people, urging a push to fully understand the possible "harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents." He also called on policymakers to limit young people's access to social media to help protect children and their privacy.
Virtual reality is a relatively new field and its risks are still emerging. But harassment, assaults, bullying and hate speech already run rampant in virtual reality games, which are part of the metaverse, and there are few mechanisms to easily report the misbehavior, researchers have said.
As concerns have heightened, regulators have taken action. The Federal Trade Commission recently intensified its crackdowns on tech companies for violating a federal children's privacy law. That law, called the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, requires sites and apps directed at young people to obtain consent from a parent before collecting personal details -- like an email address or precise location -- from a child under the age of 13.
Meta and its platforms have been of particular concern to regulators. Last month, the F.T.C. said it was considering action to bar Meta from profiting off the data of young people on all of its platforms -- including Instagram and Horizon Worlds -- and that the company's "recklessness" had put young users at risk. Meta subsequently asked a federal court to block the agency's proposed action.
The age change for the Quest headset comes as building a virtual reality-based version of the metaverse has become crucial to Meta's future. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive, has spent the past two years shifting his social networking business to the metaverse. Last year, he spent nearly $ 14 billion to expand Reality Labs, the company's arm that is devoted to building hardware and developing the metaverse.
The high costs of trying to turn the metaverse into a mainstream business have spooked Wall Street, causing Meta's stock to plunge last year. Enthusiasm for the metaverse has also waned over the past year, as more technologists have flocked to the rise of artificial intelligence with the release of chatbots like ChatGPT. Mr. Zuckerberg has similarly pushed to incorporate A.I. into Meta's products.
But he has also said he remains intent on the metaverse. In a companywide meeting last week, Mr. Zuckerberg assured employees that he was committed to his virtual reality and augmented reality plans and that it would be a long haul toward realizing his vision.
Lowering the minimum age requirements for the company's Quest headset could help familiarize younger audiences with the metaverse, similar to how Facebook initially started on college campuses in 2004, so that they would be more likely to continue using the technology as they grow up.
Meta is likely seeking to integrate itself into young peoples' lives, following a strategy used by other gaming companies, including Roblox, Microsoft with its Minecraft game, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. Those games have a combined user base in the hundreds of millions, many of whom are under the age of 35.
"What we have seen is Meta, based solely on business imperatives, continually lowering the age of their virtual reality products and doing so without any evidence that these things are safe for young people," said Josh Golin, the executive director of Fairplay, a nonprofit children's advocacy group. "It's beyond the pale and clearly driven by the fact that they are trying to compete for a market, not driven by kids' needs."
Meta is working to assure regulators that it will provide parental controls to keep young users safe when using the device, said the two people with knowledge of the company's plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some of those include time limits, parent-managed controls over content or apps and privacy settings that will not allow other people using Horizon Worlds the ability to follow preteens without approval from them or their parents.
The company said it would use data from preteens who experiment with the Quest headset to deliver an "age-appropriate experience," but will not serve ads to the age group. Parents can also delete their children's profiles and associated data.

Thailand Front-Runner Facing Election Inquiry: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Activists say the case against the candidate, Pita Limjaroenrat, is part of a broader effort to nullify election results and further erode democracy in Thailand.
Thailand's Election Commission has announced that it will investigate Pita Limjaroenrat, the front-runner in the May general election, to determine whether he violated election rules that would disqualify him from becoming the country's next prime minister.
The investigation, announced last week, is centered on Mr. Pita's shares of iTV, a company that used to be a news broadcaster but is now focused on advertising. Mr. Pita, 42, said he inherited the shares from his father. Thai law prohibits parliamentary candidates from owning media shares.
Thailand's Election Commission said it needs 60 days to certify the results of the vote, after which the House of Representatives and the military-appointed Senate are expected to jointly vote for the prime minister in August.
But a month after Thai voters delivered a stinging rebuke to the military junta and handed Mr. Pita's Move Forward Party a decisive victory, his fate as an elected leader remained unclear. Here's what to know about the investigation.
What's at stake?
Activists say the case against Mr. Pita and the Move Forward Party is part of a broader effort to roll back the results of the election and erode democracy in Thailand.
The May election had a record turnout and was seen by many to be a vote against military rule. It also showed broad support for Move Forward, one of the few major political parties in Southeast Asia with a progressive platform.
Arnon Nampa, a prominent Thai human rights lawyer, wrote on Facebook on Saturday that "people will take to the streets if the Thai elite makes elections meaningless."
Mr. Pita's party wants to overhaul the old power structures that have dominated Thailand for decades, shrink the military's budget, eliminate conscription and weaken a law that criminalizes criticism of the Thai monarchy.
Move Forward has also said it wants to abolish monopolies, threatening the fortunes of the country's wealthy aristocrats.
What happens next?
On June 20, a Senate committee will review the election commission's order to investigate Mr. Pita, according to Senator Seree Suwanpanont.
A former elections commissioner, Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, said the iTV case could go to the Constitutional Court if at least 50 members of Parliament or 25 senators sign a petition against Mr. Pita's bid for prime minister.
Even before this case, Mr. Pita was contending with an obstinate Senate unlikely to support him as prime minister. Mr. Somchai wrote on Facebook that now, the investigation could result in more senators refusing to back him.
If Mr. Pita's bid for prime minister fails, Pheu Thai, the second-largest party in Mr. Pita's coalition, could field a candidate on its own as an alternative. Many expect Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister now living in exile, to be in the running.
Pheu Thai could also break away from Move Forward to form a new coalition that is more aligned with conservative parties. Pheu Thai has denied such plans.
Has this happened before?
Mr. Pita's case echoes one filed against his predecessor, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, in 2019. That year, the Constitutional Court disqualified Mr. Thanathorn from elected office because he was found to have held shares in a media company. He argued unsuccessfully that he had sold the shares to his mother before running for Parliament.
Mr. Thanathorn was the leader of the Future Forward Party, which was disbanded in 2020 by the Constitutional Court and is the predecessor of the Move Forward Party.
Last week, the Election Commission dismissed several complaints from critics of Mr. Pita seeking to disqualify his candidacy, but the commission decided to launch its own criminal probe to find out if Mr. Pita ran for Parliament knowing he was ineligible because of his iTV shares.
If he is found guilty, Mr. Pita could face up to 10 years in prison and a 20-year ban on voting.
On Tuesday, Mr. Pita told reporters that he was confident about his legal standing, saying the investigation "will not be an obstacle to me becoming Thailand's 30th prime minister."
On Thursday, iTV said that the minutes of the meeting did not intend to imply that it was still operating as a media company.
What are the details of the complaint?
Politicians from the Move Forward Party have said the case is a blatant attempt to prevent them from forming a new government and taking back power from the conservative establishment and military-appointed Senate.
Earlier this month, Mr. Pita posted on Facebook that iTV had not operated as a media company since March 2007.
Thailand has been roiled by a leaked audio recording released last weekend of an April 26 iTV shareholders' meeting. In the recording, the president of the company tells a shareholder that iTV is no longer in the media business.
But the recording contradicts the minutes of the same meeting, in which the president calls iTV a media entity. Those minutes have been submitted in the complaint against Mr. Pita.
In his Facebook post, Mr. Pita said that the shareholder raised the question a few days before he applied to run for prime minister and suggested that the inquiry was politically motivated.

Full text: As part of a legal settlement, Google agreed to pay $ 23 million to users who clicked on a search link from 2006 to 2013. Individual payments are estimated to be less than $ 8.
Anyone who clicked on a Google search result link from October 2006 to September 2013 is entitled to a piece -- however small -- of a $ 23 million settlement that the tech giant has agreed to pay to resolve a class-action lawsuit.
The settlement's administrators set up a website for people to submit claims. According to the site, the estimated individual payout stands at $ 7.70. But that figure can fluctuate based on the number of people who make valid claims.
Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., agreed to the settlement in August. The consolidated class-action lawsuit filed in 2013 accused the company of "storing and intentionally, systematically and repeatedly divulging" users' search queries and histories to third-party websites and companies.
This, according to the lawsuit, amounted to a privacy-law violation and a breach of Google's own privacy pledge to its users.
The lawsuit argued that Google search queries often contained sensitive and "personally identifiable" information, including "users' real names, street addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account numbers and more, all of which increases the risk of identity theft."
Google, which has admitted no wrongdoing, is required as part of the settlement to update its frequently-asked-questions page and its "key terms" page to disclose how search queries can be shared with third parties.
A court will decide whether to approve the agreement at a hearing on Oct. 12, according to the claim administrator website. It is not clear when payments will be distributed. Even if the court grants final approval of the settlement in October, appeals can slow the process, according to a claim notice from the administrator.
Users who wish to file a claim have until July 31 to submit their full name, street address and an email address. Anyone who wishes to object to or be excluded from the settlement must submit a form by mail by the same deadline.
Last year, Meta, Facebook's parent company, agreed to pay $ 725 million to settle a similar class-action lawsuit over its handling of user data.

E.U. Adds Google Charges, Targeting Its Ad Dominance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: European Union regulators filed new antitrust charges against Google, which could lead to fines and orders for the company to change its business practices.
Google was charged on Wednesday with violating European Union antitrust laws by using its dominance in online advertising to undercut rivals, the latest in a string of cases around the world that strike at the core of the internet giant's business model.
The case was brought by the European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation European Union, and is the fourth time Google has been charged with violating European antitrust laws in recent years. In this instance, the European Union accused Google of abusing its control of the market for buying and selling online advertising.
The U.S. Justice Department brought similar charges against Google in January, accusing the company of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising. Britain's antitrust authority has also been investigating Google's advertising practices.
The outcomes of the cases could have significant implications for Google's parent company, Alphabet, which reaped most of its $ 60 billion in profit last year from advertising. Advertising underpins nearly all of Google's most popular services, including search, email, maps and Android, and allows the company to offer them for free.
"Google is present at almost all levels of the so-called adtech supply chain," Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission, said in a statement. "Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favor its own intermediation services."
"Not only did this possibly harm Google's competitors but also publishers' interests, while also increasing advertisers' costs," added Ms. Vestager, who oversees digital and competition policy.
The new charges against Google are part of a long-running effort by the European authorities to clamp down on the world's largest technology companies. Apple and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, are also the subjects of antitrust investigations. Last year, the European Union passed new antitrust and digital services laws to tighten oversight of the biggest tech companies. And on Wednesday, the European Parliament, a legislative branch of the European Union, passed a draft law regulating artificial intelligence.
In recent years, the European authorities have fined Google billions of dollars over what they say are antitrust violations related to its Android mobile operating system, shopping service and another piece of its advertising business. All the cases remain tied up in court after legal appeals by Google.
With the new charges, the European Commission unveiled what is known as a "statement of objections" against Google, outlining why it believes the company has violated antitrust laws. It is one step in what could be a long process before final decisions are made about whether to impose a fine of up to 10 percent of Google's global revenue or to order other changes to its business practices. A settlement could also be reached.
Google said it disagreed with the regulators' finding and would "respond accordingly."
"Our advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers," said Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads. "Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The commission's investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new."
European regulators began investigating Google two years ago, focusing on the display advertising market, which includes the banners and other visual formats on websites. Google offers a number of services to advertisers and publishers in this sector. It collects data to target advertising, sells ad space on websites and offers products that serve as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers that own websites.
In controlling so much of the online advertising supply chain, Ms. Vestager has said, Google makes it harder for rivals to compete. Publishers such as News Corp have long complained that Google's dominance limits how much money they can generate from advertising put on their websites, or for rival services to emerge.
The European Publishers Council, an industry group representing media companies, applauded Wednesday's action. The group said it had filed a complaint over a year ago describing how Google "leveraged their position to the disadvantage of publishers."
"We look forward to working with the commission as the case continues," said the council's executive director, Angela Mills Wade.

Hitting Back, Russia Fights To Recapture Donbas Land: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russia attacked Ukrainian troops near villages in Ukraine's south on the same day that Russian missiles killed at least 11 people and that President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged some Russian losses.
Russian air forces and artillery weapons struck back against advancing Ukrainian troops on Tuesday, hammering them in the area of several southern villages that the Ukrainian Army had retaken over the past week in the opening phase of Kyiv's counteroffensive.
The attack reduced one village to ruins and came on the same day that a Russian missile strike killed at least 11 people in Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which lies about 100 miles from the eastern front line.
Thunderstorms had swept over southern Ukraine before the Russian attack on the villages, muddying terrain and complicating operations for both armies, which have been locked in fighting at multiple points as Ukrainian troops have tested Russian defenses along the front.
Conflicting claims made it difficult to assess the situation on the battlefield, but President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking to Russian war correspondents and military bloggers, acknowledged that his forces had suffered some losses in June, including 54 tanks. He denied Ukraine's assertions of progress on the battlefield, though, insisting that its military had lost hundreds more tanks and vehicles than Russia with no gains to speak of.
"The opponent has had no success in any area," he said. "They have had heavy losses."
Mr. Putin equivocated on the question of whether he might order another mobilization like the one last fall that brought some 300,000 men into duty and drove tens of thousands of others to flee. He said that he was aware of the hawkish calls for another major draft, but added that such a decision "depends on what we want" to do and that "there was no such need today."
After claiming to recapture a series of farming villages over the weekend, Ukraine's military announced only minimal gains on Tuesday, and the Russian attack on Ukraine's vanguard suggested Kyiv's troops faced a dangerous problem ahead. As they emerge from their trenches, military analysts say, they move out of the range of their own army's air defenses and electronic jamming systems, leaving them vulnerable to Russian air attacks like those on Tuesday.
Shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, such as American-provided Stingers, can be quickly moved forward. But doing so with more sophisticated, vehicle-mounted systems could put them at risk from Russian artillery.
Ukraine has yet to commit the bulk of its forces, including those trained by Western allies, to any one place to drive a wedge through Russian-occupied land in the southeast.
But Russia's defensive strategy of aerial counterstrikes could slow Ukraine's campaign, giving Russian troops more time to lay down even more defenses. Ukrainian forces have already faced minefields, trenches, anti-tank ditches, air assaults and artillery fire, Hannah Malyar, a Ukrainian deputy defense minister, said on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday.
"We have to be ready for our military to fight long and hard" to breach the defensive lines, Ivan Kyrychevsky, a military analyst at Defense Express, a Ukrainian analytical group, said on Facebook. Ukraine should also be prepared, he said, for Russia to "show as a strategic victory every tiny failure of our forces."
Mr. Zelensky, in an evening address on Monday, said that the bad weather, which made muddy fields impassable for heavy armored vehicles, had hampered his military's efforts. "The rain makes our task more difficult," he said, adding that the fighting was "fierce" but that his troops were moving.
A spokesman for the Ukrainian military's general staff, Andriy Kovalev, said on television that Ukrainian forces had advanced about 500 to 1,000 yards in some locations in the south, but he did not specify where. Reuters journalists were able to reach a newly retaken village, Neskuchne in eastern Ukraine, confirming on Tuesday at least one point of movement on the front.
A Russian-appointed official in southern Ukraine, Vladimir Rogov, claimed on Telegram that Russian attack helicopters had targeted Ukrainian soldiers near the town of Velyka Novosilka, in the eastern Donetsk region, where Ukraine had begun attacking last week.
"Our night counterattacks began," Mr. Rogov wrote, adding that the Russian military was flying sorties with two models of attack helicopters. Both armies were firing artillery in the area, he added.
Pro-war Russian bloggers, who are often affiliated with the military or paramilitary groups, have also described Russian counterattacks, but said the state of the fighting was uncertain.
"In reports from the field we have one piece of information, and then another," one blogger, who goes by the name Special Forces Archangel, wrote about the fighting near Velyka Novosilka.
Ukraine appears to have lost at least some of the Western-made weapons delivered in recent months. Several American-made Bradley fighting vehicles were abandoned by Ukrainian troops or destroyed in the early days of the counteroffensive, based on videos and photographs posted by pro-war Russian bloggers and verified by The New York Times.
Russia's Defense Ministry quickly put similar imagery to use in propaganda, publishing a video purporting to show its forces capturing abandoned Bradleys and German-made Leopard tanks in Zaporizhzhia, saying, "Now these are our trophies." The Russian claim could not be independently verified.
But whatever Ukraine's early losses, the United States and its European backers have continued to commit aid, including a new military package announced on Tuesday by the Biden administration. The latest package, worth $ 325 million, includes a total of about two dozen Bradley and Stryker armored fighting vehicles, as well as more rockets for the long-rage HIMARS missile system.
The United States has already sent 109 Bradleys and 90 Strykers to Ukraine, according to the Defense Department, and has committed $ 40 billion overall in arms, ammunition and equipment since Russia's invasion last year. Some European countries have also sent dozens of armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine in the past months.
Alongside its battlefield assaults, Russia has kept up its long-range campaign of attacking Ukrainian cities, hitting the president's hometown, in central Ukraine. Russian missiles hit a warehouse and an apartment building in the city, which was already grappling with the aftermath of the Kakhovka dam disaster, and the authorities said that 28 people had been injured in addition to the 11 killed.
Ukraine's military has become skilled at defending itself from Russian air attacks, but debris from some intercepted missiles and drones has killed or injured people across the country since the beginning of May.
Ukraine's General Staff said on its Facebook page that air defenses had destroyed 10 of 14 cruise missiles and shot down one of four Iranian-made Shahed drones used in Russia's overnight strike. The attack was part of Russian efforts to "exhaust" Ukraine's air defenses, said Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force.

Trump and Super PAC Release Ads Painting His Indictment as Political: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first signs are emerging of a paid messaging campaign from former President Donald J. Trump and his allies as they push back on his federal indictment, and they have two goals: Deflect and donate.
A broadcast ad released on Monday by MAGA Inc., a super PAC run by allies of the former president, does not directly mention the federal indictment against Mr. Trump, but instead focuses on allegations that President Biden also mishandled classified documents. (Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden has complied with investigators.) The ad follows similar messaging from Mr. Trump himself that tries to portray the case against him as a political maneuver.
"But they didn't indict Biden," a narrator says with an inflection of anger. "Instead Biden's D.O.J. went after Trump."
The ad is not running in Iowa, New Hampshire or any of the other early nominating states that will be casting the first electoral judgment on Mr. Trump's legal woes. Instead, it is running in major media markets, with more than $ 150,000 already spent in Washington, D.C., and on national Fox News broadcasts, according to AdImpact, a media tracking company.
The first indictment-related ad that came directly from the Trump campaign, however, was a request for money. On Friday, the day the indictment was unsealed, the Trump campaign placed an ad on Facebook that repeated many of his claims about a "witch hunt" and "election interference." At the end, it made a plea: "Contribute to peacefully stand with me today."
In anticipation of the charges, the Trump campaign also had a broadcast ad in the queue. Titled "Wolves," the ad describes a liberal "deep state" and "tainted radical left prosecutors" as out to get Mr. Trump. Sullen-looking portraits of several men who have investigated or prosecuted him -- James B. Comey, Robert S. Mueller III, Jack Smith and Alvin L. Bragg -- flicker across the screen.
But the campaign has aired the ad only on national cable networks, and has spent less than $ 10,000 so far.

F.T.C. Sues To Stop Deal For Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency had sued to halt the blockbuster deal last year. Its latest move in federal court would prevent the acquisition from being completed.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft on Monday to stop the company from closing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, escalating the federal government's efforts to stymie the largest consumer technology deal in decades.
In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the F.T.C. said the move was necessary because "Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate" the deal. It asked the court to issue an order blocking the acquisition's closing by the end of the day on Thursday.
The lawsuit is the latest blow to Microsoft's purchase of Activision, which makes popular video games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing it would damage competition in various parts of the video game market. The agency filed the separate lawsuit because unlike the F.T.C.'s in-house court, a federal court can issue a restraining order to stop a purchase from being completed.
Regulatory hurdles have piled up against the blockbuster deal, which has become a test for whether behemoth tech companies can complete major acquisitions amid backlash to the firms' growing power. In April, the British Competition and Markets Authority also moved to stop the deal, though regulators in the European Union said in May that it could go forward.
Governments around the world have been challenging the power of tech giants like Microsoft. The F.T.C. has accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of shutting off nascent competitors and has been investigating whether Amazon ran afoul of antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has filed multiple lawsuits arguing that Google has committed antitrust violations of its own.
Microsoft has appealed the British ruling to block the Activision deal and has pledged to fight the F.T.C. in court. The two companies had said they hoped the purchase would close by July.
The British portions of the deal cannot close while Microsoft's appeal moves forward. If a federal court grants the F.T.C.'s demand to stop the deal, it would also prevent Microsoft from completing the transaction in the United States.
Bill Baer, a former top government antitrust official, said the F.T.C.'s lawsuit was a response to the risk that Microsoft would try and circumvent the British ruling and "cause the injury the F.TC. is worried about" by closing the deal elsewhere.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that "Microsoft and Activision have not provided assurances" that they would not close the deal.
In a statement, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the company welcomed the "opportunity to present our case in federal court."
Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a note to employees that the company welcomed the news because it "accelerates the legal process." He added: "We will now have the opportunity to more quickly present the facts about our merger."
If Microsoft ushers the deal through, it would be a monumental moment for the $ 184 billion gaming industry. Microsoft earns billions of dollars each year in the video game business, but competitors like Nintendo and Sony -- which makes the PlayStation console -- have long been considered to have a better catalog of games that attract players to their devices. Adding Activision and its slate of gaming studios to Microsoft's Xbox consoles and its games subscription service could even the playing field.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made blocking corporate deals a cornerstone of her strategy to rein in the tech giants and other big companies. The chip maker Nvidia and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin have dropped proposed deals after they were challenged by the F.T.C. under Ms. Khan.
Attempts to block other deals have been less successful. Last year, the F.T.C. tried to stop Meta from buying Within, a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. A federal judge declined to stop the deal from closing, and the F.T.C. dropped its broader challenge to the purchase.
Microsoft has worked to gain approval from regulators for the Activision acquisition. Since announcing the deal a year and a half ago, the company has embarked on a charm offensive, meeting with regulators around the world and cutting deals with other gaming companies to assuage concerns that the deal would reduce availability of Activision's games and raise their prices.
But those moves failed to persuade the British and American regulators to approve the deal. The new lawsuit by the F.T.C., analysts said, could be an effort by the United States to regain some prominence in the legal fight, as well as an acknowledgment that Microsoft could close the deal despite Britain's objections.
"The F.T.C. is reaffirming how adamant it is about blocking this deal," said Joost van Dreunen, a gaming analyst and professor at New York University. "They want to make sure that they are still driving the bus in this."

Firefighter Drowns in N.J. Trying to Save His Daughter: [National Desk]

Full text: There were no lifeguards on duty at Avon-by-the-Sea, along the New Jersey shore, on Friday.
The day began with a dip into the cool Atlantic waters along the New Jersey shore near Avon-by-the-Sea.
Mark Batista, a father of three and a veteran member of the New York Fire Department, brought his family to the beach on Friday morning, when the salty ocean air fell just shy of 70 degrees. Soon after, his daughter made a beeline toward the waves, splashing as she waded deeper into the dark blue.
Suddenly, a deadly rip current emerged. The narrow, fast-moving stream swept her farther and farther away from the shore.
Mr. Batista rushed in to rescue her, friends and authorities said. But the ocean, in all its cruelty, pulled him under.
Mr. Batista, 39, a longtime firefighter and emergency medical technician, drowned, according to Jim Long, a spokesman for the Fire Department.
He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead. His daughter, whose name and age have not been released, survived.
Their relationship was described in a social media post a few months before Mr. Batista's death. "I can't promise to be here the rest of your life," he wrote in October on Instagram along with a photo of his smiling daughter, her arms wrapped around his neck. "But what I can promise is to love you for the rest of mine."
Mr. Batista's drowning was the second along the nearly 130-mile New Jersey coastline this year, according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. The other victim was a 15-year-old boy who died over Memorial Day weekend at Sandy Hook Beach. He was also pulled out to sea by a rip current.
In both cases, no lifeguards were on duty where the drownings occurred, according to the data and the Monmouth County Sheriff's Office.
Lifeguards at Avon-by-the-Sea will begin to work full time on Saturday, according to the community's website. On Friday, after Mr. Batista's death, the sheriff's office issued a statement on Facebook warning "all to please not to go in the water when there are no lifeguards on duty."
Mr. Batista first joined the New York Fire Department Emergency Medical Services in 2008. He spent about five years as an emergency medical technician before becoming a firefighter, Mr. Long said. He was most recently assigned to Engine Company 226 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
"We are heartbroken to learn about the death of Firefighter Mark Batista," Mr. Long said in a statement.
"Firefighter Batista was a dedicated public servant who spent 15 years serving in the FDNY," he added. "We join his family in mourning his tragic passing."
Mr. Batista's body was transferred on Sunday from the Middlesex County Medical Examiner to Vander Plaat Colonial Home in Fair Lawn, N.J., according a memo obtained by The New York Times that was sent to Fire Department firefighters and emergency service workers.
Mr. Batista's wife, Lenin Batista, posted a message to friends and family on Instagram. "I feel lost, heartbroken and very afraid," she wrote in Spanish.
On Sunday morning, Janelle Rivera, a veteran emergency service technician and Mr. Batista's longtime friend, had not yet heard about his drowning, she said later.
As she sat down to drink her coffee, she picked up her phone and saw she had dozens of unread messages. She opened one and saw a photo of Mr. Batista along with a picture of a purple and black striped flag. They were the colors of the mourning bunting, a pleated fabric drape that hangs over a firehouse to signify the death of a member.
Ms. Rivera was stunned.
She thought of how she met Mr. Batista when he worked at E.M.S. Station 45 in Queens. She remembered the near-fatal motorcycle accident Mr. Batista was in, just a few years ago, the one that made him rethink how he spent his time in the world. She thought of how he often took his family to the shore because his daughter loved the ocean.
Ms. Rivera also recalled running into Mr. Batista about a month ago at Fire Department headquarters in Brooklyn. He was driving his prized white Porsche.
On that day, Mr. Batista talked about his wife as he always did. "Every second of every day, he made sure his wife knew how much he cherished and valued her. And that meant so much to me, knowing someone in the world like that exists," Ms. Rivera said. "Anytime I had a bad day, I could just look upon him to give me hope that it's possible to be loved that way."
"That his wife had to watch him go into that water and not come out, it kills me," she added. "The life of his daughter is the result of his heroism, and that is everything a wife and mother could ever ask for."

Ukraine Claims Territorial Gains, Though Slight, in Counteroffensive: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three small settlements in the eastern region of Donetsk have been taken back from Russian occupiers, Ukrainian officials say.
After a week of mostly silence about its newly launched campaign to drive Russian occupying forces from Ukrainian territory, Ukraine's military on Sunday claimed its first small gains as fighting raged in at least three sectors of the front.
The military operation is expected to be vast, but for the moment it appears to consist mostly of probing attacks and feints.
At least three of them are said to have paid off.
Ukraine's 68th Brigade posted video on Facebook of its soldiers raising the nation's blue-and-yellow flag over the village of Blahodatne, in the eastern region of Donetsk. A deputy defense minister said Ukraine's forces had also taken the nearby village of Makarivka, and the Ukrainian Volunteer Army said it had reclaimed a neighboring settlement, Neskuchne.
"We are driving the enemy from our homeland," an unidentified soldier says in the video. "It's the most pleasant feeling. Ukraine will be victorious."
The claims could not immediately be independently verified, and their defiant tone notwithstanding, they were made in the face of unquestionable losses for Ukraine over the past week of both troops and equipment as the counteroffensive has begun to take shape.
It was also not clear whether the villages were beyond the first lines of Russian defenses -- meaning it remains to be seen whether the announcements signaled that Ukraine had managed to break through them.
But after months of speculation, one thing did appear clear over the weekend: The long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway, if not fully. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said as much on Saturday during a surprise visit from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. "At what stage, I will not disclose in detail," Mr. Zelensky said.
However limited it is for the moment, the assault has been fierce, with fighting concentrated along the front in the south and the east. The Ukrainians, outfitted with newly acquired tanks and armored vehicles, are trying both to regain ground and to persuade their Western allies that theirs is a fight still worth supporting.
In recent days, Ukrainian rockets and artillery have hit four Russian command centers, six areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment, three ammunition depots and five enemy artillery units, the Ukrainian military said. The assertions could not be verified independently.
But any gains Ukraine makes against the entrenched Russian forces are likely to be costly and bring high casualties on the Ukrainian side.
In 15 months of war, Ukraine's military has largely refrained from discussing its own casualty numbers and losses, but the evidence suggests that the renewed fighting has not been easy.
American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Ukrainian forces had suffered losses over the past week, as had the Russians, but would not quantify the casualties. At least three German-made Leopard 2 tanks and eight American-made Bradley fighting vehicles were recently abandoned by Ukrainian troops or destroyed, based on videos and photographs posted by pro-war Russian bloggers and verified by The New York Times.
Early Sunday, the assault on Blahodatne initially stalled at the edge of the village, according to Valeriy Shershen, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region. Russian forces were firing from the village's school and from a cultural club, he said, preventing any advance.
Then the Ukrainian assault group attacked both buildings simultaneously, entering the cultural club by blowing a hole in a wall and climbing in to fight room to room, Mr. Shershen said. His account could not be independently confirmed, but the video released by Ukraine showed its soldiers hanging a flag from an upper-story window of what appears to be a partly destroyed school. The New York Times has not independently verified the video.
There was no comment from Russia's Ministry of Defense, which has asserted that it repelled Ukrainian attacks in the first week of fighting.
But the Ukrainian Volunteer Army's assertion Sunday that it had recaptured Neskuchne a day earlier came shortly after an influential Russian military commentator, Igor Girkin, said on social media that Russian forces had withdrawn from the village.
The three settlements that Ukraine claimed to have taken are spread over roughly three miles. Further advances to the south from the area could cut rail and road links between Russia and the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula, an objective of the counteroffensive.
In Russia, tensions were visible on Sunday between two arms of the military offensive against Ukraine. The leader of the Wagner private military company, who has been openly critical of Russian military leaders, issued a statement that his group would not comply with an order that it sign a formal contract with the Defense Ministry by July 1.
The blunt refusal was just the latest flashpoint in a long-running feud between the Wagner leader, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu that has put a spotlight on the disunity and infighting over the prosecution of the war.
Still even as he rebuffed Mr. Shoigu, Mr. Prigozhin made clear that he remained loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin. "Wagner is absolutely completely subordinate to the interests of the Russian Federation and the supreme commander in chief," he wrote.

This Meme Symbolizes State of A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Shoggoth, a character from a science fiction story, captures the essential weirdness of the A.I. moment.
A few months ago, while meeting with an A.I. executive in San Francisco, I spotted a strange sticker on his laptop. The sticker depicted a cartoon of a menacing, octopus-like creature with many eyes and a yellow smiley-face attached to one of its tentacles. I asked what it was.
"Oh, that's the Shoggoth," he explained. "It's the most important meme in A.I."
And with that, our agenda was officially derailed. Forget about chatbots and compute clusters -- I needed to know everything about the Shoggoth, what it meant and why people in the A.I. world were talking about it.
The executive explained that the Shoggoth had become a jokey reference among workers in artificial intelligence, as a vivid visual metaphor for how a large language model (the type of A.I. system that powers ChatGPT and other chatbots) actually works.
But it was only partly a joke, he said, because it also hinted at the anxieties that many researchers and engineers have about the tools they're building.
Since then, the Shoggoth has gone viral, or as viral as it's possible to go in the small world of hyper-online A.I. insiders. It's a popular meme on A.I. Twitter (including a now-deleted tweet by Elon Musk), a recurring metaphor in essays and message board posts about A.I. risk, and a bit of useful shorthand in conversations with A.I. safety experts. One A.I. start-up, NovelAI, said it had recently named a cluster of computers "Shoggy" in homage to the meme. Another A.I. company, Scale AI, designed a line of tote bags featuring the Shoggoth.
Shoggoths are fictional creatures, introduced by the science fiction author H.P. Lovecraft in his 1936 novella "At the Mountains of Madness." In Lovecraft's telling, Shoggoths were massive, bloblike monsters made out of iridescent black goo, covered in tentacles and eyes.
Shoggoths landed in the A.I. world in December, a month after ChatGPT's release, when a Twitter user, @TetraspaceWest, replied to a tweet about GPT-3 (an OpenAI language model that was ChatGPT's predecessor) with an image of two hand-drawn Shoggoths -- the first labeled "GPT-3" and the second labeled "GPT-3 + RLHF." The second Shoggoth had, perched on one of its tentacles, a smiley-face mask.
In a nutshell, the joke was that in order to prevent A.I. language models from behaving in scary and dangerous ways, A.I. companies have had to train them to act polite and harmless. One popular way to do this is called "reinforcement learning from human feedback," or R.L.H.F., a process that involves asking humans to score chatbot responses and feeding those scores back into the A.I. model.
Most A.I. researchers agree that models trained using R.L.H.F. are better behaved than models without it. But some argue that fine-tuning a language model this way doesn't actually make the underlying model less weird and inscrutable. In their view, it's just a flimsy, friendly mask that obscures the mysterious beast underneath.
@TetraspaceWest, the meme's creator, told me in a Twitter message that the Shoggoth "represents something that thinks in a way that humans don't understand and that's totally different from the way that humans think."
Comparing an A.I. language model to a Shoggoth, @TetraspaceWest said, wasn't necessarily implying that it was evil or sentient, just that its true nature might be unknowable.
"I was also thinking about how Lovecraft's most powerful entities are dangerous -- not because they don't like humans, but because they're indifferent and their priorities are totally alien to us and don't involve humans, which is what I think will be true about possible future powerful A.I."
The Shoggoth image caught on, as A.I. chatbots grew popular and users began to notice that some of them seemed to be doing strange, inexplicable things their creators hadn't intended. In February, when Bing's chatbot became unhinged and tried to break up my marriage, an A.I. researcher I know congratulated me on "glimpsing the Shoggoth." A fellow A.I. journalist joked that when it came to fine-tuning Bing, Microsoft had forgotten to put on its smiley-face mask.
Eventually, A.I. enthusiasts extended the metaphor. In February, the Twitter user @anthrupad created a version of a Shoggoth that had, in addition to a smiley-face labeled "R.L.H.F.," a more humanlike face labeled "supervised fine-tuning." (You practically need a computer science degree to get the joke, but it's a riff on the difference between general A.I. language models and more specialized applications like chatbots.)
Today, if you hear mentions of the Shoggoth in the A.I. community, it may be a wink at the strangeness of these systems -- the black-box nature of their processes, the way they seem to defy human logic. Or maybe it's an in-joke, visual shorthand for powerful A.I. systems that seem suspiciously nice. If it's an A.I. safety researcher talking about the Shoggoth, maybe that person is passionate about preventing A.I. systems from displaying their true, Shoggoth-like nature.
In any case, the Shoggoth is a potent metaphor that encapsulates one of the most bizarre facts about the A.I. world, which is that many of the people working on this technology are somewhat mystified by their own creations. They don't fully understand the inner workings of A.I. language models, how they acquire new abilities or why they behave unpredictably at times. They aren't totally sure if A.I. is going to be net-good or net-bad for the world. And some of them have gotten to play around with the versions of this technology that haven't yet been sanitized for public consumption -- the real, unmasked Shoggoths.
That some A.I. insiders refer to their creations as Lovecraftian horrors, even as a joke, is unusual by historical standards. (Put it this way: Fifteen years ago, Mark Zuckerberg wasn't going around comparing Facebook to Cthulhu.)
And it reinforces the notion that what's happening in A.I. today feels, to some of its participants, more like an act of summoning than a software development process. They are creating the blobby, alien Shoggoths, making them bigger and more powerful, and hoping that there are enough smiley faces to cover the scary parts.

Full text: Responses to Molly Worthen's essay about removing technology from students' daily lives.
To the Editor:
Re "Universities, Meet Monasteries," by Molly Worthen (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
Dr. Worthen's essay resonated deeply with me. I am a tutor and the incoming dean of St. John's College, Santa Fe, one of the oldest colleges in America, a college with an enduring commitment to seminar-style discussion and the close reading of the Great Books.
Without fanfare, year after year, St. John's continues to offer a program of study that requires little more than a great book, a seminar table and the participants around that table.
St. John's is not a monastery, but it does provide a cloister where devices and the pull of the virtual world have no place. The education requires the students to be present to their thoughts, to the comments of their classmates, to the beauty of the texts. In doing so they experience self-discovery and deep conversation.
It becomes increasingly clear that this kind of education, Luddite though it may appear, is not a turning back, but a looking forward. It is one of the few places available for our young people to face, as Dr. Worthen put it, that these devices are our tools, not our masters.
Sarah Davis
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
The idea of creating a "monastery" within a larger university has some merit, especially given how distracted so many of our young adults are with their phones, computers and a nearly ubiquitous digital "panopticon" that has become part of not only college, but also where and how we live.
For Molly Worthen's concept to work, however, it would be necessary to get the full buy-in of the college faculty and administration, because everything they do is now fully digital, including homework, essay submissions, various e-chalkboards and even virtual office hours. College administration also operates its entire function digitally, including financial aid and all record-keeping.
This reminds me of Saul Bellow's introduction to Allan Bloom's classic 1987 book "The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students." Bellow recommended that, as much as possible, society's "backflow," as he put it, be kept off campus so students can concentrate on learning fundamental skills and develop their own powers of mind.
This was way before the internet and iPhones, and is timeless advice, whether digital or not.
Matthew G. Andersson
Clearwater, Fla.
To the Editor:
Molly Worthen made a sound argument for the creation of classes and programs at universities that limit and remove technology from students' daily lives.
TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat have already affected our collective attention span. They are designed to keep their users on the platform as much as possible; the revenue the companies generate from endless advertising is their lifeblood.
Look no further than the couple at a restaurant, glued to their phones, or the student trying to complete an assignment at 11 at night, who for hours was scrolling through a TikTok feed.
The advent of artificial intelligence is drawing humans deeper into this inescapable "technology tornado." As Dr. Worthen mentioned in her essay, there are increasing numbers of educators who want students to learn how to use this in the classroom. However, doing so relieves these students of the necessary critical thinking skills that are vital to ideas and innovation.
What will society become when our ability to reflect, ponder and strategize is greatly hindered?
Bill Tamburelli
Santa Barbara, Calif.
To the Editor:
I was a Catholic high school boarding student at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit from 1965 to 1969. We had to observe "grand silence" every night from prayers, around 9, until we sat down at breakfast the next morning, and we were not permitted to listen to the radio or watch TV while at the seminary.
Although we were not monks, in preparation to eventually become priests, we were cut off from "the world" and were taught to be "in the world but not of it."
Molly Worthen captures well the unexpected benefits of an imposed silence in the cases she describes at universities. Although it felt strange living that "vow of silence" as a teenager -- long before the age of the internet and iPhones! -- I treasure the lessons learned by living periods of each day in silence.
In the end, I did not become a priest, but I cherish the value of a somewhat "monkish" existence, living comfortably with silence and deep into my own thoughts. As a university instructor, I encourage my students to learn to do the same.

Full text: Abby Barr and Jed Feiman, two comedy writers who regularly riff off each other, also kept their wedding guests laughing.
Abigail Renée Barr and Jed Ronner Feiman are intensely supportive of each other in a funny sort of way. They're both comedy writers.
"That's our relationship," she said. "Building jokes." That and their mutual love for TV and pop culture.
When Ms. Barr first came across his Bumble profile in July 2016, she was delighted that "he was a native New Yorker interested in comedy and theater." (In her vows she joked: "How could this possibly work? You're from the Upper East Side. I'm from the Upper West Side.")
She spotted a screenshot on his dating profile of one of the many humor pieces he wrote in The New Yorker magazine with his writing partner. So, she searched on Google and came up with his full name (only first names appear on Bumble where women make the first move).
"It was funny, and impressive," said Ms. Barr, 29, who graduated from Oberlin with a bachelor's degree in theater. She is the social media manager for "Switched on Pop," a pop music podcast on Vulture, a New York Magazine website.
She read other pieces he co-wrote and, on his Facebook page, enjoyed his spoof as a basketball studies major at Georgetown, from where he actually graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in English and government. Mr. Feiman, 33, a comedy sketch performer and actor, is part of Never Sad with Nehemiah Markos, a comedy sketch writing and performing duo.
Mr. Feiman especially got a kick out of a photo of Ms. Barr standing inside a Casper mattress box on her dating profile.
"She looked really cute and fun," he said.
That same evening, after Ms. Barr's gig as a cat in an experimental comedy show at the Peoples Improv Theater in New York, they met at the Raines Law Room, a speakeasy in the Chelsea neighborhood.
"I knew there was a level of funny," said Ms. Barr, who initially found him a bit shy until they bonded over Stephen Sondheim, rattling off one favorite musical after another. "He is a comedian without a brash personality -- I knew I really had to crack him"
Then, he blew her away.
"He said I had a Jenny Slate vibe," she said. "She's a petite curly-haired Jewish comedian I worship."
Later, he surprised even himself.
"I'm going to kiss you now," he said. "I'm this short Jewish guy from New York and that's the best I could do to sound suave." And it worked. "She said 'Yes."'

They kissed good night before she headed back to the Upper West Side, where she lived with her parents, and was surprised that he did not run the other way when she mentioned that she still lived at home.
"We skipped all the boring games," said Mr. Feiman, who had a studio in the Hudson Yards neighborhood. "It felt so natural right away."
A week later, they went to the now-demolished Sunshine Cinema on the Lower East Side to see "Don't Think Twice," about an improv group by Mike Birbiglia. They walked all the way back to Hudson Yards, talking about the movie, and soon began seeing each other regularly.
In the fall of 2016, she attended all three of his presidential debate pizza parties.
"We had to turn on 'Family Guy' we were so stressed about the country," she said, referring to the animated sitcom. "You wouldn't do that with someone you're casually dating."
In summer 2017, after she moved to Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she ended up spending more time at his place, and in August 2019 she officially moved in.
When the pandemic hit, "Hudson Yards turned into an abandoned Disneyland," Ms. Barr said, and in October 2021 they moved to the more bustling Lower East Side, close to where his maternal grandparents once lived.
"Jed became a part of my life," she said. "He became most of my life. Then he became my whole life."
In March 2022, Mr. Feiman planned to propose at a restaurant in Rome, but the service and food were so bad, he went to Plan B.
In May, during Montreal Sketchfest in Canada, he asked Ms. Barr to film him and his partner rehearsing an intentionally bad comedy sketch in Mount Royal Park. Mr. Feiman rambled on about typical licenses, and when he got around to marriage licenses, (Ms. Barr was still filming) he got down on one knee. At the end of the year, they adopted a Cavapoo, Muppet.
"Our wedding was funny but it wasn't a joke," Mr. Feiman said.
The wedding overlapped with the series finale of "Succession," their favorite TV show. "We chose the finale to our singlehood over saying goodbye to Kendall Roy," they said in unison. They watched the final show the next day.
On May 28, Rabbi Dr. Elliot Cosgrove, from Park Avenue Synagogue, officiated before 120 guests on the garden terrace at the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where guests wore designer-emblazoned yarmulkes that said: "Ralph Lifschitz" (Ralph Lauren's original name). The two best men, who doubled as ring bearers, pulled lots of paper out of a giant Manhattan Mini Storage box until they got to two tiny velvet ring boxes.
During their cocktail hour, a string quartet from the Diller-Quaile School of Music played TV show theme songs and tunes from video games like the "Legend of Zelda." The couple's ketubah, entitled Chicken Soup for the Soul Mates, featured Manischewitz chicken soup cans in the spirit of Andy Warhol.
"Humor, love and joy," Mr. Feiman said. "Why not? That's what life should be."

Full text: When an ex returns from out of the blue with the same drinking problem but a new desire to be in his daughter's life, a reader is unsure how best to protect her child.
My ex and I have a 13-year-old daughter. We never married. After we broke up nine years ago (in part because of his drinking), he left the country. I never applied for sole custody. We agreed our daughter would live with me, and he never paid for anything. He moved back recently and has been having dinner with her once a week. She's getting used to having him in her life. The issue: Twice, he has turned up drunk. Most recently, he arrived very late -- without responding to her many texts -- and was sick in front of her. When I asked him to leave, we argued, and that upset my daughter a lot. (He denies he has a drinking problem; often, he denies he's been drinking at all.) How can I help my daughter navigate this relationship?
MOM
I share your concern for your daughter. It is really important that she not ride in a car with a driver who has been drinking, or be left alone with someone who is too impaired to care for her. Start drumming that into her head now! And it is unfair to ask her -- at 13 -- to police adult behavior. (No "call me if he seems odd.") She is too young for that, and it may be hard for her to rat out her father. Tell your ex that his visits must take place in your home.
Now, in many states, when an unmarried woman gives birth, she automatically becomes the sole guardian of the child until a court rules otherwise. Confirm the laws in your state. Perhaps no further action is required of you, but if it is, petition to become your daughter's sole legal guardian now to ensure the primacy of your decisions.
The hardest part of this story may be your ex's dishonesty about his drinking. It makes him an unreliable parent -- which may be upsetting for your daughter and prevents you from trusting him. Encourage her to talk about this or, better yet, find her a teen chapter of Al-Anon in your area. If she is going to have a problem drinker in her life, give her the tools to handle it.
When Cutting a Guest List, Don't Use a Scalpel
My fiancée and I are planning our wedding. (It's my second marriage, her first.) We've made an initial guest list of 60 friends and relatives. We want an intimate gathering that includes all the people who are important to us. Our question: Can we eliminate plus ones when we are friends with only half of a couple (whether married or in relationships)?
GROOM-TO-BE
I could see getting away with a plan that breaks with tradition and eliminates plus ones with whom you are not close if your guest list topped out at a dozen. People would get that it's a very small, personalized guest list -- though I bet you would still upset some of the excluded spouses and significant others. You aren't saying that you don't know them, only that they don't rate. (Ouch!)
But a party of 60 is hardly intimate, even if it's smaller than many in the wedding-industrial complex. It's too many people, I think, to let some guests bring partners and to refuse others. Your guests will compare notes, and their feelings may be hurt. Still, it's your wedding: You can invite whomever you like. But I'd hate for a surgical guest list to outshine your joyful day.
The Other Woman in the Group Chat
My husband and I have been together for 11 years. He is very close with his friends and part of several large group-text chains. One of the threads includes a woman with whom he hooked up a few times long before we met. They never dated or anything. Still, it bothers me that I have to hear from her on these chats. Am I being unreasonable?
WIFE
If I understand you correctly, you are not mistrustful of your husband or suspicious of his friend. And wisely, I think, you are not asking him to leave a chat of friends simply because he hooked up with one of them long before you met.
That leaves three options for handling your feelings: Leave the chat. (They are your husband's friends, you say.) Mute the woman, if you prefer to remain. Or learn to put up with mild annoyance like everyone else in the world.
A Case of Buzzer's Remorse
After years of struggling with thinning hair and a receding hairline, I decided to shave my head clean. I thought it would give me a boost of self-confidence. As soon as the barber began shaving me, though, I regretted my decision. I've received positive feedback on my bald look, but I fear it's too drastic. So, I've been wearing hats. Should I grow out my hair or stick with my new look?
YOUNG MAN
Take it easy on yourself! Nearly everyone is self-conscious about something, and feeling ambivalent after a big change is natural. I have no idea how you should style your hair. But I asked my excellent barber, who told me your impulse to go short was wise, but you may have been overzealous in cutting it all off. Let your hair grow back to half an inch in length. That will draw less attention and avoid looking extreme.

In Thailand, Defamation Lawsuits Can Make Free Speech Costly for Critics: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Thailand, companies and people in positions of power often use libel suits to intimidate and punish activists and critics.
The Thai activist, Sutharee Wannasiri, knew the poultry company had violated labor laws. She went on Twitter in 2017 to share a video containing an interview with an employee who said he had to work day and night with no day off.
The poultry company hit back, suing Ms. Sutharee for defamation and libel. Though a court found her not guilty in 2020, the company wasn't done.
While the case was still pending, her colleague at their human rights organization spoke up for Ms. Sutharee on Twitter and Facebook. She, too, ended up being sued for defamation and libel. Now the colleague, Puttanee Kangkun, is facing a maximum of 42 years in prison as she awaits a verdict.
The cases exemplify what often happens in Thailand when companies and government officials are unhappy with public criticism. A criminal defamation charge follows in which critics are accused of spreading falsehoods, and defendants find themselves mired in lengthy legal battles and facing the threat of a prison sentence.
Powerful figures who know they can use the courts to intimidate, harass and punish critics have taken advantage of what the United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights has called "judicial harassment" in Thailand.
Though the poultry company, Thammakaset, has been found guilty of labor abuses, it has continued to take its critics to court: first, people who talked about the labor abuses, and later those who complained about the measures the company was taking to silence those people.
Since 2016, Thammakaset has filed 39 lawsuits, mostly criminal defamation cases, against 23 individuals: migrant workers, human rights defenders and journalists. It has lost all except one, which was later overturned on appeal.
Three are still pending.
In addition to Ms. Puttanee, Thammakaset is also suing Angkhana Neelapaijit, a former National Human Rights Commissioner in Thailand, and Thanaporn Saleephol, a press officer for the European Union in Thailand.
All three women took to social media to criticize Thammakaset's lawsuits. All three are accused of defamation and libel; they are being tried together.
Many nations in Southeast Asia have criminal defamation laws, but Thailand stands out. Citizens "are just much more aggressive" in using the law to "drag people into judicial processes that are slow and expensive," according to Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division.
In addition to the criminal defamation law, there is the Computer Crimes Act, which makes it a crime to upload "false" information that can "cause damage to the public." Another law, protecting the Thai monarchy from criticism, allows ordinary Thais to file complaints for violations.
A U.K.-based rights watchdog, ARTICLE 19, cited statistics provided by Thailand's judicial authorities showing that public prosecutors and private parties have filed more than 25,000 criminal defamation cases since 2015.
"The business and political elites see this as very effective because the courts are risk-averse; they accept almost any case that is, on its face, nonsensical," Mr. Robertson said.
Faced with calls to address the rampant misuse of the courts, the Thai government amended its Criminal Procedure Code in 2018 to make it easier to dismiss cases against defendants who can argue they are acting in the public interest. But lawyers say little has changed.
Sor Rattanamanee Polkla, the lawyer representing Ms. Puttanee, Ms. Angkhana and Ms. Thanaporn, said she filed a petition to get the cases thrown out under this provision, but the court denied her request.
Thammakaset's complaint against the three women centers on the 2017 video shared by Ms. Sutharee, which was made by Fortify Rights. Ms. Puttanee works for the organization; Ms. Sutharee and Ms. Thanaporn both used to.
In their Twitter and Facebook posts, Ms. Puttanee, Ms. Angkhana and Ms. Thanaporn expressed solidarity with the activists who were persecuted by Thammakaset. Their posts linked to a Fortify Rights news release and a joint statement with other human rights organizations that ultimately linked to the video.
Thammakaset has cited the video, which includes an interview with a worker describing working long hours and having his passport withheld, in its complaint.
In 2016, the Thai authorities ruled that Thammakaset had failed to pay minimum and overtime wages or to provide adequate leave to workers. In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's order for the company to pay roughly $ 50,000 to a group of 14 employees who had filed the labor complaint.
During a hearing for the three women in March, Chanchai Pheamphon, the owner of Thammakaset, told the judge that he had already "paid his dues" to the workers, yet the online criticism continued to hurt his business and his reputation.
He said his children had asked him whether the family's money had come "from human trafficking, from selling slaves."
"How should a father feel when his children asks him this?" Mr. Chanchai said, his voice rising. "I have to use my rights to fight. But using my rights is seen as threatening, using the law to silence them."
Mr. Chanchai told the court that no one wanted to do business with him anymore. But in March, two rights groups published an investigation showing that after Thammakaset canceled its poultry farm certifications in 2016, a new poultry company called Srabua was established by a man who shared the same address as Mr. Chanchai.
Mr. Chanchai denied any knowledge of Srabua.
Asked by a New York Times reporter if he planned to file more lawsuits against critics of the company, Mr. Chanchai said, "You're a reporter for a big news agency. If someone says you're a drug dealer, will you fight back?"
Decriminalizing defamation cases could have saved Thai taxpayers $ 3.45 million over 2016 to 2018, according to the Thai Human Rights Lawyers Association. Defendants in civil suits can also expect to pay large sums of money out of pocket.
During the March hearing, Ms. Puttanee, 52, brought a backpack stuffed with clothes to court. Commuting from her home to the court takes two hours each way, so each time she attends a hearing, she books a hotel at her company's expense.
She said she expects the case to last four years if Thammakaset decides to bring its argument all the way to the Supreme Court. Nonetheless, Ms. Puttanee counts herself lucky: She is in a community that has rallied around her, and her lawyer works pro bono.
"But I still treat this as intimidation," she said.
During the hearing, Mr. Chanchai detailed how Ms. Puttanee's Twitter posts had defamed his company. His account took five hours; Ms. Puttanee nodded off during his testimony.
Ms. Angkhana, the former human rights commissioner, is well known in Thailand because of her husband, Somchai Neelapaijit, a human rights lawyer who vanished in 2004 and whose fate remains unknown.
She said the current lawsuit has taken a toll on her mental health.
"It is repeated trauma when somebody attacks you, when you didn't do anything wrong," said Ms. Angkhana, 67. "This is the real aim of the company -- to make you feel powerless."
Ms. Thanaporn, 29, said there was irony in becoming a victim of the very process she was denouncing, simply by sharing support for her fellow activists online.
"The fact that I can be sued for this speaks for itself," she said.

The Paranoid Style in Carlson's Home Office: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The lo-fi "Tucker on Twitter" finds the former prime-time host at the intersection of Fox News and Fox Mulder.
Most of the time, it does not qualify as newsworthy to see a man in your social media feed staring into a camera, asking "What exactly happened on 9/11?" and demanding to know why the media isn't digging for the truth about J.F.K.'s assassination. Usually, it's just a sign that you should not have accepted so many friend requests from high school classmates you barely remember.
But when that man was recently paid millions of dollars by Fox News to say much the same things on one of the most popular shows on cable TV, attention is paid. In Tuesday's debut episode of "Tucker on Twitter," the new home-brew show from Tucker Carlson, the ousted prime-time star's brand of resentment, insinuation and dog-whistly mocking finally gets the guy-ranting-from-his-den visuals that suit it.
There's a touch of echo in the audio; there are wall hangings, wood paneling, a bit of woodsy green through a window. Carlson holds his own Teleprompter controller and wears a suit with a pocket square. The overall look is talk-show "Green Acres," or Ron Swanson if he shaved and went to prep school.
As a production, "Tucker on Twitter" looks less like a newscast than one of the improvised lockdown shows that late-night talk hosts recorded from home in the early Covid days of 2020. But in this case, Carlson's quarantine is self-inflicted.
Fox abruptly let him go in April, after the investigation in its now-settled litigation with the voting software company Dominion turned up a racist text message and misogynistic slurs from him, as well as statements disparaging Fox executives. It's not clear whether streaming on Twitter violates Carlson's contract with Fox, which lasts until early 2025.
But commentators gotta commentate, and the time off in the woods has not mellowed Carlson. He gives the barest intro --"Hey, it's Tucker Carlson!"-- before giving a rundown of the dam explosion in Ukraine that would go down in the Kremlin like the smoothest vodka. "Any fair person would conclude that the Ukrainians probably blew it up," he says, given that the dam, located in a region taken by Russia in an invasion, was "effectively Russian."
Carlson also called Volodymyr Zelensky, the Jewish president of Ukraine, "a persecutor of Christians" and described him as "shifty, dead-eyed" and "sweaty and ratlike." For years, Carlson laundered far-right fringe rhetoric and bigotry on Fox, and there is no sign that, in the anything-goes regime of Elon Musk's Twitter, the laundry is shutting down.
Carlson's rhetoric has not diminished, but his production has. In the 10-minute first episode, there are no guests, no produced segments, a handful of news-footage clips. It's pure monologue, from the opening Ukraine comment to the offhand swipes at diversity and transgender women to a closing bit on a whistle-blower who contends that the U.S. government possesses material from extraterrestrial aircraft.
It's a Tucker Carlson show, in other words. A big question is whether Carlson can be what he once was without the Fox News platform and production resources.
Fox has ideology, of course (which has cycled through different flavors of conservatism over the decades), but it also has an aesthetic. Its shows are produced to be glossy and urgent, to convey a sense of slick confidence. Fox News is designed to look like it is broadcasting from the top of the world; "Tucker on Twitter" looks not unlike something livestreamed after the apocalypse.
Others -- Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck -- have failed to reclaim their peak influence after losing their Fox perches. Carlson could be different; Fox News has yet to recover in the prime-time ratings from his sudden departure.
But Carlson, for all his anti-elite posturing, is wholly a creature of legacy TV, having hosted shows on Fox, CNN and MSNBC. He is a houseplant grown under corporate studio lights, even when they were installed in his rural Maine town for him to broadcast remotely to Fox.
On the other hand, it's possible that the pivot to lo-fi Twitter is more of a match for the current incarnation of Carlson. Whether he is holding forth on Russia or immigrants or the Jan. 6 riot, he has one persistent meta-theme: The elites are controlling your information and telling you what you're allowed to say. "Go ahead and talk about something that really matters and see what happens," he says at one point, seeming to allude to his firing by Fox while casting himself as a free-speech martyr. "If you keep it up, they'll make you be quiet. Trust us."
Within this rhetorical framework, it is not necessary to prove that aliens have been discovered on Earth or that Ukrainians blew up a Ukrainian dam. It is enough for Carlson to say They don't want you to believe it, and the viewer can accept the idea for the sake of sticking it to them. They say you're wrong, you're crazy, you're a racist. Well, what do they know?
It is a premise made for social media, as many a red-pilled YouTuber and Facebook proselytizer has found. The premise of his appeal -- that he is the one teller of truth, and you the one critical thinker, in a world of shepherds and sheep -- dovetails with the idea of booting up your computer to seek out a man giving speeches from his den.
It also dovetails with the interests of Twitter's owner, Musk, who styles himself as a heterodox freethinker -- whose heterodoxy happens to be expressed through reinstating right-wing trolls and hosting the Republican presidential campaign announcement of Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor.
But since 2017, Carlson has made himself likely the most influential broadcaster in conservative politics by posturing as an outsider on the inside. However well he can monetize a Twitter audience, it's another matter to retain as much political-cultural power as an outsider on the outside. Nor do we know if this is a real transformation or just a stopgap until Carlson is contractually free to go back on TV.
Until then, the truth is out there, and so is Tucker Carlson -- whether or not they are necessarily in the same place.

Hong Kong Seeks to Halt Online Play of Protest Anthem: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Efforts to ban "Glory to Hong Kong," a song popularized during pro-democracy protests in 2019, could set up a legal battle between tech giants and Hong Kong.
After "Glory to Hong Kong" emerged as the unofficial anthem of pro-democracy demonstrators in 2019, the government of Hong Kong has tried to stifle its use. It has banned the song from schools. When it was played in error last year instead of the Chinese national anthem at a rugby match in South Korea, the Hong Kong government demanded an investigation.
This week the authorities asked a court to ban the public performance and online dissemination of "Glory to Hong Kong." The move could ensnare U.S. technology companies like Google and set up the first legal test of how much control the Hong Kong government can wield over online content.
Hong Kong is seeking to prohibit the distribution or reproduction of the song "in any way," including adaptations of its "melody or lyrics," the government said in a statement on Tuesday. It said the song had been used to "insult" the Chinese national anthem, "The March of the Volunteers," causing "serious damage to the country" and to Hong Kong. A date for the court to hear the request has not been set.
The Hong Kong authorities previously criticized Google for displaying the protest song under search results for Hong Kong's national anthem.
"We've already sent a request to Google to pin the correct national anthem, but, regrettably, Google refused," said Chris Tang, the Hong Kong security secretary, at a news conference in December. "I find this explanation unthinkable, and the Hong Kong people will not tolerate it."
The government's request for a court injunction against the protest song, made on Monday, is the latest attempt by Hong Kong to root out the remaining vestiges of political dissent in the city, a former British colony that once enjoyed more political autonomy. Under China's president, Xi Jinping, Hong Kong has undergone a stark shift from its days as a prosperous hub for foreign businesses to a frontier in Beijing's campaign to safeguard national security.
Last week, an annual vigil held on the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing was shut down by officers, who arrested and detained protesters and suspected mourners.
In applying for the court injunction against the Hong Kong protest anthem, the government cites its national security law, which was enacted in 2020 and gave Beijing sweeping powers to crack down on what it deemed to be political crimes, including separatism and collusion.
If granted, a court injunction would most likely make moderating content in Hong Kong more complicated and expensive for U.S. tech companies, said George Chen, managing director for the Asia Group, a consulting firm, and former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta. He said the government's decision to use the courts was "opening the floodgates."
"Glory to Hong Kong" can be found in Hong Kong on such platforms as Meta's Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet.
According to Ming Pao, a centrist Chinese-language newspaper, the court application cited 32 links on YouTube related to the song.
Google and Meta declined to comment. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. technology companies typically follow the rules of the countries and regions where they operate and, at times, remove content. The potential scope of an injunction in Hong Kong was not clear. Critics say the national security law was written with the intent of policing conduct even outside Hong Kong.
"Anyone in the world can violate the Hong Kong national security law," said Lokman Tsui, former head of free expression for Asia Pacific at Google. "The question is whether this injunction is similar in scope."
Refusal to comply with a decision by a Hong Kong court could endanger a company's staff and business in the region, Mr. Tsui added.
For now, the efforts to suppress the song appear to have driven a wave of interest in it: On Wednesday, eight different versions of "Glory to Hong Kong" topped the singles charts of iTunes in Hong Kong.
For years, even as China has been largely closed off to foreign internet companies, Hong Kong remained an exception -- a hub where foreign businesses could operate relatively free of the censorship controls they would face on the mainland.
The escalation of the Hong Kong government's efforts to proscribe speech could further damage the city's image as a financial and economic center for China and Asia, said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a think tank in Washington.
"We've already seen many multinational businesses move their personnel to Singapore and other places," Mr. Lam said. "Now there will be less multinationals choosing to base themselves in Hong Kong."
"This is another nail in the coffin for Hong Kong," he added.

The owner of a Long Island funeral home was charged on Wednesday with spraying an insecticide at police officers guarding the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
The man, Peter G. Moloney, 58, was arrested in the Justice Department's sprawling investigation of the mob attack. He was also accused of attacking members of the news media outside the Capitol, according to charging documents unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington.
Prosecutors say that Mr. Moloney, of Bayport, N.Y., showed up at the Capitol in a bicycle helmet and protective eyewear, carrying a canister of Black Flag Wasp, Hornet and Yellow Jacket Killer. After he approached a line of officers arrayed behind metal barricades on the west side of the building, prosecutors said, he sprayed several of them with the insecticide.
Mr. Moloney was released from custody on a $ 100,000 bond at his initial appearance at Federal District Court in Islip, N.Y. Outside the courthouse, his lawyer, Edward Heilig, said Mr. Moloney's next court appearance was on June 20.
"He's presumed to be innocent at this time," Mr. Heilig said.
Mr. Moloney was also charged with taking part in an assault on an Associated Press photographer, John Minchillo, whom several rioters accused of being a member of the leftist movement antifa. Prosecutors say that Mr. Moloney grabbed Mr. Minchillo's camera, causing him to stumble down some stairs outside the Capitol, then joined others in punching and shoving him until eventually the photographer was pushed over a wall.
In a separate attack, prosecutors say, Mr. Moloney yanked the camera of another photographer and caused him to stumble down the stairs as well.
Several other rioters have been charged with attacking Mr. Minchillo, including a Pennsylvania man, Alan W. Byerly, who was sentenced in October to 34 months in prison.
Another man who has admitted to joining in the assault, Rodney K. Milstreed, is set to be sentenced next month. In a Facebook post a few days after the assault, Mr. Milstreed said that attacking Mr. Minchillo was "worth it," adding that he had "hit him with everything god give."
The charges filed against Mr. Moloney were a reminder that even two and a half years after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol, federal authorities are continuing to make arrests.
As of Tuesday, the Justice Department said more than 1,040 people had been charged in connection with the riot. Prosecutors have told several judges in Washington that there could be as many as another 1,000 people who eventually face charges, according to people familiar with the matter.
About a dozen people have been charged, like Mr. Moloney, with attacking members of the news media or destroying their equipment on Jan. 6. Another 350 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers at the Capitol, including more than 100 who used a deadly or dangerous weapon, according to the Justice Department.
Department officials say that about 140 officers were attacked on Jan. 6, among them 80 from the Capitol Police and 60 from the Metropolitan Police Department.
Mr. Moloney's case appears to be the first in which someone was accused of using insecticide as a weapon against the police. In other cases, defendants have been charged with attacking officers with bats, sticks, batons, flag poles, fire crackers, fire extinguishers, various types of chemical sprays, a hockey stick and even a skateboard.

Full text: It's been a tough run for Meta, and the boss seems to be getting out some aggression with military-style endurance routines and Brazilian jujitsu.
Close your eyes. Picture Mark Zuckerberg. What do you see?
Perhaps you envision the Meta boss and Facebook founder in a gray T-shirt, spotlighted on a Silicon Valley stage. Maybe his cartoonish metaverse avatar hovers before you -- with legs, or without them. Possibly Jesse Eisenberg, the bony actor who played the fledgling tycoon in "The Social Network" (2010), appears in your mind's eye.
But it's unlikely you conjure anything like the image Mr. Zuckerberg posted to Instagram (which Meta owns) and Facebook on Monday.
The mirror selfie shows the social-media billionaire wearing a camouflage flak jacket while glistening faintly with sweat. His neck swells wider than his jaw. His shoulders are capped with muscle. His forearms bulge.
He looks -- to use a scientific term -- completely shredded. He also looks completely focused, like a guy in a Michael Bay movie who just finished a dangerous mission, or at least the Raya profile picture of the actor who plays that guy.
Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a caption that he had just done the Murph Challenge, a Memorial Day workout and fund-raiser named for the Navy SEAL officer Michael P. Murphy, who died in Afghanistan in 2005. The challenge consists of a mile run, followed by 100 pull-ups, followed by 200 push-ups, followed by 300 squats, capped off with another mile run, all while wearing a 20-pound vest.
Just as eye popping as Mr. Zuckerberg's arms was the time he said the brutal routine took him: under 40 minutes. That's an elite time according to Dr. Joshua Appel, the Veterans Affairs physician who helped popularize the workout, which has become a staple in CrossFit gyms.
So when, exactly, did Zuck decide to go Rambo? And why?
Mr. Zuckerberg did not respond to a request for comment about his physical fitness.
"He looks great," said Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist, former Facebook vice president and longtime friend of Mr. Zuckerberg's. "But I don't think he's doing it for looks. I think he's doing it because he's really into jujitsu." (Though Mr. Zuckerberg's photo suggests that he may be feeling himself, at least a little.)
That would be Brazilian jujitsu, the grueling grappling-based combat sport that is a fundamental part of mixed martial arts. In an August 2022 appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had taken up martial arts during the pandemic, training with Dave Camarillo, a well-known coach in the Bay Area.
"The crazy thing is it really is the best sport," Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Rogan at the time. "There's something that's just so primal about it." (Mr. Rogan is a martial arts enthusiast and Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator.)
According to Casey Johnston, a cultural critic who writes frequently about exercise and strength training in her newsletter She's a Beast, sports like Brazilian jujitsu appeal to a desire among Silicon Valley types to reconnect with a primitive fighting spirit, but on their own, highly formalized terms.
"It's like being on a playground with a bully but in this new framework," she said. "It's not quite choreographed but the stakes and the rules are unambiguous."
On May 6, Mr. Zuckerberg competed in his first Brazilian jujitsu event, in Woodside, Calif., where he defeated an Uber engineer and won two medals, and lost consciousness. José Lucas Costa da Silva, a veteran Brazilian jujitsu fighter who refereed one of Mr. Zuckerberg's matches, said that he halted the bout after he heard Mr. Zuckerberg start to snore, a sign of someone who has passed out in a choke hold.
"This is something we are trained to know," said Mr. Costa da Silva, who added that Mr. Zuckerberg was a good sport who was "enjoying the moment."
After this article was published Friday afternoon, both Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Camarillo reached out and said that the Meta boss had not lost consciousness.
"That never happened," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an email. According to Mr. Camarillo, Mr. Costa da Silva mistook his student's effortful grunting for snores.
"This was his first tournament, but it didn't seem like it," said Danny Patalot, the chief executive of BJJ Tour, which organized the daylong event at a local high school. "He was aggressive using technique. There was no fear. That's not typical for a white belt competitor at a first tournament."
For Mr. Zuckerberg, who has absorbed a number of metaphorical body blows over the past several years -- including an election meddling scandal, a ghost town metaverse and widespread layoffs -- it is perhaps a revealing time to start fighting back.
Mr. Zuckerberg is, of course, not the first tech titan to add significant amounts of muscle. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, has, in his 50s, developed remarkable biceps, linebacker shoulders and impressive vascularity. But some of Mr. Zuckerberg's friends say the new regimen is not exactly a surprise.
Though Mr. Zuckerberg entered the popular imagination as an indoor cat -- the millennial archnerd outsmarting the strapping regatta princes of Harvard -- the 39-year-old has been devoted to physical activity for much of his life. He was the captain of his prep school fencing team and became an avid runner in the 2010s.
According to Mr. Lessin, Mr. Zuckerberg goes through phases with new sports, including roller hockey and surfing, a hobby that was immortalized in an image of the magnate afloat in Hawaii, a haunting mask of sunscreen slathered on his face.
"He sees them as super-fun side quests," Mr. Lessin said.
Famously competitive, Mr. Zuckerberg is the "great physical instigator" of his friend group, Mr. Lessin said, and frequently proposes physical challenges. "We've been on trips where he'll say, like, 'I'll race you up that mountain."' And on Mr. Rogan's podcast, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he had successfully encouraged many of his friends to train in Brazilian jujitsu with him.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg has a passion for benchmarking. In April, he posted a photo of a stopwatch appearing to confirm that he had run five kilometers in under 20 minutes. And though many commenters were skeptical of his Murph Challenge time, Mr. Zuckerberg clarified that he had done a special, easier-but-still-painful version, in which the exercises are performed in circuits.
Also performing a modified version of the Murph challenge: Two of Mr. Zuckerberg's three daughters. He posted a picture of the girls mid-push-up, in the midst of a "quarter-Murph (unweighted)" -- a clarification that the children were not wearing flak jackets.

Dispute Takes Deadly Turn With Gunshot Through Door: [Express]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ajike Owens, a mother of four, had gone to a residence in Ocala, Fla., to confront a neighbor after a dispute involving her children. The neighbor has not been identified.
A woman in Ocala, Fla., who confronted a neighbor who had thrown an object at her children, was shot and killed "through the door" of the residence, the local sheriff said, in a case that is complicated by the state's "stand your ground" law after days without a decision on possible charges.
Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said his deputies had initially responded to "a trespassing call" on Friday at about 9 p.m., but by the time they had arrived, they found "the victim suffering from a gunshot wound."
Ajike Owens, 35, a mother of four, was given first aid and taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the sheriff's office said. The shooter, a woman, has not been identified by the authorities.
The sheriff said the confrontation came after "a neighborhood feud over time" and "there was a lot of aggressiveness" at the door, "whether it be banging on the doors, banging on the walls and threats being made," though he noted that it was an incomplete account of the dispute. Sheriff Woods did not offer many details on how the shooting unfolded, saying his office did not have all the facts and citing an ongoing investigation.
The civil-rights attorney Ben Crump, speaking for the Owens family, complained in a statement on Facebook that the shooter "HASN'T been arrested or charged with anything by law enforcement for the unjust killing."
Ms. Owens, a Black woman, had gone to the neighboring home to retrieve an iPad that her children had forgotten after playing in a nearby field, and that the woman, who is white, had taken, Mr. Crump said in the statement.
At a news conference in Ocala on Monday, the family of Ms. Owens, their legal team and community leaders called on the authorities to arrest the shooter, saying that everyone knew who she was.
Pamela Dias, Ms. Owens's mother, said that one of her daughter's children, a 9-year-old boy, had been standing next to his mother when she was shot.
"She was rendered voiceless," Ms. Dias said. "We are here on her behalf. We are here on behalf of the four kids that are left behind, without a mother."
Sheriff Woods said he had received multiple messages of concern about the shooting and about the pace at which the investigation was unfolding, adding that his office's investigators have been working on the case since the night of the shooting and that his office has been in talks with the Florida attorney general's office.
"Anytime something this tragic happens, there are always a lot of questions," he said at a news conference on Monday. "A lot of people don't understand how the laws in the state of Florida sometimes work."
The sheriff said that Florida's "stand your ground" law, which allows persons to defend themselves with force if they reasonably believe they have been threatened, makes it so that investigators need to rule out "whether deadly force was justified or not before we make an arrest."
Ms. Owens's shooting is the latest of similar incidents that have renewed focus on the legal protections for people who say they have feared for their safety. Some have involved cases where victims have mistakenly approached the wrong house.
Florida is one of about 30 states that have "stand your ground" laws, where self-defense protections apply in any place a person has a legal right to be, not just at home.
Local leaders who attended the news conference with the sheriff voiced support for the investigation and urged the community to remain calm while it takes place.
Mr. Crump and Anthony D. Thomas, another attorney working with the family, issued a statement describing what they said happened. It said Ms. Owens's children had been playing in a field next to an apartment complex, when the woman yelled at them to get off her property and used racial slurs. The children left, forgetting an iPad. When one of them returned to retrieve it, the woman threw it at them, hitting the child, it said.
When her children told her what had happened, Ms. Owens crossed the street with them to speak to the woman, the lawyer said. She knocked on the door, and the woman "allegedly shot through the door, hitting AJ," the statement said, using Ms. Owens's nickname.
Asked to confirm whether Mr. Crump's statement was accurate, Sheriff Woods said that "some of it is, some of it isn't." He said the item thrown at the children was a pair of skates. He did not have information about how many shots were fired.
There were about "six to eight" reports of wide-ranging disputes in an ongoing feud between the woman and Ms. Owens about the children, including about where they had been playing, he said.

Conspiracy? No. Concern Over Voting.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As election activists rally against new voting machines, they are drifting into territory now dominated by conspiracy theorists.
For decades, Lulu Friesdat made election integrity her life's work. Drawing support from activists and academics, she co-founded Smart Elections, a nonpartisan group that is opposed to some voting machines that Ms. Friesdat believes would increase wait times and cost a small fortune to purchase and maintain.
But since 2020, things have changed. Former President Donald J. Trump catapulted concerns about voting machines into the Republican mainstream by falsely claiming that the 2020 election was rigged, partly because of electronic voting machines.
Election integrity advocates, like Ms. Friesdat, now find themselves in an uncomfortable position, pushing for election security while sometimes amplifying claims made most vocally by conspiracy theorists, including those involved in the so-called Stop the Steal movement.
Some election activists warn that election machines could be hacked or compromised, for example, while some conspiracy theorists say, without evidence, that those hacks have already taken place. Election officials say no hacks have taken place.
Misinformation watchdogs say the somewhat overlapping arguments illustrate another consequence of Mr. Trump's false and exaggerated voter fraud claims, which have led to doubts about election integrity among a wide swath of the American public. Ms. Friesdat and other activists like her fear that their work may become too closely tied to conspiracy theorists and Mr. Trump's cause, making potential allies, like progressives, wary of joining the fight.
"If you read an article that says that these voting machines are coming in, and people's concerns about these issues are very similar to those of the Stop the Steal movement, then it makes it very hard for Democrats to work on this issue," Ms. Friesdat said. "And it has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with the Stop the Steal movement."
Misinformation watchdogs say the two movements could erode trust in American elections even further, intentionally or not, because conspiracy theorists tend to exaggerate legitimate criticisms to rile up supporters and raise questions about the entire electoral system.
"You sow a seed of doubt, and that will grow and fester into a conspiracy theory," said Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies misinformation on social media. "It always starts off with one untruth, and that grows into two untruths, and that grows into more, and before long you have an entire conspiracy theory on your hands."
The debate has played out nationally as multiple states have faced pushback on electronic voting machines. It is now happening in New York, where officials are considering certifying new voting machines made by Election Systems & Software, a manufacturer based in Omaha. The company has been targeted in Mr. Trump's voting fraud narrative, alongside competitors like Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Yet ES&S and its machines have also come under scrutiny by election activists and security experts.
The new machines, ExpressVote XL, use an "all-in-one" design: Voters make their selections on a 32-inch touch-screen, which also prints their votes on a narrow summary card. Unlike a traditional ballot, the card records the votes in bar codes at the top of the paper, which the machine reads electronically, followed by a written summary of each pick.
Ms. Friesdat and good-government groups like Common Cause, a nationwide watchdog focused on government accountability, have campaigned against the machines for years, saying they are costly and could lengthen voter lines. They also warn that voters may not always consult the summary cards, causing mistakes to sneak through.
But some activists have gone further, wandering into territory now dominated by conspiracy theorists. In one Facebook post, Smart Elections wrote that the machines can "add, delete, change votes on your ballot" -- a claim nearly identical to those made by election deniers after the 2020 election.
ES&S wrote in an emailed statement that its machines were secure and that voters managed to complete their ballots quickly. It emphasized that the ExpressVote XL could handle multiple languages at once and support voters with disabilities. Though the company said the machines cost about $ 10,000 each, on average, it added that states would save money over time because they would not have to preprint traditional ballots in multiple languages and because the new equipment would eliminate redundancies.
The machine is widely expected to be certified soon in New York after enduring a rigorous third-party security assessment.
ES&S has used the claims about potential hacks to attack those opposed to adopting its machines. ES&S said the fear that its machines could be hacked was "a conspiratorial claim used in the aftermath of 2020." It threatened to sue Smart Elections, calling its claims about the machines "false, defamatory and disparaging."
Smart Elections responded that its views were backed by experts and otherwise protected as opinion.
The fear of hacking remains the most extreme risk highlighted by election activists, and it is among the false explanations offered by election deniers for how President Biden won in 2020. Election security experts say election officials must behave as though a hack is possible, creating audits and transparent processes that allow vulnerabilities to be detected and fixed before they are exploited.
But there was no evidence that the 2020 election was influenced by hacking or compromised machines, and many officials said the threat of hacking should not be blown out of proportion.
"I compare it to saying that the gold stored in the basement of the Federal Reserve Bank on Wall Street is subject to be stolen," said Douglas Kellner, a co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, which is responsible for ultimately certifying the machines.
"Theoretically, if you aligned all of the attack elements against the numerous security protocols it would be theoretically possible to steal the gold out of the Federal Reserve," Mr. Kellner said. "But it's not particularly realistic."

For-Profit College in U.K. Made Millions by Promising Students Money: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Oxford Business College and others like it make millions, largely by recruiting immigrants. They operate in an opaque corner of the British education system.
College recruiters walked immigrant neighborhoods, knocking on doors or stopping people in shopping malls, selling the merits of a business-school education and adding a surprising offer: Get paid to enroll.
"Money, money, money," said Stefan Lespizanu, a former recruiter for Oxford Business College. "Everybody was saying, 'Hey, push the money."'
News of the opportunity spread, propelled by Facebook groups and word of mouth. Whole families signed up, helping turn a vocational school of 41 students atop a Chinese restaurant into a for-profit juggernaut. Oxford Business College, unaffiliated with the elite school nearby, now has several campuses and more than 8,000 students. That transformation made millions of dollars for its owners, company records show.
Years of free-market changes to British higher education have created opportunities for for-profit schools like Oxford Business College. Through opaque partnership deals with publicly funded universities, schools can offer undergraduate degrees and get access to the British government's student aid. Some are marketed as ways to get an easy degree and quick money, in the form of about $ 16,000 a year in government loans for living expenses.
"Join a university without any qualification and get up to 18,500 pounds," one advertisement on Facebook reads, listing no school, only a phone number and the money figure, which is about $ 23,000. Dozens of similarly anonymous posts appear on Facebook groups for Eastern Europeans in Britain.
"Do you want to study at the easiest university in U. K.?" asks another ad. "Do you need additional income?"
Higher-education experts say that partnerships between publicly funded universities and for-profit schools like Oxford Business College can prepare older students and those in underserved areas for better careers. Oxford Business College offers two-day-a-week schedules to working students and others who take nontraditional paths to higher education. Some students said the college offered opportunities that they otherwise would not have, and a national student survey showed strong approval ratings.
Many of the partnerships are new, and it is difficult to determine whether they help students land higher-paying jobs after graduation. The data, in general, is murky.
What is clear is that schools are making money in a fast-growing corner of the world-renowned British university system with little oversight. Regulators say the system is vulnerable to exploitation.
Oxford Business College has at least three partnership deals with accredited, publicly funded universities. Every new student admitted under these deals means tuition money for both the college and its publicly funded partner.
That created huge incentives to enroll students, former recruiters and interviewers recalled. Recruiters, known as "sales executives," said they were paid based on how many students they enrolled. Some students who struggled to speak English were admitted, according to more than a dozen students and former staff members.
Even applicants who plagiarized answers on admissions tests were given a second chance or, in at least one case, put forward for admission, according to internal messages among the interviewers, who tested the applicants' English.
"He copied and pasted his answer from an online source," one interviewer wrote in a text message to his supervisor.
"Pass him," she replied.
Many students said they were happy with the chance to learn business principles and improve their English. But others wondered how they would repay their loans and whether the school was adequately preparing them for good jobs. Interviewers questioned whether, with such a lenient approach, the students they passed could benefit from an undergraduate education.
"I was thinking to myself that this person would struggle," said Jake Smith, a former interviewer. "But because I've been told from above that I should, I will pass them."
Oxford Business College declined repeated requests for interviews over several months. In written responses to questions, the school said it offered educational opportunities to a diverse student body. It has robust admissions standards that are consistent with its peers and rejects 60 percent of applicants, said the school's director and co-owner, Padmesh Gupta.
In an October memo about fraud risks, England's higher-education regulator, the Office for Students, said that partnership agreements were at risk of exploitation. "Students may be registered without appropriate checks that their language qualifications and skills are genuine," it wrote. Students may be pocketing living-expenses loans, it added, "without any intention of meaningful study."
Debates over for-profit colleges are common in the United States. In England, they have emerged only recently, following changes that have made the higher-education system more like its American counterpart.
But rules that exist in the United States are not in place in England. For example, Oxford Business College offered its students a "golden ticket" of £250, about $ 310, for everybody they referred who enrolled. That practice is prohibited in the United States.
One student said she had referred dozens of people, including her husband. He said that he did not attend class and had enrolled for the government student aid. His wife said that she did his schoolwork. The college said it has strong attendance figures.
This business model succeeds in large part because of how England funds higher education. Universities used to be largely free, financed by direct government spending. That money has been steadily replaced by tuition and student loans.
Those loans cover tuition for the school and living expenses for the students, who are required to repay the money only after making $ 34,000 a year.
Experts say it is good that schools tell low-income students that money is available. But the money should be pitched as a way to finance education, they said, not as the point of enrolling.
At Oxford Business College, that distinction was not always clear. One student even pulled out her bank card at the school, expecting payments on the spot, recalled Antonino Pilade, a former visual content producer for the college.
"I could no longer understand," he said. "Are we a bank, or are we a college?"
Buckinghamshire New University, the publicly funded school whose 2019 partnership propelled Oxford Business College's transformation, said that it had seen "no evidence of wrongdoing" but that it would pause recruitment through the college and assign staff members to oversee recruitment and academic programs there.
The University of West London, another partner, said it was confident that its students at Oxford Business College met the same admission standards. Ravensbourne University London, a third partner, did not respond to questions.
In a brief telephone interview, Titiksha Shah, a dress designer who owns 60 percent of Oxford Business College, said she did not know how the school runs on a daily basis.
It has changed in recent years, she said, to become a "government-funded college."
'Competitive and Desperate'
Partnerships between publicly funded universities and other schools, known as franchising arrangements, have been possible for years in Britain. But only recently have they have become so lucrative for colleges and a lifeline for the universities, experts say.
That is because direct government aid has all but dried up and tuition is capped by law. Universities, particularly those that cannot attract higher-paying international students, are scrambling for revenue.
"The market has got a lot more competitive and desperate," said Mark Leach, the founder of Wonkhe, a higher-education research organization in England. He called the nearly unchecked proliferation of for-profit schools through franchising a policy failure that would ultimately need reckoning with.
Ninety thousand full-time undergraduate students were enrolled as part of franchising arrangements in the past academic year. That number has nearly tripled in four years, according to the Office for Students.
Regulators do not conduct checks on partnership deals, and academic data is not broken out by franchise agreements, making it hard to tell how students perform. No public data exists on how many students each partnership has or who the partners are. The Office for Students said on Thursday that it was working to improve partnership data to help improve regulation.
None of the schools would discuss the terms of their deals.
The year before its deal with Buckinghamshire, Oxford Business College had about £25,000 in the bank and Buckinghamshire ran a deficit, corporate records show. The following year, Oxford Business College had more than £1 million on hand and Buckinghamshire was running a surplus, thanks to a broader growth strategy that included franchising, records show.
Under these arrangements, students attending Oxford Business College will graduate with a degree from a partner university.
Admissions Criteria
Laura Faria, a former sales executive, said that she had begun to play down the money in her pitches, fearing that it would tarnish the school's reputation. Soon, she said, she did not need to advertise at all.
"People were just bringing each other in," she recalled.
Oxford Business College said it marketed the loans because many first-generation students had no idea that money was available. Many of the students are immigrants, living and working legally in Britain.
Students who enroll at Oxford Business College enter through what is known as a foundation year, which helps them prepare for a bachelor's program. But they still must meet English language requirements. Internal messages show that interviewers tried to respect these standards, and the school offered free language classes to help unsuccessful applicants reapply.
But Mr. Smith, the former interviewer, said, "The guidance that I was told fairly explicitly was that the more students that the college gets, the more funding they get, so I shouldn't be so harsh."
Last summer, Mr. Smith sent his supervisor this excerpt from an admission essay: "Whomen mi wife en wi thinking to ghet him whit as hire to uk when i si his education i oz very hapy because mi mom ground hi very well."
The supervisor, Tayyaba Zia, told him to pass the student if he otherwise scored well. Mr. Smith said that he had already rejected him, and apologized.
These days, the school offers testimonial videos under grammatically incorrect headlines like "Why Alex feel fortunate?" and "Elizabeth have a dream."
'What's Going on Here?'
The payoff of an undergraduate education at Oxford Business College is hard to assess. Students who enrolled in 2019 are only now graduating.
The school, though, is faring well. In 2022, it earned about £6 million and had about £15 million in the bank, records show.
In interviews, some students said they were happy with their teachers and the program.
"It's an amazing thing to have a university diploma," said Loredana Stana, a student from Romania. She said she was learning principles that helped her run her beauty salons. She, her partner, her uncle and his wife all studied at Oxford Business College, she said.
Others said it was hard to thrive when classmates seemed to attend just for the money or struggled with English.
"Some of the people in the class -- at the beginning, they didn't speak English at all," said Lidia Lei, a third-year student from East Timor. "What kind of university is this? We were wondering what's going on in here. Like the university just wants to make money?"
Ms. Lei is set to graduate this year with a business management degree from Buckinghamshire New University. She questioned whether her education was worth the debt, and whether it had prepared her for a good career.
"I feel worry a lot," she said. "How am I going to manage to find this kind of job?"

To the Editor:
Re "Advisory Says Teens Face Risk on Social Sites" (front page, May 24):
While I agree with the sentiment in the article about the surgeon general's warning that social media may harm children and adolescents, I wonder why there is not more of an emphasis on what we can do than what we shouldn't do with social media.
As an aging millennial, I know that social media is here to stay. What if we invested in promoting content that improves, not harms, users' lives instead?
A wealth of research shows that engaging in art education builds strength across the life span and in the very workings of our brains. As the pandemic proved true for many, including me, social media is a robust art and arts education platform, from YouTube tutorials to communities of artists on Facebook to TikTok's short-form content teaching techniques.
Young people deserve the time and space to engage in the visual learning of art education, which can very well begin with the social media we fear.

Oxford, but Not That Oxford: How a Tiny For-Profit School Suddenly Got Big

OXFORD, England — College recruiters walked immigrant neighborhoods, knocking on doors or stopping people in shopping malls, selling the merits of a business-school education and adding a surprising offer: Get paid to enroll.
“Money, money, money,” said Stefan Lespizanu, a former recruiter for Oxford Business College. “Everybody was saying, ‘Hey, push the money.’”
News of the opportunity spread, propelled by Facebook groups and word-of-mouth. Whole families signed up, helping turn a vocational school of 41 students atop a Chinese restaurant into a for-profit juggernaut. Oxford Business College, unaffiliated with the elite school nearby, now has several campuses and more than 8,000 students. That transformation made millions of dollars for its owners, company records show.
Years of free-market changes to British higher education have created opportunities for for-profit schools like Oxford Business College. Through opaque partnership deals with publicly funded universities, schools can offer undergraduate degrees and get access to the British government’s student aid. Some are marketed as ways to get an easy degree and quick money, in the form of about $16,000 a year in government loans for living expenses.
“Join a university without any qualification and get up to 18,500 pounds,” one advertisement on Facebook reads, listing no school, only a phone number and the money figure, which is about $23,000. Dozens of similarly anonymous posts appear on Facebook groups for Eastern Europeans in Britain.
“Do you want to study at the easiest university in U.K.?” asks another ad. “Do you need additional income?”
Higher-education experts say that partnerships between publicly funded universities and for-profit schools like Oxford Business College can prepare older students and those in underserved areas for better careers. Oxford Business College offers two-day-a-week schedules to working students and others who take nontraditional paths to higher education. Some students said the college offered opportunities that they otherwise would not have, and a national student survey showed strong approval ratings.
Many of the partnerships are new, and it is difficult to determine whether they help students land higher-paying jobs after graduation. The data, in general, is murky.
What is clear is that schools are making money in a fast-growing corner of the world-renowned British university system with little oversight. Regulators say the system is vulnerable to exploitation.
Oxford Business College has at least three partnership deals with accredited, publicly funded universities. Every new student admitted under these deals means tuition money for both the college and its publicly funded partner.
That created huge incentives to enroll students, former recruiters and interviewers recalled. Recruiters, known as “sales executives,” said they were paid based on how many students they enrolled. Some students who struggled to speak English were admitted, according to more than a dozen students and former staff members.
Even applicants who plagiarized answers on admissions tests were given a second chance or, in at least one case, put forward for admission, according to internal messages among the interviewers, who tested the applicants’ English.
“He copied and pasted his answer from an online source,” one interviewer wrote in a text message to his supervisor.
“Pass him,” she replied.
Many students said they were happy with the chance to learn business principles and improve their English. But others wondered how they would repay their loans and whether the school was adequately preparing them for good jobs. Interviewers questioned whether, with such a lenient approach, the students they passed could benefit from an undergraduate education.
“I was thinking to myself that this person would struggle,” said Jake Smith, a former interviewer. “But because I’ve been told from above that I should, I will pass them.”
Oxford Business College declined repeated requests for interviews over several months. In written responses to questions, the school said it offered educational opportunities to a diverse student body. It has robust admissions standards that are consistent with its peers and rejects 60% of applicants, said the school’s director and co-owner, Padmesh Gupta.
In an October memo about fraud risks, England’s higher-education regulator, the Office for Students, said that partnership agreements were at risk of exploitation. “Students may be registered without appropriate checks that their language qualifications and skills are genuine,” it wrote. Students may be pocketing living-expenses loans, it added, “without any intention of meaningful study.”
Debates over for-profit colleges are common in the United States. In England, they have emerged only recently, following changes that have made the higher-education system more like its American counterpart.
But rules that exist in the United States are not in place in England. For example, Oxford Business College offered its students a “golden ticket” of 250 pounds, or about $310, for everybody they referred who enrolled. That practice is prohibited in the United States.
One student said she had referred dozens of people, including her husband. He said that he did not attend class and had enrolled for the government student aid. His wife said that she did his schoolwork. The college said it has strong attendance figures.

Full text: A couple had to cancel a South America trip for which they'd bought refundable tickets. The airline wouldn't cough up the cash, and they felt like they'd hit the brick wall of bureaucracy -- until our columnist stepped in.
Dear Tripped Up,
On June 3, 2022, my husband and I booked one-way tickets from San Diego to Buenos Aires, which cost $ 8,370, and a separate reservation returning a few weeks later from Santiago, Chile, for $ 4,500 for me, plus miles for my husband's ticket, all on United. Because of health issues, we intended to book refundable tickets. But we noticed right away from the email confirmations that the flights down were nonrefundable -- perhaps our mistake. I called United immediately, and an agent changed those tickets to refundable for a $ 300 fee. So far, so good. When we did eventually cancel the trip, the $ 8,370 was "refunded" as electronic travel certificates, which makes no sense. We paid with a credit card! Two follow-up appeals have been denied. Can you help? Ellen, La Jolla, Calif.
Dear Ellen,
The roadblock that separates you from your money is such a straightforward example of red tape that readers far and wide may want to gather their children 'round the screen or newspaper to hear a tale of just what grown-ups mean when they complain of "bureaucracy."
When airlines offer refunds, they are generally returned in the customer's "original form of payment." Paid with miles? Those miles are restored to your account. Paid by card? That charge is reversed. Presumably, if you chartered a jet with gold bullion, a Brink's truck would soon show up at your home.
And if you paid with an electronic travel certificate, or E.T.C., you get that certificate back to use for future travel. But wait, you paid with a credit card, right? Sort of. When you called United to switch to a refundable ticket, the agent first granted you an E.T.C. for your mistakenly booked tickets, then used that certificate to purchase your refundable tickets. So the technical "original form of payment" was an E.T.C., even if the original original form of payment was a credit card.
Though they twice refused to help you, when I contacted United, they quickly admitted the misstep. "This sort of complicated, somewhat Byzantine situation is very rare," Charlie Hobart, a United spokesman, told me over the phone. He said he had to ask Erin Jankowski, a spokeswoman who also joined the call, to use her experience in customer service to explain the intricacies of what had gone wrong.
The airline has now refunded you $ 8,370, the right way. "This was a misstep on our part, and it was done with good intentions, to expedite the process and ensure the customer had that refundable ticket," Mr. Hobart said.
But United should have corrected the issue upon your request, long before you wrote to me.
You told me that you are a retired attorney, but I pretty much already knew that from the crystal-clear, exasperation-free, 20-page, 10-exhibit PDF you sent me via email. The original documentation you submitted via United's online refunds form, was polite, complete and convincing. (United's policy is not to handle issues after a flight has occurred over the phone.) But it appears no one read it, at least not carefully.
A follow-up email you sent didn't fare much better. United suggested you "direct any further questions to the financial institution that issued the card," which you dutifully did, predictably to no avail.
This is not an issue unique to United. How does a big company enable customer service agents to deal with massive numbers of complaints but still read them carefully enough to pluck out the ones in which a complex chain of events clearly favors the customer? I'm glad it's not my job to make that happen.
My typical advice in situations like this is to complain rationally, respectfully and concisely through one customer service channel (say, calling or an online form), then another (email), then another (social media), hoping that eventually someone with the time and training to step in sees your point. Ms. Jankowski, the United spokeswoman, had a more specific suggestion. "In this case I do think our social care team -- which can be found on Twitter and Facebook 24-7 -- would have been really helpful in this situation," she said. "They have the expertise and means to escalate this to a refund specialist."
Mr. Hobart added that customers should not have to go through all this. "The customer went through the right avenues to get this addressed," he said. "Our goal is to address it early, to address it on the first attempt, and to address it correctly."
When I pressed United on what, concretely, could be done to be sure similar situations -- or different but equally Byzantine one -- were avoided in the future, he said that executives in the "customer leadership group" had been informed and were "keenly interested in this particular scenario."
"We're going to look at this and learn from it, use it as a way to avoid something similar in the future," he said.
Perhaps. But let's end by looking at what you, Ellen, did right here -- and then compare it to something I recently did wrong in my own travels. Realizing potential and unpredictable health issues might disrupt your plans, you elected to book refundable tickets, something many cheaper, less thoughtful fliers (i.e., me) often stubbornly refuse to pay extra for. Then, you carefully read the email confirmation you got (something I'm also guilty of not doing), immediately noticed an issue and called within 24 hours, when airlines are required to refund or rebook you, to correct it. In this case, the airline still erred in how it dealt with your refund, but you ultimately prevailed.
Earlier this week, I found a very cheap one-way flight from New York to São Paulo, Brazil, via Mexico City on Aeromexico ( $ 407!), and booked it, ignoring repeated offers from the airline to make the reservation changeable with a penalty, changeable without a penalty or even refundable for a bit more money. I declined, but the next day realized traveling on a different date would be better for me. It was just under 24 hours since my email confirmation had arrived, so I called Aeromexico to reschedule.
The hold time was long enough to put me over the 24-hour limit, so I braced myself for a fight. But when I finally got on with customer service, the agent politely shut me down before I could even go there: Though I had called within 24 hours of the email confirmation, the actual booking had occurred a half-hour earlier, so I was totally out of luck.
I considered huffing and puffing and pleading and blaming them for not sending the confirmation immediately, but I realized I was doubly at fault -- first for booking a no-changes, no-refund ticket, and then failing to keep track of exactly what time I had made the reservation. I said thank you and hung up. We all need to pick our battles.

Full text: The Ukraine conflict is causing soul-searching among the Doukhobors, a peace-loving group that emigrated to Canada in 1899.
When he was growing up among the Doukhobors, a pacifist religious group that emigrated to Canada from czarist Russia, J.J. Verigin would sometimes arrive home from school to find naked elderly women trying to burn down his family's house.
One attempt, in 1969, succeeded, lamented Mr. Verigin, 67, who recently recounted the episode. A blaze destroyed precious family artifacts, including correspondence between his great-great-grandfather, a prominent Doukhobor leader, and the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, an early admirer of the Doukhobors' pacifism and Christian morality.
The elderly women, Mr. Verigin explained, were part of a small and radical splinter group within the Doukhobors who periodically stripped naked and lit buildings on fire to protest land ownership and what they viewed as excessive materialism. Some among those charged with arson had another motive, he said: getting deported to Mother Russia.
These days, with the Ukraine war raging, most Doukhobors no longer aspire to return to Russia, said Mr. Verigin, who leads the largest Doukhobor organization in Canada and studied in Moscow in 1979. The fires, which for years grabbed headlines in Canada and polarized the Doukhobors, are also a thing of the past, he stressed.
"Pacifism is at the core of what it means to be a Doukhobor, and the war in Ukraine has ended any residual desire that remained to return to Russia," said Mr. Verigin, the executive director of the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ. "We feel the emotions of our Ukrainian brothers and sisters because we, too, have faced repression in Russia."
In the 18th century, the Doukhobors (the name comes from a Russian phrase meaning "spirit wrestlers") rejected the icon worship of the Russian Orthodox Church. They also resisted serving in the imperial military; in 1895, thousands of Doukhobor soldiers set fire to their weapons, which led to the group's violent suppression and exile.
Tolstoy devoted royalties from his novel "Resurrection" to help finance the Doukhobors' transit to Canada, and in 1899, more than 7,500 emigrated to what became Saskatchewan to help farm the Canadian prairies. In 1908, the majority resettled in the rural mountainous region in southern British Columbia, in sleepy farming and mill towns like Castlegar and Grand Forks.
An estimated 30,000 people of Doukhobor descent reside in Canada, and for decades they lived ascetic, communal lives reminiscent of the Quakers or Mennonites, though suffused with Russian culture and traditions. Historically, many were vegetarian and shunned alcohol. Their motto: "Toil and peaceful life."
Many Doukhobors in Canada still speak Russian among themselves; send their children to Russian-language schools; sing Russian hymns at weekly spiritual meetings; bathe in Russian-style steam baths; and eat traditional dishes like borscht.
But the Doukhobor way of life has been buffeted by intermarriage, the allure of city life and a younger generation drawn more to TikTok than Tolstoy. Today, Doukhobors are doctors, professors, lawyers, professional athletes and, in at least one case, a drag queen.
"Assimilation is a challenge to our way of life," Mr. Verigin said.
At a recent choir practice at a Doukhobor cultural center, Jasmine Popoff, 34, a nurse with purple hair, led her choir in a rousing version of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" -- in Russian -- followed by a spirited rendition in English of Queen's "Somebody to Love."
"As Doukhobors, it's important that our culture evolves so that we keep it going," Ms. Popoff said.
As the discussion turned to the war during a rehearsal break, choir members of all ages said they rejected the authoritarianism and militarism of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. "I don't feel any connection to Mother Russia because Russia isn't our mother," said one singer, Kelly Poznikoff.
Mr. Verigin said that, because of anger over the Ukraine conflict, several Doukhobors in recent months had been denied service in local shops in Castlegar.
In the past, prejudice against the Doukhobors in Canada has been fanned by the extremist splinter group, the Sons of Freedom, which in the 1920s began marching in nude protests and torching public buildings and homes. Members of the group opposed property ownership and public schooling for their children. In the 1950s, dozens of their children were forcibly sent to government boarding schools.
Among the last of the radicals was Mary Braun, who in 2001, at age 81, was sentenced to six years in prison after setting fire to a community college building in British Columbia. Before her sentencing Ms. Braun disrobed in court. She had previously gone on numerous fasts and lit small fires in courtrooms.
Nadja Kolesnikoff, a yoga instructor who grew up in a Sons of Freedom household, said she had been confused at age 5 when her paternal grandmother burned down her own house and was jailed for three years.
"We were supposed to be pulling together as a community," she said. "I never asked her why she did it."
But Ms. Kolesnikoff said her upbringing was also empowering. Her family used kerosene lamps and stored vegetables and fruits underground in winter. Luxuries were frowned upon.
"I learned to be self-sufficient, and to this day I feel there is nothing I can't do," she said by phone from Costa Rica, where she now lives.
At the Doukhobor Discovery Center in Castlegar, the museum director, Ryan Dutchak, said that some Doukhobors over the past decades had changed their Russian-sounding last names for fear of being ostracized. In Canada's 2021 census, only 1,675 people identified as Doukhobors.
"Being stigmatized has pushed some people away," he said.
Elders say preserving the Russian language holds the key to the group's survival.
On a recent Thursday, dozens of Doukhobors gathered for a spiritual meeting. Wearing colorful kerchiefs, blouses, skirts and aprons, the women sat on one side across from the men. On a table lay a loaf of bread, salt and a pitcher of water, traditional symbols of Doukhobor hospitality.
"Gospodi blagoslovi" -- Lord grant us your blessing -- they said before singing the Lord's Prayer in melodious Russian.
Standing at the front of his classroom at an elementary school in Castlegar, Ernie Verigin, a Russian teacher, acknowledged the challenges in preserving the Doukhobor faith. "The younger generation wants a quick fix, but spirituality is a lifelong process," he said. "It's hard to compete when my 14-year-old daughter is on Instagram and Facebook."
The competing pulls of Canadian, Russian and Doukhobor identity can be complicated.
AJ Roberts, 21, a video game designer in Vancouver who grew up in Castlegar, regretted that his Russian was rusty. But he is learning to make his own borscht, even if his mother brings him many jars on every visit.
"I am proud to be Canadian but I don't shy away from saying I am Doukhobor," he said. "Because of the war, I am more ashamed of saying I have a Russian background."

A Family Travel Plan: [Style Desk]

Full text: Mindful of costs, a reader wonders whether she and her husband are obligated to extend the same hospitality to their daughter's best friend as to their son's partner.
When my husband and I married, years ago, we created a blended family of children from our prior marriages. Together, we decided that travel was important to us, and we prioritized it: We stayed in our small house and drove used cars to pay for annual family trips. Now, the children are grown, but we want to continue taking them on vacations. So far, we have included our son's longtime partner. Our other two children are single, but we have a dilemma with our daughter's best friend and roommate. Our daughter asked if she could bring her on a recent theater outing. We weren't enthusiastic about spending $ 150 on a seventh ticket, but her friend had to work, so it became a nonissue. But what if this comes up on our next family vacation to Ireland? Do we have to pay for her? Are platonic partners on the same level as romantic ones?
MOM
I admire the care that you and your husband took to prioritize family experiences over possessions. I bet it wasn't easy; kids have a way of clamoring for stuff. But back then, you and your husband were the only adults. Now, there are five grown-ups. So it doesn't really matter how I rank these different relationships: You should talk to your children about this.
Now, if you and your husband have strong feelings here, game over! It's your money. But to me, your question suggests a desire to treat your children equally and to be respectful of relationships that are important to them. I can imagine someone prizing a best friend and roommate as highly as a romantic partner; I can also imagine someone who wouldn't. So ask your daughter how she feels. There are many ways to make a family; sex and romance are not required.
Going forward, gather the children and reiterate your commitment to family travel. Share your budget, and the total costs for immediate family members. Depending on the surplus, you can cover some (or all) of the travel costs of partners and chosen family members -- or you can throw those costs back to the children involved. Try to be openhearted, though. It will serve you better to be inclusive than to decide unilaterally which of your children's relationships matter more.
In the Right, but Keeping Quiet
My husband's father left his mother when my husband was 2. He didn't come back into my husband's life until he was on his third wife and my husband was 19. The wife has three daughters. Often, she talks about celebrations and explains that only family is attending -- without inviting us. My husband says he doesn't care, but this drives me crazy. Can I ask her to stop telling me about these events?
WIFE
I get your annoyance at having your nose rubbed in your exclusion. But I would keep quiet, for your husband's sake. It sounds as if he has a complicated history with his father, and he told you he doesn't care about this. I would hate for you to offend his stepmother (even though I understand your feelings) if it could lead to estrangement or awkwardness between father and son. This seems like his call to me.
The Sharp Smell of a Sweet Gesture
I began dating my generous boyfriend two years ago. His first gift to me was an expensive bottle of perfume. Unfortunately, it was too strong for me. A year later: another powerful and expensive scent. I suggested exchanging it, but he said: "No! It's a gift!" I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I would like to sell the perfumes and use the money for us as a couple. Thoughts?
GIRLFRIEND
Not every gift is going to be a humdinger. (It's a cliché for a reason: It's the thought that counts.) I also ride out gifts I don't care for if they have sentimental value: family heirlooms, for instance. But we're talking about store-bought perfumes here. Stop worrying about seeming ungrateful and start enjoying yourself.
Thank your boyfriend for his undisputed thoughtfulness, then exchange the perfume for something you like -- or resell it, if you prefer, and spend the money as you choose. (You don't have to buy something for the two of you!) I disagree with your boyfriend that you're saddled with these bottles forever simply because they were gifts. And, after two years together, why not tell him you're not much into scent? Many people aren't.
Harshing Grandma's Mellow
Last summer, when my family and I were visiting my grandparents in Colorado, I walked in on my grandma smoking weed. She didn't see me, but I still feel uncomfortable about it. Her health hasn't been great, and I am concerned. Relatives have asked me if I know anything, but I've kept my mouth shut. Should I confront my grandma or tell my family what I saw?
GRANDCHILD
Hang on! You saw your grandmother smoking weed one time. What makes you think it's a problem, or even related to her health issues? Unless there's a pertinent fact you haven't shared, I'd stay out of this. (If you're a young person -- just a hunch -- and feel burdened by what you saw, tell your parents.) And if you still want to talk to your grandmother, tone down the judgment and make sure to do some research into the impressive medicinal properties of cannabis first.

Social Media Blocked And Troops Deployed In Capital of Senegal: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Demonstrators battled with the police to protest a two-year prison sentence given to a leading opposition figure. At least nine people died in the confrontations.
The government of Senegal said on Friday that it has deployed the military in the capital, Dakar, and other cities and shut down social media platforms in response to Thursday's deadly clashes between protesters and security forces -- a new escalation of tensions rarely seen in the West African country.
Demonstrators took to the streets across the West African nation on Thursday shortly after a court convicted a leading opposition figure, Ousmane Sonko, on charges of "corrupting youth," while acquitting him on the major charges he had faced of rape and making death threats. Mr. Sonko was sentenced to two years in prison in a case that his supporters said was politically motivated.
Shortly after the verdict, demonstrators brawled with security forces, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people, according to the government.
Periodic demonstrations have broken out in Senegal since the arrest of Mr. Sonko in 2021 after a massage parlor employee accused him of rape. But the violence of Thursday brought tensions in Senegal, a largely peaceful country, to a new high. Protesters fought with security forces in multiple neighborhoods of Dakar, and parts of the city's main university were damaged. Supermarkets, train and gas stations were also burned down in several cities.
Senegal's interior minister, Antoine Felix Abdoulaye Diome, said the deaths on Thursday had occurred in Dakar and in Ziguinchor, a southern city where Mr. Sonko is mayor. In 2021, at least 14 people were killed in protests that followed his arrest.
Confrontations continued on Friday throughout several Senegalese cities and in several neighborhoods of Dakar, where schools and many business remained closed. Multiple faculty buildings at the city's Cheikh Anta Diop University were burned and ransacked, and classes for tens of thousands of students were suspended until further notice.
Abdou Karim Fofana, the government's spokesman, said the military had been deployed to keep order. He declined to say how many troops had been mobilized or where.
The government also blocked social media outlets, which Mr. Diome, the interior minister, said was necessary to prevent calls to violence and hatred from circulating widely.
As of Friday, Mr. Sonko's fate remained unclear. Security forces stationed around his house in Dakar, where he also keeps a residence, have prevented him from leaving for days. They have also, without warning, thrown tear gas at journalists, lawmakers and residents walking nearby.
Mr. Sonko, a 48-year-old former tax inspector who is popular among younger people, has accused the president of using court cases to sideline him. In return, the government of President Macky Sall has accused Mr. Sonko of calling for an insurrection and threatening Senegal's public order. His arrest could come at any time, Ismaïla Madior Fall, the justice minister, told reporters on Thursday.
Political and human rights observers have closely watched recent developments in Senegal because the country is set to hold its next presidential election in February, a contest seen as a test in a troubled region.
For now, the sentence bars Mr. Sonko from running in the election. He is not allowed to appeal the verdict because he was not present in court for the trial. But two of his lawyers and Mr. Fall, the justice minister, said that Mr. Sonko could secure a retrial if he surrendered or was imprisoned.
Senegal has long taken pride in its culture of peaceful dialogue, political pluralism and the absence of coups since gaining independence from France in 1960. But human rights defenders and political observers have raised questions about the arrests of journalists and dozens of political opponents in recent years, as well as the criminal charges brought against major opposition figures, including Mr. Sonko.
"There are expectations in the Senegalese democratic culture that the judiciary should be independent," said Catherine Lena Kelly, an expert on Senegalese politics at the African Center for Strategic Studies, a research group that is part of the United States Defense Department. "But there have been grievances during the Sall presidency about what some citizens consider to be the state selectively charging opposition leaders with criminal offenses."
On Friday, many Senegalese took to social media despite the ban to express their concerns about the escalation of violence. Some of the loudest messengers have been the players of Senegal's national soccer team. Most of them play abroad, but they are widely respected after winning the last Africa Cup of Nations, the continent's major tournament.
"Too much blood has been spilled over the past two years," the star player Sadio Mané wrote to his 14 million followers on Instagram, urging those behind the violence to bring back peace.
Whether those messages could be heard in Senegal while social media is shut down remained to be seen.
Babacar Ndiaye, a political analyst in Senegal, said that to his knowledge, the social media blackout was a first in the country.
"It's surprising to say the least," said Mr. Ndiaye, the research and publication director at Wathi, a Dakar-based research organization. "Social media have always been a space of free expression in Senegal, including yesterday when people exchanged information in real time about the clashes and the law enforcement response."
As of Friday afternoon, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and WhatsApp were not working, and many Senegalese had switched to virtual private networks, which get around such bans by masking a user's location.

Apple Is Stepping Into the Metaverse. Will Anyone Want to Follow?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Interest in the futuristic, immersive digital world is fading just as Apple plans to debut a virtual reality device.
Mark Zuckerberg embraced a digital world known as the metaverse when he said in November 2021 that he was changing his company's name from Facebook to Meta.
A month later, Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, wrote that within two or three years, he believed most virtual meetings would transition from two-dimensional grids of video "to the metaverse, a 3D space with digital avatars."
Soon after, Microsoft announced that it would spend $ 70 billion to buy the video game giant Activision Blizzard and said the deal would "provide building blocks for the metaverse."
But since then, interest in the metaverse has stalled. Technology investors have moved on to new trends like artificial intelligence. And some metaverse projects have been shuttered at companies like Disney and Microsoft, despite that burst of enthusiasm.
Enter Apple. At its Worldwide Developers Conference starting on Monday, the tech giant is expected to debut its virtual reality hardware product: high-tech goggles that blend together the digital and physical worlds.
The company is betting that it can tempt consumers with mixed reality products better than Meta, whose high-end Quest Pro headsets have not sold well, and that it can ignite mainstream interest in virtual reality in a way that other companies have not. The Apple headset is expected to cost about $ 3,000 and will look like ski goggles, according to current and former employees familiar with its development.
Apple has done this before. Eventual hits like the iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch started in niche markets that grew into big businesses. But even Apple executives have been skeptical about the company's prospects in virtual reality, which, they say, may still not be ready for its mainstream moment.
Apple declined to comment.
The idea of an immersive, all-encompassing online universe made more sense to many investors when people weren't leaving their homes during the height of the pandemic. Metaverse-related start-ups raised about $ 664 million in venture capital in the first five months of 2023, a drastic drop from the more than $ 2.93 billion they raised in the same period in 2022, according to data compiled by PitchBook. That drop-off cuts recent metaverse start-up investment to about a quarter of its peak in the first half of 2022, PitchBook said.
"The metaverse investment fad -- it came and went, and now people are focused on A.I.," said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company. "The people who were hopping on it because it was a sexy thing to talk about have hopped back off."
This year, Microsoft shuttered a virtual reality world, called AltspaceVR, that it acquired in 2017. The company also laid off some employees working on its HoloLens mixed reality headset and eliminated or reassigned teams that had been working on metaverse projects, according to a person familiar with the changes.
In a statement, Microsoft said it was still committed to the metaverse and pointed to the news that it was rolling out three-dimensional avatars for Microsoft Teams meetings.
Disney also laid off about 50 employees who had been working on metaverse projects, according to a person familiar with the cuts. News about Microsoft's and Disney's cuts was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
At Meta, Mr. Zuckerberg's plan to restructure the company around metaverse-centric technologies has been costly. Meta's hardware unit, Reality Labs, which includes its Oculus headsets, is responsible for a significant part of Meta's recent big increase in spending. That division lost about $ 4 billion in the first three months of this year.
Mr. Zuckerberg cautioned that building the metaverse would be a money-losing proposition with little promise of early returns. Still, it has taken much longer than he anticipated. In recent months, Mr. Zuckerberg and his lieutenants have spent more time talking up Meta's expertise in A.I., though he has bristled at the notion that the metaverse is no longer his focus.
"A narrative has developed that we're somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision," he said in a call with investors in April. "So I just want to say upfront that that's not accurate. We've been focusing on both A.I. and the metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both."
A Meta spokeswoman, Ashley Zandy, said: "We've always been clear that our metaverse vision is a long-term one, and nothing about that has changed. We are committed to our metaverse vision, and we're seeing good momentum."
On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg teased a version of the Meta Quest 3, the company's latest VR headset, which will cost $ 499 and may come this year. Consumers have spent more than $ 1.5 billion on apps and games in Meta's Quest app store to date.
For Apple, its new headset could be the beginning of a long-term plan that eventually leads to a more popular virtual reality product, like a lightweight pair of glasses.
Some analysts have suggested the company could take an experimental approach, gauging how early adopters use it and then making changes before marketing a future version to a broader audience. That would be similar to what it did with the Apple Watch. It was initially marketed as a general purpose companion to the iPhone but was later reframed as a fitness gadget.
Despite the decline in interest, many argue it's far too soon to write off the idea of the metaverse. Companies that had been preaching the metaverse well before Meta popularized it, like Roblox and Epic Games, are still committed to their long-term visions.
Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist who has written a book about the metaverse, said the mainstream attention to the concept after Facebook changed its name had spurred outlandish predictions about how soon people would be spending their time in immersive online worlds.
"This was more about timeline mismanagement," Mr. Ball said. "The intense focus on the metaverse within a short period of time, with some arguing it was here now or was about to be, was bound to disappoint many."
With their tens of millions of participants, user-generated content and digital economies, Roblox and Epic Games, which produces the battle royale game Fortnite, could provide a more compelling vision of a metaverse.
Roblox, a platform with millions of games often aimed at children, had 66.1 million daily users in the first quarter of 2023, a 22 percent jump from a year earlier. Craig Donato, the company's chief business officer, said that Roblox was working on expanding into other immersive online experiences, but that a full-fledged metaverse was still far away.
"We're very much in the first or second inning," Mr. Donato said.
In March, Epic Games released new tools designed to help Fortnite players create and make money from their own games on the company's platform, spurring the creation of an online economy in Fortnite -- a cornerstone of the vision of the metaverse preached by Tim Sweeney, the company's chief executive. Mr. Sweeney said mainstream interest for the metaverse attracted people who weren't really invested in the space.
"Unfortunately, a lot of people tried to attach themselves to that trend without really delivering the goods," he said. "But if you look at the trend, it's continuing to grow, and it continues to look like exponential growth."

In Guam, Thousands Still in Dark After Typhoon: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The storm was the strongest to strike the U.S. Pacific territory in at least two decades.
Thousands of people across the island of Guam remained without power, water and cellphone service on Friday, more than a week after the U.S. territory was pummeled by the strongest typhoon in at least two decades, which flooded homes, downed coconut and mango trees, and disrupted basic services.
"Losing water has been the hardest part," said Melinda Sanchez, 50, whose family lives in central Guam. Still, she said, island residents were familiar with storm-related disruptions. "We just go back to what we've learned to do during these times. We get through it."
The typhoon, Mawar, brought widespread flooding and 140 mile-per-hour winds, equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane, when it struck the island of 150,000 people in the Pacific Ocean on May 24, knocking out power across much of the territory. Now a tropical storm, Mawar forced the evacuation of 1.2 million people as it approached Japan on Friday.
No deaths were reported on Guam, which is home to bases for the U.S. Navy and Air Force, but officials said the restoration of basic services to some parts of the island could take several weeks.
The Guam Power Authority said in an update on Friday that electricity had been restored to just over 40 percent of customers, while the Guam Waterworks Authority reported that about half of the wells that supply most of the island's water were operational. About half of the island's cellphone towers were working by Thursday, officials said.
President Biden declared a major disaster for the territory after Mawar, allowing residents to apply for individual assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Hundreds of federal aid workers are on the island to support recovery efforts, the agency said, with help from the military, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The territory's governor, Lou Leon Guerrero, said on Facebook that the disruption to the island's communications systems had made recovery efforts more challenging but that in the week since the storm, "we have already made significant improvements to damaged infrastructure and restored critical public services."
Still, in an emergency session of the territory's Legislature on Tuesday, Jesse Alig, mayor of the village of Piti and the president of the Mayors' Council of Guam, criticized the response of the island's government and utilities, calling it slow and inadequate.
"Shame on us for making our people suffer," the mayor said, adding, "Mawar was nothing compared to what we're going through right now."
Nearly the size of Chicago and about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines, Guam is used to typhoons (as tropical cyclones are called in the Pacific; in the Atlantic, they are hurricanes). The last major storm, Typhoon Pongsona, came ashore in 2002 at Category 4 strength and caused more than $ 700 million in damage.
In an early assessment after Mawar hit last week, government officials estimated that the island's commercial sector had lost about $ 112 million, mostly because of building damage. A broader assessment of the storm's impact awaited the restoration of communications and other services.
The island's major medical center, Guam Memorial Hospital, was forced to rely on generators in the storm's immediate aftermath but has since had power restored, said Cindy Hanson, the hospital's spokeswoman. But the facility is still waiting to regain full access to the water system, she said.
Though no deaths had been reported, Ms. Hanson said the number of people receiving medical care at the hospital rose slightly over the past week. But that could be attributed in part to the number of pregnant women who had been advised to wait out the storm at the facility, which is the island's only public hospital.
Twenty-two babies were born there during the typhoon, Ms. Hanson said.
In the Agana Heights neighborhood of central Guam, Jessica Kim, 37, has been sorting through waterlogged wreckage since the wind ripped off the roof of her garage and floodwaters invaded her family's home last week.
Ms. Kim still had no power as of Friday, she said. And she could see that the trash was still sitting on the sidewalk -- including the food that she had removed from her warming fridge.
"We've all been hot, moody and short-tempered with each other," Ms. Kim said, adding, "But we're finding ways to have fun and entertain ourselves."

Ditch the Crowd With a Private Social Space: [Correction]

Full text: Alternative apps and shared photo albums let you set up your own exclusive club for online conversations and digital pictures.
Even before the recent TikTok bans and mental-health concerns from the surgeon general, public attitudes toward social media have evolved. Many people are moving to online communities on less-populated networks like Nextdoor to get away from the overload of influencers, advertisers, data-mining and political divisiveness that often dominate the larger mainstream platforms.
Facebook and other sites do offer the ability to make private groups. But if you're looking for a change, you can set up your own personal ad-free space with an exclusive membership elsewhere. Here's what you can do.
Getting Started
Before you make the leap to your own micro-social network, think about what you want it to be. Does your group mostly post photos, or are you looking for a place to share status updates, pictures, videos and links? And how will people log in -- iPhones, Android phones, tablets or desktop browsers?
Next, search your app store for "private photo sharing" or "private social media" to see your options.
Even if your group is comfortable just sticking with familiar methods like WhatsApp groups, message apps or Reply All emails, increased social activity can be costly for those with limited data or message plans. And if the focus is on photo sharing, be sure to consider an app or service that includes adequate file storage or the option to buy more space.
Paying Your Way
Private social media apps work much like the larger platforms with the sharing of status updates, comments, photos and videos (although they may lack tools like photo filters and video effects). In some cases, you pay a small fee -- but you can share without advertisements and fewer personal-information concerns.
For example, Kin requires the host of the private space to buy a subscription -- but everyone else can join the group free. A Kin "space" includes a Storyline feed for members to share photos and comments, a chat function and other familiar tools. Prices start at $ 4 a month for a plan with 50 gigabytes of storage and an unlimited number of members.
Photocircle is another option for a more visually oriented circle of friends and family. The app has an ad-supported version, but you can lose the ads and focus on everyone's fabulous photos by upgrading to a PhotoCircle+ subscription for about $ 8 a year per person.
Phone-Free Photo Sharing
If your primary objective is to share photos with everyone in your family -- including those who don't have a smartphone or who aren't particularly comfortable with technology -- you still have options.
For example, both Google Photos and Apple's Photos app support shared photo albums, in which multiple people can add, view and comment on pictures in that album from their phones, tablets and computer browsers. Use the Shared Album setting when creating a new album, then name it and add the email addresses of the people you want to see the photos. Once they accept your invitation, they can see the photos and get alerts when new images are added.
You can similarly share browser-based photo albums with selected people on Dropbox, Flickr, Shutterfly and scores of other online-storage services you may already use.
But what if you have a family member with an extremely limited technology tolerance -- but who still wants to see every single baby or vacation photo? An internet-connected digital picture frame may be the solution.
Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, tested several digital picture frames and recommends the $ 150 Aura Carver model for its sharp 10.1-inch screen and ease of setup; the $ 200 Aura Mason frame was also noted for its display of photos in the vertical portrait orientation. Once you connect the frame to the internet for your recipient, you and the rest of the family can upload thousands of photos to it from the Aura smartphone app.
Big Events for Small Groups
Keeping selected people up-to-date on your major life milestones is another reason to use a private social space. For example, you can use the nonprofit CaringBridge platform to create a free, secure, ad-free site to share serious health news with friends and family.
New parents are perhaps the biggest generators of photos with the need for privacy. And there are plenty of apps for that, including FamilyAlbum, (free or a $ 5 monthly premium version for features like longer videos), Honeycomb (free) and Sproutly (free; iPhone only).
No matter which app or service you use, read the company's privacy policy carefully and make sure you have your security locked to the world outside your chosen group. Even if you decide to also stay with your older social media platforms, review your privacy and security controls there, too. Wirecutter also has guides for the major social media and messaging apps.

Sudan's Army Suspends Cease-Fire Talks, Stalling Efforts to Deliver Aid to Millions: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move deals a blow to efforts to end the war and deliver humanitarian aid to millions of people nationwide.
Sudan's army has withdrawn from talks aimed at achieving a full cease-fire and delivering humanitarian aid across the country, it said on Wednesday, raising the specter of escalating clashes as a war between rival generals rages for a second month in Africa's third-largest nation.
The talks, facilitated by Saudi Arabia and the United States, were the only major ongoing official effort to mediate between the Sudanese Army and its paramilitary rival, the Rapid Support Forces. The army's withdrawal from the talks deals a blow to the attempts to decisively end the war, which has released a paroxysm of violence and chaos that have killed hundreds of people and displaced millions more.
The army said in a statement posted to its Facebook page that it was suspending its participation in the talks because the paramilitary forces had failed "to implement any of the provisions of the agreement and to continue violating the armistice." The paramilitary group said on Twitter that it was "unconditionally" backing the Saudi and U.S.-led initiative, and that the violations by the army had "not deterred us from honoring our commitments."
The talks began in the Saudi port city of Jeddah in early May and achieved limited results between the rival groups. The two sides first allowed for aid to come through and later agreed to a seven-day cease-fire that began on May 22. That truce was then extended for five days on Monday as both parties considered ways to allow for deliveries of more aid, the restoration of services like water and electricity, and the evacuation of their forces from urban areas including civilian homes and hospitals.
But even as the talks progressed, forces from the two sides continued to clash, including on Wednesday, with street fighting, drone attacks and airstrikes decimating the health care system and pushing civilians to continue to evacuate the capital, Khartoum, and the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri.
In recent days, the fighting also intensified in El Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan State, according to residents. On social media, each side continued to accuse the other of breaking the cease-fire.
Renewed clashes have also torn through the western region of Darfur, pushing thousands of people to flee and cross into neighboring Chad. This is particularly true of El Geneina, a city in West Darfur where the health facilities have been shattered and all 86 gathering camps for displaced people have been razed to the ground, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. A communications blackout has also kept the region cut off from the wider world for more than a week, raising fears of unreported deaths and the unfolding of a dire humanitarian crisis.
The conflict, which began on April 15, has led to the killing of 865 people and the injury of 3,634 others, according to the Sudan Doctors' Union. Almost 1.4 million people have been displaced, with 360,000 of them crossing into neighboring nations like Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan, according to the United Nations' refugee agency.
Organizations for journalists and local activists have also accused the warring parties of increasingly targeting their members with home raids and arrests. Factories, banks and small businesses have been looted or destroyed, further damaging an economy that was already ailing from high inflation, spiking food prices and the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The United Nations said this past month that it would need $ 2.56 billion to assist those affected.
The army, controlled by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, were long on the same side. In 2019, they helped remove the dictator Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who had held power for three decades. They also carried out a coup that toppled the civilian government in October 2021, effectively scuttling the country's nascent efforts to transition to democratic rule.
But over the past year, the two leaders began to fall out as they vied for supremacy over the northeast African nation -- tensions that resulted in open warfare in the capital last month.
As talks for a cease-fire were held in Saudi Arabia, leaders from the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an eight-nation regional bloc that includes Sudan, also hoped to agree on a road map for future political talks that would bring in various stakeholders including civilian participants. Efforts by the United Nations mission in Sudan to support the country's democratic transition were also recently thrown into limbo, when General al-Burhan called on its head, Volker Perthes, to resign.
On Tuesday evening, the army released a video in which General al-Burhan appeared among a group of cheering soldiers, saying the military was yet to use its "maximum strength." He added: "But if the enemy does not comply and does not respond, we will be forced to use the strongest force that we have."
With the breakdown of the talks in Jeddah, observers are now worried about a protracted conflict that could have serious regional ramifications.
"Sudan is not getting the high-level attention needed to prevent another failed state in the region," said Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a research organization. "Sudan is collapsing and, thus far, no one seems to be able to do anything to reverse it."

'Swarming' Keeps U.K. Beekeepers Busy: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's swarming season in Britain, with honeybee colonies splitting in half in search of new homes. This year, beekeepers say they are getting an unusually high number of swarm sightings.
The sight is one that beekeepers say is understandably intimidating to the ordinary person out for a walk: a sliver of sky suddenly darkening amid the collective roar of thousands of honeybees before they cluster on branches or bushes.
In Britain, the behavior, known as swarming, typically takes place from May to July and is a natural process in which a honeybee colony splits in half and leaves with a queen bee in search of a new home. But the country is currently experiencing a greater numbers of sightings for this time of year, most likely thanks to unseasonably warm weather that followed a cold, wet spell.
As a result, beekeepers and pest-control workers who catch the swarms are reporting a surge in calls for their help as members of the public spot the clusters in backyards, in chimneys and even on barriers along city streets.
"We're fully booked for the next four weeks," said Rob Davies, a pest controller in Shropshire, in central England, who specializes in dismantling and rebuilding structures like chimneys to rescue honeybees, adding that he was getting "ridiculous" volumes of people calling for assistance.
Some of the bee rescuers are even having to order new equipment to keep up with the demand.
Although it is difficult to determine an exact figure for the current level of swarms, the British Beekeepers Association, which has almost 30,000 members, said that many were seeing more swarms than usual. Traffic for the association's swarm removal site is up 19 percent compared with this time last year, said Ian Campbell, a spokesman.
"It's their form of reproduction on a mass scale," Mr. Campbell said of the honeybees. "But this year, it's seemed to come a bit earlier. It's seemed to come in force."
Francis Ratnieks, a professor of apiculture at the University of Sussex, said that a recent stretch of sunny, drier days in Britain had created optimal conditions for honeybee colonies to split off.
"It probably means that we're having half-decent weather for once," he said.
Alan Deeley, a beekeeper in Warwickshire in England's West Midlands, said the weather of preceding months was also a likely factor. Honeybee populations were strengthened last year by a long, hot and dry summer, he said, and then a period of cold, wet springtime weather that dragged through April meant that many beekeepers did not inspect their hives as frequently, for fear of exposing their bees to the cold.
"They were getting constrained in the hive, and that is a trigger for them to swarm," Mr. Deeley said of the bees.
He said that he had received at least twice as many calls reporting swarms this year, and that beekeepers can sometimes stop a colony from swarming, including by increasing a hive's capacity.
The bees have been drawing plenty of notice.
In Lancaster, a city in northwestern England, one swarm gained attention last week when it took a break on a metal pole on a stretch of sidewalk outside a real-estate agency's office. (One commenter on a Facebook post pointing it out joked that they must have simply been browsing for a new home.)
On the island of Guernsey, a crown dependency that neighbors Britain in the English Channel, the swarms have been so numerous that Debbie Cox, the secretary of the local beekeepers association, recently ran out of the usual equipment and resorted to using a cardboard box to pick up a melon-size swarm that had nestled in a backyard apple tree.
"It's almost like the bees all over the country have all decided this year they're all going to swarm," she said, adding the group had already received about 30 calls this season, compared with half a dozen last season.
Although honeybees are docile rather than aggressive when swarming, beekeepers say that people should still keep their distance if they spot a sizable cluster.
The insects are pollinators that perform a crucial role for biodiversity and agriculture, and concerns over declines in honeybee populations arose last decade because of the effects of pesticides and destructive mites, along with factors like fungi and viruses. Other bee species, including bumblebees, have also experienced ecological threats.
But the number of globally managed honeybee colonies has increased in the past 50 years, according to a longitudinal study published in the journal Nature last year, and beekeeping has boomed as a hobby in many places. Some beekeepers in Britain speculated that an uptick in hobbyist beekeepers was a factor in the recent increase in swarms.
And given that it is the start of the usual season for honeybee swarming, Professor Ratnieks said that if there was a surge, it was no particular reason for concern. "It's just part of spring," he said, "like birds building their nest."
"If there is a lot of swarming, it really means the bees are doing well," he added.

Unofficial summer is officially underway. I'm looking forward to eating outdoors as much as humanly possible before it gets unbearably hot. (I'm a summer agnostic.) That said, it's reader question time and, as usual, my inbox was full of thoughtful and fun requests, including where to go for large-format dining, where to find carciofi alla giudia (Jewish-style artichokes) and where to have great nonalcoholic drinks.
As always, please email your questions to wheretoeat@nytimes.com, and you may see them answered in a future newsletter.
Duck, Pig or Sea Bass?
One of our favorite things to do with friends is to go out to eat where fixed-menu, family-style dining is offered. We recently ate at Momofuku Ssam Bar for the pork shoulder dinner. Can you recommend some other restaurants that offer this type of experience? -- Joy W.
Francie, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has a whole roast duck for $ 135 that's presented with various flora before it's carved up. It's definitely worth ordering if you can afford it, especially for the soppressata jam that, I agree with Pete Wells, is good enough to lick off "a stack of junk mail." Peasant, in NoLIta, will serve you a family-style whole pig roast with antipasti, sides and dessert for $ 125 per person, given at least four days' notice and provided there are six or more people in your party. And Monsieur Vo, in the East Village, has a few big-format dishes, including a whole sea bass that's market-price, and the Monsieur Platter ( $ 48), which includes four types of meat skewers with the option to add more, as well as sides like vermicelli and roasted peanuts that you then assemble into your own bites. We call that fun with food.
Finding Carciofi alla Giudia
Just spent a week in Rome where I fell in love with Roman artichokes, Jewish-style. Ate them several times that week. Where can I find them in N.Y.C.? -- Lisa S.
I ate this exact type of deep-fried artichoke spritzed with lemon juice and dressed with mint and red chile flakes at Bottino, in Chelsea, a few weeks ago. The occasion? My sister's wedding! Talk about kismet. They're also on the menu at Macosa Trattoria, a small-but-mighty Italian restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that I mentioned a few months ago.
Not-Boring Nonalcoholic Beverages
As I have recently had to stop drinking alcohol for health reasons, I was hoping you can send me to the restaurants with the most creative nonalcoholic beverage programs. I can drink only so much sparkling water! -- Ira L.
I wasn't quite sure if you were looking for nonalcoholic drinks that were mimicking cocktails, or just very creative nonalcoholic drinks. So, I have recommendations for both. I see the phony Negroni from the Brooklyn distiller St. Agrestis on a ton of menus and, as a Negroni obsessive, I endorse it as an alterative. El Quijote has a version of the restaurant's famous sangria that's cheekily called Santa Sangre, as well as a G + T without the G. And the eternally excellent Gramercy Tavern has nonalcoholic red wine and a nonalcoholic cocktail list that's four options deep, including two seasonal spritzes (strawberry-rhubarb and green apple-fennel at the moment).
In the category of creative drinks, there's abcV, Jean-Georges's health-leaning restaurant in the Flatiron district. Between bites of your mushroom-walnut Bolognese, you can sip on any number of "juices, tonics and vibrations." I'd choose Root Reboot because lemon and ginger are my life, though a pollen shake might be the best way to toast the dustiest spring ever. Or if you'd really prefer to have some pork al pastor, Atla, in NoHo, has six agua frescas that range from the traditional hibiscus to a more experimental yuzu avocado.
In Other News ...
The dream of top-tier Peking duck is alive and well at Juqi, the Beijing-based chain with a new location in Flushing, Queens. In his review, Pete Wells writes that the restaurant pulls off "all the fine points of roasting, carving and serving -- so consistently and satisfyingly."
Openings: The Migrant Kitchen, known for its eclectic mix of cuisines, will start serving lamb torta and esquites hot dogs at Ballfields Café in Central Park; the Golden Swan has taken over the space that once housed the Spotted Pig, in the West Village; and Hand Hospitality is back at it again with Moono, a more casual project from the chef behind the Michelin-starred restaurant Jua.
Kim Severson delivered a deep dive on what restaurant hospitality looks like after the pandemic and labor shortages devastated the industry.

Venice Learns What Turned Grand Canal Green: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A chemical used in underwater construction and medical procedures was used to dye parts of the channel bright green, but the authorities still don't know how it got there.
For days, Venetians have wondered what caused a swath of their city's famous Grand Canal to turn bright green.
On Monday, the authorities had an answer: Test samples of the water confirmed that the canal's bright new hue was caused by fluorescein, a chemical often used to find leaks during underwater construction. Now, Italian officials are investigating how the chemical got into the canal.
The regional environmental agency for the state of Veneto, which includes Venice, confirmed the presence of fluorescein in the canal near the Rialto Bridge and said a complete analysis of the water samples would be completed in the next few days.
Still, officials do not know who or what was behind the color.
Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, said on Facebook on Monday that the possibility of copycats was "worrying."
"Venice, like other iconic places in the Veneto region, has such visibility that actions like this" could attract "'characters' in search of publicity," Mr. Zaia wrote.
It was unclear whether the police had identified a suspect or whether anyone might face charges. The Venice police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Mr. Zaia said that "adequate and strong responses are needed."
"We must protect the city, its monuments, everyone's right to enjoy its historical treasures free of the marks left by rowdy individuals," he said.
Fluorescein can have low levels of toxicity; however, it is routinely used in some medical eye exams, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The environmental authorities in Veneto said on Monday that tests had not indicated any levels of toxicity in the canal.
Even before tests confirmed fluorescein was in the water, officials believed the chemical was causing the abnormal hue based on similar episodes in the past, the environmental agency said in a statement on Sunday.
In 1968, the Argentine artist Nicolás García Uriburu turned the Grand Canal green using fluorescein "to bring attention to the relationship between nature and civilization and to promote ecological consciousness as a critical part of culture," according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The color faded after about a day, according to the museum. This week, Veneto's environmental agency said that depending on how much fluorescein was in the water, it could take a few more days for the canal to return to its normal color as the chemical dissolves.

Man Charged In the Killing Of an Official In New Jersey: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eunice Dwumfour, the first Black person elected to office in Sayreville, N.J., was killed as she sat in her car outside her home. She and the man who was arrested were connected through their church.
A 28-year-old Virginia man was charged with murder on Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a New Jersey councilwoman, Eunice Dwumfour, in February, the authorities said. Evidence uncovered by investigators indicated that the two knew each other, officials said.
The man, Rashid Ali Bynum, of Portsmouth, Va., was taken into custody in Chesapeake City, Va., Tuesday morning and was awaiting extradition, Yolanda Ciccone, the Middlesex County, N.J., prosecutor, said at a news conference. Mr. Bynum was charged with first-degree murder and two weapons counts, Ms. Ciccone said. It was not clear whether he had a lawyer.
Ms. Dwumfour, 30, had a number associated with Mr. Bynum listed in her cellphone contacts as "FCF," an abbreviation for Fire Congress Fellowship, according to Ms. Ciccone. Mr. Bynum, Ms. Ciccone said, was a member of the fellowship, which is affiliated with Ms. Dwumfour's church, Champions Royal Assembly in Newark, an offshoot of a megachurch based in Nigeria.
Federal tax filings describe Fire Congress Fellowship as a Bible study group, identify Ms. Dwumfour as its longtime treasurer and list its office at an address in Parlin, an unincorporated section of Sayreville, N.J., that is a two-minute drive from where the fatal shooting occurred.
Ms. Ciccone did not offer a motive for the killing. She said the investigation was continuing and declined to take questions. She was joined at the news conference by other law enforcement officials; Ms. Dwumfour's father and sister; and a minister from Ms. Dwumfour's parents' church.
John Wisniewski, a lawyer for Ms. Dwumfour's family, said they were "relieved to know that somebody was being charged and going to be held accountable." But because they did not know anything about Mr. Bynum or what might have motivated him, they had a number of questions, he said.
"They're really struggling with the why," Mr. Wisniewski said.
Ms. Dwumfour was shot while she was in her car outside the complex of apartment buildings and duplexes where she lived in Parlin just before 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 1, the authorities said.
The car rolled down a steep incline before crashing into two cars at the bottom of the hill, the police said. Officers responding to reports of a shooting found Ms. Dwumfour with several gunshot wounds, and she was pronounced dead at the scene, the authorities said.
At the news conference, Ms. Ciccone described some of the evidence that led to Mr. Bynum's arrest, including security video from the murder scene, location data from his cellphone and electronic toll information that traced his route from Virginia to New Jersey and back.
Kennedy O'Brien, a former longtime Sayreville mayor, said the scenario laid out by the authorities indicated that the killing was an "assassination of a young woman who had an 11-year-old daughter" whom she was raising on her own.
"I pray to God that she is going to be OK," Mr. O'Brien said of Ms. Dwumfour's daughter.
Ms Dwumfour's family is from Ghana. She was married last year to a leader of her church, Champions Royal Assembly, a congregation based in Nigeria, according to messages she and her husband, Eze Kings, posted on Facebook.
Ms. Dwumfour graduated from Newark public schools and received a bachelor's degree in women's studies from William Paterson University of New Jersey in 2017. Her career included jobs as a business analyst and professional scrum master, a type of project manager, according to a LinkedIn profile that was active at the time of her death.
A Republican, Ms. Dwumfour was in her first three-year term as a Sayreville councilwoman at the time of her death, having narrowly defeated an incumbent Democrat to win her seat in 2021. She was the first Black person ever elected to office in Sayreville.
In a statement about her campaign posted on the Sayreville Republican Party's website, she said she loved the borough, which has a population of about 45,000 and is about 30 miles south of Manhattan in Middlesex County, and wanted to help improve the lives of its residents.
"I am fully dedicated to building a better, stronger Sayreville," she wrote. "And with your support, we can create a brighter future for our wonderful town."

Inklings of an Antidote To Deadly Mushrooms: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Researchers are finding clues to a potential remedy for consumption of the death cap species, a potentially lethal mushroom.
Foragers around the world hunt for wild mushrooms to bring their earthy, nutty, meaty flavors to the table. But every so often, people mistake a potentially lethal variety for the edible ones.
A mushroom called the death cap -- Amanita phalloides -- and dozens of related species containing the same toxin, alpha amanitin, account for the vast majority of mushroom-poisoning deaths. And many scientists have tried to find a quick remedy.
"There's no antidote," said Terrence Delaney, a plant biologist and mycologist at the University of Vermont who studies the toxin profiles of a related mushroom called the destroying angel.
In the past, such poisoning was fatal in more than half of the cases, but today about 85 to 90 percent of people survive. The main treatment is hydration, because the toxin is excreted in urine, Dr. Delaney said, and also includes electrolytes and substances to protect the liver. "But a lot of people don't get better, and the only effective therapy is a liver transplant," he said.
Over the years, researchers have proposed and tested several treatments, Dr. Delaney said, adding, "To be honest, none of those are convincing."
Alpha amanitin wreaks havoc in the body by mucking up the cells' ability to make messenger RNA. Messenger RNA builds proteins, and without new proteins, the cell's machinery grinds to a halt. As the toxin circulates in the body, it causes extensive damage to the liver.
But researchers have very little idea of how exactly the toxin does its dirty work, said Qiaoping Wang, a pharmacologist and toxicologist at Sun Yat-Sen University in Shenzhen, China.
Dr. Wang and his colleagues are not foragers themselves. They are, however, in the business of examining the genome to look for chains of biological events set off by toxins, as well as molecules that block them. In a study published on Tuesday in Nature Communication, they reported finding a promising molecule that seemed to prevent some of the toxic effects of alpha amanitin.
The researchers first used CRISPR, the gene-editing technology, to create human cells with thousands of specific genes knocked out, one by one. They then swamped the cells with alpha amanitin and tracked which ones continued to thrive. If the cells' lives were rosier when a specific gene was deactivated, they reasoned, that gene might be involved in fighting off the toxin. They narrowed in on one gene, STT3B, that seemed especially critical to toxicity.
Next, the researchers used computer modeling to search for compounds approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that might block STT3B, coming up with 34 possible drugs. All but one fell away in further tests on cells.
The remaining compound, called indocyanine green (ICG), is a dye widely used to take images of liver and heart function. When Dr. Wang and his team injected the toxin into mice, followed by ICG, the animals' recovery improved and the liver damage decreased significantly.
"The exact mechanism is still unknown," Dr. Wang said. But his team's work so far suggests that the STTB3 gene somehow helps alpha amanitin enter cells, and that ICG prevents this step.
"It's a spectacularly cool paper," said Anne Pringle, a mycologist and geneticist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who has studied death caps for 20 years. "They do this amazing amount of work and end with this hypothesis that they've found an antidote."
Whether the compound will work in people remains to be seen, but it's a good starting point, Dr. Pringle said. "I love that they took it all the way to a mouse model," she said, "because that's a lot more than I've seen with some of these other ideas that have come and gone."
The ICG's effectiveness also depended on the window between the injection of the toxin and the reception of the drug; the possible remedy tapered off if given more than four hours later.
Too often, people don't know they've eaten a toxic mushroom like the death cap until eight or more hours later because they don't feel sick until then, Dr. Delaney said. After suffering some intense gastrointestinal symptoms, people undergo two to three days in which they feel much better. But all the while, the toxin continues to cause damage.
Dr. Delaney is part of a worldwide network of experts who run a Facebook group called Poison Help; Emergency Identification for Mushrooms & Plants.
People ask the group to identify death caps or related mushrooms. Last year, he recalled, a young boy told relatives that he'd eaten a "marshmallow" he had found in the yard. The family realized what happened, took him to the emergency room, and asked the Facebook group to identify the mushroom. Knowing what it was, doctors provided appropriate care and the boy recovered.
"We are really good at quickly identifying Amanitas and almost always give replies within 15 minutes," he said.
Antidote or not, Dr. Delaney said, "early knowledge that someone has ingested one of these is absolutely essential."

Ingrid Haebler, Pianist With a Mastery of Mozart: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In concerts and on dozens of recordings, she applied a delicate touch that critics said set her apart from other performers.
Ingrid Haebler, a pianist who drew particular acclaim for her performances and recordings of the works of Mozart, impressing critics while still in her 20s with elegant interpretations that set her apart from other musicians of her day, died on May 14. She was believed to be 96.
Decca Classics, which last year released "Ingrid Haebler: The Philips Legacy," a boxed set of dozens of recordings she made for the Philips label, posted news of her death on Facebook. The Austrian newspaper The Salzburger Nachrichten reported her death, attributing the information to her circle of friends, but did not say where she died.
Ms. Haebler was born in Vienna, probably on June 20, 1926 (some news reports said 1929). Her father was a baron. Her mother played piano and began teaching Ingrid when she was a young child; she gave her first public performance at 11. They lived in Poland when Ingrid was young but settled in Austria in the late 1930s.
As a teenager, she wrote poetry and dabbled in composing. But at 19 she decided to focus fully on piano -- "I had to kill a lot of my interests," she told The Sydney Morning Herald of Australia in 1964. She trained at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria and in the early 1950s began earning accolades at European piano competitions. By 1954, recordings she made for Vox with the Pro Musica Symphony of Vienna were drawing notice in the United States.
"A delicate -- but not finicky, to make the distinction -- articulation of Mozart that is uncommon today is the way Ingrid Haebler plays the A major (K. 414) and B-flat major (K. 595) Piano Concertos," Cyrus Durgin, a music critic for The Boston Globe, wrote in August 1954, reviewing one of those records. "You will always find people (including musicians) defending or attacking this manner, but it does meet Mozart's requirement that his keyboard music 'flow like oil and water."'
That same year she performed as a soloist in England with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Mozart was her calling card, but she proved an adept interpreter of other composers as well, as she did in 1956 when she played a program of Mozart, Haydn and Schubert at Wigmore Hall in London. She "captured and held spellbound her audience," The Daily Telegraph of Britain wrote.
By 1958, The Bristol Evening Post reported, her stature was such that, at the Bath Festival, she felt free to reject the Steinway that was provided to her during the practice session and sent the organizers scrambling to find another piano.
At that festival, she further showed that there was more to her than Mozart. She played Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 and impressed The Daily Telegraph of Britain. "Without ever invoking a spurious foresight of the Beethoven that was to come," the newspaper wrote, "she placed the work in the 18th century, yet across the gulf that already separated him from Mozart."
In October 1959 she made her American debut in Minneapolis with the Minneapolis Symphony, playing the Mozart Piano Concerto in B-flat.
"The acclaim of the audience brought the pianist back to the stage five times," Ross Parmenter wrote in a review in The New York Times, "and the members of the orchestra joined in the applause."
Ms. Haebler, who was a baroness but did not use the title, was still impressing audiences with her Mozart interpretations in 1976, when, at Hunter College, she played her first New York recital, augmenting her program with works by Schubert and Debussy but shining as usual on the Mozart selections.
"This was cloudless, untroubled Mozart," Donal Henahan wrote in a review in The Times, "in line with the last century's view of him as a miraculously blessed child."
Ms. Haebler continued to tour until early in this century. On her numerous recordings, many of them for Philips, she covered a range of composers, but again it was often the Mozart recordings that stood out. Reviewing her recording of Mozart sonatas in 1990 for The Kingston Whig-Standard of Ontario, the critic Richard Perry zeroed in on what made her refreshingly different.
"In a concert world rife with pianists of dazzling technique who seemed forced by competition and cavernous concert halls to demonstrate their mettle at every turn," he wrote, "the poise and simplicity of Ms. Haebler's Mozart is a rare treat."
Information on Ms. Haebler's survivors was not immediately available.

Full text: A reader asks whether she has to apologize after recounting a joke that used racist language in front of her son's friend, who later said he had felt unsafe.
My son is a comedian. When his comedian friends come to my town for gigs, I put them up. Recently, I hosted a Black friend of his -- I am white -- and we talked about a famous Black comic. I paraphrased one of the comic's jokes that impressed me: A TV censor allowed the comic to use the N-word but objected to his use of a gay slur. When the comic asked why, the censor said: "Because you're not gay." The comic replied: "Well, I'm not a N-word, either." I used the full N-word, as the comic had, for accuracy. Later, the guest told my son that my language had made him feel unsafe and that I am a racist. My son is angry with me. But I am stunned that he and his friend can't distinguish between quoting an antiracist joke and being racist. Do I have to apologize?
HOSTESS
Let me start with a compliment: You are generous to house traveling comedians. Aside from that, though, I can't support your positions here. Your use of the slur was insensitive, and your claim to know better than your guest how he should have felt when you used it is presumptuous. Still, I want to thank you for raising important issues.
There is no reason for you or any white person to use that word -- even in quotes. (Yes, I know some Black people do.) It is a racist epithet with a complex history that you can research if you are interested. Otherwise, saying "N-word" is plenty accurate; I knew exactly what you meant. And arguing for your need to use an explosive term, when a common euphemism will do, makes you seem defensive and tone-deaf.
More troubling (to me) is your implication that your Black houseguest was wrong to say he felt unsafe. He -- like every one of us -- is entitled to his feelings. And for you to dictate how he should have felt is wildly disrespectful. Apologize. You hurt someone, even if it was unintentional. (And in joking news: The one you repeated stinks! Rejecting a racial slur as sideways justification for using gay slurs is not antiracist. We can respect everyone.)
How to Move Forward When Trust Is Gone
My girlfriend and I have been dating for five years. We agreed to be monogamous, which is important to me. I just discovered for the second time that she had cheated on me. She swears tearfully it won't happen again. I love her, but I no longer trust her. And I'm ashamed to be in this position. Advice?
GEORGE
You have nothing to be ashamed of! We do not control the behavior of others -- only how we respond to it. Many people in your shoes would cut their losses and end the relationship.
But it may be useful to you (both) to explore your girlfriend's infidelity in couples therapy. In my experience, people who cheat are often acting out their own issues, not their feelings about their partner. Understanding her psychology better may help you move beyond hurt and shame, whether you decide to stay together or break up.
Mi Causa Es Su Causa?
I launched a charitable appeal to help a Sri Lankan woman I met in Abu Dhabi, where I used to live. She is extremely poor and in urgent need of medical care. I posted on Facebook and also in a group chat of 18 friends -- half of whom are close friends. Only three people donated. I am hurt and angry! I wonder if these people are truly my friends or if they are even good people. Thoughts?
S.
I have no doubt your appeal sprang from a humanitarian impulse. Still, it seems to have turned into an exercise in ego gratification: Do my friends value me highly enough to donate to my cause? This is a charitable request, not a popularity contest.
Most people I know choose charitable causes that are personal to them. Most of my donations, for instance, go to suicide prevention. I set an annual budget, and if I can afford to give more, I do. So, a sad story on a group-text chain about a woman in a country where you used to live would not be my priority. That doesn't mean the woman is undeserving of help, nor does it mean that your friends are wrong not to donate.
Good Curtains Make Good Neighbors
My husband was chatting with our new neighbor when the neighbor mentioned he could see me undressing at night through my bathroom window. Our homes are on three-quarter-acre lots, so we're not that close. My husband was speechless, and I continue my nightly ritual, which does not include drawing the shades. Was our neighbor wrong to say something? Shouldn't he not look?
NEIGHBOR
Your neighbor is not responsible for safeguarding your privacy. And acreage appears to be irrelevant: He can see you undressing. I interpret his comment as a neighborly gesture to tell you something he thinks you would want to know.
If you don't care, that's your call. But if you don't draw the blinds because you think your neighbor should not use certain rooms or look out his windows in the evening, I disagree. At this point, he's not peeping; you're flashing.

German Police Investigate Musician for Wearing Nazi-Like Costumes: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Waters, a founder of Pink Floyd, who has long been critical of Israel, has worn similar clothing in the past when playing songs from Pink Floyd's album "The Wall."
The German police are investigating Roger Waters, a founder of the band Pink Floyd, who has long been critical of Israel, after he performed in Berlin last week wearing a Nazi-style costume like the one he used to critique fascism in "The Wall."
Mr. Waters, who has made anti-Israel statements in the past that many have said cross a line into antisemitism, has successfully fought two attempts by German courts to block him from German concert venues in the past.
The investigation is focused on the costume Mr. Waters wore during a rendition of the 1979 Pink Floyd song "In the Flesh," from their seminal album "The Wall," in which a rock star imagines himself as a fascist dictator. Similar staging was featured in the 1982 movie "Pink Floyd: The Wall," featuring Bob Geldof.
During parts of the concerts in Berlin, on May 17 and May 18, Mr. Waters wore a black trench coat with epaulets and a red armband, according to videos posted to social media and witnesses. Flanked by men dressed in costumes that evoked Nazi storm troopers, he shot a prop machine gun into the audience. Mr. Waters has worn similar costumes at concerts outside of Germany for years for the routine, which he has called satire.
The Berlin authorities will have to determine to what extent the display of Nazi-like imagery is protected by artistic freedom of expression. In Germany, displaying Nazi symbolism, like swastikas or SS regalia, justifying or downplaying the Holocaust, and antisemitic acts are illegal.
"Artistic freedom of expression is not a license to incite hatred," wrote Nicholas Potter, a researcher with the Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin, a group that tracks neo-Nazism, right-wing extremism and antisemitism in Germany, in an email exchange.
"Artistic freedom is often used as an argument to express anti-democratic or hateful views, including antisemitic ones, but that doesn't always mean it's applicable -- the context is crucial," he added. Mr. Potter attended one of the Berlin shows and wrote about it on the foundation's news blog.
Mr. Waters initially agreed to an interview with The New York Times about the investigation, but then declined. A representative wrote: "We are reluctant to comment if the intention is to further sensationalize this fabricated news story."
A Berlin police spokesman said investigators would present their findings to the Berlin state's attorney within the next three months. The state's attorney will decide whether to indict Mr. Waters.
Mr. Waters is a vocal proponent of B.D.S., the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which pushes foreign governments, businesses and performers to cut ties with Israel until it ends its occupation of the territories it captured in 1967, among other demands.
Mr. Waters at past concerts has included a floating balloon representing a flying pig, which featured the Star of David. He defended that action, saying in 2013 on Facebook that, "Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non-violent protest."
In a Facebook post on Sunday addressing the controversy around his German concerts, he criticized German lawmakers who condemned B.D.S., saying they had "enshrined a recommendation to the German people to 'stand by silent and indifferent"' to the "institutionalized murder" of the Palestinian people by a "tyrannical racist regime," which he said was the State of Israel.
On giant display boards at the concert, the name of Anne Frank, one of the most readily recognizable victims of the Holocaust, during which Germans killed more than 6 million Jews, was juxtaposed next to the name Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian American television correspondent who was shot by Israeli Defense Forces soldiers during a raid into the West Bank last year.
On Wednesday morning Israel's Foreign Ministry posted on Twitter: "Good morning to every one but Roger Waters who spent the evening in Berlin (Yes Berlin) desecrating the memory of Anne Frank and the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust."
On Wednesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center publicly called on the German authorities to investigate the concert in Berlin. "There are few performers whose anti-Israel vitriol can match that of Waters," the center wrote in a statement. "Despite his protests to the contrary, Waters has, for years, crossed the line between anti-Zionism and antisemitism."
Any charges stemming from the concert would come as Germany faces a more general debate about the rise of antisemitism in the country, 78 years after the end of the Holocaust. In addition to an overall increase in the number of antisemitic crimes reported in the country, there were wide-ranging discussions after a group of leaders of cultural institutions published an open letter decrying not just B.D.S. but also a parliamentary resolution that declared B.D.S. inherently antisemitic. And an art installation featuring antisemitic caricatures at the Documenta art festival in Kassel last year led to another round of soul searching among cultural elites.
The city of Frankfurt tried to stop Mr. Waters from performing at the Frankfurter Festhalle this coming Sunday, a concert venue partly owned by the city. In November 1938, thousands of Jewish men were taken to the arena after the night of pogroms known as Kristallnacht, before being shipped off to concentration camps. But a judge in Frankfurt backed Mr. Waters, who had filed an emergency injunction against the city on Monday, citing the constitutional right to artistic freedom and the fact that there was no evidence that Mr. Waters would break the law.
In March, the city of Munich determined that it could legally not back out of a contract with the musician for a show, which he played at the Olympic Stadium there last week. Instead the city decided to allow organized protests outside the venue on the day of the concert.

Treasury Balance Looks Like Petty Cash to Moguls: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The cash balance at the Treasury Department is now lower than the net worth of some of the world's richest people.
The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $ 38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $ 316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $ 38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News's Billionaire Index as of Thursday. (Under the news agency's editorial policy, its billionaire owner, Michael Bloomberg, is not considered for the index. Forbes, though, estimates his net worth at $ 94.5 billion.)
Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury group LVMH: $ 189 billion
Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter: $ 179 billion
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon: $ 139 billion

Microsoft Calls for Rules To Minimize Risks of A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Its president, Brad Smith, said companies needed to "step up" and governments needed to "move faster" as artificial intelligence progressed.
Microsoft endorsed a crop of regulations for artificial intelligence on Thursday, as the company navigates concerns from governments around the world about the risks of the rapidly evolving technology.
Microsoft, which has promised to build artificial intelligence into many of its products, proposed regulations including a requirement that systems used in critical infrastructure can be fully turned off or slowed down, similar to an emergency braking system on a train. The company also called for laws to clarify when additional legal obligations apply to an A.I. system and for labels making it clear when an image or a video was produced by a computer.
"Companies need to step up," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said in an interview about the push for regulations. "Government needs to move faster." He laid out the proposals in front of an audience that included lawmakers at an event in downtown Washington on Thursday morning.
The call for regulations punctuates a boom in A.I., with the release of the ChatGPT chatbot in November spawning a wave of interest. Companies including Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet, have since raced to incorporate the technology into their products. That has stoked concerns that the companies are sacrificing safety to reach the next big thing before their competitors.
Lawmakers have publicly expressed worries that such A.I. products, which can generate text and images on their own, will create a flood of disinformation, be used by criminals and put people out of work. Regulators in Washington have pledged to be vigilant for scammers using A.I. and instances in which the systems perpetuate discrimination or make decisions that violate the law.
In response to that scrutiny, A.I. developers have increasingly called for shifting some of the burden of policing the technology onto government. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT and counts Microsoft as an investor, told a Senate subcommittee this month that government must regulate the technology.
The maneuver echoes calls for new privacy or social media laws by internet companies like Google and Meta, Facebook's parent. In the United States, lawmakers have moved slowly after such calls, with few new federal rules on privacy or social media in recent years.
In the interview, Mr. Smith said Microsoft was not trying to slough off responsibility for managing the new technology, because it was offering specific ideas and pledging to carry out some of them regardless of whether government took action.
"There is not an iota of abdication of responsibility," he said.
He endorsed the idea, supported by Mr. Altman during his congressional testimony, that a government agency should require companies to obtain licenses to deploy "highly capable" A.I. models.
"That means you notify the government when you start testing," Mr. Smith said. "You've got to share results with the government. Even when it's licensed for deployment, you have a duty to continue to monitor it and report to the government if there are unexpected issues that arise."
Microsoft, which made more than $ 22 billion from its cloud computing business in the first quarter, also said those high-risk systems should be allowed to operate only in "licensed A.I. data centers." Mr. Smith acknowledged that the company would not be "poorly positioned" to offer such services, but said many American competitors could also provide them.
Microsoft added that governments should designate certain A.I. systems used in critical infrastructure as "high risk" and require them to have a "safety brake." It compared that feature to "the braking systems engineers have long built into other technologies such as elevators, school buses and high-speed trains."
In some sensitive cases, Microsoft said, companies that provide A.I. systems should have to know certain information about their customers. To protect consumers from deception, content created by A.I. should be required to carry a special label, the company said.
Mr. Smith said companies should bear the legal "responsibility" for harms associated with A.I. In some cases, he said, the liable party could be the developer of an application like Microsoft's Bing search engine that uses someone else's underlying A.I. technology. Cloud companies could be responsible for complying with security regulations and other rules, he added.
"We don't necessarily have the best information or the best answer, or we may not be the most credible speaker," Mr. Smith said. "But, you know, right now, especially in Washington D.C., people are looking for ideas."

Exploding Melon Drew More Views Than DeSantis's Twitter Event: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Republican presidential candidate's announcement on Twitter had a high of about 300,000 concurrent listeners and a total of 3.4 million listeners as of Thursday.
Within hours of Gov. Ron DeSantis's announcement of his presidential run on Twitter on Wednesday, participants in the audio event celebrated the achievement.
David Sacks, a venture capitalist who moderated the Twitter conversation, declared it "by far the biggest room ever held on social media." Afterward, Mr. DeSantis, a Florida Republican, said in a podcast interview that he thought by later that day "probably over 10 million people" would have "watched" the event, called a Twitter Space, or a recording of it.
They were wrong on both counts.
According to Twitter's metrics, the audio event -- which was initially marred by more than 20 minutes of technical glitches before it was restarted -- garnered a high of about 300,000 concurrent listeners, or those who simultaneously tuned in as Mr. DeSantis made his announcement. As of Thursday, 3.4 million people had listened to the Space or a recording of it, according to Twitter's numbers.
Those figures fell short of 10 million people and were far from being "the biggest room ever held on social media" compared with past livestreams.
Consider that a 2016 Facebook Live event, featuring two BuzzFeed employees placing rubber bands around a watermelon until it exploded, drew more than 800,000 concurrent viewers and a total of five million views within hours of its conclusion. The 2017 livestream of a pregnant giraffe on YouTube brought in five million viewers a day.
The event with Mr. DeSantis was even dwarfed by past audio livestreams on Twitter. Last month, more than three million people at one point concurrently listened to an interview of Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, by a BBC reporter in a Twitter Space, according to the company's numbers. A recording of that Space said 2.6 million listeners had ultimately "tuned in." (Twitter did not explain the discrepancy between the concurrent listener count and the "tuned in" figure.)
"Getting a few hundred thousand people to do something for some number of minutes is not that big of a deal," said Brian Wieser, a longtime media analyst who runs Madison and Wall, a strategic advisory firm. "I'm not quite sure that using Twitter to announce a presidential campaign was the most impactful environment, though maybe Twitter could become that."
Determining the reach and audience for Mr. DeSantis's announcement on Twitter is significant because the online event had been heralded as a modern way of making political proclamations, bypassing traditional media such as cable news and network television. Yet the initial numbers from Twitter raise questions about whether presidential candidates can ignore traditional media for their big campaign announcements.
Although television does not generally pull in the same numbers that it did a decade ago, some political events that are broadcast live still garner large audiences. When President Biden delivered his State of the Union address on Feb. 7, for instance, the speech was aired live to 27.3 million people watching on 16 TV networks, according to Nielsen.
In an email, Mr. Sacks said his assertion that the Space with Mr. DeSantis was "the biggest room ever" had come from a Twitter engineer. He said he had counted other livestreams that shared the same audio as the original Space.
"I've asked for more detailed analytics, but they're a little busy right now," Mr. Sacks said.
Mr. Musk and representatives for Mr. DeSantis, who followed his Twitter Space by appearing on Fox News, did not respond to requests for comment.
That is not to say that using social media to make political announcements cannot be powerful. Mr. Wieser said that with so much media fragmentation happening, there was no unifying platform and that the quality of the audience was often a motivating factor for politicians. Perhaps, he said, Mr. DeSantis's goal was not reaching the most people, but reaching those who would be best persuaded to donate to him or help spread his message.
Comparing social media's reach with television broadcasts also can be difficult. A "unique" view on social media represents each individual account that visits a post or other content, rather than the number of times it is visited. Such views do not necessarily come from humans, because bot activity might be involved, and do not denote whether a viewer tuned in for half a second or half an hour. By contrast, TV ratings represent the average number of viewers across a longer period, Mr. Wieser said.
Twitter also does not explain the difference in how it counts listeners on its livestreams and those who have listened to recordings of Twitter Spaces.
"The reach on Twitter is artificial: People tune in and out more quickly, they're likely watching on a mobile device that just isn't as effective in getting people's attention as a large TV set," said Ross Benes, a senior analyst with Insider Intelligence who covers digital video, TV and streaming.
After the conclusion of the Twitter Space on Wednesday with Mr. DeSantis, traditional media poked fun at the technical glitches of the event. When Mr. DeSantis appeared on Fox News, Trey Gowdy, the host, quipped, "Fox News will not crash during this interview." The segment drew nearly two million viewers.
On Thursday, Mr. DeSantis also tried to make light of the Twitter Space's technical problems. His campaign sent out fund-raising emails and showcased T-shirts saying the presidential candidate "broke the internet."

Full text: OSLO -- An American aircraft carrier arrived on Wednesday in the capital of Norway for a four-day stay, a show of strength in northern Europe that seemed to irritate neighboring Russia, before beginning military exercises elsewhere in the country.
Hundreds of people watched the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, enter the Oslo fjord in an Arctic region swelling with geopolitical importance.
It was the latest American foray into an expanse increasingly contested by Russia and China, which have partnered to promote expanded use of Arctic trade routes. As the war continued to rage in Ukraine, the arrival of the carrier amounted to a display of solidarity with NATO allies nearby and a visible element of deterrence to Russia, which shares a border with Norway of almost 125 miles.
The Russian Embassy said on its Facebook page Wednesday that "there are no questions in the north that require a military solution." Since Russia, the embassy said, "poses no direct military threat to Norway, such demonstrations of power appear illogical and harmful."
Jonas Gahr Store, Norway's prime minister, said through a spokesperson that the carrier's presence in Oslo transcends mere symbolic value. It also reflects, he said, the United States' power at sea.
Historically, Norway has been slightly reluctant to allow a strong U.S. military presence, but its stance has slowly changed since Russia illegally seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. American Marines have trained on a rotational basis in Norway since 2017, buttressing their defenses against a resurgent Russia, and in 2018 U.S. troops joined 50,000 Allied Forces in the Trident Juncture, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War in 1991.
Andreas Osthagen, a senior research fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway and an expert on geopolitical issues related to the Arctic, called the trip part of a trend of the U.S. military engaging in the Arctic and North Atlantic, not only a response to Russian aggression in Europe, but also the increasing Chinese presence in the Arctic.
After its stay in Oslo, the carrier is scheduled to move along Norway's coast into the Norwegian Sea, but the Norwegian Armed Forces did not say precisely where or for how long. The aircraft carrier, the armed forces said, will train with Norway's military.

Global Group Takes On Threat of Misinformation: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A group of scholars introduced an international panel to study the digital information landscape, inspired by those who had been warning of the effect of global warming.
Two years ago, at a virtual gathering organized by the Nobel Foundation, Sheldon Himelfarb outlined the idea that the world's leading scholars should join forces to study misinformation the way that scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documented the global effect of carbon emissions.
That new group gathered for its official introduction in Washington on Wednesday, uniting more than 200 researchers from 55 countries with a similar sense of urgency and alarm as the threat of global warming. In the group's first report, the researchers questioned the effectiveness of fighting falsehoods online with content moderation, one of the most common strategies to combating misinformation, saying other tactics had more scientific evidence behind them.
"You have to approach the information environment in the same way scientists approached the environment," said Mr. Himelfarb, the group's executive director and the chief executive of PeaceTech Lab, an advocacy organization affiliated with the United States Institute of Peace in Washington.
The group, the International Panel on the Information Environment, has registered as a nongovernmental organization in Zurich at a time when the fight against misinformation has become increasingly mired in a broader erosion of trust in government, news organizations and other public institutions.
"Algorithmic bias, manipulation and misinformation has become a global and existential threat that exacerbates existing social problems, degrades public life, cripples humanitarian initiatives and prevents progress on other serious threats," the panel wrote in its inaugural announcement.
The panel was introduced during a three-day meeting, organized by the Nobel Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences, devoted to the erosion of public understanding and trust in science.
Speaker after speaker at the meeting described an onslaught of disinformation that has become a dispiriting fact of public life across the globe and that, with the recent explosion of artificial intelligence, could soon become even worse.
Maria Ressa of the Philippines, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, issued a manifesto demanding that democratic governments and Big Tech companies become more transparent, do more to protect personal data and privacy and end practices that contribute to disinformation and other threats against independent journalism. It has 276 signatories representing more than 140 organizations.
One challenge facing these efforts is overcoming the increasingly fierce arguments over what exactly constitutes misinformation. In the United States, the efforts to combat it have run aground on First Amendment protections of free speech. The biggest companies have now shifted focus and resources away from the fight against misinformation, even as new platforms emerged promising to forgo policies that moderate content.
On Wednesday, the panel's researchers presented the summary of its first two studies, which reviewed 4,798 peer-reviewed publications examining misleading information on social media and aggregated the findings on the effectiveness of countermeasures to it.
The findings suggest that the most effective responses to false information online are labeling content as "disputed" or flagging sources of state media and publishing corrective information, typically in the form of debunking rumors and disinformation.
Far less certain, the report argues, is the effectiveness of public and government efforts to pressure social media giants like Facebook and Twitter to take down content, as well as internal company algorithms that suspend or play down offending accounts. The same is true of media literacy programs that train people to identify sources of misinformation.
"We're not saying that information literacy programs don't work," said Sebastián Valenzuela, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile who oversaw the study. "What we're saying is that we need more evidence that they work."
The panel's inspirational model, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was founded in 1988, a time when climate change was equally contested. Its scientists, working under the auspices of the United Nations, toiled for decades before its assessments and recommendations came to be recognized as scientific consensus.
When it comes to the digital landscape, and the impact on society of abuses, the science of disinformation could prove even harder to measure in concrete terms. Climate change is "hard science," said Young Mie Kim, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who serves as vice chair of a committee focused on research methodology.
"So, relatively speaking, it's easier to develop some common concepts and tool kits," Ms. Kim said. "It's hard to do that in social science or humanities."
The new panel eschews a governmental role -- at least for now. It plans to issue regular reports, not fact-checking individual falsehoods but rather looking for deeper forces behind the spread of disinformation as a way to guide government policy.
"It'd be too hard to put a bunch of scientists on evaluating the truth claims in any particular piece of junk," said Philip N. Howard, director of Oxford University's Program on Democracy and Technology and chairman of the new panel.
"What we can do is look for infrastructural interference," he went on. "What we can do is audit an algorithmic system to see if it's got lousy or unintended outcomes. It's still hard, but I think that's within reach as a research objective."

Advisory Says Teens Face Risk On Social Sites: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The report by Dr. Vivek Murthy cited a "profound risk of harm" to adolescent mental health and urged families to set limits and governments to set tougher standards for use.
The nation's top health official issued an extraordinary public warning on Tuesday about the risks of social media to young people, urging a push to fully understand the possible "harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents."
In a 19-page advisory, the United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, noted that the effects of social media on adolescent mental health were not fully understood, and that social media can be beneficial to some users. Nonetheless, he wrote, "There are ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents."
The report included practical recommendations to help families guide children's social media use. It recommended that families keep mealtimes and in-person gatherings free of devices to help build social bonds and promote conversation. It suggested creating a "family media plan" to set expectations for social media use, including boundaries around content and keeping personal information private.
Dr. Murthy also called on tech companies to enforce minimum age limits and to create default settings for children with high safety and privacy standards. And he urged the government to create age-appropriate health and safety standards for technology platforms.
Adolescents "are not just smaller adults," Dr. Murthy said in an interview on Monday. "They're in a different phase of development, and they're in a critical phase of brain development."
The report, effectively elevating long-simmering concerns around social media in the national conversation, came as state and federal lawmakers, many of them raised in an era when social media barely existed or didn't exist at all, have been struggling with how to set limits on its use.
Montana's governor recently signed a bill banning TikTok from operating in the state, prompting the Chinese-owned app to file a lawsuit and young TikTok users to lament what one called a "kick in the face." In March, Utah became the first state to prohibit social media services from allowing users under 18 to have accounts without the explicit consent of a parent or guardian. That law could dramatically curtail young people's access to apps like Instagram and Facebook.
Survey results from Pew Research have found that up to 95 percent of teens reported using at least one social media platform, while more than one-third said they used social media "almost constantly." As social media use has risen, so have self-reports and clinical diagnoses among adolescents of anxiety and depression, along with emergency room visits for self-harm and suicidal ideation.
The report could help encourage further research to understand whether these two trends are related. It joins a growing number of calls for action around adolescents and social media. Earlier this month, the American Psychological Association issued its first-ever social media guidance, recommending that parents closely monitor teens' usage and that tech companies reconsider features like endless scrolling and the "like" button.
A large body of research has emerged in recent years on the potential connection between social media use and soaring rates of distress among adolescents. But the results have been consistent only in their nuance and complexity.
An analysis published last year, examining research from 2019 to 2021 on social media use and mental health, found that "most reviews interpreted the associations between social media use and mental health as 'weak' or 'inconsistent,' whereas a few qualified the same associations as 'substantial' and 'deleterious."'
At their clearest, the data indicate that social media can have both a positive and negative impact on the well-being of young people, and that heavy use of social media -- and screen time generally -- appears to displace activities like sleep and exercise that are considered vital to developing brains.
On the positive side, social media can help many young people by giving them a forum to connect with others, find community and express themselves.
At the same time, the surgeon general's advisory noted, social media platforms brim with "extreme, inappropriate and harmful content," including content that "can normalize" self-harm, eating disorders and other self-destructive behavior. Cyberbullying is rampant.
Moreover, social media spaces can be fraught for young people especially, the advisory added: "In early adolescence, when identities and sense of self-worth are forming, brain development is especially susceptible to social pressures, peer opinions and peer comparison."
The advisory noted that technology companies have a vested interest in keeping users online, and that they use tactics that entice people to engage in addictive-like behaviors. "Our children have become unknowing participants in a decades-long experiment," the advisory states.
A spokesperson for Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, said that the advisory included recommendations that "are reasonable and, in large part, Meta has already implemented." Those measures include automatically making the accounts of people under 16 private when they join Instagram and limiting the types of content teens can see on the app.
TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday afternoon.
The advisory did not provide guidance on what a healthy use of social media might look like, nor did it condemn social-media use for all young people. Rather, it concluded, "We do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents."
The surgeon general's position lacks any real power beyond its potential as a bully pulpit, and Dr. Murthy's advisory does not carry the force of law or policy. It was intended, the report said, to call Americans' attention to "an urgent public health issue" and to make recommendations for how it should be addressed.
Similar reports from past surgeons general helped to shift the national conversation around smoking in the 1960s, drew attention to H.I.V. and AIDS in the 1980s and declared in the early 2000s that obesity had become a nationwide epidemic. Dr. Murthy has declared gun violence to be an epidemic and has decried what he has called a "public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and the lack of connection in our country."
In the interview on Monday, Dr. Murthy acknowledged that the lack of clarity around social media was a heavy burden for users and families to bear.
"That's a lot to ask of parents, to take a new technology that's rapidly evolving and that fundamentally changes how kids perceive themselves," Dr. Murthy said. "So we've got to do what we do in other areas where we have product safety issues, which is to set in place safety standards that parents can rely on, that are actually enforced."

Full text: Holiday weekends in New York City are the best.
If you've subscribed to this newsletter long enough, then you know my motto: Holiday weekends in New York City are the best. The city becomes a little bit hushed, a little bit slow-going, a little bit laid-back -- descriptions that are very rarely applied to this string of islands and isthmuses.
It's also a perfect time to swing by that restaurant you've been meaning to check out, but haven't had the time or the presence of mind to plan for, a problem I also share. Here are six restaurants for you to consider for the Memorial Day weekend, between much-deserved naps and couch potato-ing.
Eastern European in Midtown
Alex Stupak has yet to open a boring restaurant. Mr. Stupak, the pastry-chef-turned-restaurateur of Empellón fame, is synonymous in New York City with upscale Mexican dining, but his latest Midtown project, Mischa, veers in a much more Eastern European and American direction. Go for the kasha varnishkes and apple vareniky dumplings with salt pork and tangy sour cream, and the hot dog (yes, even at $ 29) with a side of chili. And because this is Alex Stupak, everything is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the stomach.
French in Fort Greene
Let this be your warning that the next year will be a big one for dining in Fort Greene. Oma Grassa has been slinging a tight menu of pizzas and antipasti since July, including a mussels fra diavolo that you simply must order. And we now know that the chef April Bloomfield, formerly of the Spotted Pig and the Breslin, is planning a new spot in the neighborhood with the restaurateur Gabe Stulman, as revealed in an Instagram post from February.
And then there's Margot, which to me is Brooklyn's version of King -- and not just because the team is led by women. There's an ease to the place, with every dish delivering on big flavor, like the celery and fennel salad with sweet golden raisins, and the egg yolk raviolo with shallots. Margot also has Manhattan prices -- like $ 85 for a fantastic lamb dish -- but they don't sting as much when you consider the clear ambition streaming out of the kitchen.
Mexican in the Bronx
Another benefit of long weekends? Trying restaurants outside your neighborhood. I've been hungrily eyeing the pizzas at Decades Pizza in Ridgewood, Queens. There's one pie with more pepperonis on it than seems legal.
I would also happily drive up to Tobalá, the eight-month-old Mexican restaurant in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx that Pete Wells reviewed last week. The pulpo de puerto with salsa, and the sweet tamales are calling my name. Pete also makes a compelling case for this year's drink of the summer: the carajillo. "An inky brew under a plush cap of foam," he writes, "it is a union of opposites, bitter and sweet, caffeine and alcohol, liquid and froth, darkness and sunshine."
And, if the weather is good, I'll make my way to the Rockaways because, say it with me, New York City is famously a beach town. Try La Cevicheria, a Peruvian food stand at the Rockaway Bazaar at Beach 97th Street and, starting this weekend, at Jacob Riis Park. What could be more refreshing than ice-cold seafood on a sunny day? Not a single alternative comes to mind.
In Other News ...
I have two exciting bits of news to share: First, The Times has a new iOS app for audio journalism called New York Times Audio. It features our podcasts, narrated articles and more. You'll also hear from Times journalists (including myself!), Opinion columnists and cultural critics. Download that now.
And second, the Summer in the City newsletter returns on Thursday in a new monthly format that will give you and your loved ones recommendations to use throughout the summer. You can sign up here.
This week Pete Wells reviewed House Brooklyn, a new French-Japanese restaurant in Greenpoint. With "a shorter menu and lower prices" the cooking would be "just as intuitive, fluid and impressionistic, if not more so," he writes.
Openings: Restaurant Yuu is now serving a $ 250 tasting menu in Greenpoint; Libertine is slinging gougères and duck breast au poivre in the West Village; and Mitica, a new restaurant from the couple behind Mariscos El Submarino in Jackson Heights, Queens, has moved into the space that was once Anella in Greenpoint.
Is Dallas the new Dubai? A growing number of fine-dining restaurants with national and international footprints certainly seem to think so, reports Priya Krishna.
If you hate QR menus, Amelia Nierenberg has good news for you.
Horses, a popular restaurant in Los Angeles that is a celebrity magnet, is now at the center of a marital dispute between two of its chefs, Julia Moskin reported.

At Least 19 Dead After 'Horrific' Blaze In Dorm of a Guyana Boarding School: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many of the 19 victims were schoolchildren. The fire service said it was still unclear who had set the building ablaze.
A fire that engulfed a girls' dormitory at a school overnight in central Guyana and killed at least 19 people, many of them children, had been "maliciously set," a fire service official said on Monday, as the authorities in the South American country scrambled for answers.
The official, a representative for the Guyana Fire Service, said in a message, "We cannot confirm who set the fire at this time."
Earlier on Monday, the country's president, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, described the blaze as "horrific" and a "major disaster," and said he was organizing a "full-scale emergency" plan.
The ages of the victims were not immediately known, but students enrolled at the school in Mahdia, a gold mining town about 120 miles southwest of the capital, Georgetown, are between 12 and 18.
Officials originally put the death toll at 20, but health care workers resuscitated a young girl who remains in critical condition, according to the fire service.
The blaze broke out around 10:50 p.m. on Sunday, according to the government. A female student was awakened by screams in the night. She saw a fire in the bathroom area that quickly spread to other parts of the building, but was able to escape, the government said.
In a statement on Facebook, the Guyana Fire Service said firefighters had broken holes in a wall of the building to rescue 20 students. Fourteen victims died at the site of the blaze, and five others at a hospital, the statement said. Six other students were evacuated to the capital to receive treatment, and two remained in critical condition.
Five planes stocked with emergency medical supplies and health care workers were also dispatched to Mahdia to support rescue and evacuation efforts, officials said.
"The focus now is on the children to ensure that we do everything, to give them as much help as we can," Mr. Ali told journalists early Monday at Ogle airport, also known as Eugene F. Correia International Airport.
Inclement weather slowed the initial response to the crisis, the government said in an earlier statement. Images posted by a local news outlet showed a glowing plume of smoke rising from the blazing building at Mahdia Secondary School.
Efforts were being made to reach the relatives of the victims, who come from villages across the country to attend the school, according to the government.
In Mahdia, which has a majority Indigenous or Amerindian population, students largely come from remote areas. The government provides air travel so that they can attend the public boarding school.
Michael Mc Garrell, an Amerindian activist, said in a telephone interview that his 15-year-old twin great-nieces were among the fire victims.
"They were jovial girls, always together; when you see one, the other is always there," he said in a WhatsApp message. "Our family is deeply heartbroken by their sudden demise."
Mr. Mc Garrell and other activists have raised concerns about metal grills on the dormitory windows, which he believed blocked the victims from escaping.
"It was a poorly designed building," said Mr. Mc Garrell, who lives in the village of Chenapou, which has a population of 800 and lost four residents in the fire, including the twins, he said.
Some residents of Chenapou began demonstrating, asking for a national day of mourning and for the bodies to be repatriated.
"The community is angry," Mr. Mc Garrell said. "They're trying to find answers."
A regional education officer for Guyana's Ministry of Education, which operates the school, declined to comment, saying she was not permitted to speak to the news media.
"We have to get this right," said President Ali, who added that psychologists and counselors were needed for the emergency response effort, which was headed in Mahdia by the country's minister of home affairs, Robeson Benn. Prime Minister Mark Phillips was also leading a team of officials to the site.
Natasha Singh-Lewis, a representative for the opposition coalition A Partnership for National Unity + Alliance for Change, called for a thorough investigation into "what really went wrong" at the school, according to a statement posted on Facebook on Monday.
"We need to understand how this most horrific and deadly incident occurred and take all necessary measures to prevent such a tragedy from happening again," she said.

The Optimist's Guide to A.I. And Its Value in the Workplace: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The focus of much discussion is on how it will replace jobs, but nothing is inevitable.
It's easy to fear that the machines are taking over: Companies like IBM and the British telecommunications company BT have cited artificial intelligence as a reason for reducing head count, and new tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E make it possible for anyone to understand the extraordinary abilities of artificial intelligence for themselves. One recent study from researchers at OpenAI (the start-up behind ChatGPT) and the University of Pennsylvania concluded that for about 80 percent of jobs, at least 10 percent of tasks could be automated using the technology behind such tools.
"Everybody I talk to, supersmart people, doctors, lawyers, C.E.O.s, other economists, your brain just first goes to, 'Oh, how can generative A.I. replace this thing that humans are doing?"' said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI.
But that's not the only option, he said. "The other thing that I wish people would do more of is think about what new things could be done now that was never done before. Obviously that's a much harder question." It is also, he added, "where most of the value is."
How technology makers design, business leaders use and policymakers regulate A.I. tools will determine how generative A.I. ultimately affects jobs, Brynjolfsson and other economists say. And not all the choices are necessarily bleak for workers.
A.I. can complement human labor rather than replace it. Plenty of companies use A.I. to automate call centers, for instance. But a Fortune 500 company that provides business software has instead used a tool like ChatGPT to give its workers live suggestions for how to respond to customers. Brynjolfsson and his co-authors of a study compared the call center employees who used the tool to those who didn't. They found that the tool boosted productivity by 14 percent on average, with most of the gains made by low-skilled workers. Customer sentiment was also higher and employee turnover lower in the group that used the tool.
David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that A.I. could potentially be used to deliver "expertise on tap" in jobs like health care delivery, software development, law, and skilled repair. "That offers an opportunity to enable more workers to do valuable work that relies on some of that expertise," he said.
Workers can focus on different tasks. As A.T.M.s automated the tasks of dispensing cash and taking deposits, the number of bank tellers increased, according to an analysis by James Bessen, a researcher at the Boston University School of Law. This was partly because while bank branches required fewer workers, they became cheaper to open -- and banks opened more of them. But banks also changed the job description. After A.T.M.s, tellers focused less on counting cash and more on building relationships with customers, to whom they sold products like credit cards. Few jobs can be completely automated by generative A.I. But using an A.I. tool for some tasks may free up workers to expand their work on tasks that can't be automated.
New technology can lead to new jobs. Farming employed nearly 42 percent of the work force in 1900, but because of automation and advances in technology, it accounted for just 2 percent by 2000. The huge reduction in farming jobs didn't result in widespread unemployment. Instead, technology created a lot of new jobs. A farmer in the early 20th century would not have imagined computer coding, genetic engineering or trucking. In an analysis that used census data, Autor and his co-authors found that 60 percent of current occupational specialties did not exist 80 years ago.
Of course, there's no guarantee that workers will be qualified for new jobs, or that they'll be good jobs. And none of this just happens, said Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at M.I.T. and a co-author of "Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity."
"If we make the right choices, then we do create new types of jobs, which is crucial for wage growth and also for truly reaping the productivity benefits," Acemoglu said. "But if we do not make the right choices, much less of this can happen." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Martha's model behavior. The lifestyle entrepreneur Martha Stewart became the oldest person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue this week. Stewart, 81, told The Times that it was a "large challenge" to have the confidence to pose but that two months of Pilates had helped. She isn't the first person over 60 to have the distinction: Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, graced the cover last year at the age of 74.
TikTok block. Montana became the first state to ban the Chinese short video app, barring app stores from offering TikTok within its borders starting Jan. 1. The ban is expected to be difficult to enforce, and TikTok users in the state have sued the government, saying the measure violates their First Amendment rights and giving a glimpse of the potential blowback if the federal government tries to block TikTok nationwide.
Banker blame game. Greg Becker, the ex-C.E.O. of Silicon Valley Bank, blamed "rumors and misconceptions" for a run on deposits in his first public comments since the lender collapsed in March. Becker and former top executives of the failed Signature Bank also told a Senate committee investigating their role in the collapse of the banks that they would not give back millions of dollars in pay.
A brief history of tech C.E.O.s seeking constraints
When OpenAI's chief executive, Sam Altman, testified in Congress this week and called for regulation of generative artificial intelligence, some lawmakers hailed it as a "historic" move. In fact, asking lawmakers for new rules is a move straight out of the tech industry playbook. Silicon Valley's most powerful executives have long gone to Washington to demonstrate their commitment to rules in an attempt to shape them while simultaneously unleashing some of the world's most powerful and transformative technologies without pause.
One reason: A federal rule is much easier to manage than different regulations in different states, Bruce Mehlman, a political consultant and former technology policy official in the Bush administration, told DealBook. Clearer regulations also give investors more confidence in a sector, he added.
The strategy sounds sensible, but if history is a useful guide, the reality can be messier than the rhetoric:
In December 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, was one of six executives to testify about digital assets in the House and call for regulatory clarity. His company had just submitted a proposal for a "unified joint regime," he told lawmakers. A year later, Bankman-Fried's businesses were bankrupt, and he was facing criminal fraud and illegal campaign contribution charges.
In 2019, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post, "The Internet Needs New Rules," based on failures in content moderation, election integrity, privacy and data management at the company. Two years later, independent researchers found that misinformation was more rampant on the platform than in 2016, even though the company had spent billions trying to stamp it out.
In 2018, the Apple chief Tim Cook said he was generally averse to regulation but supported more strict data privacy rules, saying, "It's time for a set of people to think about what can be done." But to maintain its business in China, one of its biggest markets, Apple has largely ceded control of customer data to the government as part of its requirements to operate there.
Buzzword of the week: 'Algospeak'
Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter use algorithms to identify and moderate problematic content. To avert these digital moderators and allow free exchange about taboo topics, a linguistic code has developed. It's called "algospeak."
"A linguistic arms race is raging online -- and it isn't clear who's winning," writes Roger J. Kreuz, a psychology professor at the University of Memphis. Posts about sensitive issues like politics, sex or suicide can be flagged by algorithms and taken down, leading to the use of creative misspellings and stand-ins, like "seggs" and "mascara" for sex, "unalive" for death and "cornucopia" for homophobia. There is a history of responding to prohibitions with code, Kruz notes, such as 19th-century Cockney rhyming slang in England or "Aesopian," an allegorical language used to circumvent censorship in Tsarist Russia.
Algorithms aren't alone in not picking up on the code. The euphemisms and misspellings are particularly ubiquitous among marginalized communities. But the hidden language also sometimes eludes humans, leading to potentially fraught miscommunications online. In February, the celebrity Julia Fox found herself in an awkward exchange with a victim of sexual assault after misunderstanding a post about "mascara" and had to issue a public apology for responding inappropriately to what she thought was a discussion about makeup.

Angry About a Will: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A reader's adult stepchildren want nothing to do with her or their father after learning that the couple plan to leave their estates to each other. Should he reach out?
My husband and I, both 70, were married two years ago after living together for 20 years. When we shared our plans with his grown children, then 25 and 28, they were angry. His son demanded to see my husband's will, which my husband showed him. In it, he leaves his entire estate to me, just as I leave mine to him. His son had hoped to inherit my husband's New York loft and pay me an allowance. Eventually, the loft will go to his two children, and our upstate property will go to them and my daughter. Still, his children accused him angrily of not putting family first. It has now been two years since they spoke to their father. In their last conversation, my husband said he loved them and was always there to talk. Should he reach out to them, or is the onus on them to apologize? Also, should we tell them we've decided to sell the loft?
WIFE
You probably don't need me to tell you that your husband's children behaved atrociously -- both by counting their father's money as if it were their own and by disrespecting your relationship of two decades. I am not shocked by this story, though. Inheritance often brings out the very worst in people.
Now, I don't say this to excuse his children, but I also remember being in my mid-20s: It can be dispiriting to be a young adult without many financial prospects and with everything costing a fortune. So, I empathize (a little) with their grasping at a loft they had long expected to inherit. I am also surprised that your husband has let two years lapse without reaching out to his kids. They are still his children -- bad behavior and all.
If I were your husband and wanted to reconcile, I would call them to re-establish contact. Be the adult! They may be embarrassed by their bad behavior or may have dug into their greed -- or somewhere in between. If the calls go reasonably well, he can invite them to dinner and start rebuilding his relationships with them. Pro tip: Leave out the loft for now. It's been the source of enough drama already.
Too Cozy for Comfort
My boyfriend and I are going on vacation with his parents and brother. His parents are paying for the trip. They sent a link to the vacation house, and we see that we will be sharing a bedroom with my boyfriend's brother that has two queen beds. As a 27-year-old woman, I find this prospect uncomfortable. At the same time, I don't want to complain about a free vacation. Thoughts?
GIRLFRIEND
No offense, but your question makes me wonder if your boyfriend's parents invited you on this vacation or if you and your boyfriend simply decided it would be fun if you went. Because I agree: The sleeping arrangements seem odd.
On the bright side, his parents did you a favor by sending a link to the house in advance. Find out if there's a (pullout) sofa to sleep on. Or buy an inflatable mattress. You are all adults, and his parents are generously picking up the tab. If you can't make the vacation house work for you, stay home.
Looking for Strings on a Stranger's Gift
I have an online friend whom I have never met in real life. We play Words With Friends and chat online about movies and books. I have never divulged my age, address or relationship status to him. Recently, he gave me two tickets to a concert by an artist I mentioned liking. He didn't invite himself as my companion. Still, I told him I was uncomfortable accepting his gift, and I questioned his motives. He assured me that he was acting only out of friendship and that I had no obligation to accept the tickets. Are people really this nice to strangers, or I should I trust my gut that this feels way off?
FRIEND
Yes and yes. People are generous to strangers all the time. In fact, the tremendously low stakes of interactions like yours make it even easier to be nice. What could you possibly fight about in a friendship based on online word games?
I also think you should trust your gut. You are entitled to set boundaries, and if accepting this gift makes you feel uncomfortable or indebted -- which I also get -- refuse it. No matter what you decide, though, acknowledge your friend's thoughtfulness without casting aspersions on his motives.
Sure, He's Cute. But Is He to Dye For?
I am trying out dating apps for the first time. A majority of men on the apps in my area have full, generous beards. But I don't enjoy kissing men with facial hair. When, in a budding relationship, may I ask a man to shave?
SUSAN
I would not ask a man to shave off his beard until you would be comfortable with him asking you to dye your hair a different color or to get a Brazilian wax. It's not wise to start relationships with people whose appearance you intend to change from the outset. If you can't wait to express your preference until a relationship is solid, focus your attention on the smaller pool of clean-shaven men instead.

Stranded Afghans Risk Crossing a Jungle: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Taiba was being hunted by the men she had put behind bars.
The death threats came as the Americans withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban marched across her country, she said. In the chaos, cell doors were flung open, freeing the rapists and abusers she had helped send to prison.
"We will find you," the callers growled. "We will kill you."
Taiba's entire life had been shaped by the American vision of a democratic Afghanistan: She had studied law, worked with the Americans to fight violence against women and ultimately became a top government official for women's rights, gathering testimony that put abusers away.
But after saving so many women's lives, she was suddenly trying to save her own.
She and her husband, Ali, pleaded for help from a half-dozen nations -- many of which they'd worked with -- and found an American refugee program they might be eligible for. Taiba said she sent off her information, but never heard back.
"They left us behind," she said of the Americans. "Sometimes I think maybe God left all Afghans behind."
For months, Taiba kept trying to make it to America any way she could -- even by foot. She and her husband fled with their 2-year-old son, first to Pakistan, then to South America, joining the vast human tide of desperation pressing north toward the United States.
Like thousands of Afghans who have taken this same, unfathomable route to escape the Taliban and their country's economic collapse in the last 17 months, they trudged through the jungle, slept on the forest floor amid fire ants and snakes, hid their money in their food to fool thieves and crossed the sliver of land connecting North and South America -- the treacherous Darién Gap.
Now, after more than 16,000 miles, Taiba and her family had finally reached it: the American border.
In the darkness, Taiba crawled into a drainage tunnel under a highway. When she emerged, she saw two enormous steel fences, the last barriers between her old life and what she hoped would be a new one. A smuggler flung a ladder over the first wall.
Taiba gripped the rungs and began to climb into the country that had helped define her. She knew the Americans were turning away asylum seekers. A single thought consumed her.
Once she got in, would they let her stay?
'The failure is happening right now.'
Frantic parents breached airport gates with suitcases and children in hand. Panicked crowds climbed jet wings and clung to the sides of departing American planes. A few tried to hang on, lost their grip and fell from the skies.
It was August 2021, and the Taliban had swept into Kabul just as American troops pulled out, ending a 20-year occupation that left Afghanistan in the hands of the very militants Washington had ousted.
The images seemed a tragic coda to America's longest war. But for countless Afghans, the frenetic days of the U.S. withdrawal were only the beginning of a long, harrowing search for safety.
The new Taliban administration turned back decades of civil liberties, particularly for women. Afghans who had supported the West were terrified of being persecuted, and a careening economy pushed millions near starvation. Many Afghans fled to Pakistan, Iran and Turkey, often finding only short-term visas or worse -- beatings, detention and deportation.
Thousands tried for Europe, climbing into cargo trucks or taking flimsy boats across the Mediterranean Sea. At least 1,250 Afghan migrants have died trying to find refuge since the American withdrawal, the United Nations says.
Many others set their sights even farther: the United States.
More than 3,600 Afghans have traveled the same agonizing route as Taiba since the beginning of 2022, according to tallies in Panama, one of the most perilous sections of the journey. Many of them had partnered with the West for years -- lawyers, human rights advocates, members of the Afghan government or security forces. They packed up their children, parents or entire families, sold their apartments and borrowed enormous sums to pay for the passage, convinced there was nothing left for them back home.
Their journeys represent the collision of two of President Biden's biggest policy crises: the hasty American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the record number of migrants crossing the U.S. border.
Now, the fallout from a faraway war that many Americans thought was over is landing at the president's doorstep: Afghan men, women and children climbing over border walls under the cover of night, desperate to join a nation that, they feel, left them behind.
The withdrawal from Afghanistan is not just a failure "in the rearview mirror," said Francis Hoang, a former U.S. Army captain who runs an organization to help Afghans immigrate, called Allied Airlift 21.
"The failure is happening right now," he said.
The Afghans wend through about a dozen countries, for months or longer. Nearly all are robbed or extorted; some are kidnapped or jailed. Others are fought over by rival smugglers or sent back to countries they already passed through. Parents and children are torn apart by the authorities. Babies have been born along the way.
The Times traveled with a group of 54 Afghans through one of the hardest parts of the journey, the notorious Darién Gap, and interviewed nearly 100 people making the trek. Many spoke English, had entwined their lives with the Western mission in Afghanistan and hoped that, as American allies, they would be received with open arms.
Most set out for the U.S. border after flying to Brazil, which offers humanitarian visas for Afghans. From there, the smuggler fees mounted quickly, often costing $ 10,000 a person or more, sealing in the Afghans a conviction that they had to reach the United States, where they could earn enough money to dig out from debt and help their relatives back home.
Niazi, 41, traveled with his wife and three sons, all wearing New York baseball caps. He described working in the Afghan president's protective service, and showed off pictures of himself guarding Laura Bush, the American first lady, and President Barack Obama.
He then played a surveillance video of people he identified as members of the Taliban, beating his brothers as they searched for him. He had applied for a special U.S. visa, he said, but because he had worked for the Afghan government, not directly for the Americans, he wasn't eligible.
Ali and Nazanin, a pair of doctors in their 20s who had recently married, were risking the journey, too. Like Taiba and her family, they are Hazara, an ethnic minority massacred by the Taliban during their first regime in the 1990s, and believed they could never be safe under the new government.
"I am thinking about my future child," said Ali.
Two grandfathers, one who said he had worked for the toppled Afghan government, traveled with their families, 17 people in all. Mohammad Sharif, who said he was a former Afghan police officer, and his wife, Rahima, came too, carrying their infant son, born two months before in Brazil.
Nearly all of them asked to be identified only by their first names, to protect relatives back in Afghanistan.
Mozhgan, 20, was the most talkative. She had been in the 11th grade when the Taliban entered Kabul and she could no longer go to school.
The American presence had opened the world for her. She spoke multiple languages, including English, Hindi and bits of Chinese. She watched Marvel movies and listened to BTS, the Korean pop group whose music had turned her from what she called a "shy, sad, corner girl" into a confident, inquisitive woman.
She dreamed of being a fashion designer or a reporter, like the women in American movies. Her sister, Samira, 16, thought about being an astronaut. Under the Taliban, which have barred women from most public spaces, those lives were now impossible.
"Like being on a road with no destination," Mozhgan called it.
Their family, also Hazara, considered legal paths to the United States, Mozhgan said, but determined they would "take years."
Then a bomb went off at their brother's school in Kabul, most likely an attack by Islamic State militants challenging the Taliban, and her father decided to flee.
"You don't know if you will survive," she said, "so we have to take action now."
Thousands of despairing migrants have made the daunting jungle crossing from South America to the United States for years.
But before the Americans left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, Afghans were hardly ever among them. Officials in Panama say that only about 100 Afghans in total crossed the jungle from 2010 to 2019.
Now, hundreds of Afghans are risking it every month, officials say, part of a historic crush of people pouring through the Darién, the only way from South America to the United States by land.
The Darién is a roadless, mountainous tangle, considered a last resort for decades, with notorious hardships: rivers that sweep away bodies, hills that cause heart attacks, mud that nearly swallows children, bandits who rob, kidnap, assault and kill.
But with the economic and political havoc of recent years, including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, interest in the Darién has exploded -- along with relentless advertising on TikTok, Facebook and WhatsApp by smugglers and migrants alike, sometimes presenting the route like a family outing that almost anyone can manage.
"Safe. 100 percent trustworthy. Special packages with transport, lodging and food," reads one Facebook post showing people holding hands as they stroll toward a fluttering American flag. "Guaranteed."
Fewer than 11,000 people crossed the jungle each year, on average, from 2010 to 2020. But this year, officials say, as many as 400,000 are expected to make the journey, nearly all of them headed to the United States.
And while most are from Venezuela, Haiti and Ecuador, the route has increasingly become a United Nations of migration, with a growing number from China, India, Nigeria, Somalia and elsewhere.
Mr. Biden is trying hard to shut it down. In April, he and his allies in the region announced a 60-day campaign intended to end the illicit movement of people through the Darién. His administration has also imposed new rules that are expected to make it harder for all asylum seekers, including Afghans, to enter the United States.
Many of the Afghans on the journey knew Mr. Biden was clamping down on immigration, but said they were coming anyway -- no matter the hardship.
"If 10 times I am sent back," said Ali, the doctor, "10 times I will return."
'Are we going to survive?'
A village formed in Terminal B of São Paulo-Guarulhos airport: Afghans sleeping under wool blankets strung like tents across luggage carts.
It was December 2022, and most of them had arrived in Brazil days before, even weeks, carrying the last of their belongings and only a vague idea of what to do next.
They could stay in Brazil, even work. But few spoke Portuguese, and the nation's minimum wage was only about $ 250 a month. Most had large families -- five, 10 or 20 people -- to support back home. Many had borrowed their relatives' last savings to make it this far, and if they didn't pay it back, their families would go hungry.
"The only hope in the family is me," said Haroon, 27, an engineer who had recently arrived in Brazil.
So, many of the Afghans soon took off, their minds fixed on the United States.
They crossed Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, passed liked batons from smuggler to smuggler.
On a starless night in March, Taiba and her husband, Ali, waded toward a boat in Colombia with 50 other Afghans, headed for the Darién Gap. A haze blurred a full moon.
Their road map was nothing more than a terse, three-page PDF circulating around the world, sometimes on WhatsApp chains. Written in Persian, it offered advice on getting from Brazil all the way through Mexico, listing a few smuggler contacts and pithy travel tips.
In Colombia, "always remember to keep 10 dollars in your passport," to pay off police officers who threaten arrest. In the jungle, "the first day is stressful." In Mexico, "make sure to hide all your documents and money."
Taiba and Ali's son, a round-cheeked toddler who had just turned 3, was getting heavy, so they often strapped him to the back of a cousin, Jalil, 24, a kickboxing coach and an ideal bodyguard for the journey ahead.
Most of the Afghans had heard about the dangers of the Darién, and their smuggler offered them the so-called V.I.P. route -- $ 420 a person, versus the more common $ 300 -- that cut the trip to about four days, from as many as eight or nine.
As Taiba climbed into the boat, packing in with dozens of others like cargo, she tried to make sense of how much her life had changed in the last two years.
She and Ali had met as university students. He later worked as a translator for Spanish troops, he said, before taking a job with a United Nations contractor. Until the Taliban took over, they were happy -- and in love with the Afghanistan they were helping to build. Then, as fighters swept into Kabul, Taiba raced to her office to burn documents, hoping to protect herself and other women, she said, before fleeing to another city.
For months, they pleaded with governments for help, until Uruguay agreed to take them in. But in Montevideo, the capital, they quickly decided that they couldn't earn enough to support their families back home. Taiba argued for heading north.
Now, she was having regrets.
A boat captain barked at them to turn off their phones, so they could travel undetected by the police. The motor roared, and the 54 Afghans sped up the coast, crying, vomiting and praying. Many had never seen an ocean or sea.
"Are we going to drown?" Mozhgan wondered out loud. "Or are we going to survive?"
The next day, they entered the forest and trudged up three mountains, the last of which is known locally as La Llorona, the crying woman. They fell often, lanced their hands on spiked trees, dragged boots filled with mud and at times collapsed from exhaustion. The former policeman's son cried constantly.
Mohammad Rahim, 60, one of the two grandfathers in the family of 17, fared the worst, stopping many times each hour to lay in the dirt. His children knelt beside him, massaging his body back to life. Murmuring prayers, the other Afghans wondered if he would make it.
Near the top of La Llorona, Ahmad, 24, an engineer, began to break down.
"I am crazy to come here!" he yelled, banging his machete into the tree roots knotting the ground.
He had tried to enter the United States legally, applying for a humanitarian parole program in 2021, he said, but never heard back.
"No one cares about us!" he yelled. "We have important people left in Afghanistan and no one cares!"
In the final days of the American occupation in 2021, the Biden administration airlifted roughly 88,500 Afghans out of the country, an effort the American president called "extraordinary."
"Only the United States had the capacity and the will and the ability to do it," Mr. Biden told the American public afterward.
But many tens of thousands of other Afghans worked with the U.S. government or American organizations during the war, and could be at risk of retaliation, according to #AfghanEvac, a group of organizations helping Afghans seeking resettlement.
Fewer than 25,000 Afghans have received special visas or refugee status in the United States since the airlifts in 2021, government data shows. And the options are scarcer for people who didn't work with the United States but might still be in danger.
Roughly 52,000 Afghans have applied for a program called humanitarian parole. As of mid-April, just 760 people had been approved.
By comparison, more than 300,000 Ukrainians arrived in the United States under various programs in just over a year.
"I don't understand why the world has had their arms so open to Ukrainians and so closed to Afghans," said Shawn VanDiver, the U.S. Navy veteran who started #AfghanEvac.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, said the administration was working to enhance an already robust resettlement program for Afghans. She called it "part of our long-term commitment to our Afghan allies."
Many of the Afghans in the jungle said they didn't feel that commitment.
"We did a lot of things for the American people," said Niazi, the father who showed pictures of himself as a guard with President Obama. "But the American people just left us."
A steep dirt hill signaled the Afghans' last push through the wilderness. Finally, they had reached a camp constructed by an Indigenous group, the Emberá. Taiba stared slack-jawed at the generators, wooden platforms and women selling fried chicken and Coca-Cola.
In the morning, the Emberá led them to canoes and, for $ 25 a person, ferried them to a checkpoint in Panama, where officials counted them, took down their nationalities and sent them on their way north.
Mohammad Azim, 70, the other grandfather, rushed to the river to wash himself. Then, beneath a fence topped by barbed wire, he knelt to pray -- thankful that he made it, apprehensive about the thousands of miles to go.
'Everything is dark.'
The group of 54 splintered soon after.
Taiba and her family took a bus through Costa Rica, walked for hours until they found a car through Nicaragua, and were forced to pay bribes to the police in Honduras. In Guatemala, they hiked through more forest, then paid another smuggler to get them from a bus to a boat, across a river and into a truck, all the way to southern Mexico.
Back in Uruguay, Taiba had shed her head scarf to blend in and cut her hair when it began to fall out. By now, she had lost 20 pounds and watched her child lose 15 percent of his body weight.
If the Americans didn't take her, she thought, maybe she would just keep going -- to Canada, where her husband had relatives and, she imagined, the government might be more welcoming.
Ali, the doctor who vowed to keep trying to make it to the United States even if he was "sent back" 10 times, proved prescient. Near the American border, he and his wife were stopped by the Mexican police, robbed and put on a bus across Mexico, back to the border with Guatemala.
They set out again from there, only to be apprehended for a second time and jailed for about a week.
News about other Afghans who tried to cross into the United States trickled in.
Milad, 29, a lawyer, climbed over the wall with his wife and children, ages 2 and 4. They were held in U.S. detention in Calexico, Calif., he said, and told they would be taken to a hotel. Instead, U.S. border officials put them in a white van with blacked out windows that dropped them on the street in Mexicali, Mexico, he said. His cousin Tamim, 27, a journalist, said he had a similar experience.
Ahmad Faheem Majeed, 28, a former Afghan Air Force intelligence officer who crossed into Texas in September 2022, was detained and charged with failing to enter at a designated checkpoint, a misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty and was held in U.S. custody for eight months, court records show.
"I helped these Americans," he said from Eden Detention Center in Texas, sometimes near tears. "I am not understanding why they are not helping me."
U.S. homeland security officials declined to discuss their cases.
Mozhgan's family made it to Mexico City, but was scared to continue without immigration paperwork issued by the Mexican government, which they thought would shield them from arrest. They waited in line for days before heading north.
Taiba and her family boarded a bus from Mexico City to the U.S. border.
"The pleasure of travel," the motto on the bus said. It had been a year since they left Afghanistan.
A weariness set in, her hope nearly buried by exhaustion. Criminals and the police stopped the bus repeatedly to extort money. On the third night, they reached Tijuana, border lights twinkling in the distance. It was early April.
The next evening, a smuggler brought them to the drainage tunnel in the middle of the city. As they climbed the first border fence, they could see wildflowers and a highway on the other side.
Taiba lowered herself to the ground with anticipation, her feet landing on dirt.
They had made it -- or so they thought.
They spent a cold night in an immigration netherworld, of sorts, trapped between two border fences. In the morning, U.S. Border Patrol officers swept them up. After so many thousands of miles, they said, their welcome was a detention center.
They had hoped to claim asylum then and there. Instead, U.S. officials handed them documents clarifying that each was an "alien present in the United States," subject to deportation.
They could fight removal at a court hearing, set for June 30, 2025, on the other side of the country, in Boston.
To apply for asylum, they would have to navigate the process on their own, or find a lawyer. Until then, they couldn't work.
A charity briefly put them in a hotel room, but the questions began to gnaw: How would they eat? Where could they live? Was this the American dream?
"Everything is dark," said Taiba's husband, Ali.
The others faced similar challenges.
Milad, the lawyer, tried the crossing again and made it, landing a kitchen job under the table. Ali and Nazanin, the doctors, finally got to the border and across it, then made their way to her brother's home in Georgia. Niazi, the presidential guard, wound up in a shelter in San Diego, wondering how to get his three boys into classes -- they had lost two years of schooling.
None of the families had a lawyer or a clear idea of how to survive, much less feed their families back home in Afghanistan. Most began writing desperate messages to migrant aid organizations, but the groups were overwhelmed, and the Afghans rarely heard back.
Mozhgan's family faced a different terror: She had gone missing.
She had scaled the first border fence, then spent three nights between the walls. Finally, immigration officials carted her family to detention -- but she and an older brother, both over 18, were treated as single adults and kept in custody, while the rest of the family was released in California.
They had fled Afghanistan together and spent months trekking through unforgiving terrain, evading bandits and dodging corrupt police officers -- only to be separated, without any contact, in the country where they hoped to find refuge.
Her mother, Anisa, was frantic, said Mozhgan's father, Abdul. "We might not be able to see them again," he recalled her saying.
Their children were released about a week later and reunited with the family.
Taiba kept moving. In early May, an aid group in New York offered a spot in a shelter and the family headed east, bound for more uncertainty. Without asylum, they faced a life in the shadows, like millions of other undocumented immigrants in the United States.
Her husband had always assumed the Darién would be the hardest part of the journey.
"But when I emerged from the jungle, we have seen, 'No,"' he said. "The difficulties are forever."

Meta's Big A.I. Giveaway: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant has publicly released its latest A.I. technology so people can build their own chatbots. Rivals like Google say that approach can be dangerous.
In February, Meta made an unusual move in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence: It decided to give away its A.I. crown jewels.
The Silicon Valley giant, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had created an A.I. technology, called LLaMA, that can power online chatbots. But instead of keeping the technology to itself, Meta released the system's underlying computer code into the wild. Academics, government researchers and others who gave their email address to Meta could download the code once the company had vetted the individual.
Essentially, Meta was giving its A.I. technology away as open-source software -- computer code that can be freely copied, modified and reused -- providing outsiders with everything they needed to quickly build chatbots of their own.
"The platform that will win will be the open one," Yann LeCun, Meta's chief A.I. scientist, said in an interview.
As a race to lead A.I. heats up across Silicon Valley, Meta is standing out from its rivals by taking a different approach to the technology. Driven by its founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta believes that the smartest thing to do is share its underlying A.I. engines as a way to spread its influence and ultimately move faster toward the future.
Its actions contrast with those of Google and OpenAI, the two companies leading the new A.I. arms race. Worried that A.I. tools like chatbots will be used to spread disinformation, hate speech and other toxic content, those companies are becoming increasingly secretive about the methods and software that underpin their A.I. products.
Google, OpenAI and others have been critical of Meta, saying an unfettered open-source approach is dangerous. A.I.'s rapid rise in recent months has raised alarm bells about the technology's risks, including how it could upend the job market if it is not properly deployed. And within days of LLaMA's release, the system leaked onto 4chan, the online message board known for spreading false and misleading information.
"We want to think more carefully about giving away details or open sourcing code" of A.I. technology, said Zoubin Ghahramani, a Google vice president of research who helps oversee A.I. work. "Where can that lead to misuse?"
Some within Google have also wondered if open-sourcing A.I. technology may pose a competitive threat. In a memo this month, which was leaked on the online publication Semianalysis.com, a Google engineer warned colleagues that the rise of open-source software like LLaMA could cause Google and OpenAI to lose their lead in A.I.
But Meta said it saw no reason to keep its code to itself. The growing secrecy at Google and OpenAI is a "huge mistake," Dr. LeCun said, and a "really bad take on what is happening." He argues that consumers and governments will refuse to embrace A.I. unless it is outside the control of companies like Google and Meta.
"Do you want every A.I. system to be under the control of a couple of powerful American companies?" he asked.
OpenAI declined to comment.
Meta's open-source approach to A.I. is not novel. The history of technology is littered with battles between open source and proprietary, or closed, systems. Some hoard the most important tools that are used to build tomorrow's computing platforms, while others give those tools away. Most recently, Google open-sourced the Android mobile operating system to take on Apple's dominance in smartphones.
Many companies have openly shared their A.I. technologies in the past, at the insistence of researchers. But their tactics are changing because of the race around A.I. That shift began last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT. The chatbot's wild success wowed consumers and kicked up the competition in the A.I. field, with Google moving quickly to incorporate more A.I. into its products and Microsoft investing $ 13 billion in OpenAI.
While Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have since received most of the attention in A.I., Meta has also invested in the technology for nearly a decade. The company has spent billions of dollars building the software and the hardware needed to realize chatbots and other "generative A.I.," which produce text, images and other media on their own.
In recent months, Meta has worked furiously behind the scenes to weave its years of A.I. research and development into new products. Mr. Zuckerberg is focused on making the company an A.I. leader, holding weekly meetings on the topic with his executive team and product leaders.
On Thursday, in a sign of its commitment to A.I., Meta said it had designed a new computer chip and improved a new supercomputer specifically for building A.I. technologies. It is also designing a new computer data center with an eye toward the creation of A.I.
"We've been building advanced infrastructure for A.I. for years now, and this work reflects long-term efforts that will enable even more advances and better use of this technology across everything we do," Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Meta's biggest A.I. move in recent months was releasing LLaMA, which is what is known as a large language model, or L.L.M. (LLaMA stands for "Large Language Model Meta AI.") L.L.M.s are systems that learn skills by analyzing vast amounts of text, including books, Wikipedia articles and chat logs. ChatGPT and Google's Bard chatbot are also built atop such systems.
L.L.M.s pinpoint patterns in the text they analyze and learn to generate text of their own, including term papers, blog posts, poetry and computer code. They can even carry on complex conversations.
In February, Meta openly released LLaMA, allowing academics, government researchers and others who provided their email address to download the code and use it to build a chatbot of their own.
But the company went further than many other open-source A.I. projects. It allowed people to download a version of LLaMA after it had been trained on enormous amounts of digital text culled from the internet. Researchers call this "releasing the weights," referring to the particular mathematical values learned by the system as it analyzes data.
This was significant because analyzing all that data typically requires hundreds of specialized computer chips and tens of millions of dollars, resources most companies do not have. Those who have the weights can deploy the software quickly, easily and cheaply, spending a fraction of what it would otherwise cost to create such powerful software.
As a result, many in the tech industry believed Meta had set a dangerous precedent. And within days, someone released the LLaMA weights onto 4chan.
At Stanford University, researchers used Meta's new technology to build their own A.I. system, which was made available on the internet. A Stanford researcher named Moussa Doumbouya soon used it to generate problematic text, according to screenshots seen by The New York Times. In one instance, the system provided instructions for disposing of a dead body without being caught. It also generated racist material, including comments that supported the views of Adolf Hitler.
In a private chat among the researchers, which was seen by The Times, Mr. Doumbouya said distributing the technology to the public would be like "a grenade available to everyone in a grocery store." He did not respond to a request for comment.
Stanford promptly removed the A.I. system from the internet. The project was designed to provide researchers with technology that "captured the behaviors of cutting-edge A.I. models," said Tatsunori Hashimoto, the Stanford professor who led the project. "We took the demo down as we became increasingly concerned about misuse potential beyond a research setting."
Dr. LeCun argues that this kind of technology is not as dangerous as it might seem. He said small numbers of individuals could already generate and spread disinformation and hate speech. He added that toxic material could be tightly restricted by social networks such as Facebook.
"You can't prevent people from creating nonsense or dangerous information or whatever," he said. "But you can stop it from being disseminated."
For Meta, more people using open-source software can also level the playing field as it competes with OpenAI, Microsoft and Google. If every software developer in the world builds programs using Meta's tools, it could help entrench the company for the next wave of innovation, staving off potential irrelevance.
Dr. LeCun also pointed to recent history to explain why Meta was committed to open-sourcing A.I. technology. He said the evolution of the consumer internet was the result of open, communal standards that helped build the fastest, most widespread knowledge-sharing network the world had ever seen.
"Progress is faster when it is open," he said. "You have a more vibrant ecosystem where everyone can contribute."

Thiel Is the Latest Billionaire Said to Have Met With a Disgraced Financier: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Thiel apparently had several meetings with Mr. Epstein in 2014, according to records of the disgraced financier reviewed by The New York Times.
In 2014, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel was gaining prominence as one of Silicon Valley's most successful entrepreneurs and investors. He had made billions of dollars as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, where he was chairman; and he sat on the board of Facebook, where he was the company's first outside investor.
That made him an ideal contact for Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender with a knack for cultivating the rich and powerful.
Mr. Thiel apparently had several meetings with Mr. Epstein that year, according to scheduling records of the disgraced financier that were reviewed by The New York Times.
The records -- in the form of emails that Mr. Epstein's assistant sent to remind him of upcoming events -- show that in September 2014 Mr. Thiel was scheduled to meet with Mr. Epstein on at least three occasions, either in one-on-one meetings or with others over lunch or dinner. Two other times, Mr. Thiel was listed among more than a dozen other well-known people Mr. Epstein should try to see while at his New York mansion.
It's unclear from the records whether all the meetings with Mr. Thiel took place. Some were listed as tentative or "TBD" -- for "to be determined."
Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for Mr. Thiel, declined to comment.
The Times obtained the records through a public records request to the attorney general for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which had sued Mr. Epstein's estate. (Mr. Epstein died in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.) The records suggest that Mr. Thiel may have had a closer relationship with Mr. Epstein than was previously known.
Even after his 2008 conviction in Florida on a charge of soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl, Mr. Epstein continued to hobnob with top finance executives and investors, scientists, professors, politicians and celebrities.
Mr. Epstein was fascinated with the technology industry, attending conferences with high-profile industry executives. In 2015, for example, the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman invited him to a dinner attended by, among others, the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk; the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg; and Mr. Thiel. (The dinner was previously reported by Axios.)
The records reviewed by The Times, which begin in 2011, are not a comprehensive accounting of Mr. Epstein's meetings. They do not cover every day, and even full years are missing. (Some of the calendar entries were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal in connection with other individuals.)
On Sept. 14, 2014, Mr. Epstein was tentatively scheduled to have lunch with Mr. Thiel, the records show. The schedule then changed, with Mr. Thiel listed as having an appointment in the afternoon, followed by a potential dinner with Mr. Epstein, the director Woody Allen and others. Mr. Thiel was also expected to have lunch with the financier the next day and the following weekend, the records show.
It's unclear why Mr. Thiel was meeting with Mr. Epstein. At the time, Mr. Thiel sat on the board of Facebook and oversaw Founders Fund, a top venture capital firm. Mr. Thiel was also the chairman of Palantir, the C.I.A.-backed data analytics company, which at the time was seeking outside investments.
Two years later, Mr. Thiel was the most prominent Silicon Valley investor to back the successful presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Thiel's name comes up in the calendar entries far less often than other names of famous people like the Wall Street financier Leon Black, who is listed as having come over frequently for breakfast and lunch.

Supreme Court Delivers 2 Wins To Tech Giants: [National Desk]

Full text: The justices ruled in one case that a law allowing suits for aiding terrorism did not apply to the ordinary activities of social media companies.
The Supreme Court handed twin victories to technology platforms on Thursday by declining in two cases to hold them liable for content posted by their users.
In a case involving Google, the court for now rejected efforts to limit the sweep of the law that frees the platforms from liability for user content, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
In a separate case involving Twitter, the court ruled unanimously that another law allowing suits for aiding terrorism did not apply to the ordinary activities of social media companies.
The rulings did not definitively resolve the question of what responsibility platforms should have for the content posted on and recommended by their sites, an issue that has grown increasingly pressing as social media has become ubiquitous in modern life. But the decision by the court to pass for now on clarifying the breadth of Section 230, which dates to 1996, was cheered by the technology industry, which has long portrayed the law as integral to the development of the internet.
"Companies, scholars, content creators and civil society organizations who joined with us in this case will be reassured by this result," Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, said in a statement.
The Twitter case concerned Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in 2017 for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. His family sued Twitter, Google and Facebook, saying they had allowed ISIS to use their platforms to recruit and train terrorists.
Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the "plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying out the relevant attack."
He wrote that the defendants transmitted staggering amounts of content. "It appears that for every minute of the day, approximately 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, 510,000 comments are posted on Facebook, and 347,000 tweets are sent on Twitter," Justice Thomas wrote.
And he acknowledged that the platforms use algorithms to steer users toward content that interests them.
"So, for example," Justice Thomas wrote, "a person who watches cooking shows on YouTube is more likely to see cooking-based videos and advertisements for cookbooks, whereas someone who likes to watch professorial lectures might see collegiate debates and advertisements for TED Talks.
"But," he added, "not all of the content on defendants' platforms is so benign." In particular, "ISIS uploaded videos that fund-raised for weapons of terror and that showed brutal executions of soldiers and civilians alike."
The platforms' failure to remove such content, Justice Thomas wrote, was not enough to establish liability for aiding and abetting, which he said required plausible allegations that they "gave such knowing and substantial assistance to ISIS that they culpably participated in the Reina attack."
The plaintiffs had not cleared that bar, Justice Thomas wrote. "Plaintiffs' claims fall far short of plausibly alleging that defendants aided and abetted the Reina attack," he wrote.
The platforms' algorithms did not change the analysis, he wrote.
"The algorithms appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any content (including ISIS' content) with any user who is more likely to view that content," Justice Thomas wrote. "The fact that these algorithms matched some ISIS content with some users thus does not convert defendants' passive assistance into active abetting."
A contrary ruling, he added, would expose the platforms to potential liability for "each and every ISIS terrorist act committed anywhere in the world."
The court's decision in the case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, allowed the justices to avoid ruling on the scope of Section 230, a law intended to nurture what was then a nascent creation called the internet.
Section 230 was a reaction to a decision holding an online message board liable for what a user had posted because the service had engaged in some content moderation. The provision said, "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."
Section 230 helped enable the rise of huge social networks like Facebook and Twitter by ensuring that the sites did not assume legal liability with every new tweet, status update and comment. Limiting the sweep of the law could expose the platforms to lawsuits claiming they had steered people to posts and videos that promoted extremism, urged violence, harmed reputations and caused emotional distress.
The case against Google was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old college student who was killed in a restaurant in Paris during terrorist attacks there in November 2015, which also targeted the Bataclan concert hall. The family's lawyers argued that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, had used algorithms to push Islamic State videos to interested viewers.
In a brief, unsigned opinion in the case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333, the court said it would not "address the application of Section 230 to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief." The court instead returned the case to the appeals court "in light of our decision in Twitter."
It is unclear what the ruling will mean for legislative efforts to eliminate or modify the legal shield.
A growing group of bipartisan lawmakers, academics and activists have grown skeptical of Section 230 and say that it has shielded giant tech companies from consequences for disinformation, discrimination and violent content across their platforms.
In recent years, they have advanced a new argument: that the platforms forfeit their protections when their algorithms recommend content, target ads or introduce new connections to their users. These recommendation engines are pervasive, powering features like YouTube's autoplay function and Instagram's suggestions of accounts to follow. Judges have mostly rejected this reasoning.
Members of Congress have also called for changes to the law. But political realities have largely stopped those proposals from gaining traction. Republicans, angered by tech companies that remove posts by conservative politicians and publishers, want the platforms to take down less content. Democrats want the platforms to remove more, like false information about Covid-19.
Critics of Section 230 had mixed responses to the court's decision, or lack of one, in the Gonzalez case.
Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who has criticized major tech platforms, said on Twitter that Congress needed to step in to reform the law because the companies "turn a blind eye" to harmful activities online.
Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who signed a brief supporting the Gonzalez family's case, said that he was heartened that the court had not offered a full-throated defense of the Section 230 liability shield.
He added that he thought "the door is still open for a better case with better facts" to challenge the tech platforms' immunity.
Tech companies and their allies have warned that any alterations to Section 230 would cause the online platforms to take down far more content to avoid any potential legal liability.
Jess Miers, legal advocacy counsel for Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group that represents tech firms including Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that arguments in the case made clear that "changing Section 230's interpretation would create more issues than it would solve."

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court handed twin victories to technology platforms Thursday by declining in two cases to hold them liable for content posted by their users.
In a case involving Google, the court for now rejected efforts to limit the sweep of the law that frees the platforms from liability for user content, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
In a separate case involving Twitter, the court ruled unanimously that another law allowing suits for aiding terrorism did not apply to the ordinary activities of social media companies.
The rulings did not definitively resolve the question of what responsibility platforms should have for the content posted on and recommended by their sites, an issue that has grown increasingly pressing as social media has become ubiquitous in modern life. But the decision by the court to pass for now on clarifying the breadth of Section 230, which dates to 1996, was cheered by the technology industry, which has long portrayed the law as integral to the development of the internet.
“Companies, scholars, content creators and civil society organizations who joined with us in this case will be reassured by this result,” Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement.
The Twitter case concerned Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in 2017 for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. His family sued Twitter, Google and Facebook, saying they had allowed the Islamic State group to use their platforms to recruit and train terrorists.
Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the “plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying out the relevant attack,” using an alternative name for the Islamic State group.
He wrote that the defendants transmitted staggering amounts of content. “It appears that for every minute of the day, approximately 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, 510,000 comments are posted on Facebook, and 347,000 tweets are sent on Twitter,” Thomas wrote.
And he acknowledged that the platforms use algorithms to steer users toward content that interests them.
“So, for example,” Thomas wrote, “a person who watches cooking shows on YouTube is more likely to see cooking-based videos and advertisements for cookbooks, whereas someone who likes to watch professorial lectures might see collegiate debates and advertisements for TED Talks.
”But,” he added, “not all of the content on defendants’ platforms is so benign.” In particular, “ISIS uploaded videos that fundraised for weapons of terror and that showed brutal executions of soldiers and civilians alike.”
The platforms’ failure to remove such content, Thomas wrote, was not enough to establish liability for aiding and abetting, which he said required plausible allegations that they “gave such knowing and substantial assistance to ISIS that they culpably participated in the Reina attack.”
The plaintiffs had not cleared that bar, Thomas wrote. “Plaintiffs’ claims fall far short of plausibly alleging that defendants aided and abetted the Reina attack,” he wrote.
The platforms’ algorithms did not change the analysis, he wrote.
“The algorithms appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any content (including ISIS’ content) with any user who is more likely to view that content,” Thomas wrote. “The fact that these algorithms matched some ISIS content with some users thus does not convert defendants’ passive assistance into active abetting.”
A contrary ruling, he added, would expose the platforms to potential liability for “each and every ISIS terrorist act committed anywhere in the world.”
The court’s decision in the case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, allowed the justices to avoid ruling on the scope of Section 230, a law intended to nurture what was then a nascent creation called the internet.

Kyiv and Moscow Agree On Grain Shipping Deal: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russia last year blocked exports of Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea, a vital part of the global food supply, but they resumed last summer under a fragile pact.
Ukraine and Russia agreed Wednesday to a two-month extension of a wartime deal that allows Ukraine to ship its grain across the Black Sea, a rare example of cooperation between the two countries.
The agreement was scheduled to expire on Thursday. While both sides expressed ongoing grievances over the issue of exports, reaching agreement appeared to offer advantages for governments in both Kyiv and Moscow, as well as for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who acted as broker along with the United Nations.
Under the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which began last July, Ukraine, a major exporter of wheat, corn and sunflower oil, can transport grain and other food products along a corridor past Russian naval vessels that have blockaded Ukraine's ports since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion 15 months ago. The shipments are subject to inspection off the coast of Istanbul, while empty cargo ships headed to Ukraine's ports are also checked, in part to ensure they are not carrying weapons.
Grain exports are important for Ukraine's economy and their resumption also helps maintain the stability of global food prices, which rose sharply during the first months of war, as grain intended for export piled up in Ukrainian ports and warehouses. The resulting shortages and price increases raised the threat of famine in parts of the Middle East and Africa.
"These agreements matter for global food security," the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement, adding that "Ukrainian and Russian products feed the world." He said that discussions would continue on unresolved issues, which he did not specify.
Acrimony caused by the war is a backdrop to the agreement. Russian forces have seized control of agricultural land in southern and eastern Ukraine, and Russian missiles have also targeted Ukraine's agricultural facilities.
To add further insult, this month, Denis Pushilin, the pro-Russian leader of Donetsk region, which Moscow has illegally annexed, said authorities had loaded grain onto a ship at the port of Mariupol. Russian forces decimated the city last spring and occupied it one year ago after a siege.
Ukraine has complained in recent weeks that Russia has prevented required inspections of Black Sea shipments and refused to approve the use of more vessels.
Ukraine's infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said in a Facebook post that despite the extension until July 18, more work needed to be done to address shipment delays that he blamed on Russian "sabotage."
"We hope that our partners will do their best to get the grain deal to fully work for the world's food security and that Russia will eventually stop using food as a weapon and blackmail," he wrote.
Several times over the past year, Russia has threatened to withdraw from the deal, arguing that provisions allowing its own agricultural products and fertilizers to be shipped to world markets are not being fulfilled.
The spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, suggested that the extension of the agreement did not address Russia's complaints. "The distortions in the implementation of the deal should be corrected as quickly as possible," she said during a news conference.
Even though Russian agricultural products are not covered by Western sanctions, some international shipping companies have avoided getting involved in that trade because sanctions have made it more difficult to strike financial and insurance deals with Russia.
In fact, trade data shows that grain exports rose last year as Russia reported a record harvest. And while it's not clear how much those exports have been facilitated by the grain deal, analysts say that Mr. Putin has been under pressure from two of his most important international partners -- Turkey and China -- to continue to renew it.
The deal also serves Mr. Erdogan, who faces a presidential runoff in 11 days, allowing him to avert a repeat of last year's spike in food prices, and to project himself to voters as a vital international leader. He made little reference to his role in brokering the deal on the campaign trail, but supporters take pride in seeing him wheeling and dealing with other world leaders and, to that extent, the announcement enhances his image.
It also highlights Mr. Erdogan's warm ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which have grown stronger during the war, to the dismay of Turkey's NATO allies.
Mr. Erdogan, who announced the extension in a speech to governing party officials, called the renewal "good news for the whole world."
More than 30 million tons of food have been shipped under the Black Sea Initiative, according to data from the United Nations. The original deal was extended in October and again in March, but the last renewal was for just 60 days, half the 120 days sought by Turkey, Ukraine and the United Nations.
Exports slowed in recent weeks as the expiration date approached, and international aid agencies said they feared a lapse in the deal would affect millions of people worldwide. Over all, Ukrainian grain exports have fallen significantly since the invasion.
Since the Russian blockade began last February, Ukraine has explored ways to export more of its crops overland into Eastern and Central Europe. However, those routes can handle much smaller volumes -- and have also provoked a backlash among farmers in some countries, after the Ukrainian grain flooded their markets, driving down prices.

U.S. Sues to Block Amgen's $27.8 Billion Takeover of Horizon: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission said the deal would enable Amgen to exploit its size to block competition for two expensive Horizon drugs.
The News
The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sued to block the drug maker Amgen's $ 27.8 billion acquisition of the pharmaceutical company Horizon Therapeutics, saying it would thwart competition in the drug industry.
The F.T.C. said the deal would allow Amgen to exploit a maneuver known as bundling, in which pharmaceutical companies take advantage of their large portfolios of drugs to offer discounts to insurers and others in exchange for favoring their products. The agency pointed to two expensive Horizon medications that lack competition, saying that bundling would entrench those monopolies.
The commission's move is its most aggressive yet after years of signaling that it would be tougher in scrutinizing pharmaceutical mergers. Its commissioners voted 3 to 0 to approve filing the suit.
Holly Vedova, a senior commission official, said the agency's lawsuit "sends a clear signal to the market: The F.T.C. won't hesitate to challenge mergers that enable pharmaceutical conglomerates to entrench their monopolies at the expense of consumers and fair competition."
Amgen said the merger did not pose competitive issues and that it would not bundle the two Horizon products.
The merger, announced late last year, was poised to be one of the largest pharmaceutical deals in recent years.
The F.T.C. has long forced merging pharmaceutical companies to sell off drugs that treat the same types of diseases, but it is much rarer for it to try to quash a merger altogether. This case is unusual because Amgen and Horizon do not sell competing products.
Background: The F.T.C. has been challenging corporate deals
Under the Biden administration, the F.T.C. has challenged corporate mergers for reasons that go beyond traditional antitrust concerns about overlapping products.
The F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, has been very skeptical of corporate mergers in the tech industry. For example, the agency unsuccessfully tried to block Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, from buying a small virtual reality start-up, a rare challenge to an acquisition in a nascent market for an unproven product.
The F.T.C.'s move to try to block the Amgen-Horizon merger because of concerns about bundling is also unusual. "It tells us that the F.T.C. is considering new theories of harm that have not been front and center before," said Michael Carrier, an expert on antitrust issues in the pharmaceutical industry at Rutgers Law School.
Why It Matters: Bundling can keep drug prices high
The F.T.C.'s concern about bundling in the Amgen-Horizon merger is linked to concerns about high drug prices.
There has been increased attention to the rebates that drug companies offer to insurers and the industry middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers in exchange for favoring their drugs. By offering deep discounts through bundling, a company can prevent competitors from gaining market share or discourage them from even trying to enter the market. That can keep prices high.
In the case of Amgen and Horizon, the F.T.C. said, the merger would enable Amgen to pressure insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to favor two expensive Horizon drugs for rare conditions. The drugs treat an autoimmune disease, thyroid eye disease, and an inflammatory condition, chronic refractory gout.
Amgen's promise to the F.T.C. not to bundle the two Horizon products would be difficult for regulators to enforce. Drug negotiations are confidential, and drug makers have a long history of finding creative ways to get around such commitments, said Ameet Sarpatwari, an expert in pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.
What's Next: The case will move to court
Amgen and Horizon said that they would not abandon the deal and would go to court to try to push through the merger by mid-December. The outcome is likely to be decided by a federal court in Illinois, where the F.T.C. filed its lawsuit.
"How it plays out will serve as a litmus test for the ability to use antitrust law as a way to promote affordable access to pharmaceuticals," Dr. Sarpatwari said.

Where Vegetarians Are Always Welcome: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: These restaurants are not meatless, but they have a way with vegetables.
New York City is full of restaurants that deliver the unexpected. A nearly 80-year-old Jewish deli run by a Yemeni family, scallion pancake burritos lowered from someone's fire escape by bucket, bagels to rival New York's delivered from Connecticut. After all, isn't that why we live here? The ever-present possibility that something exciting could be right around the corner.
That's what I had in mind when I started thinking about restaurants that aren't vegetarian, but treat vegetables and other non-meat dishes in such a surprisingly loving way that they feel as if they were made for vegetarians? Here are just a few options that I find so thrilling they have me reconsidering my omnivore status altogether.
Yes, Pasta
Misi, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the first to come to mind. You might be thinking, a pasta restaurant? Really, Nikita? But Misi is so much more. It has one of the most impressive and well-considered antipasti lists you're likely to find on that side of the East River. Consider the earthy trumpet mushrooms sprinkled over the Instagram-famous crostini with whipped ricotta. Or the plump little butter beans in a shimmering pool of olive oil. Maybe Swiss chard studded with pine nuts is more your steeze. I'm so enamored with how the vegetables are treated here that I'm just as inclined to choose a vegetarian pasta for my entree: Run, don't walk, to the corzetti.
Look to the Middle East
A tip I cannot emphasize enough: Middle Eastern and North African restaurants always have a way with vegetables. One place that perfectly represents this is Miriam, an Israeli restaurant with locations in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and the Upper West Side. So much of the menu is vegetarian-leaning that adding meat is an option. Think turmeric-dusted cauliflower over a swirl of green tahini, and kebabs made with "meat" from Impossible Foods.
My colleague Kasia Pilat -- whose adorable illustrations you may have seen as part of the meal plans that Tanya Sichynsky puts together for her New York Times Cooking newsletter, The Veggie -- is mostly vegetarian. She says (and I agree) that my above theorem holds up at Sofreh, a Persian restaurant in Prospect Heights, calling their smoked eggplant with frizzled onions "BONKERS good." What's more: The cauliflower entree with walnuts and pomegranate is not a sad excuse of a vegetarian main. That's truly the highest praise a vegetable lover can give a restaurant that also offers a lamb shank the size of a pro wrestler's fist.
And Something Just For You
Or perhaps you're simply tired of accommodating meat eaters. I hear you: Going out to eat should be a two-way street. But New York is full of uncompromising one-way streets that work just fine, thank you very much.
Let this then be your umpteenth reminder that Superiority Burger, in the East Village, is finally open. The namesake burger is one of the best veggie burgers in the city, though I find myself drawn to the focaccia sandwich stuffed with long-cooked collard greens. (As a lifelong anemic, I need the iron.) Beets sprinkled with fried pretzels? Yes, please. Spiced lentils and cornbread, absolutely.
You can enjoy those veggie burgers until 1:45 in the morning if you have a hankering and are in the East Village on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night, as part of the restaurant's pared-down Night Shift menu. New York is (maybe) back, baby!
In Other News ...
I received so many great responses to last week's newsletter about where to eat with picky parents. (I also got your recipe requests; thank you, please hold!) Kenzie D. said that Periyali, a Greek restaurant in the Flatiron district, "can accommodate groups" and is on the quieter side. Matthew R. took his parents to Vic's, in NoHo, where they enjoyed the simple menu while rubbing elbows with the "N.Y.U./hipster crowd." Lacey B. says her "picky mom" loves Frank, in the East Village, not least because she "has crush on the bartender." And Michael R. said he usually takes his parents to Turkish Grill, in Sunnyside, Queens, which is "delightfully low-key but still delicious" and offers dishes his parents can't get in their hometown.
Pete Wells reviewed the Mexican restaurant Tobalá, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, founded by a chef and his wife who fell in love with Oaxaca while on vacation. The restaurant, which serves carajillo cocktails and dishes like duck enmoladas with mole negro, "tries to stay true to Mexico without getting precious about it," he writes.
Openings: Jaffa Cocktail + Raw Bar, from the CookNSolo team, joins Laser Wolf and K'Far at the Hoxton hotel in Williamsburg; Donna, which closed during the pandemic, is reopening in the West Village as a cooperative; and 929 and Gulp is serving Taiwanese takeout and Chinese-inspired cocktails in Long Island City, Queens.
Restaurant service charges are here to stay, even though diners and employees don't always know where the money is going, Priya Krishna reports.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Marion Siéfert's much-anticipated new show, the French director explores the dynamics of online grooming.
The French stage director Marion Siéfert has her finger on the pulse of our digital lives. In "2 or 3 Things I Know About You," she playfully tackled oversharing on Facebook, before turning to the perils of online streaming in "_jeanne_dark_" -- a show that fell foul of Instagram's moderation policies when it was relayed live on the platform.
With "Daddy," a sharp, no-holds-barred new production at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, in Paris, Siéfert has ventured even further into the internet's dark corners. In it, a 13-year-old is groomed online by an older man and gets lost in a virtual reality game that exploits teenage girls for profit.
It also marks a new stage in Siéfert's career. "Daddy" is her first big-budget production for a major playhouse, and one of the Paris season's most anticipated premieres. So Siéfert is swinging much bigger, on every level: larger cast, more atmospheric sets and a somewhat indulgent running time of three and a half hours. Yet her biting originality remains intact.
Reality is no match for screen entertainment in "Daddy." The central character, Mara, is a quiet teenager from southern France. A subtly written scene, early on, introduces her family: Her parents, a nurse and a security guard, are too exhausted by their poorly paid jobs to devote much attention to their daughters. It's no surprise that whenever she can, Mara escapes to the brighter landscape of online gaming.
In an unnamed video game, she joins Julien, a smooth-talking 27-year-old who is her frequent online partner in crime. The easy intimacy they have built is showcased through a spectacular video sequence: On a screen the size of the Odéon's stage, we see a 3-D game designed by the video artist Antoine Briot in which Mara and Julien's avatars who shoot at enemies with assault rifles before hopping on fluorescent skateboards.
Throughout, we hear Mara and Julien banter over their headsets. "You're the most badass girl in this game," Julien says.
The groundwork is laid for the abusive dynamic that ensues. When they first meet outside the game, on a video call, Mara confides in Julien that she dreams of being an actress. He compliments her, and tells her about "Daddy" -- a new game that allows players, Julien says, to become avatars sponsored by sugar daddies, and showcase their talents to a "fan base."
Siéfert has a knack for assembling captivatingly unconventional actors, and just as "_jeanne_dark_" was tailor-made for Helena de Laurens, a shape-shifter unafraid to lean into grotesque physicality, "Daddy" owes much to its two central performers. As Mara, the 15-year-old Lila Houel, who came to the production with limited stage experience, is coarsely candid in these early scenes, with turns of phrase that emphasize the character's working-class background. Opposite her, Louis Peres, best known as a screen actor, is a startling tech-generation descendant of Christian Bale in "American Psycho": clean-cut, in control, smoothly scary.
Siéfert's smartest move is to leave video and special effects behind once the two enter the game world of "Daddy." The virtual space becomes a sinister, near-empty stage dotted with what look like snow mounds, where Mara encounters other preyed-upon young women.
The rules of "Daddy" aren't wholly clear. Men invest so teenage girls can perform routines that earn them points with fans. Houel, for instance, interprets a scene from the movie "Interview with the Vampire"; the sparkling Jennifer Gold, who plays the game's reigning star Jessica, delivers cabaret-style numbers, including Marilyn Monroe's "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" from the 1960 film "Let's Make Love."
The points and the fans are never shown -- Siéfert keeps things deliberately vague. The focus is on the dynamics of child abuse, and the erosion of Mara's individuality and willpower by Julien. While some scenes of verbal and physical violence are troubling enough to make you fear for Houel's mental health, she rises to the occasion with astonishing sang-froid, quietly haunted then seething in the second act.
Siéfert co-wrote "Daddy" with Matthieu Bareyre, and some of the points they make don't need so much time to come across: Cuts would be welcome. Yet "Daddy" speaks to the zeitgeist and the lives of teenagers today with a mix of ease and critical distance that few stage directors can match.
And even at 11:30 p.m., one final scene had the audience sitting up and leaning forward. After a bloody narrative twist, the back wall of the stage slid away to reveal the street outside, and a performer staggered out of the game into the Odéon's leafy neighborhood -- while a few passers-by stopped, puzzled, to peek at the action onstage. In Siéfert's theater, the real and the virtual keep colliding in invigorating ways.

To Turn Around Twitter, Musk Looks to an Advertising Expert: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Musk said Ms. Yaccarino would focus on business operations and he would work on product design and technology at the social media platform.
Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal's advertising chief, was preparing to interview Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, onstage at a conference last month when she received an email from a peer in the advertising industry.
Rob Norman, a former executive at the ad giant WPP, wanted to know if Ms. Yaccarino had seen the op-ed he wrote after Mr. Musk bought Twitter last year. Mr. Norman's column discussed the tech billionaire's amplification of misinformation on Twitter and its chilling effect on advertisers.
Ms. Yaccarino said that she had and that she planned to raise such concerns, Mr. Norman said. But the main focus of her talk with Mr. Musk would be on something else: His efforts to revamp the social network into "Twitter 2.0."
Now Ms. Yaccarino is set to become the face of Twitter 2.0. Mr. Musk said on Friday that he had selected Ms. Yaccarino, 60, to become the company's chief executive. Hours earlier, NBCUniversal announced that Ms. Yaccarino was leaving, effective immediately.
"I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new C.E.O. of Twitter," Mr. Musk tweeted. He said she would mainly handle business operations while he would continue working on product design and technology.
In choosing Ms. Yaccarino, Mr. Musk is signaling what his priority is at Twitter: its advertising business, rather than social media know-how. Ms. Yaccarino has been one of Madison Avenue's power brokers for decades. And Twitter, which makes the bulk of its revenue from ads, has struggled to expand that business, especially after Mr. Musk spooked advertisers last year.
"Linda's a force," said Joe Marchese, the former head of ad sales at the Fox Networks Group, who has known Ms. Yaccarino for at least a decade. "She has one of the biggest jobs in advertising, and the ad market is as hard as it's ever been."
Yet Ms. Yaccarino will have to do more than contend with Twitter's advertising woes. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has been severely slimmed down since Mr. Musk slashed 75 percent of its work force and has grappled with gaps in expertise and technical glitches. Twitter is also weighed down by $ 13 billion in debt that it took on to enable Mr. Musk to buy the company.
Most significantly, Ms. Yaccarino would have to deal with a mercurial and unpredictable boss in Mr. Musk. The 51-year-old billionaire has a track record of firing executives who don't achieve his goals. He sometimes tweets news about his various companies, which also include the electric carmaker Tesla, without warning. And as Twitter's owner, Mr. Musk retains absolute power at the company.
Mr. Musk already upended Ms. Yaccarino's carefully laid plans when he tweeted on Thursday that he had selected a new Twitter chief, though he did not identify her. Ms. Yaccarino, who was in back-to-back rehearsals for NBC's annual pitch to major advertisers when the tweet went out, hadn't informed many of her fellow executives that she was planning to leave, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
Lou Paskalis, a longtime ad executive and friend of Ms. Yaccarino, likened her move to Twitter to taking a "step into the lion's mouth."
"With her stature in the industry as probably one of the most beloved and trusted people on the revenue side, I question why she would subject herself to that kind of potential reputational risk," he said.
Mr. Musk and Ms. Yaccarino may be betting that there is plenty of upside with Twitter 2.0. Mr. Musk has laid out ambitious plans for the company, telling employees that it could be worth $ 250 billion one day and that the platform can be an "everything app," with features like payments. (He recently said that Twitter is worth $ 20 billion, down from the $ 44 billion he paid for it.)
Ms. Yaccarino has already been working on her priorities at Twitter. One person who has spoken with her in recent days said that she is focused on repairing the company's relationship with Madison Avenue and wooing media companies back to the platform, potentially with partnership deals.
And she and Mr. Musk appear aligned on political issues -- such as a more permissive approach toward speech on Twitter -- that are central to his vision for the platform, two people familiar with her views said. She is a conservative and a critic of so-called woke discourse, a term used by conservatives to describe elements of left-wing social progressivism they view as censorious, they said.
Former President Donald J. Trump twice appointed Ms. Yaccarino to two-year terms on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, where she joined would-be Republican politicians such as Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician.
Ms. Yaccarino, who did not return requests for comment, grew up with working-class Italian parents in Long Island, New York, including a father who was a police officer. She attended Catholic school. After graduating from Pennsylvania State University in 1985 with a telecommunications degree, she spent nearly 20 years at Turner Entertainment, becoming chief operating officer of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions before leaving for NBCUniversal in 2011.
At Turner and NBCUniversal, Ms. Yaccarino -- who has been said to negotiate like a "velvet hammer" -- made a name for herself by helping traditional television hold its ground in advertising in the era of Facebook and Google. Each year, she strode onstage at Radio City Music Hall for the upfront presentations, the glitzy showcases used by television networks to woo Madison Avenue, to persuade marketers to pay a hefty premium over social media rates to advertise on shows like "This Is Us" and "Saturday Night Live."
But while Ms. Yaccarino has spent years defending TV ad dollars from tech companies and been a fierce critic of Facebook and YouTube, she has also struck partnerships with apps like Snapchat and TikTok and digital outlets like BuzzFeed.
Outside work, Ms. Yaccarino became involved in initiatives including the World Economic Forum's Taskforce on Future of Work, which she heads. She was also a chair on the board of the Ad Council, a nonprofit, and helped the group raise $ 60 million in three months early in the pandemic to help counter vaccine hesitancy, making private calls, sending notes and "working every lever that she had," said Lisa Sherman, the council's chief executive.
Ms. Yaccarino reached out to Mr. Musk around the time of the Super Bowl in February to discuss a partnership with NBCUniversal and potentially joining Twitter as chief executive, three people familiar with their talks said.
She had previously expressed admiration for Twitter, calling the platform "the single, No. 1 biggest" content distribution partner for NBCUniversal at an ad industry event soon after Mr. Musk took over the company. At the time, she added that she did not plan to "bet against him" and that she believed he could "learn advertising."
"I think we can teach him," she said.
This week, Ms. Yaccarino was in attendance when Mr. Musk spoke at an advertising conference in California's Napa Valley hosted by WPP, three people familiar with the event said.
Ms. Yaccarino would be a rare female chief executive in technology, as top executives like Meta's Sheryl Sandberg and YouTube's Susan Wojcicki have recently left their roles. Throughout her career, Ms. Yaccarino has often said that she has been the only woman at the table and has described incidents of bias, such as the time a male supervisor complained in an otherwise flattering performance review about her aggressiveness: "I only wish she would stop using her high heels as a weapon."
While Ms. Yaccarino is active on Twitter, her habits are sedate compared to Mr. Musk's, though in recent weeks, she has liked dozens of posts by and about him.
Still, the differences between Mr. Musk and Ms. Yaccarino were clear last month at the media conference in Miami. A polished Ms. Yaccarino came with prepared comments. An unshaven Mr. Musk spent a few moments wrangling his toddler son, X Æ A-12, before joining her and offering sometimes halting answers to her questions.
Ms. Yaccarino returned repeatedly to worries that her industry colleagues have voiced since Mr. Musk took control of Twitter, emphasizing several times that the audience of ad executives was crucial to the company's financial success.
Mr. Musk said that "there's legitimate concerns that advertisers have that I want to hear." He recounted a complaint he had heard from David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, who was frustrated that he was unable to place ads for "White Lotus," the hit HBO show, next to discussions of "White Lotus" on Twitter.
The issue has since been fixed, Mr. Musk said.
Ms. Yaccarino answered: "So it's a new beginning."

Close Election in Thailand Becomes a Vote on the Role of the Monarchy: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Liberal voters have intensified their scrutiny of the Thai monarchy in recent years. Conservatives have responded with a campaign to defend the institution at all costs.
When Thais go to the polls on Sunday, they will be voting in a closely fought election that is seen, in part, as a referendum on whether it is illegal to criticize the Thai monarchy.
Thailand has one of the world's strictest laws against defaming or insulting the king and other members of the royal family. Once considered taboo, the topic of the monarchy was brought to the forefront after tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and called for checks on the institution's power in 2020.
The protests represented two sides of an impassioned struggle to determine the role of the crown in modern Thailand. The election could determine whether the Southeast Asian nation of 72 million will revive its once-vibrant democracy or slide further toward authoritarian rule, with royalists firmly in power.
On one side of the debate are conservative political parties whose standard-bearer is Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who has governed Thailand for nine years after seizing power in a coup. He and his supporters argue that amending the law could lead to abolishing the monarchy altogether, and have vowed to defend the royal family.
On the other side is the progressive Move Forward Party, which is polling in second place and argues that the law needs to be amended because it is being used as a political weapon. Several young people who participated in the 2020 protests are now running as candidates with the Move Forward Party.
"Perhaps one of the deepest fault lines in Thai society is about the monarchy," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand for Human Rights Watch.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the youngest daughter of the ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and the front-runner for prime minister, is treading carefully. Her father, a populist billionaire, is one of the most divisive political figures in Thailand. He lives in self-exile after being ousted in a coup in 2006 and can return to Thailand only with the king's permission.
Royalists have consistently accused Mr. Thaksin of wanting to overthrow the monarchy, a charge that he denies. Ms. Paetongtarn has said her party, Pheu Thai, would not abolish the law protecting the monarchy from criticism, but that the issue of reform must be openly discussed in Parliament.
Opinion polls show that the party of Mr. Prayuth, United Thai Nation, is trailing in third place behind Pheu Thai, which has topped the polls. In recent weeks, there has also been a surge in support for the Move Forward Party, which is polling a close No. 2.
Move Forward is the largest party pushing to amend the law, irking conservatives who have accused it of undermining the monarchy. The party wants to cut the jail terms of violators of the law and designate the Bureau of the Royal Household as the only agency allowed to file lawsuits. (Any Thai citizen is able to file complaints under the current version of the law.)
Conservative politicians have threatened to disband Move Forward. The party's previous iteration, the Future Forward Party, was dissolved in 2020 by the Constitutional Court. In a sign of how sensitive the topic of reform has become, Move Forward has attempted to moderate its position, saying reform would not take precedence in its campaign.
For decades, the monarchy and the military have had a symbiotic relationship, with the army frequently reminding the public that it is the true guardian of the Thai crown. Thais are taught from a young age that they have to love the king and that any criticism of the monarchy is strictly forbidden.
But today, many Thais no longer stand at attention when the royal anthem is played in public spaces such as movie theaters. Royalist Marketplace, a Facebook group set up to satirize the monarchy, had more than 1 million members before Facebook blocked access to it in 2020, citing a Thai government request.
The law criminalizing criticism of the monarchy carries a minimum sentence of three years if violated -- the only law in Thailand that imposes a minimum jail term -- and a maximum sentence of up to 15 years. After the 2020 protests, the authorities charged at least 223 people, including 17 minors, for violating the law, known as Article 112.
Tantawan "Tawan" Tuatulanon, a 21-year-old law student, was accused of violating the rule in 2022 after she and her friends conducted a poll asking whether the royal motorcade was an inconvenience to Bangkok residents.
In recent weeks, she has been pressing political parties on whether they would amend the law -- which she is in favor of abolishing -- after the election. On Wednesday, Ms. Tantawan was arrested after she called for the release of a 15-year-old charged with violating the rule.
"I feel we don't need any law that specially protects anybody or any family," said Ms. Tantawan, who mounted a hunger strike earlier this year in protest against the government. "He is a person like us, not a god or a demigod."
King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who ascended the throne in 2016, is not as beloved as his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years. While King Bhumibol was revered in Thailand, his son used to spend most of his time in Germany, though he has been seen more often in public since the 2020 protests.
In the wake of the protests, Mr. Prayuth instructed all government officials to "use every single law" to prosecute anyone who criticized the monarchy. Royalists stepped up their campaign against people they accused of insulting the crown, filing more complaints and attacking anti-monarchy activists.
In 2021, Warong Dechgitvigrom, a former doctor, founded Thailand's first far-right party, Thai Pakdee, in response to what he called the "Three Fingers Mob," referring to the three-finger salute adopted by young Thais as a symbol of resistance during the 2020 protests.
He now says the current law protecting the monarchy does not go far enough, as it is limited to shielding four key members of the royal family. Former Thai kings, princes, princesses and the word "monarchy" itself should also be protected, he said.
Although Mr. Warong's views are considered extreme, he says he has collected about 6,000 to 7,000 signatures for his proposal, and that he is confident he can gather the 10,000 signatures needed for the House of Representatives to consider passing the bill.
Mr. Warong says people need to understand that the Thai monarchy is unique. He recalled France's former monarchy as one characterized by the oppression of its people. "But ours is like father and children," he said. "We have good feelings together, there are no bad feelings."
Those views are at odds with how many young people feel about the king. During the 2020 demonstrations, protesters questioned the wealth of the royal family, which is one of the richest in the world.
Kasit Piromya, a former foreign minister, said it would be challenging for Mr. Warong and his party to lead a successful campaign backing the constitutional monarchy because many young people "don't see what is in it for them."
"If you cannot speak this in the open, then it gives more room and ammunition to the students, to the Thaksin supporters to say, 'We are more democratic,"' Mr. Kasit said, referring to calls to reform the monarchy.
Arnond Sakworawich, an assistant professor of statistics at the National Institute of Development Administration, said that preserving Article 112 was necessary because the king and the royal family do not defend themselves against criticism.
"It's a different culture, because in Thailand, people believe that the king is their parent, and parents never hurt their children," said Mr. Arnond, who is known for his royalist views. "So there must be some people to protect the king."
In their zeal to defend the monarchy, many royalists may ultimately end up hurting the institution more than they protect it.
Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, the head of the department of government at Chulalongkorn University, said it was "very precarious and risky" for parties such as Thai Pakdee to use the monarchy as a campaigning platform.
"Even though the monarchy is above politics, it's now drawn into the divide," she said. "It will polarize the voters and parties into two camps, inevitably."

Abstract: None available.

Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal’s advertising chief, was preparing to interview Elon Musk, Twitter’s owner, onstage at a conference last month when she received an email from a peer in the advertising industry.
Rob Norman, a former executive at the ad giant WPP, wanted to know if Yaccarino had seen the op-ed he wrote after Musk bought Twitter last year. Norman’s column discussed the tech billionaire’s amplification of misinformation on Twitter and its chilling effect on advertisers.
Yaccarino said that she had and that she planned to raise such concerns, Norman said. But the main focus of her talk with Musk would be on something else: his efforts to revamp the social network into “Twitter 2.0.”
Now Yaccarino is set to become the face of Twitter 2.0. Musk said Friday that he had selected Yaccarino, 60, to become the company’s CEO. Hours earlier, NBCUniversal announced that Yaccarino was leaving, effective immediately.
“I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter,” Musk tweeted. He said she would mainly handle business operations while he would continue working on product design and technology.
In choosing Yaccarino, Musk is signaling what his priority is at Twitter: its advertising business, rather than social media know-how. Yaccarino has been one of Madison Avenue’s power brokers for decades. And Twitter, which makes the bulk of its revenue from ads, has struggled to expand that business, especially after Musk spooked advertisers last year.
“Linda’s a force,” said Joe Marchese, the former head of ad sales at the Fox Networks Group, who has known Yaccarino for at least a decade. “She has one of the biggest jobs in advertising, and the ad market is as hard as it’s ever been.”
Yet Yaccarino will have to do more than contend with Twitter’s advertising woes. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has been severely slimmed down since Musk slashed 75% of its workforce and has grappled with gaps in expertise and technical glitches. Twitter is also weighed down by $13 billion in debt that it took on to enable Musk to buy the company.
Most significantly, Yaccarino would have to deal with a mercurial and unpredictable boss in Musk. The 51-year-old billionaire has a track record of firing executives who don’t achieve his goals. He sometimes tweets news about his various companies, which also include electric carmaker Tesla, without warning. And as Twitter’s owner, Musk retains absolute power at the company.
Musk already upended Yaccarino’s carefully laid plans when he tweeted Thursday that he had selected a new Twitter chief, although he did not identify her. Yaccarino, who was in back-to-back rehearsals for NBC’s annual pitch to major advertisers when the tweet went out, hadn’t informed many of her fellow executives that she was planning to leave, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
Lou Paskalis, a longtime ad executive and friend of Yaccarino, likened her move to Twitter to taking a “step into the lion’s mouth.”
“With her stature in the industry as probably one of the most beloved and trusted people on the revenue side, I question why she would subject herself to that kind of potential reputational risk,” he said.
Musk and Yaccarino may be betting that there is plenty of upside with Twitter 2.0. Musk has laid out ambitious plans for the company, telling employees that it could be worth $250 billion one day and that the platform can be an “everything app,” with features like payments. (He recently said that Twitter is worth $20 billion, down from the $44 billion he paid for it.)
Yaccarino has already been working on her priorities at Twitter. One person who has spoken with her in recent days said she is focused on repairing the company’s relationship with Madison Avenue and wooing media companies back to the platform, potentially with partnership deals.
And she and Musk appear aligned on political issues — such as a more permissive approach toward speech on Twitter — that are central to his vision for the platform, two people familiar with her views said. She is a conservative and a critic of so-called woke discourse, a term used by conservatives to describe elements of left-wing social progressivism they view as censorious, they said.
Former President Donald Trump twice appointed Yaccarino to two-year terms on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, where she joined would-be Republican politicians such as Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician.
Yaccarino, who did not return requests for comment, grew up with working-class Italian parents in Long Island, New York, including a father who was a police officer. She attended Catholic school. After graduating from Pennsylvania State University in 1985 with a telecommunications degree, she spent nearly 20 years at Turner Entertainment, becoming chief operating officer of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions before leaving for NBCUniversal in 2011.
At Turner and NBCUniversal, Yaccarino — who has been said to negotiate like a “velvet hammer” — made a name for herself by helping traditional television hold its ground in advertising in the era of Facebook and Google. Each year, she strode onstage at Radio City Music Hall for the upfront presentations, the glitzy showcases used by television networks to woo Madison Avenue, to persuade marketers to pay a hefty premium over social media rates to advertise on shows like “This Is Us” and “Saturday Night Live.”
But while Yaccarino has spent years defending TV ad dollars from tech companies and been a fierce critic of Facebook and YouTube, she has also struck partnerships with apps like Snapchat and TikTok and digital outlets like BuzzFeed.
Outside work, Yaccarino became involved in initiatives including the World Economic Forum’s Taskforce on Future of Work, which she heads. She was also a chair on the board of the Ad Council, a nonprofit, and helped the group raise $60 million in three months early in the pandemic to help counter vaccine hesitancy, making private calls, sending notes and “working every lever that she had,” said Lisa Sherman, the council’s CEO.
Yaccarino reached out to Musk around the time of the Super Bowl, in February, to discuss a partnership with NBCUniversal and potentially joining Twitter as CEO, three people familiar with their talks. She had previously expressed admiration for Twitter, calling the platform “the single, No. 1 biggest” content distribution partner for NBCUniversal at an ad industry event soon after Musk took over the company. At the time, she added that she did not plan to “bet against him” and that she believed he could “learn advertising.”
“I think we can teach him,” she said.
This week, Yaccarino was in attendance when Musk spoke at an advertising conference in California’s Napa Valley hosted by WPP, three people familiar with the event said.
Yaccarino would be a rare female CEO in technology, as top executives like Meta’s Sheryl Sandberg and YouTube’s Susan Wojcicki have recently left their roles. Throughout her career, Yaccarino has often said that she has been the only woman at the table and has described incidents of bias, such as the time a male supervisor complained in an otherwise flattering performance review about her aggressiveness: “I only wish she would stop using her high heels as a weapon.”
While Yaccarino is active on Twitter, her habits are sedate compared with Musk’s, although in recent weeks, she has liked dozens of posts by and about him.
Still, the differences between Musk and Yaccarino were clear last month at the media conference in Miami. A polished Yaccarino came with prepared comments. An unshaven Musk spent a few moments wrangling his toddler son, X Æ A-12, before joining her and offering sometimes halting answers to her questions.
Yaccarino returned repeatedly to worries that her industry colleagues have voiced since Musk took control of Twitter, emphasizing several times that the audience of ad executives was crucial to the company’s financial success.
Musk said that “there’s legitimate concerns that advertisers have that I want to hear.” He recounted a complaint he had heard from David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, who was frustrated that he was unable to place ads for “White Lotus,” the hit HBO show, next to discussions of “White Lotus” on Twitter.
The issue has since been fixed, Musk said.
Yaccarino answered, “So it’s a new beginning.”

A Crucial Question in Thailand’s Election: Can You Criticize the King?

BANGKOK — When Thais go to the polls Sunday, they will be voting in a closely fought election that is seen, in part, as a referendum on whether it is illegal to criticize the Thai monarchy.
Thailand has one of the world’s strictest laws against defaming or insulting the king and other members of the royal family. Once considered taboo, the topic of the monarchy was brought to the forefront after tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and called for checks on the institution’s power in 2020.
The protests represented two sides of an impassioned struggle to determine the role of the crown in modern Thailand. The election could determine whether the Southeast Asian nation of 72 million will revive its once-vibrant democracy or slide further toward authoritarian rule, with royalists firmly in power.
On one side of the debate are conservative political parties whose standard-bearer is Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who has governed Thailand for nine years after seizing power in a coup. He and his supporters argue that amending the law could lead to abolishing the monarchy altogether, and have vowed to defend the royal family.
On the other side is the progressive Move Forward Party, which is polling in second place and argues that the law needs to be amended because it is being used as a political weapon. Several young people who participated in the 2020 protests are now running as candidates with the Move Forward Party.
“Perhaps one of the deepest fault lines in Thai society is about the monarchy,” said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand for Human Rights Watch.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the youngest daughter of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and the front-runner for prime minister, is treading carefully. Her father, a populist billionaire, is one of the most divisive political figures in Thailand. He lives in self-exile after being ousted in a coup in 2006 and can only return to Thailand with the king’s permission.
Royalists have consistently accused Thaksin of wanting to overthrow the monarchy, a charge that he denies. Paetongtarn has said that her party, Pheu Thai, would not abolish the law protecting the monarchy from criticism, but that the issue of reform must be openly discussed in parliament.
Opinion polls show that the party of Prayuth, United Thai Nation, is trailing in third place behind Pheu Thai, which has topped the polls. In recent weeks, there has also been a surge in support for the Move Forward Party, which is polling a close No. 2.
Move Forward is the largest party pushing to amend the law, irking conservatives who have accused it of undermining the monarchy. The party wants to cut the jail terms of violators of the law and designate the Bureau of the Royal Household as the only agency allowed to file lawsuits. (Any Thai citizen is able to file complaints under the current version of the law.)
Conservative politicians have threatened to disband Move Forward. The party’s previous iteration, the Future Forward Party, was dissolved in 2020 by the Constitutional Court. In a sign of how sensitive the topic of reform has become, Move Forward has attempted to moderate its position, saying reform would not take precedence in its campaign.
For decades, the monarchy and the military have had a symbiotic relationship, with the army frequently reminding the public that it is the true guardian of the Thai crown. Thais are taught from a young age that they have to love the king and that any criticism of the monarchy is strictly forbidden.
But today, many Thais no longer stand at attention when the royal anthem is played in public spaces such as movie theaters. Royalist Marketplace, a Facebook group set up to satirize the monarchy, had more than 1 million members before Facebook blocked access to it in 2020, citing a Thai government request.
The law criminalizing criticism of the monarchy carries a minimum sentence of three years if violated — the only law in Thailand that imposes a minimum jail term — and a maximum sentence of up to 15 years. After the 2020 protests, authorities charged at least 223 people, including 17 minors, for violating the law, known as Article 112.
Tantawan “Tawan” Tuatulanon, a 21-year-old law student, was accused of violating the rule in 2022 after she and her friends conducted a poll asking whether the royal motorcade was an inconvenience to Bangkok residents.
In recent weeks, she has been pressing political parties on whether they would amend the law — which she is in favor of abolishing — after the election. On Wednesday, Tantawan was arrested after she called for the release of a 15-year-old charged with violating the rule.
“I feel we don’t need any law that specially protects anybody or any family,” said Tantawan, who mounted a hunger strike earlier this year in protest against the government. “He is a person like us, not a god or a demigod.”
King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who ascended the throne in 2016, is not as beloved as his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years. While Bhumibol was revered in Thailand, his son used to spend most of his time in Germany, although he has been seen more often in public since the 2020 protests.
In the wake of the protests, Prayuth instructed all government officials to “use every single law” to prosecute anyone who criticized the monarchy. Royalists stepped up their campaign against people they accused of insulting the crown, filing more complaints and attacking anti-monarchy activists.
In 2021, Warong Dechgitvigrom, a former doctor, founded Thailand’s first far-right party, Thai Pakdee, in response to what he called the “Three Fingers Mob,” referring to the three-finger salute adopted by young Thais as a symbol of resistance during the 2020 protests.

Warong says people need to understand that the Thai monarchy is unique. He recalled France’s former monarchy as one characterized by the oppression of its people. “But ours is like father and children,” he said. “We have good feelings together, there are no bad feelings.”
Those views are at odds with how many young people feel about the king. During the 2020 demonstrations, protesters questioned the wealth of the royal family, which is one of the richest in the world.

At Turner and NBCUniversal, Yaccarino — who has been said to negotiate like a “velvet hammer” — made a name for herself by helping traditional television hold its ground in advertising in the era of Facebook and Google. Each year, she strode onstage at Radio City Music Hall for the upfront presentations, the glitzy showcases used by television networks to woo Madison Avenue, to persuade marketers to pay a hefty premium over social media rates to advertise on shows like “This Is Us” and “Saturday Night Live.”
But while Yaccarino has spent years defending TV ad dollars from tech companies and been a fierce critic of Facebook and YouTube, she has also struck partnerships with apps like Snapchat and TikTok and digital outlets like BuzzFeed.
Outside work, Yaccarino became heavily involved in initiatives including the World Economic Forum’s Taskforce on Future of Work, which she heads. She was also a chair on the board of the Ad Council, a nonprofit group, and helped the group raise $60 million in three months early in the pandemic to help counter vaccine hesitancy, making private calls, sending notes and “working every lever that she had,” said Lisa Sherman, the council’s CEO.
It’s unclear when Yaccarino met Musk, but they publicly interacted onstage at the media conference last month at the ritzy Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel in Florida. Yaccarino had previously expressed admiration for Twitter, calling the platform “the single, No. 1 biggest” content distribution partner for NBCUniversal at an ad industry event soon after Musk took over the company. At the time, she added that she did not plan to “bet against him” and that she believed he could “learn advertising.”
“I think we can teach him,” she said.
This week, Yaccarino was in attendance when Musk spoke at an advertising conference in California’s Napa Valley hosted by WPP, three people familiar with the event said.
Yaccarino would be a rare female CEO in technology, as top executives like Meta’s Sheryl Sandberg and YouTube’s Susan Wojcicki have recently left their roles. Throughout her career, Yaccarino has often said that she has been the only woman at the table and has described incidents of bias, such as the time a male supervisor complained in an otherwise flattering performance review about her aggressiveness: “I only wish she would stop using her high heels as a weapon.”
While Yaccarino is active on Twitter, her habits are sedate compared with Musk’s, although in recent weeks, she has liked dozens of posts by and about him.
Still, the differences between Musk and Yaccarino were clear last month at the media conference in Miami. A polished Yaccarino came with prepared comments. An unshaven Musk spent a few moments wrangling his toddler son, X Æ A-12, before joining her and offering sometimes halting answers to her questions.
Yaccarino returned repeatedly to worries that her industry colleagues have voiced since Musk took control of Twitter, emphasizing several times that the audience of ad executives was crucial to the company’s financial success.
Musk said that “there’s legitimate concerns that advertisers have that I want to hear.” He recounted a complaint he had heard from David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, who was frustrated that he was unable to place ads for “White Lotus,” the hit HBO show, next to discussions of “White Lotus” on Twitter.
The issue has since been fixed, Musk said.
Yaccarino answered, “So it’s a new beginning.”

Full text: The United States is trying to curtail border crossings as a Covid-era immigration policy lifts this week, but it has little control over the crises in Latin America that have upended the lives of millions.
CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico -- Millions of people are leaving their homes across Latin America in numbers not seen in decades, many of them pressing toward the United States.
While migration to the U.S. southern border has always fluctuated, the pandemic and the recession that followed hit Latin America harder than almost anywhere else in the world, plunging millions into hunger, destitution and despair.
A generation of progress against extreme poverty was wiped out. Unemployment hit a two-decade high. Russia's invasion of Ukraine choked off a key pipeline for grain and fertilizer, triggering a spike in food prices.
Economic shocks were worsened by violence, as conflict between armed groups festered in once relatively peaceful countries and raged in places long accustomed to the terror.
Amid these events, smugglers and migrants alike have pushed powerful social media campaigns, many rife with misinformation, that have encouraged people to migrate to the United States.
This accumulation of grim factors means that when a pandemic-era border restriction known as Title 42 lifts this week, the United States will be confronted with an immigration challenge even more daunting than the one it faced when the measure was first imposed.
"You couldn't come up with a worse set of facts to leave tens of millions of people with no choice but to move," said Dan Restrepo, who served as President Barack Obama's top adviser on Latin America. "It's inevitable that you'd have massive displacement, it really is a perfect storm."
For the last three years, the American government has tried to curtail the record flows of people arriving at the U.S. border by using the public-health measure to quickly expel those who crossed illegally.
However, when Title 42 expires, migrants who enter the country illegally will have the opportunity to apply for asylum, something many were barred from doing during the three years the public-health restriction was in place.
Qualifying won't be easy -- the Biden administration is rolling out new eligibility restrictions -- and if the process works as intended, many will still be deported relatively quickly.
But the large flows building in northern Mexico could overwhelm the system, which means more people, especially families and children, may be released into the United States with a notice to appear before an immigration judge.
In some cases, social media is being used to falsely advertise the coming border rule changes as the opening of the floodgates. On TikTok, posts tagged #titulo42 have been viewed more than 96 million times, with one popular post claiming, "May 11: You cannot be deported. Title 42 has come to an end."
The number of encounters at the border has already risen in recent days, a jump American officials hope will last only a few weeks and then eventually die down.
Many migrants are coming from places like Venezuela, which was suffering one of the worst economic crises in the world before the pandemic. Much of the country sank further into misery when the coronavirus shut the world down. A mass exit deepened, bringing the total number of Venezuelans who have fled since 2015 to 7.2 million -- roughly a quarter of the population.
In Colombia, where worker protections are weak, joblessness reached its highest rate on record. Brazil recorded the second-highest number of Covid deaths worldwide. Immigrants who had already traveled from across Latin America to these two countries were among the first to lose their hold on any hope of a livelihood.
Nicaraguans historically migrated north in relatively small numbers. But inflation, sinking wages and an increasingly authoritarian government have prompted hundreds of thousands to leave in recent years.
Gang violence and homicides exploded in relatively tranquil Ecuador. Haiti got hit by a cholera outbreak, an extreme hunger crisis and warfare between armed criminal groups -- all at the same time.
The Darién Gap, a treacherous 70-mile stretch of jungle that connects Central and South America, suddenly became a thoroughfare for people without the visas or money to make the journey any other way.
The United Nations expects as many as 400,000 people to pass through this year, nearly 40 times the yearly average from 2010 through 2020.
Sitting inside a pale pink tent on a Colombian beach not far from the jungle last year, Willian Gutiérrez, 31, a welder and bricklayer, said the situation at home in Venezuela had gone from bad to worse. He hadn't had stable work in years, meals were meager, "and sometimes I stopped eating so they would be able to," he said, motioning to his children, Ricardo, 5, and Yolayner, 2.
The family lived in a half-built house without electricity in the oil-rich city of Maracaibo, Mr. Gutiérrez's wife, Johana García, 38, explained. After watching so many friends leave for the United States, she said, they had decided to risk the trek.
They went because the American economy bounced back quickly from the coronavirus and then got hungry for workers.
But they also were told -- by human smugglers, relatives and people posting on Facebook, TikTok and WhatsApp -- that under President Biden, they could actually cross the border and stay.
Ms. García, who had just enough money to purchase a tent, a headlamp and two bags of bread for the jungle trip, had heard this from Venezuelans who had made it to the United States before her.
"It's difficult, yes," they told her, "but it's possible."
American border authorities have in fact been regularly using Title 42 to immediately turn back people who enter the country illegally, invoking it more than 2.7 million times since March 2020.
But Mexico only agreed to take in expelled migrants from a handful of countries in the region, forcing the Biden administration to fly others back to their homelands -- a slower process constrained by cost, logistics and the fact that some governments have not always accepted expulsion flights from the United States.
"What on paper was in some ways the harshest border policy ever put into effect, like a complete and total ban on entry, never worked like that in practice," said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based immigrant advocacy organization.
Since taking office, according to federal data, the Biden administration has allowed some 1.8 million migrants to stay in the country while awaiting asylum hearings, many of whom turned themselves in after crossing the border. Unknown numbers also entered the country undetected.
"People who want to get to the United States know that it has been an advantageous time to try to get into the country," said Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. "They calculate their chances of getting in before they go."
Ana Gabriela Gómez, 28, a pharmacy assistant who made less than $ 100 a month at home in Caracas, left Venezuela with her two young sons in September. After nine terrible days in the Darién jungle, she heard that Mr. Biden was tightening border restrictions against Venezuelans.
But so many neighbors and friends had gotten through. She didn't quite believe the president.
"I'm going to go to see it with my own eyes," she decided. After she got to the U.S. border with her boys, ages 5 and 6, she crossed the Rio Grande at Ciudad Juárez and turned herself in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who let her through.
She's now staying in a shelter in Manhattan, and plans to apply for asylum. In her view, the journey was painful, but worth it.
"My goal was to get here," she said, "but now I have another goal: to work, to get my papers, a good school for the boys."
In Facebook and WhatsApp groups directed at would-be migrants, a cascade of users have been encouraging migrants to make the trip to the border after the public health measure expires.
"For those who want to know if the border is open," one person said last week in a Facebook group called Darién Jungle Migrant Survivors, "yes it is."

LinkedIn Opts To Pare Down China Presence Amid Adversity: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft, LinkedIn's owner, had already pulled the flagship networking site from China in 2021, leaving only a stripped-down app that catered to job seekers.
LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
The company, owned by Microsoft, said it will lay off 716 employees worldwide, including teams dedicated to engineering and marketing in China, because of slumping demand. It did not say how many of those layoffs will be in China.
LinkedIn will also shut its China job posting app, a bare-bones version of its international service, by August. Users of the app, called InCareer, could only search for jobs and not post or share articles the way they can on LinkedIn.
When LinkedIn started a Chinese-language version of its website in 2014, it charted a path that its peers, including Facebook and Google, had shied away from. It partnered with local firms and began censoring the content of millions of Chinese customers in accordance with Beijing's strict laws. Several U.S. journalists and activists said their profiles had been blocked because of "prohibited content." The company said at the time that while it opposed government censorship, its absence in the country could deprive Chinese professionals of the chance to make professional connections.
Yet over the years, the challenges for foreign and domestic social media platforms multiplied as the power of China's censorship machine ballooned under its leader, Xi Jinping. In 2021, LinkedIn closed its flagship networking service in China, citing compliance issues and a "significantly more challenging operating environment."
In a letter to employees, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn's chief executive, said the cuts were prompted by slower revenue growth and fluctuations in customer behavior. The news follows an overall slowdown in tech that has led to tens of thousands of layoffs this year by the largest companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google.
LinkedIn, which employs about 20,000 people, said Monday that while it was reducing operations in China and other countries, it plans to create 250 jobs in other areas.
Mr. Roslansky said it will retain a presence in China to help companies operating in the country hire and train employees from overseas.

If Some Dangers Posed by A.I. Are Already Here, Then What Lies Ahead?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A recent letter calling for a moratorium on A.I. development blends real threats with speculation. But concern is growing among experts.
In late March, more than 1,000 technology leaders, researchers and other pundits working in and around artificial intelligence signed an open letter warning that A.I. technologies present "profound risks to society and humanity."
The group, which included Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive and the owner of Twitter, urged A.I. labs to halt development of their most powerful systems for six months so that they could better understand the dangers behind the technology.
"Powerful A.I. systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable," the letter said.
The letter, which now has over 27,000 signatures, was brief. Its language was broad. And some of the names behind the letter seemed to have a conflicting relationship with A.I. Mr. Musk, for example, is building his own A.I. start-up, and he is one of the primary donors to the organization that wrote the letter.
But the letter represented a growing concern among A.I. experts that the latest systems, most notably GPT-4, the technology introduced by the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, could cause harm to society. They believed future systems will be even more dangerous.
Some of the risks have arrived. Others will not for months or years. Still others are purely hypothetical.
"Our ability to understand what could go wrong with very powerful A.I. systems is very weak," said Yoshua Bengio, a professor and A.I. researcher at the University of Montreal. "So we need to be very careful."
Why Are They Worried?
Dr. Bengio is perhaps the most important person to have signed the letter.
Working with two other academics -- Geoffrey Hinton, until recently a researcher at Google, and Yann LeCun, now chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the owner of Facebook -- Dr. Bengio spent the past four decades developing the technology that drives systems like GPT-4. In 2018, the researchers received the Turing Award, often called "the Nobel Prize of computing," for their work on neural networks.
A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text called large language models, or L.L.M.s.
By pinpointing patterns in that text, L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own, including blog posts, poems and computer programs. They can even carry on a conversation.
This technology can help computer programmers, writers and other workers generate ideas and do things more quickly. But Dr. Bengio and other experts also warned that L.L.M.s can learn unwanted and unexpected behaviors.
These systems can generate untruthful, biased and otherwise toxic information. Systems like GPT-4 get facts wrong and make up information, a phenomenon called "hallucination."
Companies are working on these problems. But experts like Dr. Bengio worry that as researchers make these systems more powerful, they will introduce new risks.
Short-Term Risk: Disinformation
Because these systems deliver information with what seems like complete confidence, it can be a struggle to separate truth from fiction when using them. Experts are concerned that people will rely on these systems for medical advice, emotional support and the raw information they use to make decisions.
"There is no guarantee that these systems will be correct on any task you give them," said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science at Arizona State University.
Experts are also worried that people will misuse these systems to spread disinformation. Because they can converse in humanlike ways, they can be surprisingly persuasive.
"We now have systems that can interact with us through natural language, and we can't distinguish the real from the fake," Dr. Bengio said.
Medium-Term Risk: Job Loss
Experts are worried that the new A.I. could be job killers. Right now, technologies like GPT-4 tend to complement human workers. But OpenAI acknowledges that they could replace some workers, including people who moderate content on the internet.
They cannot yet duplicate the work of lawyers, accountants or doctors. But they could replace paralegals, personal assistants and translators.
A paper written by OpenAI researchers estimated that 80 percent of the U.S. work force could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected by L.L.M.s and that 19 percent of workers might see at least 50 percent of their tasks impacted.
"There is an indication that rote jobs will go away," said Oren Etzioni, the founding chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a research lab in Seattle.
Long-Term Risk: Loss of Control
Some people who signed the letter also believe artificial intelligence could slip outside our control or destroy humanity. But many experts say that's wildly overblown.
The letter was written by a group from the Future of Life Institute, an organization dedicated to exploring existential risks to humanity. They warn that because A.I. systems often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze, they could pose serious, unexpected problems.
They worry that as companies plug L.L.M.s into other internet services, these systems could gain unanticipated powers because they could write their own computer code. They say developers will create new risks if they allow powerful A.I. systems to run their own code.
"If you look at a straightforward extrapolation of where we are now to three years from now, things are pretty weird," said Anthony Aguirre, a theoretical cosmologist and physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and co-founder of the Future of Life Institute.
"If you take a less probable scenario -- where things really take off, where there is no real governance, where these systems turn out to be more powerful than we thought they would be -- then things get really, really crazy," he said.
Dr. Etzioni said talk of existential risk was hypothetical. But he said other risks -- most notably disinformation -- were no longer speculation.
"Now we have some real problems," he said. "They are bona fide. They require some responsible reaction. They may require regulation and legislation."

Ire Over Twitter Letting Images Spread Online: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Graphic images of the attack went viral on the platform, which has made cuts to its moderation team. Some users said the images exposed the realities of gun violence.
Pat Holloway has seen her share of destruction during a 30-year career as a photojournalist: the 1993 standoff in Waco, Texas; the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh; and the 2011 tornado that struck Joplin, Mo.
But this weekend, she said in an interview, she had had enough. When graphic images began circulating on Twitter showing bloody victims of a mass shooting at a mall in Texas that left at least nine people, including the gunman, dead, she tweeted at Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, demanding that he do something.
"This family does not deserve to see the dead relatives spread across Twitter for everybody to see," Ms. Holloway, 64, said in the interview on Sunday.
Ms. Holloway was one of many Twitter users who criticized the social network for allowing the grisly images -- including of a blood-spattered child -- to spread virally across the platform after the shooting on Saturday. Though gruesome images have become common on social media, where a cellphone camera and an internet connection make everyone a publisher, the unusually graphic nature of the images drew sustained outcry from users. And they threw a harsh spotlight on Twitter's content moderation practices, which have been curtailed since Mr. Musk acquired the company last year.
Like other social media companies, Twitter has once again found itself in a position akin to that of traditional newspaper editors, who wrestle with difficult decisions about how much to show their audiences. Though newspapers and magazines generally spare their readers from truly graphic images, they have made some exceptions, as Jet magazine did in 1955 when it published open-casket images of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who was beaten to death in Mississippi, to illustrate the horrors of the Jim Crow-era South.
Unlike newspaper and magazine publishers, however, tech companies like Twitter must enforce their decisions on a huge scale, policing millions of users with a combination of automated systems and human content moderators.
Other tech companies like Facebook's parent, Meta, and YouTube's parent, Alphabet, have invested in large teams that reduce the spread of violent images on their platforms. Twitter, on the other hand, has scaled back its content moderation since Mr. Musk bought the site late last October, laying off full-time employees and contractors on the trust and safety teams that manage content moderation. Mr. Musk, who has described himself as a "free speech absolutist," said last November that he would establish a "content moderation council" that would decide which posts should stay up and which should be taken down. He later reneged on that promise.
Twitter and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for YouTube said the site had begun removing video of the massacre, adding that it was promoting authoritative information sources.
Graphic content was never completely banned by Twitter, even before Mr. Musk took over. The platform, for instance, has allowed images of people killed or wounded in the war in Ukraine, arguing that they are newsworthy and informative. The company sometimes places warning labels or pop-ups on sensitive content, requiring that users opt in to see the imagery.
While many users clearly spread the images of the massacre, including of the dead attacker, for shock value, others retweeted them to underscore the horrors of gun violence. "The N.R.A.'s America," one tweet read. "This isn't going away," said another. The New York Times is not linking to the social media posts containing the graphic images.
Claire Wardle, the co-founder of the Information Futures Lab at Brown University, said in an interview that tech companies must balance their desire to protect their users with the responsibility to preserve newsworthy or otherwise important images -- even those that are uncomfortable to look at. She cited as precedent the decision to publish a Vietnam War image of Kim Phuc Phan Thi, who became known as "Napalm Girl" after a photo of her suffering following a napalm strike circulated around the world.
She added that she favored graphic images of noteworthy events remaining online, with some kind of overlay that requires users to choose to see the content.
"This is news," she said. "Often, we see this kind of imagery in other countries and nobody bats an eyelid. But then it happens to Americans and people say, 'Should we be seeing this?"'
For years, social media companies have had to grapple with the proliferation of bloody images and videos following terrible violence. Last year, Facebook was criticized for circulating ads next to a graphic video of a racist shooting rampage in Buffalo, N.Y., that was live-streamed on the video platform Twitch. The Buffalo gunman claimed to have drawn inspiration from a 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, that left at least 50 people dead and was broadcast live on Facebook. For years, Twitter has taken down versions of the Christchurch video, arguing that the footage glorifies the violent messages the gunman espoused.
Though the graphic images of the Texas mall shooting circulated widely on Twitter, they seemed to be less prominent on other online platforms on Sunday. Keyword searches for the Allen, Texas, shooting on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube yielded mostly news reports and less explicit eyewitness videos.
Sarah T. Roberts, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who studies content moderation, drew a distinction between editors at traditional media companies and social media platforms, which are not bound by the ethics that traditional journalists adhere to -- including minimizing harm to the viewer and the friends and family of the people who were killed.
"I understand where people on social media are coming from who want to circulate these images in the hopes that it will make a change," Ms. Roberts said. "But unfortunately, social media as a business is not set up to support that. What it's set up to do is to profit from the circulation of these images."

I Saw What Dad Did: [Style Desk]

Full text: After witnessing her father at a motel with a woman who was not her mother, a young reader describes experiencing near-daily guilt about not having spoken up.
Three years ago, when I was 15, I saw my dad going into a motel with a woman I didn't know. I happened to be getting frozen yogurt with friends next door. I was totally freaked out, but I said nothing. I just pretended it never happened. A few months later, my mom asked me directly if I thought my dad was having an affair. I said I didn't -- which was obviously a lie. My parents separated, then divorced, about a year later. Pretty much every day since then, I have felt guilty about my behavior. Do you think if I'd confronted my dad or told my mom the truth, at the time, my parents might still be married today?
DAUGHTER
Let me be crystal clear: The only person who did nothing wrong here is you. Your father was reckless to subject you to what seemed to be his adultery, even by accident. And while I sympathize with your mother, she was wrong to involve a child in her marital difficulties. It was natural for you to shut down about what you had seen and, later, to try to protect your father and keep your family intact.
Sadly, your (unwarranted) guilt makes perfect sense to me, too. Young people often feel responsible for creating crises to which they are witnesses at most. I can't say with certainty that your parents would be divorced today no matter how you had responded to what you saw, but I suspect they would be.
That leaves my overriding concern: Unless you address your feelings of guilt about this episode, they may bleed into other areas of your life and diminish them. (I worry that may be happening already.) I am sorry you have to grapple with your parents' poor judgment, but you do. Talk to a counselor to help put this episode into perspective and acknowledge your blamelessness.
Better an Empty Seat Than an Upset Sister
My sister's partner of six years, 46, doesn't like spending time with our family. He frequently fails to show up for family dinners even after accepting invitations. He did this at Easter lunch. More often, he says he "might" come, leaving us guessing until the last minute, which is stressful and annoying. His behavior upsets my sister, but she puts up with it. Should we stop inviting him?
SISTER
Without question, your sister's partner is behaving impolitely -- both as a no-show and by failing to respond definitively to invitations. For me, though, these are small potatoes in the larger scheme: It is more important for your sister to feel supported by her family than for you to satisfy your (reasonable) pique.
So, let her drive this bus. Your sister is the best judge, for instance, of whether her partner is extremely introverted or being a jerk. And while your annoyance is legitimate, excluding him -- without consulting your sister -- may strike her as harsh or judgmental of her relationship. Instead, ask her gently what she would prefer: that you keep inviting her partner to family gatherings or that you stop. Then follow her lead. There are worse things than removing a place setting at the last minute -- and hurting your sister is one of them.
What Are You Waiting for, an Invitation?
I received a save-the-date announcement for a wedding I've decided not to attend for scheduling reasons. I am not particularly close with the bridal couple; in fact, I was surprised to be invited. Is it better to let them know right away that I can't attend, or should I wait until I receive the formal invitation?
FRIEND
Given the difficulty (and occasional heartbreak) of creating guest lists for many bridal couples, the kindest thing would be to let them know as soon as possible that you are unable to attend. This way, they can adjust their plans and possibly invite someone in your place. Send a warm note with your regrets.
Now, in my experience, when letter writers express surprise at receiving wedding invitations, they usually couple it with a question about their obligation to send a gift. You didn't, but just in case: You are not required to give a gift, though depending on your relationship with the bridal couple, you may want to.
Champagne Problems
I am a Swiftie. I have an extra (nearly impossible to get) ticket to one of Taylor's upcoming concerts. I could invite my fiancé's sister, who has been extremely nice to me. Or I could invite a former best friend whom I haven't been close to in recent years. (It could be a rapprochement.) Or I could sell the ticket for a big profit. What would you do?
T.
I am going to assume that you are as devoted to Taylor Swift as I am to Joni Mitchell. (Now, Joni's superfans may not have a cute nickname -- like yours -- but we wear the mantle proudly just the same.) Based on my experience, your best companion at the concert will share your love of the woman and her music.
You will have plenty of opportunities to repay the kindness of your future sister-in-law and to mend fences with your former BFF. And ticket scalping is illegal in many places. So, invite the person who is most likely to share your unbridled joy in an evening devoted to Tay Tay.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

A Perfectly Fine Plan A, Except for All Those Bees: [Society Desk]

Full text: Peter Walters planned to propose to Ray Quintero at a picnic on Fire Island, but en route Mr. Quintero spotted a swarm of bees ahead, and bolted.
Peter Derek Walters never thought a swarm of bees would get in the way of his proposal to Ray Aaron Quintero on Fire Island in New York.
"I hid two Cartier rings under leaves and branches," said Mr. Walters, 48, who had secretly and painstakingly set up a picnic overlooking the Great South Bay for the special moment in June 2020. He had also dropped off Champagne and wrote "Marry Me" in the sand.
But, a few hours later while en route with Mr. Quintero, 43, who has been deathly afraid of bees since he was a child, it was all ruined. As soon as Mr. Quintero spotted the swarm he bolted.
Mr. Walters, not a happy camper, walked another 30 minutes by himself to gather everything up, and later resorted to Plan B.
The two met one Sunday afternoon in September 2018 when friends gathered at Boxers, a gay bar in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. Their connection was a mutual friend, whom, coincidentally, each casually dated.
"Hey, g'day, I'm Peter, you must be Ray," said Mr. Walters, who recognized him from a Facebook photo taken with that friend in Mykonos, Greece.
Mr. Walters, an identical twin, from Elong Elong, a small village in New South Wales, Australia, grew up in a house abutting his family's cattle and grain ranch where feral pigs, emus, kangaroos and goannas wandered in from the bush. (He considered bees the most important insect in the ecosystem.) His family also ran a ranch supplies business in the village.
Mr. Walters, the chief executive of the Americas at Inquisitive, an Australian-based education publishing company, graduated from the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, from which he received an M.B.A.
"Is that tall strapping Australian talking to me?," Mr. Quintero, originally from Tucson, Ariz., recalled thinking. He graduated from the University of Arizona, and is now a managing partner of Healthsperien, a Washington-based health care policy and business strategy consultancy.
Later on, during their first meeting, the group barhopped to Rise Bar nearby. The two chatted on the sidelines and swapped phone numbers.
"It was the spark of a friendship," Mr. Walters said, and soon they began hanging out two or three days a week, and even more as the Christmas season revved up.
When Mr. Quintero, who had been working remotely from New York for a year, moved back to Washington over the holidays, their friendship continued.
Like a good friend, three weeks later, Mr. Quintero showed up for Mr. Walters at his birthday/Australia Day open house in January where about 80 guests snacked on Vegemite, Tim Tams and assorted Aussie lollies at Mr. Walter's Chelsea apartment decked out with Australian flags.
"I normally have a small group of friends for dinner before the rest of the party arrives," Mr. Walters said. "I invited Ray to this."
Later, on their way to a bar with guests, the two lagged behind, and twirled around into a kiss.

"We were giddy, and holding hands," Mr. Walters said, and the next evening they had tapas on their first official date at Salinas in West Chelsea, which became their favorite restaurant.
They soon took turns seeing each other every weekend via Amtrak Acela, and in March took a trip to St. Barths, which they both described as the "magical acknowledgment of each other."
By May, to slow things down, they took what they called an "intermission." Six weeks later when Mr. Quintero flew into New York in June after celebrating world gay pride in Tel Aviv, they reunited at a fund-raiser for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
"Maybe we're ready for Act Two," Mr. Quintero said "We're going to make this act the one that lasts."
That summer they went to Fire Island several times and in September they vacationed in Spain.
In March 2020, when the pandemic hit, they quarantined with friends on Fire Island for a month, and then rented their own place along the water for another three months.
"We had never cooked and leaned into our recipes," said Mr. Walters, "and made lasagna and enchiladas."
"Our friends named us the chefettes," he added, and soon they proudly donned black aprons with "chefettes" printed in teal.
On a whim, in June, Mr. Walters got down on one knee for a pre-proposal before the two identical platinum bands he had ordered online arrived. Two days later, with rings in hand, his real proposal was thwarted by the bees. But that evening came success. Mr. Walters got down on one knee on their balcony as the moon rose over the ocean. After Mr. Walters proposed, Mr. Quintero got the other ring from where Mr. Walters had hidden it. Then he got down on one knee and proposed.
"I have since embraced bees," said Mr. Quintero, who from that day overcame his phobia, and in November 2022 they celebrated their engagement on St. Barths, where they also planned to celebrate their union.
On April 21, Madeline Plasencia, on the city clerk's staff, officiated at their civil ceremony at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, with their mutual friend, who introduced them, as their witness.
Then, on May 6, they planned to exchange vows at the Le Sereno hotel on St. Barths, before 64 guests. "It's not only empowering to overcome the fear of bees," Mr. Quintero said, "but also to choose to get married in the place we fell in love and bring together friends and family closest to us."

Magnetic Changes Allow the Northern Lights to Dip South: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Rubin, April

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over the past few months, viewings of the lights have increased in areas farther south than usual. That's going to continue into 2025.
Central Pennsylvania. Southern England. Arizona.
The northern lights are most often seen in the earth's northernmost regions, but in recent months, they've been visible to residents farther south. It's not a fluke, scientists say, but part of a trend that will allow a wider swath of the world to get a rare glimpse of the phenomenon for the next few years.
The lights will be visible farther south because of a shift in the sun's magnetic fields, which flip on an 11-year cycle. This phenomenon will peak in 2025, during the phase known as solar maximum.
The expanded visibility of the lights, created by activity in the sun's magnetic field, has already begun, said Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.
What exactly are the lights?
The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are created when solar wind or charged particles from the sun interact with the earth's magnetic field, exciting atoms in the atmosphere.
Electrons jump to a higher energy level and release light -- seen as the auroras -- as they settle back down, she said.
Oxygen in the atmosphere creates green or red light during an aurora, while nitrogen causes blues.
Usually, the auroras are most easily viewable in places like Scandinavian countries and Northern Canada. Every winter, tourists from around the world flock to Arctic locations, venturing into the snowy night to spot the phenomenon.
The auroras have expanded farther south.
But over the past few months in the northern hemisphere, viewings of the lights have increased in areas farther south.
One cold Sunday night in February, the skies of southern England and Ireland were alight with the auroras. In March, powerful geomagnetic storms helped to make them visible as far south in the United States as North Carolina and New York. In April, they were spotted in Arizona, central California, southern Ontario and England.
In the southern hemisphere, aurora australis, or the southern lights, are typically visible from Antarctica, Australia and south of Argentina. Their visibility has also expanded.
Besides creating a beautiful show, scientists are interested in the auroras because extreme geomagnetic storms, which can create the lights, can also damage power grids, said Taylor Cameron, a research scientist with the Canadian Hazards Information Service. The last large outage of this sort was in 1989, leaving six million people in Quebec without power.
Why are the northern lights more prevalent now?
As the sun's magnetic fields flip over 11 years, this cycle, phases between solar minimum and solar maximum, Dr. Cameron said. Experts predict that solar maximum will be reached in 2025, meaning the auroral oval, or the area on earth where the lights are visible, will widen until then.
"When we're in the minimum part of the solar cycle, the sun is very quiet, basically nothing going on," Dr. Cameron said. "And then at maximum, we've got lots of solar flares, lots of coronal mass ejections. The sun is just much more active."
The current cycle started in 2019, he said.
The solar cycle is tied to the sun's magnetic field, Dr. Cameron said, but doesn't affect its temperature. In contrast to the sun's 11-year cycle, the earth's magnetic field reverses every tens of thousands of years.
Earth's northern and southern hemispheres may reach solar maximum at different times, given that they can be out of sync, said C. Alex Young, an associate director for science at NASA's heliophysics science division.
Space weather modeling, which incorporates both real data and computer models recreating space physics, allows scientists to better understand the auroras, Dr. Young said.
When and where can I expect to see them?
The best seasons to see the aurora are spring and fall, especially close to the equinoxes.
"That's the same time in which sort of the Equator is totally flat with the rotational plane of the sun," said William Archer, a mission scientist at the Canadian Space Agency.
Solar terrestrial events are measured by a Kp-index, which is a scale from zero to nine, Dr. Archer said. The higher the number, the more active the aurora.
A northern lights episode last month reached a Kp of eight. For central United States viewing, the Kp has to reach about seven or higher, he said. Darker areas away from city lights have the best visibility.
Trips to see the aurora often involve hunting for the perfect view, said Amy Hope, a managing director for the Aurora Zone, a northern lights tourism company based in Britain.
In the past, solar maximum has helped to grab travelers' attention, she said. Since the aural window has expanded, Ms. Hope has received messages from friends in Scandinavia who have seen the lights from kitchen windows. Even during solar maximum, tour groups will hunt for the best view.
"What's so addictive about it -- for want of a better word -- is that it's different every single time," Ms. Hope said.
I'm excited. Help me track them down!
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates a short-term forecast with the location and intensity of auroras.
Experts also recommend using SpaceWeather.com and SpaceWeatherLive.com as resources to hunt for the light shows; AuroraMAX shows a livestream of the lights during winter months.
The Geophysical Institute run out of the University of Alaska Fairbanks provides forecasts for locations in North America, Europe, and the southern hemisphere.
Facebook communities have also formed for people in common aurora-spotting areas to discuss forecasts and to suggest viewing points. Many destinations have similar websites, including Fairbanks, Alaska, Canada and Iceland.
"For many people, the aurora is a beautiful nighttime phenomenon that is worth traveling to Arctic regions just to observe," NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center said on its website. "It is the only way for most people to actually experience space weather."

Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Over Location Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling was a blow to the commission's intensifying efforts to crack down on the sale and use of sensitive personal information.
A federal judge in Idaho on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit against Kochava, a major location data broker, brought last year by the Federal Trade Commission. In a ruling, the judge wrote that regulators had not provided sufficient evidence to back up their claims that the company was unfairly selling information on the precise locations of millions of people's mobile phones.
But the court gave the F.T.C. the opportunity to strengthen its arguments if it wanted to proceed with the case.
The ruling deals at least a temporary blow to recent aggressive efforts by the commission to crack down on the sale and use of potentially sensitive information, like data on consumers' drug prescriptions, religious affiliations or sexual orientation.
Kochava, based in Sandpoint, Idaho, is a mobile analytics firm that uses location data to help marketers target and measure ad campaigns. The company typically collects more than 90 location data points per day from about 35 million active mobile device users, according to the judge's ruling in the case -- location coordinates that can "reveal where each mobile device has been approximately every 15 minutes."
In its complaint against Kochava, filed last August, the F.T.C. argued that the company's sale of geolocation data on tens of millions of smartphones could be used to track people's visits to private locations such as churches, mosques, synagogues, abortion clinics, domestic violence shelters, medical centers and homeless shelters.
The location data could be used to track not just the dates and times that patients visited abortion clinics, regulators said, but also to track the locations of health care professionals who provided medical treatments like abortions.
In an investigation into location data brokers several years ago, for instance, reporters at The New York Times were able to use a mobile device location data set to track a smartphone user from their home outside of Newark to a Planned Parenthood clinic.
"The sale of such data poses an unwarranted intrusion into the most private areas of consumers' lives and causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers," the F.T.C. complaint said.
But a judge in United States District Court for the District of Idaho dismissed the agency's claim that Kochava's sale of location data was such a severe intrusion on consumers' privacy that it amounted to a substantial injury.
And, while the court agreed with the F.T.C. that Kochava's sale of location data could enable third parties to track and harm smartphone users who visited sensitive locations, the judge said that regulators had not provided adequate evidence that consumers were actually suffering -- or were likely to suffer -- substantial harm.
In a statement, Douglas Farrar, a spokesperson for the F.T.C., said: "We are pleased the Court agreed with our key argument and we look forward to continuing to press our case on behalf of American consumers."
Charles Manning, the founder and chief executive of Kochava, welcomed the judge's ruling, saying that the company complied with "all rules and laws," including privacy laws.
"We are hopeful that challenging the F.T.C. will bring necessary regulatory clarity that will ultimately benefit consumers and advertisers," he said in a statement.
The case dismissal highlights the uphill battle regulators are facing in trying to restrict or bar certain kinds of data collection and usage.
In an administrative action earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission proposed barring Meta from monetizing the personal data of users under the age of 18 on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and other company platforms. Such a blanket ban could prohibit Meta from using young people's data for purposes like targeting advertising or "enriching its own data models and algorithms," the agency said in an administrative order.
Meta said it would "vigorously fight" the F.T.C.'s action and expected to prevail.

Sued for Helping a Friend Obtain An Abortion, 2 Women Sue Back: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Texas man says text messages on his ex-wife's phone show the women helped her obtain an abortion. The women say he invaded their privacy.
In March, a Texas man, Marcus Silva, sued three women for $ 1 million each after they helped his ex-wife obtain an abortion last summer using pills. The suit alleged that the termination of the pregnancy qualified as wrongful death under state law, and he presented text messages between his ex-wife and the women as evidence.
In the post-Roe era, the suit horrified abortion-rights advocates and galvanized opponents. Both sides view it as a test case aimed at discouraging anyone from helping women access abortion in states where the procedure is now banned or severely restricted.
This week, two of the women, Jackie Noyola and Amy Carpenter, filed their response in court: They are countersuing Mr. Silva for invasion of privacy in addition to offering a number of defenses to his claims. Ms. Noyola and Ms. Carpenter, who are close friends of Brittni Silva, Mr. Silva's ex-wife, said he searched her phone without her consent and read their private messages.
Abortion-rights advocates have raised the alarm over how private information might be used in both civil and criminal cases against people who have abortions, and those who help them. In Nebraska, prosecutors used Facebook messages between a mother and daughter to bring charges against them after the daughter's abortion.
For Ms. Noyola and Ms. Carpenter, the experience of being sued has been difficult, said their lawyer, Rusty Hardin. "They're being thrust into the public arena, with their financial well-being at risk," he said. "They believed strongly that they were helping a friend at a time of dire need."
Mr. Silva's lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas, has advocated using private lawsuits to deter abortion.
He was the architect of the Texas law, passed in 2021, which led clinics in the state to stop providing abortions after six weeks, by deputizing private citizens to enforce the law by suing for cash judgments of $ 10,000 per procedure. Mr. Mitchell did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Mitchell's argument in this case uses the state's wrongful death statute to seek damages on behalf of Mr. Silva.
The suit asserts that under that state law, the rights of a fetus are equivalent to those of an adult. If Mr. Mitchell's argument succeeds, it would be a legal victory for the concept of fetal personhood -- a goal of many abortion opponents.
Mr. Silva's complaint is based on a series of photos he took of texts between Ms. Noyola, Ms. Carpenter, and Ms. Silva. (The third woman he sued, who he says supplied the abortion pills to his wife, has not yet responded in court and could not be reached for comment.)
According to the texts, Ms. Silva's friends helped her date her pregnancy, which was early in the first trimester, and figure out how to get pills to terminate it.
"Jackie your help means the world to me," Ms. Silva wrote.
Mr. Silva is not suing his ex-wife. Her friends' countersuit includes a police report Mr. Silva filed in which he admitted that he "went through his wife's phone."
"There are clear violations of Texas law in this case with respect to illegally accessing the phone," said Charles Rhodes, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. "And that's a situation which will probably occur in other cases."
Without a private message, or evidence like a Google search that another person might well access without permission, Rhodes asks, "how else would you have the evidence you need to bring your lawsuit?"
In their countersuit, Ms. Noyola and Ms. Carpenter included more texts -- provided, their lawyers said, with Ms. Silva's consent. Ms. Silva declined to comment.
Ms. Silva claimed that Mr. Silva had a history of emotionally abusive behavior. In her texts to her friends, she recounted that he burned their wedding photos and threatened the family dog. Ms. Silva told her friends once that she called the police because he was harassing her.
She filed for divorce in May 2022, but continued living with Mr. Silva.
In his suit, Mr. Silva says he only recently learned of his ex-wife's abortion. But in a police report he filed on July 18, 2022, he stated that he found the text messages on July 12, searched her purse the next day, and found an abortion pill. He put the pill back. The abortion took place on July 14. Mr. Silva waited to confront Ms. Silva about it.
"So now he's saying if I don't give him my 'mind body and soul' until the end of the divorce, which he's going to drag out, he's going to make sure I go to jail for doing it," Ms. Silva wrote to her friends on July 23.
The case has other legal complexities. It is a crime in Texas to provide an abortion to someone else but not to self-administer an abortion. And the abortion at issue in Mr. Silva's suit took place before Texas' ban on abortion was in effect. "The woman here was clearly within her rights to end her own pregnancy, which means this would be a very unusual application of the wrongful death statute," said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University.
Mr. Rhodes, on the other hand, thinks that "the intent of the Texas wrongful-death statute, when it was amended in 2003, was to allow wrongful-death claims against individuals who assisted with an abortion that wasn't done legally."
None of the women in Mr. Silva's suit will face criminal charges, Jack Roady, the district attorney in Galveston County, the relevant jurisdiction, said in March.

McDonald's Groups FinedFor Child Labor Violations
Two 10-year-olds are among 300 children who worked at McDonald's restaurants illegally, a Labor Department investigation of franchisees in Kentucky found.
Agency investigators found the 10-year-olds received little or no pay at a McDonald's in Louisville, the Labor Department said. The three franchisees were fined $ 212,000 in total.
One of them, Louisville's Bauer Food L.L.C., which operates 10 McDonald's locations, employed 24 minors under the age of 16 to work more hours than legally permitted, the agency said. Among those were two 10-year-old children. The agency said the children sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m., but were not paid.
The franchise owner-operator, Sean Bauer, said the two 10-year-olds were visiting their parent, a night manager, and weren't employees.
The Walton, Ky.-based Archways Richwood L.L.C. and Louisville-based Bell Restaurant Group I L.L.C. were also fined. ASSOCIATED PRESS

French Authority RejectsRestoring Retirement Age
France's top constitutional body rejected on Wednesday an effort by opposition lawmakers to undo a law to raise the retirement age to 64, deeming that a proposal did not meet the needed criteria. The law was pushed by President Emmanuel Macron, right.
It was the second time that the Constitutional Council has rejected the plan to restore the retirement age to 62, notably via a possible referendum or new bill. Had it passed muster, the process called for would be long and wouldn't stop Mr. Macron's unpopular law from taking effect.
Opposition lawmakers, mainly from the left, sought a complex process to reject the law, which was enacted last month.
The Constitutional Council's role was to assess whether the opposition's request meets the legal conditions for a potential referendum. Had it been accepted, supporters would have had nine months to collect signatures from at least 4.8 million, or 10 percent, of French voters. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google Plans to Add2 Data Centers in Ohio
Google plans to build two more data centers in Ohio to help power its artificial intelligence technology and other tools, the company and state officials announced Wednesday.
With one data center already up and running near Columbus, the two new locations will bring Google's total investment in Ohio to more than $ 2 billion, officials said.
Ohio is seeing a wave of big investments by the technology industry.
Intel is building a $ 20 billion chip factory just east of Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea are building a $ 3.5 billion battery plant between Columbus and Cincinnati that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub.
The area around Columbus also is home to data centers operated by Facebook and Amazon.
The two new Google data centers will be built in Columbus and Lancaster. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Madison Malone Kircher, who covers online culture, recently started a newsletter that digs into the occasionally viral, sometimes strange and often heartwarming trends that take over the internet.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
As an internet reporter for the Styles desk at The New York Times, Madison Malone Kircher has covered a viral T-shirt paid for in blood, A.I.-generated selfies and a marketing professor who told his students their final exam would be canceled -- if they went viral on TikTok. And that's just in the past few months.
The internet can seem like an ever-expanding landscape, filled with breaking news, dance challenges and even drama over olive oil. In It Happened Online, a weekly, subscriber-only newsletter that debuted last week, Ms. Kircher unearths the wackiest (and most uplifting) stories from the deepest corners of the web.
It Happened Online was derived from Ms. Kircher's column by the same name. The mission, too, has remained the same: to compile and distill internet trends.
In an interview, Ms. Kircher discussed how she chooses what topics to focus on, the death of the Twitter blue check mark and whether anyone can really be "too online." This conversation has been edited and condensed.
How would you describe the mission of the newsletter?
It's going to be covering delicious little tidbits that maybe don't warrant a full story in The New York Times, but certainly do warrant, in my world, a text message or a DM. Something in a group chat to my friends saying, "Hey, this is funny," or "Hey, this is weird -- look at this olive oil C.E.O. feuding with someone on LinkedIn." That's the way I envision it: this patchwork quilt of things that on their own don't make a piece for The Times, but together make a really fun lunch read.
What do you hope readers take away?
I want people to come away from it as the most internet-culturally versed people in their group chats. I am very much the friend in all of my circles who gets called upon when, say, the teens are drinking BORGs, which is an acronym that stands for "blackout rage gallon." What does that mean? I'll tell you, and hopefully you will be able to take that knowledge and be your own expert.
There is absolutely an appetite for this sort of content -- it absolutely speaks to a cultural change. Internet culture doesn't happen in a vacuum. It's not, "Here's traditional culture; the internet's over there in a weird box." They happen one and the same. I like that I get to, with levity and a little bit of silliness, treat those things as seriously as we treat what we think of as traditional culture.
What trends do you notice from your reporting?
Experiences are increasingly being filtered online and I'm excited to cover that. We had a piece a couple weeks ago about rejection parties for high school students who were not accepted into college -- the experience happens on TikTok now.
We've also watched the demise of Twitter play out -- I don't know if it's a demise because we're all still there.
R.I.P. blue check marks, though.
You know, I'm not really mourning mine. You can read about why in the first edition of the newsletter.
The whole launch issue is a good example of what we're aiming to do. We talk a little bit about the death of the Twitter check mark and what that means, but I've also got a really lovely interview with these singer-songwriters from TikTok who wrote an accidental hit.
Do you think there is such a thing as being "too online"?
Absolutely -- and it's me. If you subscribe to my newsletter, you don't have to be "too online." The question in my mind when I'm reporting is: How does this matter offline? What does this mean for me and my friends and the rest of the folks of the world who are just living our lives on our phones? If you can keep that question somewhere in your brain as you're enjoying (or suffering) on the internet, I think you haven't quite reached the "chronically online" diagnosis.
What are you focusing on now? What do you predict is going to be the next big thing online?
Something we're seeing across every social platform is that we are all creators now. That has been happening, slowly, for years. The first time I noticed it was during the Facebook Live boom when the phrase "Hi guys" was popping off. It started appearing in the lexicon of people like your aunt, turning on Facebook Live and being like, "Hi, I'm just popping on. We're going to wait a minute so everybody can get here." That approach as a creator has become more and more prevalent in the way that we engage with social media apps.
I think it's an equalizer. But it has created this interesting thing I've been witnessing where if we're all creators, what's left? Who are we talking to? Who is the audience? And that's something I'm excited to watch as social media becomes even bigger than it already is.

Full text: Some dishes are so good that you simply must recreate them at home.
We've all heard it before: Why go to a restaurant to eat something you can make at home? But sometimes you order something so incredible, so unforgettable, that you immediately want the recipe to make whenever you feel like it.
Here at The Times, we've been collecting restaurant recipes -- which can be found on New York Times Cooking -- for decades, from high-end French restaurants to neighborhood spots. Adapting these dishes presents challenges because chefs tend to, well, chef things up. Nevertheless, we persist.
So let's take a look at some recipes we've already collected from restaurants, as well as some that I desperately want for my own kitchen. And I'd love to know which New York City restaurant recipes you've always wanted. Email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com.
A Brief History of Restaurant Recipes in The Times
Craig Claiborne, an early Food editor at The Times, devoted much time to improving home-cooking classics like the chicken salad sandwich and beef stroganoff. But he and the columnist and chef Pierre Franey also adapted restaurant recipes, like the Grand Marnier soufflé perfected at La Côte Basque in New York.
In the more recent past, our reporters and columnists have collected an array of recipes from restaurants in our own backyard, including Via Carota's insalata verde, the Nashville-style hot fried chicken from Peaches HotHouse, the bulgogi sliders from Danji, Roberta's pizza dough and a standout celery Victor salad served at Inga's Bar.
Alexa Weibel, a recipe editor at New York Times Cooking who often adapts chefs' recipes, told me that she works to highlight details that chefs internalize, like cooking times, temperatures and signs of doneness. "The end goal is truly to create recipes that capture the magic of the chef's creation, but are as doable as they are delicious," she said.
A Recipe Wish List
And what recipes do I want for my kitchen? Well, the first dish that comes to mind is the tardivo salad at Raf's, the new restaurant and bakery in NoLIta from the team behind the Musket Room. I'm not a radicchio fan -- I like only my cocktails bitter -- but this salad made with curled fingers of the tardivo varietal has me reconsidering my position.
It isn't doused in dressing, but rather topped with pistachios, Cara Cara and blood oranges, ricotta salata, lemon and olive oil. That all sits on a schmear of Sicilian pistachio purée that drew a collective raised eyebrow from everyone at my table. Given the chance, I'd serve that salad at every dinner party from here to eternity.
But when I think of a recipe I'd make for myself every day, it's always the luscious confit tuna melt served on thick slices of Pullman bread at Agi's Counter, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. It's the generous use of dill that keeps me coming back. Boy, do I love dill. And the sharp, nose-hair-burning mustard they serve on the side demands to be consumed to the last spoonful.
Ras Plant Based, a vegan Ethiopian restaurant in Crown Heights, serves incredible bolé bowls, a stew of chickpeas, steamed collard greens, cabbage, carrots, bell peppers and avocado salad run through with turmeric, cumin, basil, jalapeños and more. Whenever I'm craving a meal with as many ingredients as possible, this is the recipe I want. The disparate parts add up to a soul-warming amalgam of damn goodness that had me hooked when I tried it last fall at The New York Times Food Festival.
Stay tuned. Maybe I'll be able to charm my way into the grand tradition of bringing restaurant recipes to home kitchens everywhere.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The police said the man, 30, was acting erratically on an F train Monday afternoon when another man, 24, placed him in a chokehold.
A 30-year-old man who was screaming on a subway train died on Monday afternoon after another rider grabbed him and placed him in a chokehold, according to the police and video of the encounter.
The man, whose name has not been released, flailed with his arms and kicked his legs as he attempted to free himself, the video shows. The video was taken by Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist, who posted it on his Facebook page, "Luces de Nueva York."
Witnesses said the victim had been acting in a "hostile and erratic manner" toward other passengers on the train when he was approached by the other man, 24, who moved to restrain him, according to the police.
In the video, the man who died pushes off another man who held his arms down.
The police later took the rider who had placed the man in a chokehold into custody, questioned him and released him. The man has not been charged and the investigation was continuing, the police said. He also was not named by the police.
Mr. Vazquez said in an interview that he was on the F train going northbound, on his way to a date, when the 30-year-old man boarded the train and began yelling.
"'I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,"' the man screamed, according to Mr. Vazquez. " 'I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die."'
Soon after, the 24-year-old man grabbed him.
Mr. Vazquez said that the rider who was screaming was frightening but had not assaulted anyone.
"It was a very tense situation because you don't know what he's going to do afterwards," Mr. Vazquez said in the interview Tuesday night.
Mr. Vazquez's video shows the man being held down for at least two minutes before he stopped moving. The men continued to hold him down for about 50 seconds before releasing him.
"He'll be all right," said one person on the train as several others looked down at the man's motionless body.
The police said they received a call at about 2:27 p.m. about a fight that had broken out on an F train traveling north. When they arrived, they found the man unconscious on the train.
He was taken to Lenox Health hospital in Greenwich Village, where he was pronounced dead. The police had not declared the death a homicide or announced arrests as of Tuesday.
Mr. Vazquez said he felt conflicted about the actions of the 24-year-old man.
"I am confused now because I'm not sure how to think about what the young man did," he said. "He was trying to help."
Mr. Vazquez said at the time he did not believe the 30-year-old man could die.
"None of us were thinking that," he said. "He was moving and he was defending himself."
The incident on Monday occurs amid increasing ridership on the subway, and state and city officials have expressed optimism about falling crime rates and an apparent rise in confidence among riders in the safety of the city's trains.
The rates of major crimes in the subway dropped 16 percent from Oct. 25 to Jan. 22, compared with the same period a year earlier, Ms. Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams announced earlier this year.
That drop coincided with an aggressive safety push that filled the system with more police officers. The move to add more police followed a rise in violence on the transit network in 2022, when there were 10 killings on the subway, compared with an average of two a year in the five years before the pandemic. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had also said it planned to install security cameras inside every subway train.

Outsize Tech Earnings Buoy Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street rallied to its best day since January after Meta on Thursday became the latest big tech company to blow past profit expectations and reports painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 jumped 2 percent to erase all its losses from what had been a tough week so far. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 2.4 percent gain.
Facebook's parent company did some of the heaviest lifting, and it jumped 13.9 percent. Not only did Meta beat analysts' estimates for profit during the first three months of the year, it also gave a forecast for revenue that topped expectations.
It joined Microsoft and Alphabet, which reported better-than-expected results earlier in the week, and Amazon followed suit after trading closed for the day.
The majority of companies have been beating forecasts so far this earnings reporting season. Hasbro climbed 14.6 percent, and Comcast rose 10.3 percent after they also topped Wall Street's estimates. But expectations were broadly low coming into this reporting season because of still-high inflation, much higher interest rates and a slowing economy.
A report on Thursday gave the first indication of just how much the U.S. economy is slowing: down to an estimated 1.1 percent growth at an annual rate during the first three months of 2023 from 2.6 percent at the end of last year. That was worse than expected, but the economy may be in better shape than it looks.
Underneath the surface, the report showed strength at the economy's core, with growth in spending by consumers and other areas accelerating. Much of the weakness was related to businesses thinning out inventories. Also within the data, though, was a measure of inflation that the Fed likes to use, which came in hotter than hoped.
A separate report showed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising hope that the job market may remain resilient.
"In our view, pulled all together, the conflicting data signals to us that we are in the 'bend, not break' phase of the cycle" for the economy, said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-head of portfolio management for multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Investors took the data to mean the Federal Reserve next week will see the economy is still strong enough to handle another interest rate increase at its next meeting.
Treasury yields jumped immediately after the release of the economic reports as traders raised their forecasts for the Fed and rates.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.53 percent from 3.44 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
High rates have hit some areas of the economy particularly hard, including the housing and manufacturing industries. Banks have also come under pressure.
The hunt has been on for potential weak links, and Wall Street's spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank. Its stock has more than halved this week after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers pulled after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history last month.
Its stock steadied a bit Thursday, rising 8.8 percent.
Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the global economy, slipped 0.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to concerns that its profitability may have maxed out. It also benefited from a bigger-than-expected buildup in dealer inventories.
Crocs tumbled 15.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than expected. The footwear company gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that fell short of some analysts' expectations.

Its Go-Go Days Over, Amazon Grows a Little, And Wall Street Shrugs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, reporting a 9 percent revenue increase for the first quarter, is the latest Big Tech company to top Wall Street's financial expectations.
For much of its history, Amazon grew amazingly, unbelievably fast. Not so much anymore.
Amazon released on Thursday its results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 9 percent, the same as in the previous quarter.
While slow by historical standards, when sales could pop 40 percent from the previous year, the numbers looked pretty good to analysts who expected even less. Amazon shares, which have had a lousy 18 months, rose more than 10 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday before giving up those gains as reality settled in.
Revenue rose to $ 127.4 billion, while net income jumped to 31 cents a share against a loss of 38 cents in 2022. Analysts had expected a profit of 21 cents a share and revenue of $ 124.55 billion.
"From my perspective, I think there's a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we're starting to see," Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, said in a call with analysts.
Best-performing sectors were advertising, which rose 21 percent, and Amazon Web Services, which rose 16 percent. But revenue at the online stores, which for most consumers is the essence of Amazon, fell by about $ 33 million.
Mr. Jassy spoke at length about how all of Amazon will be invigorated in the next few years by artificial intelligence -- like large language models and the generative A.I. that they power.
"Frankly the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago," he said. "They have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly. It really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists, and many that don't exist."
Amazon, like other tech companies, did very well early in the pandemic when everyone stayed home but has had some troubles since. After expanding its retail distribution network to handle an influx of new business that did not stick around, management is paring back.
Employment at the company has shrunk 10 percent since its peak in early 2022, or by 150,000 workers. Since November, the company has confirmed 27,000 layoffs in divisions including human resources, retail and cloud computing. But the warehouses and distribution network have dropped the most.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, did not rule out more layoffs in a call with reporters on Thursday. "We'll proceed adaptively," he said.
Amazon's Big Tech peers reported surprisingly good results this week after a brutal winter of layoffs, weak results and diminished expectations. Facebook's parent, Meta, snapped a three-quarter losing streak in revenue, sending its shares up 10 percent. Google's advertising search business did better than expected, while Microsoft's cloud computing operation helped the company notch impressive results.
For years, even decades, Amazon chose growth over profits. Making money took a back seat to establishing new markets. Sometimes this worked so well it changed the fundamental nature of the company. AWS grew at such a torrid rate that its profits have done much to compensate for Amazon's anemic returns on the retail side.
On the other hand, many small ventures remained small. When to shut them down is a decision that for years Amazon could put off, but no longer. Rising interest rates and balky consumers forced its hand.
This week, the company shut its Halo line of health and fitness devices. Amazon has major ambitions in health care, but fitness devices are a crowded market and Halo was not breaking through. Amazon also shut down in recent days Book Depository, an online bookseller it bought in 2011 and operated independently from its principal book-selling division.
New horizons beckon.
"Health care is a multitrillion-dollar business that is very segmented and it's really broken, in the U.S. particularly," Mr. Jassy said.

Regulators Have New Focus in Assessing Tech Deals: The Future: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: British regulators cited the newness of the cloud gaming field to block Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision, a shift in antitrust strategy.
As companies like Google and Facebook grew into giants in the early 21st century, regulators chose largely not to interfere in the still-young market for online services.
Now regulators have reversed course: When it comes to tech, they want to see into the future and beat companies to getting there.
The decision by the British authorities on Wednesday to block Microsoft's $ 69 billion bid for the video game giant Activision Blizzard exemplified the new approach. British officials said a core reason for rejecting the deal was how it could threaten competition in the nascent market for cloud gaming, which lets users stream their favorite video game titles.
That argument is becoming familiar. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which last year sued to block Microsoft's deal for Activision, also raised concerns about competition in cloud gaming, though the agency focused mostly on the impact to the traditional console games business.
Then this month, the F.T.C. ordered the biotech firm Illumina to sell a company that it had acquired, saying the deal could harm competition in the young market for cancer blood tests. And in July, the F.T.C. sued to stop Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, from buying a virtual reality start-up because, the agency said, the purchase would give the tech behemoth unacceptable power over the emerging metaverse.
The actions are part of how governments, frustrated by the speed with which Silicon Valley companies rush to dominate new technologies, are trying to predict how the tech giants could hurt competition in new areas and stop it before it happens.
"Enforcers have to be ahead of the ball on this," said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, which receives some funding from Microsoft.
Regulators' fascination with foreseeing how the tech giants could harm competition stems largely from their perceived failure to do so in the past. In the 1970s and 1980s, courts and regulators made it harder for the government to prove that an acquisition could illegally damage potential future competition. Courts have also said it is hard to sort through the uncertainty of young areas of the economy. So regulators focused largely on whether a deal could hurt competition in mature markets.
Whether the new predictive tack will work for regulators is unclear. In February, a judge ruled against the F.T.C.'s attempt to stop Meta's virtual reality deal. And Illumina has said it plans to appeal the agency's order to sell its blood test company.
Still, divining power plays by the tech giants has become a central goal for lawmakers, activists and regulators who say those companies have too much clout. After arguing that governments were effectively asleep at the wheel while Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple ballooned into giants, many critics are now in government themselves and under pressure to do things differently.
The biggest tech companies, for their part, are jockeying to own the next big thing. Meta is investing heavily in virtual reality, and Apple is working on augmented reality glasses. The explosion of artificial intelligence chatbots has reinvigorated the fight between Google and Microsoft for control of online search.
The F.T.C. and the Justice Department declined to comment specifically on their interest in nascent technologies, beyond earlier statements. Microsoft declined to comment, and the British Competition and Markets Authority did not respond to a request for comment.
The lack of regulatory action as the tech giants mushroomed is well documented. The F.T.C. declined to challenge Facebook's purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, for instance. Then in 2020, the agency sued Facebook over antitrust concerns, arguing that those acquisitions had allowed it to illegally cut off young competitors.
Similarly, the F.T.C. let Google buy the ad software DoubleClick in 2007. This year, the Justice Department said Google had abused a monopoly over the ad market.
Gene Kimmelman, a former member of the Justice Department's antitrust staff who favors more regulation of the tech giants, said regulators in the internet's early days had been gripped by a "reticence to predict what would happen."
"Then you fast-forward 20 years, and there's a lot of critical introspection about why we didn't see what was coming," he said.
By 2021, regulators were looking more at future markets. That year, the F.T.C. sued in its internal court to stop Illumina from buying Grail, which makes blood tests to detect cancer. The judge on the internal court ruled for Illumina, which had already taken the unusual step of closing the deal.
This month, the F.T.C. voted to reverse the judge's ruling and demanded that Illumina sell Grail. Illumina plans to appeal that decision to a traditional federal court.
Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual reality fitness game, saying it would hurt competition in the market for the so-called metaverse, where users play, work and socialize in virtual worlds. In February, a judge declined to temporarily stop the deal from closing, and the agency abandoned its challenge.
In trying to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision -- the largest consumer tech deal since AOL bought Time Warner decades ago -- the British authorities focused squarely on the deal's impact on cloud gaming, which is currently a niche market.
The officials said cloud gaming could be worth $ 13.7 billion globally by 2026 and worried that Microsoft already accounted for 60 to 70 percent of current services. Microsoft also has the tools to operate an entire cloud gaming ecosystem, from its Azure cloud system to its Xbox services, the agency said.
But cloud gaming is in its infancy, and there is no guarantee that the technology, which requires huge amounts of computing power and often has glitches, will become mainstream. Sales from subscription services that exclusively offer cloud gaming are expected to hit about $ 288 million globally this year, according to Ampere Analysis, a London firm.
"They're predicting what's going to happen," said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher for Ampere Analysis. "There is some legitimacy to that, but it's hard to predict. It's a very dynamic space."
Antitrust officials appear to be looking ahead to other young technologies, too. At a March event, the Justice Department's top antitrust enforcer, Jonathan Kanter, and the F.T.C.'s chair, Lina Khan, said they thought A.I. products like ChatGPT could be potentially transformational -- and ripe for domination by the tech giants.
"This is another transition that we're looking at closely," Ms. Khan said, "to make sure that if this is an opportunity for competition to really enter the market and disrupt, that we're allowing that to happen rather than illegal tactics locking up the market."

Revenue Declines as Snap Struggles With Ad Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, reported on Thursday that its revenue had fallen for the first time since it went public as the app maker struggled to adjust to a difficult economic environment.
Revenue for the first quarter was $ 989 million, down 7 percent from the same period last year. That was below Wall Street estimates of $ 1 billion. The company said demand for its ads was "disrupted" by upgrades it made to the platform it sells ads on. Snap's stock fell more than 20 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.
Snap also recorded a net loss of $ 329 million, which was narrower than the $ 360 million it lost a year ago.
Despite the company's business struggles, the number of Snapchat daily users grew to 383 million, a 15 percent increase over last year.
In a statement, Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive, highlighted Snapchat's increase in users. "We are working to accelerate our revenue growth," he said.

Why It Matters: The digital ad slump is bouncing back, but not for everyone.
Falling demand for Google's search ads and Facebook's display ads has stabilized, with the digital ad giants each reporting a slight uptick in growth this week.
But Snap, a smaller company, still faces stiff competition from the likes of TikTok. Snap has also been hit by privacy changes made by Apple, which make it harder for advertisers to collect data and show highly targeted pitches.
Others are also continuing to grapple with the ad slump. Advertising revenue at YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, declined 3 percent in the first three months of the year.
Background: Tough times.
Snap was founded in 2011 and went public in 2017. It is a growth stock, meaning investors expect it to expand rapidly. As recently as 2021, Snap reported revenue growth that doubled its previous year's results. That has slowed dramatically over the last year amid macroeconomic uncertainty in the face of inflation and rising interest rates, culminating in this quarter's decline.
Snap's stock fell 65 percent over the last year, dragging its valuation below $ 16 billion earlier this week. That's less than what venture capitalists valued the company at before it went public in 2017.
What's Next: Subscriptions and A.I.
Like much of the tech industry, Snap has spent the last year laying off staff and paring back creative and ambitious side projects. And like much of the tech industry, it is going big on artificial intelligence.
Snap recently unveiled a chatbot called My AI that allows Snapchat users to chat with the bot individually or with a group. The bot, powered by OpenAI, was met with some criticism from users. Snap said its users were sending more than two million messages a day to the bot.
Snap is also pushing for more revenue from subscriptions. Three million users pay $ 4 a month for Snapchat+, which gives them access to extra features.
Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence, wrote in a report that the company had not yet translated the excitement around its new products into revenue, which did not change "the reality that its core business is struggling," she wrote.
"We are working to accelerate our revenue growth," said Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, which recorded a net loss of $ 329 million for the quarter. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOE SCARNICI/GETTY IMAGES) This article appeared in print on page B4.

Big Tech Blunts a Wall Street Decline: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell again Wednesday, though a rally for Microsoft and some other Big Tech stocks helped to limit the losses.
The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a gain of 0.5 percent.
Wall Street was coming off its worst day in a month, hurt by concerns about the strength of U.S. banks. The spotlight has been harshest on First Republic Bank, and the worry is that it and other smaller and mid-sized banks could suffer debilitating runs of deposits from customers, similar to the ones that caused last month's failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Even without more shutdowns, the industry's struggles could cause a pullback in lending by banks that saps the economy.
PacWest Bancorp., another bank that has been in investors' spotlight, rose 7.5 percent after reporting stronger results than expected and saying that its deposits have grown since late March. That may offer optimism that First Republic's struggles could be specific to itself, rather than a symptom of deeper issues with the system.
Also dropping sharply Wednesday was Enphase Energy, which fell 25.7 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast. But analysts said its revenue forecast for the current quarter fell short of some expectations.
Most companies have been topping expectations so far this reporting season, but the low bar set for them has many investors paying more attention to what chief executives say about upcoming trends than results for the past three months.
Activision Blizzard tumbled 11.4 percent after British regulators blocked its takeover by Microsoft on concerns it would hurt competition in the cloud gaming market.
While most stocks fell, gains for Microsoft and other Big Tech companies prevented a sharper slide for the market. Microsoft rose 7.2 percent after reporting stronger profit for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. It carries a huge weight on the S&P 500 because it's the second-largest stock in the index.
Tech stocks have been some of the year's best performers as ttech companies lay off workers and make other cost cuts to improve their profitability. Hopes for a coming pause from the Federal Reserve on its barrage of interest rate hikes have also helped them.
Google's parent company, Alphabet, turned a bigger profit than expected. But its stock slipped 0.2 percent after drifting between gains and losses through the day. It reported its first back-to-back drops in advertising revenue from a year earlier since it became a publicly traded company in 2004.
More Big Tech firms are set to follow with their own reports soon. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, rose 0.9 percent ahead of its report. It jumped in after-hours trading after it said it earned more than expected.
Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 12.9 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after reporting stronger profit than expected, raising hopes that consumer spending could remain resilient despite a slowing economy. That's key because consumer spending makes up the bulk of the U.S. economy.
Stocks have been mostly listless in recent weeks as Wall Street struggles with several questions. With few answers imminent, Mark Haefele, UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer, expects stocks to stay stuck in a range.
Not only are investors worried about the possibility of a recession this year, he said stocks also look relatively expensive. That means "the scope for upside appears limited, in our view," he said.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.43 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.92 percent.

Community Newspaper Was Planning Last Edition Until the Press Caught Fire: [Correction]

Full text: For years, the Montclair Local bucked trends and delivered a weekly print edition to subscribers. The end of its run came with a new challenge.
In 2017, a tech executive and his wife from New Jersey with a spare fortune to invest in local news and nostalgia started a weekly print newspaper covering their beloved Montclair, an affluent commuter town some 30 minutes from Manhattan.
As other regional and community papers were fading, Montclair Local popped up with a subscription price: $ 12 a year. It added a website and weekly email newsletters, and for seven years, it defied the odds. The press run grew to 3,500.
Every Thursday, mailboxes in town were fed 20 fresh pages of local coverage, from school board updates to rumblings of a new supermarket -- and of course high school sports.
But print circulation costs were eating 40 percent of the budget, so last week, the Local's board announced it would go online-only and merge with another online outlet, Baristanet. Its last print edition would come out the following Thursday, April 27.
The Local decided to go all out, with a 64-page whopper to be delivered -- just as it was for its first-ever press run -- to every house in Montclair.
"It's our send-off issue, it's much bigger than what we usually put out," said its editor in chief, Carla Baranauckas.
Copy was filed and edited, headlines were written, pages were laid out. The issue would be sent to the printer at midnight on Tuesday.
But on Monday morning, Ms. Baranauckas received an email with some troubling news: There had been a fire at the printing plant in Rockaway, N.J.
Suddenly, the Local's last edition was in jeopardy.
Though print newspapers have been fading for years, many older readers -- and journalists -- still cling to a fondness for them. Ms. Baranauckas said the Local's print edition had some younger fans, too: children. "When they're in the newspaper, they get a kick out of it," she said.
Jennifer Dunne Keeney, a Broadway actress and Montclair resident currently appearing in "Chicago," described the Local as "a tangible thing that gets you to focus on the space where you live."
Her husband, Booth Keeney, is also a devoted reader. "The first thing I do on Thursday is go to the mailbox to see if the Local is in there," he said.
The printing plant is run by Gannett, the newspaper chain behemoth that publishes USA Today and bought up a slew of community newspapers in and around Montclair, including the Montclair Times, a community staple printed since 1877.
Gannett would not comment on the Local's situation but did release a statement saying that there were no injuries in the fire. "Two printing presses sustained damage and some production schedules were impacted," it said.
For the Local, alternatives were scarce; it's not so easy to find someone to print a newspaper these days. But Ms. Baranauckas was resolute.
"We will figure out a way to do it," she said. "If I have to print it out on my home printer and walk it door to door, that's what I'll do."
The Local was founded by Heeten Choxi, a tech executive, and his wife, Thalla-Marie Choxi, a lactation and sleep consultant, in the wake of Gannett's takeover of the Montclair Times, which resulted in cuts to its coverage and staffing.
It was a bet on local news at a time when the press corps at the statehouse in Trenton was dwindling, and papers even in wealthy towns were shrinking.
But if anywhere could sustain a start-up local print outlet, it might be Montclair, a highly educated and politically engaged town of 37,000 whose residents have lots of disposable income. Many commute -- or did, prepandemic -- to jobs in newsrooms, television studios and publishing offices in Manhattan.
The Choxis spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the Local, which became a nonprofit in 2021. After the couple moved away from Montclair in 2022, the Local was buoyed by more than $ 450,000 in contributions from local donors, the paper said.
The Local's board is stocked with media and dot-com veterans from Google, Facebook and The New York Times, including a former masthead editor and the current editor of The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Baranauckas, the Local's editor, spent 21 years at The Times and taught at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
The final print edition was to feature an article about Black firefighters suing Montclair alleging racial discrimination and a package on the Lackawanna Plaza redevelopment plan in town.
There was to be a special section on local spring activities, and crack coverage of the Little League parade. On the front page would be an article about the merger with Baristanet.
By Tuesday night, the pages were laid out and edited but had nowhere to go.
Then word came through that the presses that print The Star-Ledger could handle the Local's print run -- perhaps as soon as Wednesday -- preserving hope that the final issue might still hit Montclair's mailboxes on time.
Ms. Baranauckas plans to leave the paper after the merger. On Wednesday, after the pages had been sent to print, she called the mini-drama a testament to the persistence of a gritty local newspaper.
"It's a weekly miracle," she said. "Come hell or high water, we get the paper out."

Full text: Miss the Red Cat, in Chelsea? We have just the place.
As spring marched forward and cherry blossom petals covered city sidewalks, you filled our inbox with questions both practical and highly specific. One reader is searching for wheelchair-friendly dining. Another is looking for a replacement for a beloved restaurant -- I found the perfect spot -- and a third asked for recommendations in Upper Manhattan for the "one million people in Westchester," as the reader put it.
As always, email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com with your questions or advice, and you may see your message featured here.
Dining With A.D.A.-Accessible Accommodations
My husband recently started using a wheelchair. Before his illness, we enjoyed eating excellent food ranging from luxurious to neighborhood. He especially likes excellent sushi. Please tell us great places to go that are wheelchair accessible (including the bathroom!). -- Ellen C.
The excellent Peruvian restaurant Contento in Harlem immediately springs to mind. Two of its owners use wheelchairs, so the space has been outfitted accordingly. (And if your husband loves sushi, the ceviche will hit the spot.) If you want luxurious sushi, Yoshino, a restaurant in NoHo that Pete Wells awarded four stars last year, is accessible and has a counter at wheelchair height.
Finally there's Fulgurances Laundromat, where rotating resident chefs showcase their talents with a six-course tasting menu for $ 89 ( $ 149 with wine pairings). The nearby Greenpoint Avenue subway stop is A.D.A.-accessible, and the restaurant has an entrance ramp and a wheelchair-accessible bathroom. Through April 29, the resident chef is Flor Camorlinga, who mixes elements of Japanese, Korean and European cooking with food rooted in her native Mexico. And because the menu changes every few months, this is a restaurant you can revisit as you find your way to a new but no less delicious normal.
Tracking Down a Chef
The Red Cat was recommended to us by Ina Garten. Sadly, it closed after the owner wanted a fresh start -- good for him, but bad for us. Can you recommend a similar restaurant? We like the neighborhood vibe without loud music or TVs. -- Kathy H.
It's so rare that I'm able to find a near-perfect answer for a question, but Kathy, wait until you see what I came up with! Some background: The Red Cat was a popular American restaurant in Chelsea that closed in 2018 after nearly 20 years in business. As this reader points out, the chef and owner, Jimmy Bradley, decided to take a break. We could all learn something from Jimmy.
The first place that came to mind was Motel Morris, a chic, New American restaurant, also in Chelsea, where the music is of the soothing soul variety (think Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder). And wouldn't you know it, the restaurant's executive chef is one Bill McDaniel, who spent 14 years as the chef de cuisine at the Red Cat. Ta da! Go for the red curry mussels at dinner, or the Gruyère-smothered, open-faced Reuben at lunch.
Dinner Near 125th Street
For the one million people in Westchester, where can we drive down for a great meal in New York City but not have to go below 125th Street? I have a place for Dominican chicken on Broadway and 177th Street. But what else? -- Betsy T.
First, please tell me the name of your Dominican chicken place. I hope you don't mind that my recommendations are below 125th Street -- but only by a few blocks. You'll find one in an earlier answer (Contento). And for the second, my dear colleague Eric Kim lives in Upper Manhattan and has always loved Massawa, the 35-year-old Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurant between 120th and 121st Streets. I trust Eric's tastes completely and you should, too. He says to order the cabbage and potatoes; the salmon; and any of the vegan options, like the tsebhi hamli, collard greens stewed with tomatoes and berbere.
In Other News ...
There's no restaurant review this week, but here's Pete Wells's list of the city's 100 best restaurants in case you missed it.
Openings: Ma-dé, "a Balinese beach party" of a restaurant from the Wayan team, is now open on Spring Street; Jupiter at Rockefeller Center has added Jupiter Pasta & Wine Terrace, serving cocktails and small plates; and Little Egg, a spinoff of the restaurant Egg (closed), is now open in Prospect Heights.
Priya Krishna has a vibrant report on Corona Plaza in Queens, where Latin American food sellers have created "one of the only markets in New York spearheaded and operated by local vendors," she writes.
Through interviews with dozens of former employees and local restaurant veterans, Julia Moskin reported on allegations of workplace abuse and harassment against Barbara Lynch, one of Boston's most celebrated chefs and restaurateurs.
Tejal Rao wrote about Los Angeles's ever-growing and ever-delicious doughnut scene.

Web Search Sparks Sales For Alphabet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's parent company returned to sales growth, even as an advertising slowdown continued to crimp YouTube.
After years of easy financial growth and booming popularity, Alphabet, Google's parent company, has in recent months faced mounting questions about its future. It has been under the gun to deliver artificial intelligence technology, its sales growth has decelerated, and it is laying off 12,000 employees to cut costs.
On Tuesday, Google shrugged off some of those questions, returning to sales growth in defiance of a slowdown in digital advertising.
The company reported revenue of $ 69.8 billion in the first three months of 2023, up 3 percent from a year earlier and beating analysts' average estimate of $ 68.9 billion. Its profits fell 8 percent, to $ 15 billion -- the fifth consecutive decline -- though Alphabet said it recorded $ 2.6 billion in charges related to recent layoffs and office space reductions.
Google still faces significant challenges. Its video platform, YouTube, continues to be crimped by the ad slump and rival Microsoft has gained buzz and users after incorporating an A.I. chatbot into its search engine, Bing.
But Tuesday's results highlighted Google's enviable advantage as a gateway to the web for billions of people around the world, a position that cannot be dislodged quickly or easily.
In particular, Google's search engine, the core of the world's largest digital advertising machine, remained strong. Revenue from the search engine rose almost 2 percent. to $ 40.4 billion, in the first quarter, higher than analysts' estimates of $ 39.4 billion. The company said travel firms and retailers had spent more to reach customers on the search platform.
Sante Faustini, who runs product intelligence at M Science, a data research firm, said in an interview that Google's search engine was the driving force of the company's rebound, in a sign of the service's "resilience" against larger economic forces.
Starting last year, rising interest rates and inflation had made advertisers thriftier, undermining the sales and profit of Google and its peers Snap and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Google's sales had declined slightly at the end of last year.
That had put Alphabet under growing pressure to reassure investors it could still deliver revenue and profit gains, after years of gravity-defying leaps. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, encapsulated Wall Street's demands in a recent note, in which he pushed the company to shed expenses, stabilize core businesses including YouTube and accelerate the release of artificial intelligence technology.
The internet giant said in January it would cull 12,000 people, or 6 percent, of its global work force, from its payroll. As of March 31, Alphabet had 190,711 employees, compared with 190,234 at the end of last year. The company's layoffs did not officially go into effect until the end of last month.
At the same time, Google's search engine appeared threatened by a wave of chatbots that have captured the public imagination. In particular, tools from Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, have begun testing Google's mettle.
In March, Google released a chatbot called Bard to mixed reviews, but the company does not generate revenue from the tool. The New York Times has reported that Google will incorporate conversational A.I. features into its flagship search engine in May, and has begun work on a new, more personalized search engine designed to take advantage of A.I. advances.
Last week, Alphabet consolidated its main A.I. teams into one unit, Google DeepMind, to make quicker progress in the field. The move combined the London-based A.I. lab DeepMind with Google Brain, part of the company's research division. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, assumed control of the group. Jeff Dean, Google's top research executive, had previously overseen Google Brain, which he co-founded.
In an earnings call on Tuesday, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, said the company had made "good progress" in A.I., comparing it to the company's transition from desktop to mobile computing more than a decade ago.
"Our investments and breakthroughs in A.I. over the last decade have positioned us well," he said, while promising a raft of new A.I. features in everything from Android smartphones to software for other businesses. He added that he hoped Google's efforts to develop A.I. features would help the company retain its large user base.
"We'll continue to incorporate generative A.I. advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way," he said.
Advertising sales at YouTube, Google's video platform, dipped almost 3 percent, to $ 6.7 billion, in the first quarter, narrowly ahead of the $ 6.6 billion expected by analysts. The division has recorded declining revenue in recent months amid increased competition from TikTok. Apple's privacy changes for its iPhones have also tamped down the growth of social media platforms by making it more difficult to prove to advertisers that their ads are effective.
Sales at Google Cloud, the division that offers software and technology services to other businesses, jumped 28 percent to $ 7.5 billion. For the first quarter, the division reported a profit for the first time, of $ 191 million.

A Scramble To Use Up All Those Coupons: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The retailer is closing its stores, leaving many longtime customers scrambling to make sure they get their goods -- at a discount.
For many shoppers, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy filing on Sunday was a call to action.
Customers -- both loyal and lapsed -- received an email from the home-goods retailer around 8 a.m. telling them that the company had decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores would soon be closing, as would its 120 Buy Buy Baby locations.
Shoppers have until Wednesday to use their coupons. Around the country, they rounded up the ubiquitous blue slips of paper offering 20 percent off, stuffed them in pouches and plastic bags, and made their way to the nearest Bed Bath & Beyond.
At a store in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Monday, Sylvia Ward, a self-described Bed Bath & Beyond aficionado from the Bronx, said news of the closings had "absolutely devastated" her. Then she learned she had only a few days to use coupons.
"I had to run down here today!" she said.
Ms. Ward said she had brought about seven coupons to use toward items including two Simplehuman soap dispensers, kitchen timers and about 14 packets of Clorox wipes, estimating that she saved $ 30.
Bed Bath & Beyond, which opened in 1971, held unique cultural cachet among big-box retailers. It served as a recurring story line on Comedy Central's "Broad City"; a plot device for Adam Sandler's 2006 movie, "Click"; and a talking point for celebrities showcasing their relatability on late-night shows. Facebook groups were formed for people to trade the retailer's coupons.
Over the decades, those coupons reliably showed up in millions of mailboxes -- and, more recently, email inboxes -- offering a discount on home goods like kitchen gadgets, fluffy pillows and wooden hangers. People gave them as gifts to new homeowners and college students, kept them in kitchen junk drawers and car glove compartments. At least one customer used them as a calling card, writing their phone number on the back of the coupons and handing them to fellow patrons deemed attractive.
A steady flow of customers moved through the Bed Bath & Beyond store in Chelsea on Sunday. People milled around looking at towel heaters and large pillows. While some asked employees in blue aprons where they could find certain products, they also took the time to ask how the workers were feeling about the location's closing.
Bobbi Kimberly was one of those customers. The chain's bankruptcy news was the motivation she needed to finally use a coupon she had been holding on to and to see the store again before it shut down.
"It's like you're losing a buddy, because it's something that's dependable," Ms. Kimberly, a yoga instructor, said. She said she would miss roaming the stores, which kept her active and social.
After hearing about the bankruptcy, loyal Bed Bath & Beyond customers took to social media. The company's name became a trending topic on Twitter. People shared odes to the retailer, posted TikTok videos of themselves walking into stores and alerted their friends and families to the chain's closing through their Facebook statuses. Reddit threads about Bed Bath & Beyond, which became a "meme stock" favorite during the pandemic, lit up with chatter about its downfall.
Some shoppers handed unused coupons to other customers in stores and texted friends and family, encouraging them to use theirs before it was too late.
The outpouring of support came too late for Bed Bath & Beyond. Despite a boost early in the pandemic, when quarantined Americans bought items to spruce up their homes, sales soon started to fall precipitously. The retailer's supply chain was strained, operational costs rose, and vendors held back on shipping inventory when they grew nervous about being paid on time.
In recent months, Bed Bath & Beyond store shoppers were met with sparsely stocked shelves. The chain had been slashing hundreds of jobs and closing stores to try to survive. In its bankruptcy filing, it said the "past 12 months have undoubtedly been the most difficult and turbulent in Bed Bath & Beyond's storied history."
Jean Massaro was in a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Yonkers on Monday morning with her coupons in tow. She said she didn't shop online and had ignored the discounts the retailer emailed to her in favor of the tangible ones she had, some collected from People magazine.
"I really, really love this store," Ms. Massaro said. "I'm upset, and so are a lot of other people."
But it has been years since Bed Bath & Beyond was at its peak. In 2020, it said it would pull back on sending shoppers coupons after investors questioned if they hurt the company's margins. Shoppers recoiled, with the decision seeming like one in a growing list of ways that the chain was taking away the things that customers loved most about their shopping experience.
"I used to come here a lot," said David Salidor, who swung by a location in Manhattan with some coupons on Monday. "It's because they have stuff that a lot of stores don't have."
He added: "I'm sorry to see it go. But it's strange times, strange times."
Some store visitors on Monday were disappointed that they didn't see eye-popping sales. The deep discounts characteristic of liquidation sales won't start until Wednesday -- once Bed Bath & Beyond stops accepting coupons. The company said it expected that customers would be able to use gift cards until May 8.
For shoppers who have baby and wedding registries, the company said it would work with an alternative platform to transfer their data. Some Bed Bath & Beyond customers said they were likely to go to retailers like T.J. Maxx, Kohl's and Amazon to fill the void.
Thea Derecola, a hairstylist and an educator in Chelsea, took a pouch of coupons to the store and used them to buy two pillows for 20 percent off. Without the coupons, she said, she thought the pillows would have cost less on Amazon.
Her doorman used to save Bed Bath & Beyond coupons for her, said Ms. Derecola, a longtime shopper who used to work across the street and visit the store weekly.
Daniel Duque, a retired teacher in Brooklyn Heights, said he hoped this wasn't really the end of Bed Bath & Beyond, which expects all of its locations to be closed by June 30.
"I'm still waiting for a miracle," he said. For years, he had shopped in the store, but stopped going as much after moving to Brooklyn.
A feeling of nostalgia is common when a retailer goes out of business. It's similar to the response that shoppers had when Toys "R" Us filed for bankruptcy, said Joanie Demer, co-founder of Krazy Coupon Lady, an online community that shares discounting tips and deals.
"There's all this altruism for the brand all of a sudden," Ms. Demer said. "It's like, OK, but you weren't shopping there. You've been shopping on Amazon like the rest of us."
Chelsea Gordon, an Atlanta entrepreneur who owns the Cooking Code, didn't learn about Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy until Sunday evening. She had been spending the day prepping meals with kitchen gadgets, like her juicer, that she had bought from the retailer.
She's a frequent shopper. Last year, she used Bed Bath & Beyond for her house registry and Buy Buy Baby to register gifts for her baby shower.
When learning she had only a few days to use her coupons, Ms. Gordon made a plan to head to her nearby store on Monday morning right after her Pilates class. She said she also wanted to make sure her mother had heard the news since they often texted about Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.
"That coupon, it's going to be one less thing to talk about," Ms. Gordon said with a sigh.

After Rocket Launch, a Town Is Covered in Dust: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Residents of Port Isabel said that their city was covered in grime following SpaceX's rocket launch on Thursday. The city said there was no "immediate concern for people's health."
As the most powerful rocket ever built blasted from its launchpad in Boca Chica, Texas, on Thursday, the liftoff rocked the earth and kicked up a billowing cloud of dust and debris, shaking homes and raining down brown grime for miles.
In Port Isabel, a city about six miles northwest where at least one window shattered, residents were alarmed.
"It was truly terrifying," said Sharon Almaguer, who, at the time of the launch, was at home with her 80-year-old mother. During previous launches, Ms. Almaguer said she had experienced some shaking inside the brick house, but "this was on a completely different level."
Meanwhile, SpaceX's Starship exploded minutes after liftoff and before reaching orbit. Near the launch site, the residents of Port Isabel, known for its towering lighthouse and less than 10 miles from the border with Mexico, were left to deal with the mess.
Virtually everywhere in the city "ended up with a covering of a rather thick, granular, sand grain that just landed on everything," Valerie Bates, a Port Isabel spokeswoman, said in an interview.
Images posted to social media showed residents' cars covered in brown debris.
A window shattered at a fitness gym, its owner, Luis Alanis, said. Mr. Alanis, who was at home at the time of the launch, said he felt "rumbling, kind of like a mini earthquake." He estimated that the window would cost about $ 300 to fix.
Closer to the launch site, large pieces of debris were recorded flying through the air and smashing into an unoccupied car.
Louis Balderas, the founder of LabPadre, which films SpaceX's launches, said that while it was common to see some debris, smoke and dust, the impact of Thursday's liftoff was unlike anything he had ever seen.
"There were bowling ball-sized pieces of concrete that came flying out of the launchpad area," Mr. Balderas said. The blast, he added, had created a crater that he estimated was around 25 feet deep.
In a statement on Facebook, the city of Port Isabel said that the emergency management division of Cameron County had confirmed the dust "was sand and soil from near the SpaceX launch site that was lofted into the air by the force of liftoff."
On Thursday, the Cameron County judge, Eddie Treviño Jr., ordered the closure of Boca Chica Beach and a section of State Highway 4 until 2 p.m. on Friday "for the purpose of protecting public health and safety during anomaly cleanup efforts."
Ms. Bates, the Port Isabel spokeswoman, said that based on current information, there was no "immediate concern for people's health."
Eric Roesch, an expert in environmental compliance and risk assessment who has been tracking SpaceX's rocket launches, said in an interview that he and others had long warned of the environmental risks to the surrounding region. But without a chemical analysis of the dust and debris, he added, it was difficult to say whether or not they were harmful to human health.
But, Mr. Roesch said, "the presence of that dust kind of indicates to me that the impact modeling was inadequate, because this was not really disclosed as a possible impact."
In June, an environmental assessment by the Federal Aviation Administration concluded that SpaceX's plans for orbital launches would have "no significant impact" on the region along the Gulf Coast.
Mr. Roesch, who runs the environmental policy blog ESG Hound, said he believed the dust and debris came largely from a giant crater formed during the rocket's liftoff. Normally, major launch sites are engineered with a trench or water system that helps to divert the rocket's flame away from the ground and to dampen the impact, he said.
"They didn't do that," he said. "It appears they just went ahead and just launched this thing."
The F.A.A. said in a statement on Friday that Space X's "anomaly response plan" was activated.
In the outlined plan, SpaceX is responsible for evaluating the situation and notifying the proper agencies.
If an event causes debris in the area where the rocket took off, the plan says that the company would need to obtain an emergency special use permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and that access in the area could possibly be restricted.
The F.A.A. said that SpaceX is required to ensure that "any ground safety and flight hazards do not pose unacceptable risk to the public during licensed activities."
SpaceX did not respond to questions about the dust and debris on Thursday evening.
Ms. Almaguer, the Port Isabel resident, said that while Elon Musk's venture had brought jobs to an economically distressed region, the brown muck covering her city was a reminder of the environmental downsides and a sign that things had gotten out of hand.
"The locals here are just being sacrificed," she said.
"He just wanted to get this thing up in the air," Ms. Almaguer said of Mr. Musk. "Everybody else sort of be damned."

Digging Into a Popular Fat-Zapping Procedure: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A New York Times examination found that a popular beauty treatment may be leading to disfigurement for more patients than previously known.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In early 2022, Ethan Hauser, my editor on the Styles desk at The New York Times, approached me with a question that neither of us knew would grow into a yearlong reporting project. It was a few months after the model Linda Evangelista shared publicly that she had been disfigured by a side effect of CoolSculpting, a cosmetic treatment that promises to freeze away fat cells.
The company that manufactures CoolSculpting, Allergan Aesthetics, a unit of the pharmaceutical giant AbbVie, has repeatedly said that the side effect, known as paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, is incredibly rare, occurring in just one in every 3,000 treatments. P.A.H. results in enlarged, hardened masses of fat on the body -- almost the opposite of what CoolSculpting patients are hoping for.
Ethan's question sounded simple: If this side effect was as rare as the company estimated, wasn't it strange a famous supermodel got it? The answer was anything but.
While many publications covered the news about Ms. Evangelista, we wanted to go deeper, digging into the studies that led the Food and Drug Administration to clear the treatment, combing through Securities and Exchange Commission filings and speaking with dozens of doctors and patients. Last week, after more than a year of reporting, we published our examination of CoolSculpting. Our reporting indicates that the risk of P.A.H. to patients may be considerably higher than previously known.
I'll admit that I wasn't quite sure where to start with this project. I was a reporting fellow on the Styles desk, and I didn't have much experience with long-term investigative reporting. But it was an exciting opportunity to step outside my comfort zone -- and to finally put my information science degree to use. (My fluency with numbers would come in handy.)
Shortly after Ethan and I started looking into CoolSculpting, Kirsten Danis, an editor on the Investigations team, approached us to see how she could help. She taught me some of the basic techniques of investigative reporting, including one of my favorites, perhaps borrowed from telemarketing: "smile and dial."
I began by making phone calls, on background, to experts who study the F.D.A. regulatory process. I wanted to get a general understanding of how medical devices are brought into the marketplace.
Then I spent months reading all the documents I could find that were relevant to CoolSculpting, such as earnings reports, lawsuits and medical studies. I was looking for things that might surprise readers. For example, I learned from a 2011 S.E.C. filing that the initial F.D.A. clearance for CoolSculpting was based on a study that involved just 60 patients. Clinical studies for medical devices are often small, so this wasn't too unusual -- but to readers unfamiliar with this world, the size of the study could be interesting.
Another source of information was the lawsuits filed against the manufacturer of CoolSculpting. I learned a lot from reading court transcripts and documents. I also used the F.D.A.'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to find patient, physician and manufacturer reports about P.A.H.
Many of the documents I obtained had redacted parts, and The Times's research team helped me track down the people who had written those correspondences. I had to learn many technical terms and the differences between them: For example, "clearance" and "approval" are two different processes at the F.D.A., with approval being more rigorous. I'd mute my computer notifications, print the documents and go through them line by line with a highlighter.
I interviewed more than a dozen doctors who said the manufacturer's estimate of the risk was lower than what they had observed in their work. I reached out to Allergan for comment, but the company declined to answer most of our questions. (In statements, Allergan maintained that P.A.H. is rare and said it was well documented in the information they provide to patients.)
To humanize the article, I also included the voices and experiences of patients. It's one thing to read about P.A.H.; it's another to see how it upended a person's life or sense of self. Ms. Evangelista, for example, wrote on Instagram that she became a "recluse" as a result of her condition.
But some people feared speaking out about their experiences because they were hoping the company would help pay for corrective surgeries, and those payments were often contingent upon patients' signing confidentiality agreements. One of the women I spoke with, Gina D'Addario, had declined the company's settlement offer. She wanted to share her story, with the hope that it would help others.
Doctors who worked on corrective surgeries connected me with patients, and I found others through Facebook support groups for people with P.A.H. I didn't want to make anyone feel pressured to participate in the article, and I tried my best to make those who came forward feel heard.
For my first big Times examination, I wasn't meeting secretive sources in parking garages late at night or eavesdropping on important conversations on a train. It did involve a lot (and I mean a lot) of reading dense documents, over and over again, and speaking with dozens of people who had seen or experienced P.A.H. firsthand.
Often, the answers I was seeking were hidden in plain sight.

Court to Weigh Officials' Right To Block Critics On Social Sites: [National Desk]

Full text: The justices agreed to hear a pair of cases on what the First Amendment has to say about social media accounts maintained by elected officials.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether elected officials violate the First Amendment when they block people from their social media accounts.
The question has divided the lower courts and had seemed headed to the Supreme Court after the federal appeals court in New York ruled in 2019 that President Donald J. Trump's Twitter account was a public forum from which he was powerless to exclude people based on their viewpoints.
"We conclude that the evidence of the official nature of the account is overwhelming," Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. "We also conclude that once the president has chosen a platform and opened up its interactive space to millions of users and participants, he may not selectively exclude those whose views he disagrees with."
Had the account been private, Judge Parker wrote, Mr. Trump could have blocked whomever he wanted. But since he used the account in his official role as a government official, he was subject to the First Amendment.
After Mr. Trump lost the 2020 election, the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit's ruling as moot.
On Monday, the justices granted review in a pair of cases involving local officials, focusing on whether their use of private social media accounts to discuss public issues amounted to "state action," which is governed by the First Amendment, or private activity, which is not.
One of the cases concerned the Facebook and Twitter accounts of two members of the Poway Unified School District in California, Michelle O'Connor-Ratcliff and T.J. Zane. They used the accounts, created during their campaigns, to communicate with their constituents about activities of the school board, invite them to public meetings, ask for comments on the board's activities and discuss safety issues in the schools.
Two parents, Christopher and Kimberly Garnier, frequently posted lengthy and repetitive critical comments, and the officials eventually blocked them. The parents sued, and lower courts ruled in their favor.
"We have little doubt that social media will continue to play an essential role in hosting public debate and facilitating the free expression that lies at the heart of the First Amendment," Judge Marsha S. Berzon wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. "When state actors enter that virtual world and invoke their government status to create a forum for such expression, the First Amendment enters with them."
The school board officials' petition seeking Supreme Court review in the case, O'Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier, No. 22-324, said their accounts were personal and were created and maintained "without any direction, funding, support or other involvement by the district."
The petition added, "A public official does not engage in state action when blocking users from a social media account where, as here, the account is not operated pursuant to any governmental authority or duty."
The second case, Lindke v. Freed, No. 22-611, concerned a Facebook account maintained by James R. Freed, the city manager of Port Huron, Mich. He used it to comment on a variety of subjects, some personal and some official. Among the latter were descriptions of the city's responses to the coronavirus pandemic.
The posts prompted critical responses from a resident, Kevin Lindke, whom Mr. Freed eventually blocked. Mr. Lindke sued and lost. Judge Amul R. Thapar, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, said Mr. Freed's Facebook account was personal, meaning that the First Amendment had no role to play.
"Freed did not operate his page to fulfill any actual or apparent duty of his office," Judge Thapar wrote." And he did not use his governmental authority to maintain it. Thus, he was acting in his personal capacity -- and there was no state action."
Katie Fallow, a lawyer with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had sued Mr. Trump, said in a statement that the question the justices agreed to decide had only become more pressing.
"With more and more public officials using social media to communicate with their constituents about official business," she said, "public officials' social media accounts are playing the role that have historically been played by city council meetings, school board meetings and other offline public forums."

Bed Bath & Beyond Shoppers Rush to Use All Those Coupons

NEW YORK — For many shoppers, Bed Bath & Beyond’s bankruptcy filing Sunday was a call to action.
Customers — both loyal and lapsed — received an email from the home-goods retailer around 8 a.m. telling them that the company had decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its 360 Bed Bath & Beyond stores would soon be closing, as would its 120 Buy Buy Baby locations.
Shoppers have until Wednesday to use their coupons. Around the country, they rounded up the ubiquitous blue slips of paper offering 20% off, stuffed them in pouches and plastic bags, and made their way to the nearest Bed Bath & Beyond.
At a store in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood on Monday, Sylvia Ward, a self-described Bed Bath & Beyond aficionado from the Bronx, said news of the closings had “absolutely devastated” her. Then she learned she had only a few days to use coupons.
“I had to run down here today!” she said.
Ward said she had brought about seven coupons to use toward items including two Simplehuman soap dispensers, kitchen timers and about 14 packets of Clorox wipes, estimating that she saved $30.
Bed Bath & Beyond, which opened in 1971, held unique cultural cachet among big-box retailers. It served as a recurring storyline on Comedy Central’s “Broad City”; a plot device for Adam Sandler’s 2006 movie, “Click”; and a talking point for celebrities showcasing their relatability on late-night shows. Facebook groups were formed for people to trade the retailer’s coupons.
Over the decades, those coupons reliably showed up in millions of mailboxes — and, more recently, email inboxes — offering a discount on home goods such as kitchen gadgets, fluffy pillows and wooden hangers. People gave them as gifts to new homeowners and college students, kept them in kitchen junk drawers and car glove compartments. At least one customer used them as a calling card, writing their phone number on the back of the coupons and handing them to fellow patrons deemed attractive.
A steady flow of customers moved through the Bed Bath & Beyond store in Chelsea on Sunday. People milled around looking at towel heaters and large pillows. While some asked employees in blue aprons where they could find certain products, they also took the time to ask how the workers were feeling about the location’s closing.
Bobbi Kimberly was one of those customers. The chain’s bankruptcy news was the motivation she needed to finally use a coupon she had been holding on to and to see the store again before it shut down.
“It’s like you’re losing a buddy, because it’s something that’s dependable,” said Kimberly, a yoga instructor. She said she would miss roaming the stores, which kept her active and social.
After hearing about the bankruptcy, loyal Bed Bath & Beyond customers took to social media. The company’s name became a trending topic on Twitter. People shared odes to the retailer, posted TikTok videos of themselves walking into stores, and alerted their friends and families to the chain’s closing through their Facebook statuses. Reddit threads about Bed Bath & Beyond, which became a “meme stock” favorite during the pandemic, lit up with chatter about its downfall.
Some shoppers handed unused coupons to other customers in stores and texted friends and family, encouraging them to use theirs before it was too late.
The outpouring of support came too late for Bed Bath & Beyond. Despite a boost early in the pandemic, when quarantined Americans bought items to spruce up their homes, sales soon started to fall precipitously. The retailer’s supply chain was strained, operational costs rose and vendors held back on shipping inventory when they grew nervous about being paid on time.
In recent months, Bed Bath & Beyond store shoppers were met with sparsely stocked shelves. The chain had been slashing hundreds of jobs and closing stores to try to survive. In its bankruptcy filing, it said the “past 12 months have undoubtedly been the most difficult and turbulent in Bed Bath & Beyond’s storied history.”
Jean Massaro was in a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Yonkers on Monday morning with her coupons in tow. She said she didn’t shop online and had ignored the discounts the retailer emailed to her in favor of the tangible ones she had, some collected from People magazine.
“I really, really love this store,” Massaro said. “I’m upset, and so are a lot of other people.”
But it has been years since Bed Bath & Beyond was at its peak. In 2020, it said it would pull back on sending shoppers coupons after investors questioned if they hurt the company’s margins. Shoppers recoiled, with the decision seeming like one in a growing list of ways that the chain was taking away the things that customers loved most about their shopping experience.
“I used to come here a lot,” said David Salidor, who swung by a location in Manhattan with some coupons Monday. “It’s because they have stuff that a lot of stores don’t have.”
He added: “I’m sorry to see it go. But it’s strange times, strange times.”
Some store visitors Monday were disappointed that they didn’t see eye-popping sales. The deep discounts characteristic of liquidation sales won’t start until Wednesday — once Bed Bath & Beyond stops accepting coupons. The company said it expected that customers would be able to use gift cards until May 8.
For shoppers who have baby and wedding registries, the company said it would work with an alternative platform to transfer their data. Some Bed Bath & Beyond customers said they were likely to go to retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Kohl’s and Amazon to fill the void.
Thea Derecola, a hairstylist and an educator in Chelsea, took a pouch of coupons to the store and used them to buy two pillows for 20% off. Without the coupons, she said, she thought the pillows would have cost less on Amazon.
Her door attendant used to save Bed Bath & Beyond coupons for her, said Derecola, a longtime shopper who used to work across the street and visit the store weekly.
Daniel Duque, a retired teacher in Brooklyn Heights, said he hoped this wasn’t really the end of Bed Bath & Beyond, which expects all of its locations to be closed by June 30.
“I’m still waiting for a miracle,” he said. For years, he had shopped in the store, but stopped going as much after moving to Brooklyn.
A feeling of nostalgia is common when a retailer goes out of business. It’s similar to the response that shoppers had when Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy, said Joanie Demer, co-founder of Krazy Coupon Lady, an online community that shares discounting tips and deals.
“There’s all this altruism for the brand all of a sudden,” Demer said. “It’s like, OK, but you weren’t shopping there. You’ve been shopping on Amazon like the rest of us.”
Chelsea Gordon, an Atlanta entrepreneur who owns the Cooking Code, didn’t learn about Bed Bath & Beyond’s bankruptcy until Sunday evening. She had been spending the day prepping meals with kitchen gadgets, such as her juicer, that she had bought from the retailer.
She’s a frequent shopper. Last year, she used Bed Bath & Beyond for her house registry and Buy Buy Baby to register gifts for her baby shower.
When learning she had only a few days to use her coupons, Gordon made a plan to head to her nearby store Monday morning right after her Pilates class. She said she also wanted to make sure her mother had heard the news since they often texted about Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.
“That coupon, it’s going to be one less thing to talk about,” Gordon said with a sigh.

Full text: A reader eager to be freed from $ 100,000 worth of co-signer responsibilities seeks a judgment on her daughter's behavior.
Five years ago, my 17-year-old daughter couldn't secure a loan to study art and live on campus at our in-state public university. She needed me to co-sign her loans, which I did reluctantly. (I told her they were her responsibility, though.) She graduated with a degree in fine art and $ 100,000 in debt. She now works at a fast-casual restaurant for $ 18 an hour. During this time, I divorced my husband of 25 years and received a small cash settlement. I want to buy a home, but my credit score is so badly affected by my daughter's debt that I can't get a mortgage. A broker suggested that my daughter submit an application to release me from her loans. But she flatly refused! She thinks it may prevent her from getting a car loan. Do you agree she is showing poor character?
MOTHER
I sympathize with you (and with anyone trying to finance higher education), but I won't bash your daughter. You were an adult and she was a child when you co-signed large loans she was unlikely to be able to repay with income from a fine arts degree. You may have thought you were being supportive, but you (and her father) missed a big opportunity to help her make more sensible plans for her education.
What's more, the release you now want her to sign is worth little as a practical matter. What prudent lender is going to release you -- the party with money -- and look solely to a low-wage worker for repayment of $ 100,000? You are entitled to your feelings about your daughter's automotive dreams, but you co-signed those loans.
If I were you, I would hire a good financial adviser. I don't know why you didn't include this debt in your divorce settlement with your ex-husband (it was incurred during your marriage). But you need a comprehensive financial plan now. And stop dragging your daughter!
Slighted by a Ring Requirement
My boyfriend and I are in our mid-20s. We've been dating for five years and live together. He comes from a large family with more than 25 first cousins. They're great, but they established a "no plus one" policy for weddings unless invitees are married or engaged. I missed one wedding already, and another is looming. I feel slighted! I know I have no right to attend, but this policy seems hurtful to those who have opted out of marriage. My boyfriend insists it's not his place to intervene. He goes without me and says an invitation you have to beg for is not worth having. Should I bite my tongue?
GIRLFRIEND
The cruelty of guest lists is that some people have to be left off. Weddings are expensive, and venues have limited space. (And have you really "opted out of marriage" in your mid-20s, or have you simply not crossed that bridge yet?) I'm sorry you feel slighted. Bite your tongue for now, though -- unless it's to dress down your boyfriend for being a bit blasé about going to parties without you.
Absorbing a $ 400 Friendship Fee
For some time, I've treated a dear friend to a theater subscription for $ 400 a season. I started paying because she was under financial stress caring for an invalid parent and her husband was out of work. But her dad passed away, and her husband found a job. She should be able to pay for her own tickets if she made them a priority. Should I broach the subject? I don't want her to feel bad, and I enjoy sharing the experience with her.
FRIEND
I understand wanting to be even-steven with your friend. It's natural. I have a few pesky questions for you, though: Could your friend be in the hole still, financially, from paying for her father's medical care or from her husband's unemployment? And how meaningful is this $ 400 to you?
There's nothing wrong, of course, with asking your friend if she's ready to pony up for her subscription. But the worst outcome here, in my view, is if the $ 400 is relatively minor to you -- but not to your friend -- and you lose a valued theater buddy on principle. Think it over before you ask.
A Neighbor Eager to Watch Paint Dry
My husband and I own a second home at the beach. We rebuilt ours, but most of the houses in the neighborhood are modest. We were happy when our neighbor hired painters last year. (The paint was peeling badly, and the shingles were droopy.) The odd thing: They painted the whole house except the side that faces us! When my husband asked our neighbor when she planned to finish the job, she said she ran out of money. Am I wrong to be annoyed? It can't cost that much to paint one side of a house.
NEIGHBOR
Here's the thing about finite resources (such as money): When they're gone, they're gone. If your neighbor paid the painters an hourly rate, it's possible she spent her budget. And if she's out of cash, it doesn't matter how little it costs to paint one side of a house. She doesn't have it! So, if that unpainted side bothers you enough, offer to help her finish the job. Otherwise, learn to live with it, I'm afraid.

The Spilled Beer Was Nothing to Cry About: [Society Desk]

Full text: Stephanie Turner and Paul Kremer, both lawyers, quickly bonded over their shared profession and interest in punk music. So when he accidentally spilled a drink on her on their first date, she shrugged it off.
At their first meeting, Paul Justin Kremer was feeling a bit nervous in front of Stephanie Blair Turner. They were having happy hour drinks at the now-closed Beer Bar in Midtown in November 2013. Mr. Kremer had seen Ms. Turner's picture on Facebook and had requested that a mutual friend make an introduction.
Mr. Kremer, a lawyer, had honed his public speaking and gesticulating in the courtroom. But, that evening, his nerves got the best of him and he knocked over his drink on the table. Beer spilled all over Ms. Turner. He apologized, but she was unfazed. "I was having a good time, so I tried to forget about the wet dress and carry on," she said.
The two forged ahead and learned that beyond work -- Ms. Turner is also a lawyer -- they shared an interest in some niche musical subgenres: pop punk, New Jersey pogo punk, country punk, folk punk and post-hardcore. Such musical tastes, they said, are rare in their circles. "A lot of lawyers I encounter are surprised to hear how often I find myself in mosh pits," Mr. Kremer said.
After the happy hour drinks, Mr. Kremer, now 37, offered to walk Ms. Turner, now 35, toward her subway stop, but they ended up at another bar called Park Avenue Tavern a few blocks away. "It became a late night," Ms. Turner said.
While neither of them had been looking for something serious, their relationship status became official after a Cory Branan concert they attended at the Mercury Lounge that winter. At the show, Mr. Kremer offered to pay the musician back for albums he illegally downloaded years earlier, but Mr. Branan (whose music they categorized as revival punk) wouldn't hear of it. Instead, Mr. Branan took their picture and tweeted about them, calling them a "lovely couple."
When Mr. Kremer saw it the next day, he thought, "Oh, I guess we're a couple."

Another factor solidified their connection over Thanksgiving weekend in 2015: a scrawny black cat. Ms. Turner had moved into Mr. Kremer's apartment in Stuyvesant Town that July, and she had been pining for a cat. When Mr. Kremer was in his parents' home in Smithtown, N.Y., for the holiday, he saw the cat wandering in the woods outside. He called Ms. Turner, who was at her family's home in Rockaway, N.J. She told him not to move and drove to meet him.
"We lured him out with leftover Thanksgiving turkey," Mr. Kremer said. After no one responded to their lost cat posters, they brought the cat home and named him Socrates.
"It really affected how we interact with the world and think about the environment and animals," Mr. Kremer said. The couple also decided to embrace veganism.
Ms. Turner has a bachelor's degree in English from Barnard College and a law degree from Yale. She is a lawyer and the senior pro bono manager at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Manhattan. Mr. Kremer has a bachelor's degree in economics and political science from Loyola University Maryland and a law degree from Harvard. Mr. Kremer works in the Manhattan office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which is based in Los Angeles.
When the couple thought about their future, they didn't picture an elaborate wedding. Over the course of their relationship, they have attended more than 30 weddings together. Ms. Turner also officiated one, while Mr. Kremer officiated four.
"It seemed like a whole lot of work," Ms. Turner said.
Then Socrates grew sick and, in December 2022, they had to put him down. Losing their cat put their relationship into perspective.
"After going through that, we felt like we wanted to be there to support each other through all the best and worst parts of life," Mr. Kremer said.
The couple were married at the city clerk's office in Manhattan on April 3 by Yan Fang Chen, a clerical associate, with just their photographer as a witness. Ms. Turner wore her grandmother's cat silhouette pin, and Mr. Kremer wore a pocket square that an artisan from Etsy had embroidered with a picture of Socrates.
Afterward, the couple met about 30 friends and relatives at the Winslow, a bar in the East Village. A few out-of-town friends surprised them by flying in for the celebration.
Mr. Kremer lifted his glass and thanked those who had gathered to help the couple mark the occasion.
"The toast was champagne," he said, "and not a drop was spilled."

Ex-Santos Aide Also Traveled A Murky Path: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nancy Marks, Mr. Santos's former campaign treasurer, has her own history of questionable dealings that have aroused interest from federal investigators.
When George Santos was a political neophyte struggling to launch his first bid for Congress in the suburbs of New York City, he made a consequential early hire.
He brought on Nancy Marks, a fixture in Long Island Republican circles, to serve as campaign treasurer. Over the next three years, she used her deep ties to local Republicans and her stable of businesses to become indispensable to the campaign and to Mr. Santos.
She helped him meet donors and signed off on nearly every campaign invoice and financial filing. In May 2021, records show, the two even briefly went into business together as political consultants.
Now, as federal and local prosecutors examine the web of deceit Mr. Santos spun on his way to winning a closely contested House seat last November, they appear to be focused on a trail of financial dealings that suggests possible campaign finance violations or outright fraud. Campaign filings listed donations that exceeded the legal limit, hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained spending and a strange string of expenses for $ 199.99 -- just pennies below the threshold beyond which receipts are required.
No one may be more central to that inquiry than Ms. Marks, who was, until now, an unheralded cog in New York politics, toiling in her converted garage on Long Island's South Shore as a campaign bookkeeper to dozens of congressmen, judges and political action committees.
Battling for self-preservation, Mr. Santos has sought to blame Ms. Marks for his financial troubles, telling a conservative news outlet that "the former fiduciary went rogue." Ms. Marks, in turn, has told at least two associates in recent months that she, like others, was duped by Mr. Santos. In late January, amid growing interest from the Federal Election Commission about financial irregularities, she resigned.
It will be up to investigators to determine whether Ms. Marks, 57, participated in any impropriety. But a review by The New York Times -- including dozens of interviews and scrutiny of hundreds of pages of legal and campaign records -- shows that even as her stature grew over two decades, Ms. Marks waded into ethically and legally murky territory.
A relentless entrepreneur, Ms. Marks worked her way into Republican favor, expanding her business with big-name clients like the former congressman Lee Zeldin. She became a civic leader, serving on the board of the local library and, in January, received honors from a local charity.
But while the kind of egregious irregularities in Mr. Santos's reports do not appear in other campaigns she worked on, The Times found that Ms. Marks's accounting and business practices repeatedly drew suspicion. Former clients have taken her to court, saying she overpaid herself or failed to pay bills, as have a long line of creditors. Her close business ties with a felon alienated some onetime allies.
And in at least two previously unreported instances, her actions have attracted scrutiny from the U.S. attorney's office for New York's Eastern District, according to several people with direct knowledge of the inquiries. In one, prosecutors investigated allegations that Ms. Marks attempted to help broker the sale of a ballot line; in another, authorities scrutinized whether she had embezzled money from clients. She was never charged.
Ms. Marks did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Her lawyer, Ray Perini, a former candidate for district attorney who used Ms. Marks as his treasurer during his campaign, did not answer a detailed list of questions about her record, including whether she was cooperating with the investigations into Mr. Santos.
The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Santos, who said it would be "inappropriate" to do so given ongoing investigations.
Prosecutors are almost certainly more interested in Mr. Santos, who recently announced his intention to seek re-election in 2024. But campaign finance experts said that Ms. Marks could face her own criminal charges if she willfully misled the F.E.C. or covered up improper behavior.
"There are very fundamental errors that no accountant of her experience would make," said Brett G. Kappel, an elections lawyer who advises both political parties. "If she submitted these knowing they contained false information, there are going to be consequences."
A one-stop shop for candidates
Political campaigns are legally required to have a treasurer to oversee records of how money is raised and spent for state and federal authorities. The administrative role often falls to a family member or friend, especially for first-time candidates.
Ms. Marks realized years ago that there was a niche for someone like her to professionalize the position. State records show she does not have a C.P.A. license, but she taught herself election law and used connections forged as a low-level Suffolk County employee and political volunteer to become a one-stop shop for candidates' needs.
She formed businesses like GMG Print and Marketing Resources and Campaigns Unlimited to handle everything from lawn signs and palm cards to fund-raising and bookkeeping. They all operated under her home address in Shirley, N.Y., where a statue of the Virgin Mary stood watch.
In an industry dominated by slick consultants, some clients relished the unvarnished, mom-and-pop quality of her business. Visitors described middle-aged workers running big piles of checks through auto scanners as they smoked cigarettes and drank Diet Cokes.
"She was lovely. Easy to work with. Knew what she was doing," said David Catalfamo, a veteran Republican consultant who worked with Ms. Marks on Vito Fossella's 2021 campaign for Staten Island borough president. "In the world of crazies in politics, she was normal."
But Ms. Marks's eagerness to assume greater responsibility rankled other political operatives, who said she tried to take on work she had not been hired or asked to do. Others said she appeared in recent years to have taken on more accounts than she could handle, leading to sloppy or rushed work.
By then, she had become the go-to treasurer in Suffolk County for the right. Among scores of clients were Mr. Zeldin, who ran for governor in 2022; John Flanagan, a state senator and former majority leader; and conservative political action committees like God, Guns, Life; Veterans for MAGA; and the 1776 Project, which works to elect school board members who oppose teaching children about the history of race.
Altogether, Ms. Marks's businesses took in at least $ 3.3 million in political spending between 2009 and 2022, city, state and federal records show.
Roughly 10 percent of that came from one candidate, John Cummings, a Republican who raised $ 11 million in his unsuccessful 2020 campaign to unseat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Cummings paid Campaigns Unlimited more than $ 90,000 for accounting, compliance, thank you notes and special projects. He spent another $ 250,000 on Ms. Marks's printing and consulting operations, for a total of $ 340,000 -- just over half coming after he lost.
Mr. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Santos was also a lucrative account. Between his campaign, and associated PACs and committees, he paid Ms. Marks and her companies nearly $ 240,000, including reimbursements.
Far from becoming rich, though, Ms. Marks repeatedly found herself in debt.
Unpaid credit card bills led to a spate of judgments, and unpaid taxes threatened the handful of modest homes her family bought near the Canadian border. In 2014, Ms. Marks's husband, Peter, was diagnosed with cancer, according to a GoFundMe page to support the family. More unpaid bills piled up.
In 2017, Chase Bank moved to foreclose on the Shirley home. Mr. Marks, a former corrections officer, died in 2019. The foreclosure dispute is ongoing.
'Nancy is a hustler'
Even as her business grew, Ms. Marks increasingly gave other Republicans reasons to question her judgment.
Many of the cases trace back to Fred Towle Jr., a former Suffolk County legislator for whom Ms. Marks worked as an aide and campaign treasurer. Mr. Towle pleaded guilty in 2003 to political corruption charges. Ms. Marks cooperated with the investigation, according to a report in Newsday, and was never charged. When other Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Towle after he got out of jail, though, she kept working with him.
Their association came under scrutiny after a meeting they held with Tara Scully, a Republican judicial candidate in Suffolk County in the fall of 2015. At the time, Ms. Scully was looking for support from the local Conservative Party, which would come with a coveted ballot line that could improve her chances of winning.
At the meeting, details of which were first reported by Newsday in 2016, Mr. Towle said he could use his relationship with the Conservative Party chairman to help Ms. Scully secure the endorsement if she paid him a large consulting fee. He also suggested she donate $ 2,000 to the Conservative Party. As an added layer of caution, the pair offered to route the payment through Ms. Marks's Campaigns Unlimited.
The offer caught the attention of local and federal prosecutors, who at the time were preparing to put the Conservative Party chairman on trial on charges of defrauding taxpayers. Ms. Scully's team told them they believed Mr. Towle and Ms. Marks had dangled a blatant -- and corrupt -- quid pro quo. The two denied that interpretation.
Subpoenas were issued. Witnesses surreptitiously recorded each other. But prosecutors concluded they could not clearly establish bribery or extortion, according to four people familiar with the case who described it on the condition of anonymity. Prosecutors declined to bring charges.
Mr. Towle later entered a guilty plea for unrelated tax charges. His lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said this week that the matter involving Ms. Scully had been "thoroughly investigated by the U.S. attorney's office, and they declined to bring charges."
Ms. Marks's work left other clients feeling uneasy.
Peter Zinno turned to Ms. Marks for help with his run for a House seat on Long Island in 2010. He recalled her offering to charge him half of her usual rate because, he said, "She liked me, apparently."
But after he failed to win the Republican nomination, he discovered that during his campaign, Ms. Marks had doubled the monthly rate paid to her company without notice. Some months she appeared to bill him twice.
Mr. Zinno sued Ms. Marks in 2013 for $ 3,800, but lost his case when a judge said he lacked sufficient evidence, in part because he had waited too long to lodge his claim.
"Nancy is a hustler," Mr. Zinno said in an interview. "And I got taken."
Mr. Zinno's experience appears similar to conduct that prompted a second pass at Ms. Marks's business by federal investigators.
In that inquiry, investigators came to suspect that Ms. Marks might have been playing tricks with the books she kept. They confronted at least one of her clients with evidence that she used her position as treasurer to overpay herself, according to the client, who insisted on anonymity, and another official familiar with the matter.
It is unclear what prompted the outreach or if it was connected to a broader inquiry. The inquiry again ended without charges.
'Her George'
Ms. Marks doted on many of her clients -- offering encouragement regardless of how bad the polls looked. But in recent years, George Santos stood apart.
"She thought of George as her favorite client," said Michael Rendino, the Bronx Republican Party chairman, who briefly hired Ms. Marks for his own race. "She had, I thought, a motherly love for him. That was 'her George."'
The relationship was mutually beneficial. Ms. Marks offered Mr. Santos decades of experience and relationships with key Republicans. Mr. Santos offered Ms. Marks a chance to expand her business, inviting her to join staff phone calls and accompany him on fund-raising trips out of state.
All the while, she filed reports with suspicious patterns of spending. There were payments to cleaning companies described as "rent"; $ 365,399.08 in spending that the campaign never explained; and nearly $ 800,000 in loans he made to his campaign over the years that raised questions about the source of his income.
And then there were the $ 199.99 payments to "anonymous" -- totaling nearly $ 250,000 at one point -- that have drawn the scrutiny of the F.E.C.
Mr. Santos is not the only client whose filings have drawn scrutiny. In late March, Mr. Zeldin amended years-old reports to clear up 21 payments of $ 199.99 to unnamed recipients during his 2020 House campaign. A review of his congressional filings shows that the Zeldin campaign also reported $ 110,000 in nonitemized spending that year, more than any sitting New York House member, apart from Mr. Santos.
Earlier this month, the F.E.C. wrote to Ms. Marks ordering Mr. Zeldin to refund $ 129,000 in contributions he collected improperly in 2021 and 2022 and then transferred to his campaign for governor.
"It shows a certain level of disregard for the rules," said Saurav Ghosh, a former F.E.C. enforcement lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center.
The Zeldin campaign reviewed its filings in response to a request from The Times and found no issues, the former campaign manager, Eric Amidon, said. He added that he believed the F.E.C. to be mistaken about the contributions, but said that they would be refunded out of an abundance of caution.
The degree to which Ms. Marks was aware of Mr. Santos's numerous biographical deceptions is not clear. But Florida corporate records show she went into business with him and some of his colleagues from Harbor City Capitol, a Florida-based investment company, just weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission had shut the company down over concerns it operated as a Ponzi scheme.
In May 2021, Red Strategies USA was born.
Like Ms. Marks's Campaigns Unlimited, the venture promised candidates convenience: one place to produce and place ads, manage social media and provide general political consulting.
Jordan Hafizi, a first-time candidate, turned to Red Strategies for help on a 2021 City Council race, paying the firm $ 22,450 to produce and promote a campaign video on social media, according to public campaign filings and a contract agreement reviewed by The Times.
But a review of the repository of ads on Meta, the company that owns Facebook, as well as a review by the ad tracking firm AdImpact, shows that only four Facebook ads were purchased on Mr. Hafizi's behalf, and those were removed because they did not include a required disclaimer. The placements cost $ 3,800, though Mr. Hafizi paid Red Strategies $ 12,000, according to a person with direct knowledge of the arrangement.
Red Strategies was not the only company Mr. Hafizi patronized that was tied to Ms. Marks, who was also his treasurer. All told, Mr. Hafizi, who failed to garner the nomination in his City Council race, spent nearly $ 50,000 with Ms. Marks's companies -- roughly 60 percent of his campaign's total spending, New York City campaign finance records show. He declined to comment.
As for Red Strategies, the company barely got off the ground: It handled just a few accounts, and was dissolved by the State of Florida in September 2022 for failing to file an annual report. By then, Ms. Marks and Mr. Santos were just a few weeks from an unlikely upset victory that would alter the course of their careers.

Slight Gains in Markets After Quiet Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks capped a listless day of trading Friday with slight gains for the major stock indexes, closing out a quiet week on Wall Street highlighted by a batch of mostly mixed corporate earnings reports.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite all gained 0.1 percent after drifting between small gains and losses for most of the day. The indexes each posted a slight loss for the week.
Health care companies and a range of consumer product makers gained ground, tempering losses in banks, technology stocks and elsewhere. Truist Financial and KeyCorp, two of the larger regional banks, were among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500. Truist fell 6 percent and KeyCorp ended 3.7 percent lower.
Bond yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates and other loans, rose to 3.56 percent from 3.54 percent late Thursday.
Trading was muted as investors focused on the latest corporate earnings reports and forecasts in a bid to get a better sense of how companies are handling high inflation, a slowing economy and fears about a recession.
"You have a market that's in waiting mode," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. "It's waiting for a sense of what we're going to hear from companies."
Investors reviewed a handful of earnings reports Friday. Hospital operator HCA Healthcare rose 3.9 percent after the company topped estimates for the first quarter and raised its full-year profit forecast. Procter & Gamble, the maker of Charmin toilet paper and other popular consumer products, rose 3.5 percent after beating estimates thanks to price increases.
Information technology services company PC Connection fell 4.9 percent after giving investors a disappointing financial update. Regional bank Regions Financial fell 2.8 percent after reporting discouraging earnings.
Companies have so far been beating Wall Street forecasts this earnings period. Analysts had forecast this would mark the sharpest drop in S&P 500 earnings per share since the pandemic stunned the economy in 2020. Analysts polled by FactSet expect profits to contract by 6.3 percent for companies in the S&P 500.
Several big companies are on deck to report earnings next week, giving investors another heavy few days of corporate updates. Coca-Cola reports its latest results on Monday, followed by McDonald's and Alphabet on Tuesday.
Boeing and Facebook's parent, Meta Platforms, will report results on Wednesday. Investors will get more details on the health of the airline industry when American Airlines and Southwest Airlines report financial results on Thursday, along with internet retail giant Amazon.
The busy week of earnings reports could help provide more direction for investors as recession worries linger, Dr. Krosby said.
"There's a tug of war between what the economic data is saying and the message from equity markets," she said.
The latest earnings come as investors worry about the potential for a recession amid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. The central bank aggressively raised interest rates through 2022 and into 2023. The rate hikes have weighed on economic growth and while inflation has eased it remains high and is still squeezing consumers.
The Fed will meet again in early May and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by another quarter point. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will take a break from raising interest rates after that meeting.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.17 percent from 4.16 percent late Thursday.
Wall Street is anticipating more economic data next week that could provide greater insight into inflation's impact and the economy's path. The reports will included consumer confidence for April, first-quarter gross domestic product and another government update on prices and inflation.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 3.73 points to 4,133.52. The Dow added 22.34 points to close at 33,808.96. The Nasdaq rose 12.90 points to 12,072.46. Decliners held a slight edge over gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Markets in Europe also ended with small gains Friday, while exchanges in Asia declined overnight.

Otis Redding III, 59, Who Followed His Father Into Music: [Biography]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/otis-redding-iii-59-who-followed-his-father-into/docview/2804209708/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was grateful for Otis Redding's enduring legacy, he said, even if it overshadowed his efforts to make music of his own.
Otis Redding III, the son and namesake of the celebrated 1960s soul singer, who made a name for himself as a singer and guitarist, died on Tuesday in Macon, Ga. He was 59.
The cause was cancer, his sister, Karla Redding-Andrews, said in a statement posted on the Facebook page of the Otis Redding Foundation, the family's charity.
Mr. Redding was just 3 years old when his father died, along with several members of his band, in a plane crash on Dec. 10, 1967, outside Madison, Wis. Otis Redding III and his brother, Dexter, along with a cousin, Mark Lockett, went on to form the funk band the Reddings, which recorded six albums in the 1980s. Otis was a guitarist with the group; Dexter, who survives him, played bass and handled the vocals; and Mr. Lockett played keyboards.
The band had some success on the Billboard charts: "Remote Control" reached No. 6 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 89 on the Hot 100 in 1980. The group's final album, called simply "The Reddings," which contained the hit single "Call the Law," reached No. 88 on the Billboard album chart in 1988.
The Redding brothers never came close to matching their father's success, but Otis Redding III nonetheless continued performing. When the soul singer Eddie Floyd hired him as guitarist for a European tour, Mr. Redding became comfortable singing "(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay" and other songs made famous by his father, he told WCSH-TV in Portland, Maine, in 2018.
"He said, 'You can play guitar with me, but you're going to have to sing a few of your dad's songs,"' Mr. Redding recalled Mr. Floyd saying. "I was like, 'Huh? I don't sing,' you know. And he was like, 'Well, you're going to sing "Dock of the Bay" with me tonight."' He continued to perform his father's songs live.
He said he was grateful for his father's enduring legacy even if it overshadowed his own music-making efforts.
"I go ahead and do what people want, and I live with it," he said, adding, "I don't put myself mentally under any pressure to go begging for record deals."
Otis Redding III was born on Dec. 17, 1963, in Macon. His mother was Zelma Atwood.
In later years he worked with his family's foundation to organize summer camps that teach children to play music. He also served as board president of the local chapter of Meals on Wheels.
In addition to his sister Ms. Redding-Andrews and his brother, Mr. Redding's survivors include another sister, Demetria Redding.

A Former Aide to Santos Had Also Traveled a Murky Path

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When George Santos was a political neophyte struggling to launch his first bid for Congress in the suburbs of New York City, he made a consequential early hire.
He brought on Nancy Marks, a fixture in Long Island Republican circles, to serve as campaign treasurer. Over the next three years, she used her deep ties to local Republicans and her stable of businesses to become indispensable to the campaign and to Santos.
She helped him meet donors and signed off on nearly every campaign invoice and financial filing. In May 2021, records show, the two even briefly went into business together as political consultants.
Now, as federal and local prosecutors examine the web of deceit Santos spun on his way to winning a closely contested House seat last November, they appear to be focused on a trail of financial dealings that suggests possible campaign finance violations or outright fraud. Campaign filings listed donations that exceeded the legal limit, hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexplained spending and a strange string of expenses for $199.99 — just pennies below the threshold beyond which receipts are required.
No one may be more central to that inquiry than Marks, who was, until now, an unheralded cog in New York politics, toiling in her converted garage on Long Island’s South Shore as a campaign bookkeeper to dozens of congressmen, judges and political action committees.
Battling for self-preservation, Santos has sought to blame Marks for his financial troubles, telling a conservative news outlet that “the former fiduciary went rogue.” Marks, in turn, has told at least two associates in recent months that she, like others, was duped by Santos. In late January, amid growing interest from the Federal Election Commission about financial irregularities, she resigned.
It will be up to investigators to determine whether Marks, 57, participated in any impropriety. But a review by The New York Times — including dozens of interviews and scrutiny of hundreds of pages of legal and campaign records — shows that even as her stature grew over two decades, Marks waded into ethically and legally murky territory.
A relentless entrepreneur, Marks worked her way into Republican favor, expanding her business with big-name clients like former Rep. Lee Zeldin. She became a civic leader, serving on the board of the local library and, in January, received honors from a local charity.
But while the kind of egregious irregularities in Santos’ reports do not appear in other campaigns she worked on, the Times found that Marks’ accounting and business practices repeatedly drew suspicion. Former clients have taken her to court, saying she overpaid herself or failed to pay bills, as have a long line of creditors. Her close business ties with a felon alienated some one-time allies.
And in at least two previously unreported instances, her actions have attracted scrutiny from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New York’s Eastern District, according to several people with direct knowledge of the inquiries. In one, prosecutors investigated allegations that Marks attempted to help broker the sale of a ballot line; in another, authorities scrutinized whether she had embezzled money from clients. She was never charged.
Marks did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment. Her lawyer, Ray Perini, a former candidate for district attorney who used Marks as his treasurer during his campaign, did not answer a detailed list of questions about her record, including whether she was cooperating with the investigations into Santos.
The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Santos, who said it would be “inappropriate” to do so given ongoing investigations.
Prosecutors are almost certainly more interested in Santos, who recently announced his intention to seek reelection in 2024. But campaign finance experts said that Marks could face her own criminal charges if she willfully misled the FEC or covered up improper behavior.
“There are very fundamental errors that no accountant of her experience would make,” said Brett G. Kappel, an elections lawyer who advises both political parties. “If she submitted these knowing they contained false information, there are going to be consequences.”
A one-stop shop for candidates
Political campaigns are legally required to have a treasurer to oversee records of how money is raised and spent for state and federal authorities. The administrative role often falls to a family member or friend, especially for first-time candidates.
Marks realized years ago that there was a niche for someone like her to professionalize the position. State records show she does not have a CPA license, but she taught herself election law and used connections forged as a low-level Suffolk County employee and political volunteer to become a one-stop shop for candidates’ needs.
She formed businesses like GMG Print and Marketing Resources and Campaigns Unlimited to handle everything from lawn signs and palm cards to fundraising and bookkeeping. They all operated under her home address in Shirley, New York, where a statue of the Virgin Mary stood watch.
In an industry dominated by slick consultants, some clients relished the unvarnished, mom-and-pop quality of her business. Visitors described middle-aged workers running big piles of checks through auto scanners as they smoked cigarettes and drank Diet Cokes.
“She was lovely. Easy to work with. Knew what she was doing,” said David Catalfamo, a veteran Republican consultant who worked with Marks on Vito Fossella’s 2021 campaign for Staten Island borough president. “In the world of crazies in politics, she was normal.”
But Marks’ eagerness to assume greater responsibility rankled other political operatives, who said she tried to take on work she had not been hired or asked to do. Others said she appeared in recent years to have taken on more accounts than she could handle, leading to sloppy or rushed work.
By then, she had become the go-to treasurer in Suffolk County for the right. Among scores of clients were Zeldin, who ran for governor in 2022; John Flanagan, a state senator and former majority leader; and conservative political action committees like God, Guns, Life; Veterans for MAGA; and the 1776 Project, which works to elect school board members who oppose teaching children about the history of race.
Altogether, Marks’ businesses took in at least $3.3 million in political spending between 2009 and 2022, city, state and federal records show.
Roughly 10% of that came from one candidate, John Cummings, a Republican who raised $11 million in his unsuccessful 2020 campaign to unseat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cummings paid Campaigns Unlimited more than $90,000 for accounting, compliance, thank-you notes and special projects. He spent another $250,000 on Marks’ printing and consulting operations, for a total of $340,000 — just over half coming after he lost.
Cummings did not respond to a request for comment.
Santos was also a lucrative account. Between his campaign, and associated PACs and committees, he paid Marks and her companies nearly $240,000, including reimbursements.
Far from becoming rich, though, Marks repeatedly found herself in debt.
Unpaid credit card bills led to a spate of judgments, and unpaid taxes threatened the handful of modest homes her family bought near the Canadian border. In 2014, Marks’ husband, Peter, was diagnosed with cancer, according to a GoFundMe page to support the family. More unpaid bills piled up.
In 2017, Chase Bank moved to foreclose on the Shirley home. Marks, a former corrections officer, died in 2019. The foreclosure dispute is ongoing.
‘Nancy is a hustler’
Even as her business grew, Marks increasingly gave other Republicans reasons to question her judgment.
Many of the cases trace back to Fred Towle Jr., a former Suffolk County legislator for whom Marks worked as an aide and campaign treasurer. Towle pleaded guilty in 2003 to political corruption charges. Marks cooperated with the investigation, according to a report in Newsday, and was never charged. When other Republicans distanced themselves from Towle after he got out of jail, though, she kept working with him.
Their association came under scrutiny after a meeting they held with Tara Scully, a Republican judicial candidate in Suffolk County in the fall of 2015. At the time, Scully was looking for support from the local Conservative Party, which would come with a coveted ballot line that could improve her chances of winning.
At the meeting, details of which were first reported by Newsday in 2016, Towle said he could use his relationship with the Conservative Party chair to help Scully secure the endorsement if she paid him a large consulting fee. He also suggested she donate $2,000 to the Conservative Party. As an added layer of caution, the pair offered to route the payment through Marks’ Campaigns Unlimited.
The offer caught the attention of local and federal prosecutors, who at the time were preparing to put the Conservative Party chair on trial on charges of defrauding taxpayers. Scully’s team told them they believed Towle and Marks had dangled a blatant — and corrupt — quid pro quo. The two denied that interpretation.
Subpoenas were issued. Witnesses surreptitiously recorded each other. But prosecutors concluded they could not clearly establish bribery or extortion, according to four people familiar with the case who described it on the condition of anonymity. Prosecutors declined to bring charges.
Towle later entered a guilty plea for unrelated tax charges. His lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said this week that the matter involving Scully had been “thoroughly investigated by the U.S. attorney’s office, and they declined to bring charges.”
Marks’ work left other clients feeling uneasy.
Peter Zinno turned to Marks for help with his run for a House seat on Long Island in 2010. He recalled her offering to charge him half of her usual rate because, he said, “She liked me, apparently.”
But after he failed to win the Republican nomination, he discovered that during his campaign, Marks had doubled the monthly rate paid to her company without notice. Some months she appeared to bill him twice.
Zinno sued Marks in 2013 for $3,800, but lost his case when a judge said he lacked sufficient evidence, in part because he had waited too long to lodge his claim.
“Nancy is a hustler,” Zinno said in an interview. “And I got taken.”
Zinno’s experience appears similar to conduct that prompted a second pass at Marks’ business by federal investigators.
In that inquiry, investigators came to suspect that Marks might have been playing tricks with the books she kept. They confronted at least one of her clients with evidence that she used her position as treasurer to overpay herself, according to the client, who insisted on anonymity, and another official familiar with the matter.
It is unclear what prompted the outreach or if it was connected to a broader inquiry. The inquiry again ended without charges.
‘Her George’
Marks doted on many of her clients — offering encouragement regardless of how bad the polls looked. But in recent years, George Santos stood apart.
“She thought of George as her favorite client,” said Michael Rendino, the Bronx Republican Party chairman, who briefly hired Marks for his own race. “She had, I thought, a motherly love for him. That was ‘her George.’”
The relationship was mutually beneficial. Marks offered Santos decades of experience and relationships with key Republicans. Santos offered Marks a chance to expand her business, inviting her to join staff phone calls and accompany him on fundraising trips out of state.
All the while, she filed reports with suspicious patterns of spending. There were payments to cleaning companies described as “rent”; $365,399.08 in spending that the campaign never explained; and nearly $800,000 in loans he made to his campaign over the years that raised questions about the source of his income.
And then there were the $199.99 payments to “anonymous” — totaling nearly $250,000 at one point — that have drawn the scrutiny of the FEC.
Santos is not the only client whose filings have drawn scrutiny. In late March, Zeldin amended years-old reports to clear up 21 payments of $199.99 to unnamed recipients during his 2020 House campaign. A review of his congressional filings shows that the Zeldin campaign also reported $110,000 in nonitemized spending that year, more than any sitting New York House member, apart from Santos.
This month, the FEC wrote to Marks ordering Zeldin to refund $129,000 in contributions he collected improperly in 2021 and 2022 and then transferred to his campaign for governor.
“It shows a certain level of disregard for the rules,” said Saurav Ghosh, a former FEC enforcement lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center.
The Zeldin campaign reviewed its filings in response to a request from the Times and found no issues, the former campaign manager, Eric Amidon, said. He added that he believed the FEC to be mistaken about the contributions, but said that they would be refunded out of an abundance of caution.
The degree to which Marks was aware of Santos’ numerous biographical deceptions is not clear. But Florida corporate records show she went into business with him and some of his colleagues from Harbor City Capitol, a Florida-based investment company, just weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission had shut the company down over concerns it operated as a Ponzi scheme.
In May 2021, Red Strategies USA was born.
Like Marks’ Campaigns Unlimited, the venture promised candidates convenience: one place to produce and place ads, manage social media and provide general political consulting.
Jordan Hafizi, a first-time candidate, turned to Red Strategies for help on a 2021 City Council race, paying the firm $22,450 to produce and promote a campaign video on social media, according to public campaign filings and a contract agreement reviewed by the Times.
But a review of the repository of ads on Meta, the company that owns Facebook, as well as a review by the ad tracking firm AdImpact, shows that only four Facebook ads were purchased on Hafizi’s behalf, and those were removed because they did not include a required disclaimer. The placements cost $3,800, though Hafizi paid Red Strategies $12,000, according to a person with direct knowledge of the arrangement.
Red Strategies was not the only company Hafizi patronized that was tied to Marks, who was also his treasurer. All told, Hafizi, who failed to garner the nomination in his City Council race, spent nearly $50,000 with Marks’ companies — roughly 60% of his campaign’s total spending, New York City campaign finance records show. He declined to comment.
As for Red Strategies, the company barely got off the ground: It handled just a few accounts, and was dissolved by the state of Florida in September 2022 for failing to file an annual report. By then, Marks and Santos were just a few weeks from an unlikely upset victory that would alter the course of their careers.

Full text: BeReal was pitched as Gen Z's safe haven from the artifice of social media. For some, authenticity only proved interesting for so long.
Each day last summer, a black-and-white notification appeared simultaneously on millions of phone screens. As if in a trance, many people paused their conversations or lowered their video game controllers. It was time to BeReal.
BeReal, a French photo-sharing app founded in 2020 that took off on college campuses, prompts users at a different time each day to take shots with their front and rear phone cameras. The app billed itself as an alternative to the artifice of social media: If Instagram had become a catalog of cosmetic enhancements and painstakingly arranged tableaus, BeReal's feed full of limp salads, messy apartments and unflattering selfies appeared an attractive refuge. By July, BeReal had soared to the top of the iPhone app store.
The spell seems to have broken. Some users have discovered that seeing the monotony of their own lives reflected back at them is compelling for only so long.
When Night Noroña, 17, a high school student in Redding, Calif., downloaded the app in August, he liked seeing that his friends' lives were less glamorous than the highlight reels they posted to Instagram suggested, he said. But after a few months, he tired of scrolling through nearly identical pictures of their laptop screens and deleted the app. Most of his friends no longer use it either, he said.
"Gen Z hops on trains really fast, but they hop off even faster," Mr. Noroña said.
The app's monthly downloads have been slipping since September, according to data from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. The number of people who use the app daily has dropped 61 percent from its peak, from about 15 million in October to less than six million in March, according to Apptopia, another analytics firm.
BeReal declined to comment for this article, and the company does not share its numbers of users. "We want for ourselves what we want for our users -- not to chase fame or the spotlight or to be tethered to metrics like the number of followers or number of downloads," reads a statement posted to the company's website in November.
The app does not allow users to see friends' posts until contributing their own. That made it feel collaborative at first, said Oriana Riley, 20, a Stanford University student. In the fall, entire classrooms were whipping out their iPhones in unison, she said.
Ms. Riley still uses the app but said it was well past the point of academic interruption. "It's something to do, but it's not the thing to do anymore," she said.
BeReal faces a dilemma, said Niklas Myhr, an associate professor of marketing at Chapman University. Doubling down on so-called authenticity risks making the app more monotonous.
But doing the opposite -- breaking the platform's rules to generate more interesting pictures -- risks turning BeReal into the very platforms it was supposedly a reaction against. BeReal may alienate users if it becomes awash in the kind of highly produced content that influencers and advertisers typically post on Instagram and Facebook, Dr. Myhr said. (BeReal is currently ad-free.)
Some users stretch the app's rules. Last month Sondra Tarmoedji, 31, a wedding photographer in Sacramento, got a BeReal notification when she was in the Uber on the way to the first show of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in Glendale, Ariz. She ignored it.
Ms. Tarmoedji resisted until Ms. Swift's performance of "All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)" to post. "I can be a little bit late on my BeReal for the day, just to show, Hey, I am doing something cool," she said. (The app lets other users know if you have posted late as well as how many times you retook your photo.)
Oliver Haimson, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, calls this phenomenon the online authenticity paradox. We consider authenticity to be important, but often fall short of achieving it in our digital presences for very human reasons. For example, because we want to share exciting moments with others, or we care what our followers think of us.
Those tendencies have made it hard for BeReal to live up to its name. "People were starting to realize that it's not necessarily this promise of authenticity and realness that they were expecting it to be," Dr. Haimson said.
Even if BeReal does not retain users, it appears to have made an impression on other social media companies. In July, Instagram introduced a dual camera feature. In September, TikTok introduced "TikTok Now," which instructs users each day to share a spontaneous photo or video.
And some BeReal users still see value in capturing the mundane -- if not for their followers, then for themselves. Sunny Tang, 23, a medical student at New York University, uses BeReal to document artifacts from her daily life, like her class notes on the esophagus. Sure, the images are boring, she said. But that doesn't mean they are meaningless.
"I'd rather remember these less significant moments, because at the end of the day, those are the moments that will be making up my life," Ms. Tang said.

Full text: Warm days are returning, after all.
I have notifications turned on for only two Twitter accounts: One is for the city's alternate-side parking days, and the other is @nymetrowx, an account dedicated to breathless coverage of New York City meteorology. To live here is to be incredibly attuned to the weather -- after all, you're probably going to be out in it.
That's why when the weather's going to be immaculate, planning starts immediately for park hangs, stoop sits and outdoor dining. This naturally leads to larger gatherings, so I thought I'd swing a few recommendations your collective way for where to get a group together for a good time.
A Bushwick Standby for Larger Parties
Last week I helped organize a surprise party for Tanya Sichynsky, whom you may know as the writer behind New York Times Cooking's The Veggie newsletter. As soon as my co-conspirators and I realized that it was going to be a hot day and a warm night, we knew dinner had to be outside. So we emailed the folks at Roberta's, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to ask if we could bring 20 friends for pizza, salads, wine and pie.
I remember when every other 20-something I knew would gather in Roberta's large, sparse backyard for daytime dance parties. Now, it features a few tents: one with a bar, and two more with wooden picnic tables. My party sat at a Last Supper-esque table on a patch of fake grass. It was a perfect New York City spring night™.
A fellow Food editor let me know that the big outdoor space at Popina, an Italian restaurant on Columbia Street, has both covered and uncovered options. And I had my 33rd birthday party this year at Prima Brooklyn, the wine bar on Greene Avenue in Clinton Hill. Though we were rained out, the bar has a lovely back patio that's perfect for groups of 40 or fewer.
French and Basque for You and Yours
Sometimes your group is just a few good friends looking for a lovely place to hang out. A few weeks ago I had brunch with my sister at Lafayette, in NoHo, and it washed over me how lovely its space is. There are two private dining rooms, the large booths in the main dining room can each fit six to eight diners and the patio that wraps around the front of the restaurant really puts the fresco in alfresco. Order an almond croissant, a few green juices and whatever inspires you from the brunch menu (I stan the giant basket of French fries), and take in the neighborhood.
A few notes: If it's the weekend, you will have to watch the line for the Suprême, Lafayette's Instagram-famous filled croissant, snake around the block. Diners are not allowed to order one to their table. And though it may seem as if Lafayette takes no reservations on Resy (or, rather, sets them aside solely for Amex card holders), you can very easily book a reservation on the restaurant's website.
Finally, I recently enjoyed not one, but two meals at Txikito, the beloved Basque restaurant on Ninth Avenue in Chelsea. And just as every tree has suddenly sprouted leaves, Txikito sprouted outdoor dining in the week between my meals. I can't imagine a more incredible spring evening than one spent sipping one or two or three vermouth preparados alongside some octopus carpaccio, creamy, pimento-spiked bomba rice and an order of patatak (French fries forever).
Split the cochillon, with its crackly skin, and take the long way home -- it's that time of year.
In Other News ...
New bucket list just dropped: Or rather, Pete Wells's list of the 100 best restaurants in New York City. The list, which can be organized by price point and by borough, is an excellent guide based on a decade of Pete's restaurant reviews in The Times. It can also be viewed as a composite of the city, Pete writes: "I've attempted to arrange my favorite restaurants into a pattern that captures the diversity and character of dining in New York." Mam, a Vietnamese restaurant on the Lower East Side reviewed just this week, landed at No. 26. What a debut!

Tunisian Officials Arrest a Key Opposition Leader: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Targeting Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, is an escalation in President Kais Saied's crackdown on dissent.
Tunisian authorities have arrested a prominent opposition leader and three other officials from his party in an escalation of President Kais Saied's campaign against political opponents, which began after he seized full power over the North African nation nearly two years ago.
The arrest Monday evening targeted Rachid al-Ghannouchi, the leader of the Ennahda party, which dominated Tunisia's Parliament for years during the country's short-lived democratic experiment, becoming deeply unpopular for its Islamist views and missteps while in power. That unpopularity has made Ennahda a convenient target of Mr. Saied's campaign against political rivals, with Mr. al-Ghannouchi the most prominent opponent to be targeted so far.
Ennahda said about 100 plainclothes police officers raided and searched Mr. al-Ghannouchi's home in the capital, Tunis, taking him and another party member to a military barracks. The authorities then raided Ennahda's Tunis headquarters, arresting two other prominent party officials, and searched the home of Mr. al-Ghannouchi's daughter, according to Ennahda and Tunisian prosecutors.
"The Ennahda movement condemns this very dangerous development and demands the immediate release" of Mr. al-Ghannouchi, the party said in a statement posted on the leader's Facebook page. "It also calls on all liberals to stand together in the face of these oppressive practices."
Tunisia was the only country to emerge from the wave of Arab Spring uprising in 2011 as a new democracy, an experiment that endured for about a decade. But the new order began to unravel when Mr. Saied, who was elected as a political outsider in 2019, established one-man rule in 2021 by suspending the country's powerful, Ennahda-led Parliament.
Since mid-February, facing intensifying unpopularity over a looming economic collapse, Mr. Saied has ramped up his repression of dissent. The authorities arrested at least two dozen opposition politicians, journalists, activists, judges and others in what analysts said was an attempt to distract from his own mistakes and deflect blame for Tunisia's deteriorating situation.
He also recently appointed a hard-line new minister of the interior, who ordered Monday's crackdown on Ennahda.
The latest developments had the makings of a concerted offensive against Ennahda and its main opposition partner, an anti-Saied coalition known as the National Salvation Front.
Mr. al-Ghannouchi and his party have been among Mr. Saied's main antagonists since Tunisians embraced the president's power grab, in part because they detested Ennahda: The party had been an important player in government, if not in outright control, since Tunisians overthrew their longtime autocratic ruler, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, in the 2011 revolution.
"This is a, if not the, biggest slice of red meat that many of Saied's initial supporters -- including some in U.G.T.T. -- had wanted," said Monica Marks, an assistant professor of Middle East politics at New York University Abu Dhabi who studies Tunisia, using the initials for Tunisia's powerful general labor union. "But it by no means solves his problems on the socioeconomic front."
Mr. Saied's security services have detained and questioned Mr. al-Ghannouchi, who is in his 80s, several times over the last two years. But this was the first time he had been arrested without warning.
The arrest came after Mr. al-Ghannouchi said in a meeting on Saturday that excluding the opposition from Tunisian politics, including Ennahda, risked starting a "civil war," a phrase he used repeatedly.
The authorities pounced on his words to charge him with incitement, saying in a statement that they had been authorized to do so under the country's antiterrorism law.
Ennahda's statement outlined a series of what the party called violations of basic legal procedure during the raids. Security personnel had barred Mr. al-Ghannouchi's lawyers from being present during the search of his house or his interrogation, it said, and Mr. al-Ghannouchi was refusing to speak without a lawyer present.
Even so, it said, investigators had kept him sitting in the interrogation room all night, refusing to allow him to use the bathroom unless the door was kept open.
Though moderate compared with other Islamist movements in the Middle East and North Africa, Ennahda's religious orientation spooked many Tunisians who feared the party would undo the country's secular values and freedoms. It did not help that Mr. Ben Ali's government had demonized Ennahda for years before the 2011 revolution.
Ennahda's dominance in government -- Mr. al-Ghannouchi was the speaker of Parliament before it was dissolved, and Ennahda figures regularly served as prime minister or in cabinet -- meant it was closely associated, fairly or not, with the incompetence and corruption that plagued Tunisia's post-revolution governments. The party was also blamed by many for those governments' failure to deliver the economic prosperity Tunisians had demanded during the uprising.
The economic problems that had been building for the last decade have culminated over the last year in a massive crisis compounded by the worst drought in years. Inflation is emptying Tunisians' wallets; basic goods such as oil, sugar and coffee have disappeared from supermarket shelves. Migration to Europe from Tunisia has surged.
Yet Mr. Saied has appeared more interested in overhauling the country's political system than in rescuing the economy, ramming through a new Constitution he drafted which concentrates power in the president's hands and neutralizes Parliament.
That has led some Tunisians to turn against him. But for many, the fear that Ennahda, or an opposition coalition including it, will return to power in Mr. Saied's stead, has kept them from embracing his opponents.

Star Light, Star Bright, but Then There Are the Birds: [Science Desk]

Full text: Before an observatory can plumb the secrets of the cosmos, it must navigate more humbling challenges.
Few things in science appear to be as delicate or precarious as the giant mirrors at the hearts of modern telescopes. These mirrors -- doughnuts of glass meters in diameter, weighing tons and costing millions of dollars -- are polished within a fraction of a wavelength of visible light into the precise concavity required to gather and focus starlight from the other end of the universe.
When not at work, they are sheltered in lofty domes that protect them from the distortions of humidity, wind and changes in temperature. But this cannot shield them from all the vicissitudes of nature and humanity, as I was reminded on a recent visit to the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
As my hosts showed off one of their prized telescope mirrors -- 20 feet of shiny, immaculately curved aluminum-coated glass -- I couldn't help noticing a small, suspicious smudge. It looked like the kind of smear you might find on your windshield in the morning, especially if you had parked under a tree.
"Birds," one astronomer grumbled when asked what it was.
It happens all the time, other astronomers say. Michael Bolte, now an emeritus professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, recalled giving the governor of Wyoming a tour of the Wyoming Infrared Observatory, outside Laramie, in 1981. "We went up on the service platform and looked down, and there were bird droppings all over the mirror," he said. "It looked awful."
It's not only birds that can deface a mirror. Mike Brotherton, the current director of the Wyoming observatory, posted a picture on Facebook of frost that had accumulated on his mirror while the dome was open for observation. "It's hard to keep a mirror pristine," he said. "It's a balance between opening to take data and protecting the mirror."
Bird residue has a special place in astrophysical lore. In the early 1960s, the radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, both then at Bell Labs, were trying to calibrate an old horn antenna to study galaxies. In an effort to get rid of a persistent background hum, they shoveled vast amounts of pigeon guano out of their telescope, only to eventually learn that the hum was cosmic: It was the hissing remains of radiation from the Big Bang, and it firmly settled the question of whether the universe had a distinct beginning.
Luckily, such biodegradable insults to the mirrors are temporary and don't block much light. Observatories periodically wash their mirrors, strip off the old aluminum coatings and apply a fresh layer, which involves removing the mirror from the telescope.
That can be a ticklish operation. Last fall, the 8-meter-diameter primary mirror of the Gemini North telescope, on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, was nicked on its outer edge while being moved for cleaning and recoating. The damage was not to the part of the mirror that collects light, but the telescope's managers opted to repair it anyway. On March 31, Jen Lotz, the observatory director, reported that the repairs were complete and that the telescope, she hoped, would be back in operation sometime in May.
Some things are less easy to fix. On Feb. 5, 1970, a new employee at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas took a gun to work and opened fire, first at his boss and then several times point-blank at the primary mirror of the observatory's new 2.7-meter reflecting telescope. Then he went at it with a hammer.
Preliminary reports indicated that the mirror had been destroyed; when the sheriff had arrived, he had noted that it had a big hole in it. In fact the mirror, of a common type called Cassegrain, was designed and built with central holes to permit light to pass through to instruments behind it.
Nobody was hurt during the assault. And aside from seven small bullet holes, which affected only about 1 percent of the mirror's surface area, the telescope was virtually unscathed.
"The telescope resumed its observing program the following night," the observatory's director, Harlan Smith of the University of Texas, reported to the International Astronomical Union soon after, "producing some of the best photographs (of quasar fields) so far obtained with this instrument in its first year of use."
Which is to say, telescope glass is tougher than you think. When I first visited the 200-inch Hale Telescope on Palomar Mountain in California -- a rite of passage for a young science writer -- I was startled to discover, looking down the barrel of what was then the world's largest and most famous telescope, a dinner-plate-size gash left by a tool that a worker had dropped years earlier.
Dr. Bolte described a close call at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. He and a colleague were up in the dome, working on a camera in the telescope, when they noticed that the covers that normally protected the mirror were open. They managed to radio down to the floor and get the covers closed.
"We did whatever we were going to do, and were getting ready to come down," Dr. Bolte wrote in a Facebook conversation. "You counted all the tools you took to the prime focus cage and made sure the count on the way up matched the count on the way down. Just as I was saying to Bob, 'I think we are one tool short,' a big crescent wrench fell out of the cage and made an incredible racket, smacking the mirror cover."
The most famous example of what can go wrong with a mirror occurred in 1990, when the Hubble Space Telescope was launched with a misshapen mirror that could not focus.
Astronauts were able to fix it, and Hubble is still going strong. But the episode led NASA to be extra cautious with Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduling extensive tests that vastly increased the telescope's cost and construction time.
The Webb was launched spectacularly and successfully on Dec. 25, 2021, but space is a shooting gallery, too. The telescope had barely set up shop when it was pelted by a larger-than-expected micrometeorite, which left a tiny crater in one of the telescope's mirror segments. NASA has since modified its protocols to minimize the amount of time that the telescope is aimed into meteor streams.
And so it goes. The cosmos has a way of guarding its secrets.

Full text: Mr. Kennedy, a Democrat who plans to kick off his campaign this week, says he wants to make vaccines safer, but he is spreading misinformation by twisting facts out of context.
WASHINGTON -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stood before the Lincoln Memorial in January 2022 and condemned the federal government's coronavirus response by railing against totalitarianism. Jews in Nazi Germany, he suggested, had more freedom than Americans facing vaccination mandates and school, church and business closures in the era of Covid-19.
"Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland," he told a crowd of flag-waving anti-vaccine enthusiasts at a "Defeat the Mandates" rally. "You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did."
Mr. Kennedy later apologized, though it was not the first time he had invoked the Holocaust. Over the past two decades, as he has pursued what he calls "safe vaccine activism," Mr. Kennedy has evolved from an environmental lawyer concerned about mercury poisoning into a crusader for individual liberty -- a path that has landed him, a scion of a storied Democratic clan, in the unlikely embrace of the American political right.
On Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy plans to formally announce that he is challenging President Biden for the Democratic nomination for president. His vaccine skepticism gives him something in common with another candidate: former President Donald J. Trump, who like Mr. Kennedy has blamed childhood vaccines for autism -- a discredited theory that has been repudiated by more than a dozen peer-reviewed scientific studies in multiple countries.
"Robert F. Kennedy could jump into the Republican primary for president and only DeSantis and Trump, I think, would do better," Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist, said recently on his podcast, referring to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Mr. Bannon said Mr. Kennedy had a "massive following" with his audience. "People love this guy," he said.
Vaccination is a singular public health success that has saved untold millions of lives. Vaccines have eradicated smallpox, averted millions of deaths from measles and sent naturally occurring polio cases plummeting, from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to six reported cases worldwide in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.
Mr. Kennedy has insisted that he is not opposed to vaccines and that his sole interest is in making them safer. "I'm not anti-vaccine, although I'm kind of the poster child for the anti-vax movement," he said during a recent speech at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian college in Michigan.
But through his nonprofit, Children's Health Defense, and his movies, speeches and books -- including one that portrays Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry -- Mr. Kennedy has used his platform and his family's star power to sow doubts about vaccine safety, spreading misinformation by twisting facts out of context.
In 2021, the Center for Countering Digital Hate named him one of its "Disinformation Dozen" -- the 12 people whom the organization found to have been responsible for roughly three-quarters of anti-vaccine content on Facebook.
Facebook and Instagram have removed the accounts of Children's Health Defense, and Mr. Kennedy has accused them of censorship. He is also suing the Biden administration and Dr. Fauci, who for decades led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, accusing them of pressuring social media companies to censor free speech.
Mr. Kennedy declined to be interviewed. In an email message, he said Children's Health Defense had "an extremely robust fact-checking operation." He also pointed to a response by Meta, Facebook's parent company, disputing the "Disinformation Dozen" report. Meta critiqued the study's design, saying that focusing on just 12 people "misses the forest for the trees."
Family Backlash
Mr. Kennedy, 69, is the third-eldest child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, who urged Americans to take the Salk polio vaccine and signed the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962 to help states and cities carry out childhood immunization programs.
His activism, and now his political aspirations, have been wrenching for his family. Some of his family members have publicly rebuked him. His sister Rory Kennedy told CNN she was backing Mr. Biden, while his sister Kerry Kennedy said in a statement, "I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues."
Ahead of his White House bid, Mr. Kennedy is playing up his family history. He lives in California but plans to make his announcement in Boston, a city closely identified with the Kennedys. He recently tweeted a photo of himself in a vintage "Kennedy for President" T-shirt.
His name and family reputation have opened doors for him. Dr. Fauci said he had met with Mr. Kennedy several times and had told him "that I believe that his intentions are not evil, but his information is incorrect, and he's misguided and can inadvertently cause significant harm." Dr. Fauci said that when Mr. Kennedy's book about him, titled "The Real Anthony Fauci," came out in 2021, he was "really shocked."
"The entire book is such a complete lie," Dr. Fauci said.
Mr. Kennedy's messages often have a grain of truth. The Children's Health Defense website, for instance, says "vaccines contain many ingredients, some of which are known to be neurotoxic, carcinogenic and cause autoimmunity." Vaccines do contain preservatives and additives, such as aluminum salts, which have been in use in vaccines for decades. Studies show adverse reactions are rare and typically involve skin allergies.
The Children's Health Defense website also states that certain vaccines are not tested against placebos in clinical trials, citing polio, hepatitis and meningitis vaccines as examples. That is misleading. Brand-new vaccines -- from polio to measles to Covid-19 -- are tested in large clinical trials that include placebo groups. But scientists agree it would be unethical to withhold lifesaving vaccines from study participants. For that reason, when older vaccines are reformulated or updated, studies do not include a placebo group.
"Vaccine injuries can and do happen," the website declares. That is true as well, but the federal government has an aggressive system to track and detect side effects so they can be addressed.
The measles vaccine, for instance, lowers the platelet count in about one in every 25,000 to 30,000 people. That can cause red spots from bleeding under the skin -- a problem that is usually "short-lived and self-resolving," said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. But measles causes that problem in one in 3,000 children -- roughly 10 times as many as the vaccine, he said.
"There are no risk-free choices, just choices to take different risks," said Dr. Offit, who has been a vocal critic of Mr. Kennedy. "You could argue the greatest risk of vaccines is driving to the office to get them."
A Movement Grows
By his own account, Mr. Kennedy was at first a reluctant critic of vaccination. He got involved in 2005, when he was an environmental lawyer suing coal-fired power plants to force them to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic chemicals.
The anti-vaccine movement in the United States had been growing amid debate over a rise in cases of autism. In 1998, a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield published a study of 12 children in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, that suggested a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism.
The article was retracted in 2010, and Mr. Wakefield was later barred from practicing medicine. But in the years after its publication, another theory began to take hold: that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that had been used for decades to prevent bacteria from growing in multiple-dose vials of vaccines, caused autism.
The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine never contained thimerosal, but other vaccines given to infants did. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is "no evidence" that the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines cause harm, "except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site."
But in 1999, after Congress directed the Food and Drug Administration to look at mercury in all products, the American Academy of Pediatrics, federal health agencies and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be removed from childhood vaccines. The decision was made "out of an abundance of caution," said Daniel Salmon, the director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
But the move alarmed parents. As Mr. Kennedy traveled the country giving speeches, he has said, mothers of intellectually disabled children began buttonholing him, pressing him to investigate vaccines.
"They would say to me in a very respectful but also kind of vaguely scolding way, 'If you're really interested in mercury exposures to children, you need to look at vaccines,"' he told the Hillsdale College audience.
In 2005, Rolling Stone and Salon copublished an article by Mr. Kennedy, headlined "Deadly Immunity," that blamed thimerosal in vaccines for fueling the rise in autism. Salon later retracted the article. Mr. Kennedy insisted Salon caved to pressure from government regulators and the pharmaceutical industry.
Thimerosal is still used in flu vaccines. In 2015, shortly after Mr. Kennedy published a book about the preservative, he met Eric Gladen, an engineer who believes he was sickened by thimerosal in a tetanus vaccine and who made a film about his experience. The two joined forces. Mr. Gladen's advocacy group, World Mercury Project, was later rebranded as Children's Health Defense.
"We had two huge tools to raise funds; we had my film, which is about 10 years of research put into 90 minutes, and his book," Mr. Gladen said in an interview, adding, "Between him being a Kennedy, the film and his book, it compelled a lot of people to get involved."
The anti-vaccine movement was, at the time, largely the province of the political left. Mr. Kennedy found allies in Hollywood celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy. In California, he waged an unsuccessful fight against a bill to eliminate the "personal belief" exemption that allowed parents to opt out of vaccinating their children.
Mr. Kennedy has been a vocal opponent of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, a 1986 federal law intended to promote the development of vaccines by shielding manufacturers from lawsuits. In 2003, at the height of the thimerosal controversy, a bipartisan measure to update the law by offering immunity to vaccine additive manufacturers collapsed in Congress.
Mr. Kennedy points to such efforts as evidence that lawmakers and federal regulators are conspiring to protect drug companies, which he says lack incentives to focus on safety. During the fight over the California legislation, he invoked those arguments, said Dr. Richard Pan, a former state senator who was an author of the bill and met with Mr. Kennedy at the time.
"He mainly focused on the F.D.A. being corrupt and in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies to hide the danger of vaccines," Dr. Pan said.
Meeting With Trump
Shortly before Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mr. Kennedy met with him at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Kennedy said afterward that the president-elect wanted him to lead a "vaccine safety and scientific integrity" commission. He told Science magazine that Mr. Trump had told him he had five friends whose healthy children "developed a suite of deficits" after being vaccinated.
The commission never came to pass, but the coronavirus pandemic gave Mr. Kennedy an even bigger platform. As the country grew ever more polarized, with many of Mr. Trump's followers shunning the vaccines and Dr. Fauci becoming a lightning rod, Mr. Kennedy's book about Dr. Fauci became a best seller.
Another book by Mr. Kennedy is due out in June, this time focusing on the controversy over the origins of the coronavirus. Titled "The Wuhan Cover-Up," it claims that federal health officials "conspired with the Chinese military" to hide the pandemic's origins -- an assertion that appears to conflate experiments by the Chinese military at the Wuhan Institute of Virology with other work there funded by the U.S. government.
How much Mr. Kennedy will talk about vaccine safety during his presidential campaign remains unclear. As he did during the rally at the Lincoln Memorial, he used his talk at Hillsdale College to cloak his activism in a broader point -- that the government, the press and social media companies are trying to silence him, pushing the United States toward tyranny.
"The founders, specifically Hamilton, Madison, Adams, said, 'We put freedom of expression in the First Amendment because all the other amendments are dependent on it,"' Mr. Kennedy said. "Because if you give a government the right to silence their opponents, they now have a license for any atrocity."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The authorities did not offer any details about a motive for the shooting on Saturday night in Dadeville, Ala.
Four people were killed and 28 others were injured in a shooting at a birthday party on Saturday night in an Alabama city, officials said.
Sgt. Jeremy Burkett, a spokesman for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, said that the shooting in Dadeville took place around 10:34 p.m. At news conferences on Sunday, the authorities did not provide information about who opened fire or why.
The shooting occurred at the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, The Montgomery Advertiser reported. Dadeville is about 60 miles northeast of Montgomery, and about 3,000 people live there.
The studio hosted Zumba and line dancing classes for children and teenagers and had been rehearsing for a dance showcase celebrating its second anniversary on April 29, according to its Facebook page. A representative of the studio could not be immediately reached on Sunday.
At least 15 teenagers were treated for gunshot wounds, said Heidi Smith, a spokeswoman for Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville.
She said that nine of the teenagers were transferred to a different hospital to receive a higher level of care and that five of those nine were in critical condition. There were 17 ambulances on the scene after the shooting, Ms. Smith said.
Residents on Sunday morning grappled with the shooting, which took place at a 16th birthday party, said Ben Hayes, the senior pastor at Dadeville First Baptist Church, who is also the chaplain of the city's Police Department.
Philstavious Dowdell, a Dadeville High School football player who was known as Phil and who had committed to Jacksonville State University, was one of those killed, the pastor said.
Mr. Dowdell was 18, and it was his younger sister's birthday party, according to Michael Taylor, a coach at Dadeville High School.
He said that Mr. Dowdell's sister was a cheerleader who cheered for every sport at the high school and that many of the athletes she had supported came out to celebrate.
"They're all like family, like brothers and sisters in a small town," Mr. Taylor said. "This whole town is just in disbelief, like it's a dream."
The head coach of Jacksonville State University's football team, Rich Rodriguez, said in a statement that Mr. Dowdell was a "great young man with a bright future."
KeKe Nicole Smith, 18, a volleyball player and team manager for the Dadeville High School track team, was also killed, Mr. Taylor said. Ms. Smith's cousin, Amy Jackson, confirmed her death in a Facebook message. Mr. Taylor, who coached the track team Ms. Smith managed, described her as "full of life."
"She was so fun and funny," he said. "A typical 18-year-old."
The superintendent of the Tallapoosa County Board of Education, Raymond Porter, said at the news conference that schools would provide counseling to students on Monday. "We will make every effort to comfort those children," Mr. Porter said.
Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama said on Twitter on Sunday morning that her office was receiving updates about the shooting.
"This morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians," the governor said. "Violent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge."
President Biden was briefed on the shooting, and he and his staff have been in contact with local law enforcement and officials to offer support, White House officials said.
"What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear?" the president said in a statement. "This is outrageous and unacceptable," he added.
Guns are the leading killer of children in the United States, making it an extreme outlier compared with similarly large and wealthy nations. In 2020, gun violence surpassed car accidents and disease to become the leading killer of children.
The gun death rate for children in the United States is nearly five in every 100,000. The rate had been flat for more than a decade starting in 2000 and started to creep up in 2014. Researchers who study gun violence say that it is difficult to explain why the rate has risen so quickly, but most emphasize that the proliferation of guns has most likely played a role.
Mr. Taylor said that at Dadeville High School, where many of the victims were students, classes would be in session on Monday. He was already trying to figure out what to say to the students who would show up.
"Bottom line, we've got to pray our way out of this and give it time," Mr. Taylor said. "That's the only way out."

Full text: Michael Sin-Suarez was shocked when he overheard Kia Zalewski discussing one of his favorite '80s movies. Neither of them anticipated that reciting dialogue from the film would later lead to romance.
It was the summer of 2005, and Kia Dawn Zalewski, a recent graduate of Florida State University with a bachelor's degree in communications, landed a position in sales and marketing at Nikki Beach Miami, a luxury beach club. While working in the corporate office, she often crossed paths with the then-V.I.P. manager, Michael Anthony Sin-Suarez.
Each thought the other was attractive, but there was something else that caught their attention. "I came in one day and she was talking about 'Grease 2' with a co-worker," Mr. Sin-Suarez, an '80s movie aficionado, said. "No one knows 'Grease 2', but it was one of my favorite movies. She said a line from the movie and I said the following one."
A year later, she left Nikki Beach to work for a public relations firm in Miami. But a surprise encounter would lead them back to each other. In September 2012, Ms. Zalewski was visiting friends in Marbella, Spain, and one of them turned out to be roommates with Mr. Sin-Suarez. He was by then a manager at Nikki Beach Marbella. After that trip, the two kept in touch.
In early January 2013, Mr. Sin-Suarez traveled to New York, where Ms. Zalewski was living, for a friend's wedding. "Michael asked me to meet up with him in Rockefeller Center," Ms. Zalewski said. She nearly declined.
"But I accepted and we had the most fun running around town," she said, "drinking whiskey from a pocket flask and having far too many pickleback shots at tiny Midtown dive bars."
A few weeks later, Ms. Zalewski reached out to Mr. Sin-Suarez, who was then a manager at Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Koh Samui in Thailand, to ask if he could pass on her résumé to a friend in Los Angeles, where she was looking to relocate.
While the call from Los Angeles never came, Ms. Zalewski was offered a job as the marketing lead at Nikki Beach in Thailand. "I had two days to take the offer and two weeks to empty my apartment and move my life to Koh Samui," she said.

The pair quickly became best friends over late nights in the office, post-work cocktails, and getting each other through occasional bouts of homesickness.
Over a year later, in October 2014, the two traveled to a work conference in Marbella. When the backpacking trip Ms. Zalewski planned fell through, Mr. Sin Suarez invited her to go to Rome with him. "We had an amazing time, even though things didn't go as planned," he said. "We missed flights because I miscalculated the times, but she was so easygoing and understanding. It was the best trip I've ever had."
The couple officially began dating in 2015 when they moved together to oversee the Nikki Beach Bali location in Indonesia, where Ms. Zalewski was the marketing director and Mr. Sin-Suarez, who attended Johnson & Wales University for culinary studies, was the general manager. (The location has since closed.) "Since then, we've traveled around the world together," Ms. Zalewski said.
In 2016, they moved back to Miami, where they still live today, and adopted a dog they named Lilo. Ms. Zalewski is now the senior marketing director for the Riviera Dining Group, a luxury hospitality company based in Miami, and Mr. Sin-Suarez is the general manager at Nikki Beach Miami.
Mr. Sin-Suarez had been plotting a proposal since 2019, but Covid threw a wrench into his planning. "Then in summer 2021, I suggested going to New York City to celebrate my birthday in September," he said. The trip started with an unexpected gift from Mr. Sin-Suarez to Ms. Zalewski: a silver pocket flask engraved with the words "All roads lead to you'."
Mr. Sin-Suarez then insisted on visiting Rockefeller Center, where he got down on one knee and proposed. They then "stopped into Midtown bars to toast with celebratory pickleback shots and danced the night away," Ms. Zalewski said.
Ms. Zalewski, 39, and Mr. Sin-Suarez, 44, were married April 1 at Sydonie Mansion in Mount Dora, Fla. Ms. Zalewski's older brother, Joel Zalewski, who was ordained by the American Marriage Ministries for the occasion, officiated the ceremony in front of 83 guests.
The wedding was the actualization of a dream for Mr. Sin-Suarez. "Back when Facebook was a big thing and before we were serious, I tagged Kia in a photo of Ralph Macchio and the actress who played his love interest in 'Karate Kid,"' he said (that actress was Elisabeth Shue). "I wrote that I wished my life was like an '80s movie, and, in fact, it's been like a great '80s movie with her."

Junk Food Quandary: [Style Desk]

Full text: Eager not to participate in his husband's junk-food habit, a reader hesitates to draw a line in the sand, stung by memories of disagreements over his spouse's smoking.
My husband, 53, finally stopped smoking after 30 years -- not because of my prodding or refusal to buy him cigarettes (which he called self-righteous), but because he could no longer breathe easily. That was two years ago. Since then, he has gained a lot of weight. He is now obese, according to the body mass index. He can't even bend over to tie his shoes. His father and uncles died young, and I am worried about him. Still, he expects me to buy him highly processed junk food when I go shopping. I see this as a slow death wish, and I want no part in it. Is it reasonable for me to refuse to buy fattening, sugary treats without nutritional value? He can always buy them himself.
SPOUSE
I sympathize with your worries and even with your frustrations about your husband. (You love him!) But your tone strikes me as a bit harsh, and that may not be productive here. In all likelihood, you made the choice to marry a smoker long after the harmful effects of cigarettes were well known. Yet I detect no "Hurray!" in your report that he finally kicked the habit.
I hope you can applaud your husband's healthy choices -- even if they don't happen on your timetable. Breaking addictive behaviors can be rough, but he did it. It sounds as if he may now be compensating for the loss of cigarettes with sugary snacks. That's not uncommon.
If I were you, I would try to shift from policing his diet to giving him more positive reinforcement. Go with your husband to his next doctor's appointment or encourage him to meet with a nutritionist. That way, you can cheer his healthier choices, consistent with their recommendations, rather than carping about missteps or refusing to be complicit. Your husband knows he's fat. No need to remind him. Finding a way to support him, though, may be a big help.
What a Will Can Do
I am a divorced mother of three adult children. Several years ago, two of them decided that their values were better aligned with those of their father and his new wife than with mine. So they cut off all contact with me, claiming they will associate only with family members who share their worldview. Luckily, I am still very close to my middle daughter. I am in my late 60s, and as I review my will I wonder if it would be OK to leave all my assets to the daughter who speaks to me and to leave out the children who severed ties with me, despite many attempts to reach them?
MOTHER
Thanks again, cable news and social media! (Just a hunch.) Your assets are yours. You are free to bequeath them however you like. Many parents opt for equal treatment of children -- even amid fractious relationships or economic disparities among siblings -- to underscore the equal love they feel for them.
Your situation is different: Two of your adult children have estranged themselves from you completely. Do you want to send them a final message that you love them anyway? Or would you prefer to treat them in kind? Only you can decide that. (Personally, I'm hoping for a reconciliation and that the question becomes moot.)
Where Are These Ties You're Looking to Cut?
I accidentally sent a text message to a friend that was about her. (I meant to text another friend that she should sell her car to someone else because the friend I accidentally texted is broke.) She replied immediately that she had seen my message and had set aside money for the car. I apologized for my error and thought we had smoothed things over. Since then, she hasn't responded to my messages. My instinct is to step up and call her, but my friend is a difficult person. She is needy and often dumps her many personal problems on me. I feel ready to let this friendship fade. Advice?
FRIEND
You say your friend is needy. And the evidence? She hasn't replied to you in weeks after you slammed her (in error) and interfered with her purchase of a used car. You also say you would like to let this friendship go. But it appears your friend may have beaten you to the punch. And who can blame her after your pot-stirring?

The Unpleasant Aroma of Unsolicited Feedback
I work at a large company. A young man walked by my office yesterday. I've seen him around before. I noticed he was wearing Vetiver -- a lot of it, in fact. It didn't bother me. I like the fragrance. But I couldn't help thinking he should be wearing less of it. I didn't say anything. Could I have?
CO-WORKER
Like you (seemingly), I would enjoy nothing more than walking through the world issuing aesthetic pronouncements to strangers: "You may want to rethink that sweater." Sadly, though, the mere existence of our opinions is not a mandate to share them. I would feel differently if you had a sensitivity to fragrance, if this guy had asked for your opinion or even if he sat next to you all day. As it is: Permission denied.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ya Ya, who has been at the Memphis Zoo for 20 years, will soon return to China, where a campaign accusing the zoo of mistreating her has resonated on social media.
After two decades on loan to the Memphis Zoo, Ya Ya, a female giant panda, is heading home to China. To some animal welfare activists and Chinese people, it's not a moment too soon.
They are alarmed by videos and photos of Ya Ya in which she has mangy fur and looks somewhat thin. Two animal rights groups, In Defense of Animals and Panda Voices, have been campaigning to send her back to China "before her health worsens." They have also blamed the zoo for the death of Ya Ya's mate, Le Le, in February.
The zoo strongly denies mistreating either panda, and it has issued a joint statement with Chinese officials explaining Ya Ya's health issues. But the campaign has resonated on Chinese social media. Outraged users have analyzed the zoo's "panda cam" videos in minute detail, looking for signs of abuse, and some have gone so far as to question China's decades-old practice of using pandas as a tool for diplomacy.
A Chinese student in New York, Hugo Zhang, said he became so concerned about Ya Ya's welfare that he flew to Memphis during his spring break to see her in person.
"She was in bad shape physically, and appeared to be seriously suffering from skin disease," Mr. Zhang said by telephone. He said the bamboo she was being fed didn't look fresh to him.
China has engaged in "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when its leader Mao Zedong promised two of the animals to President Richard M. Nixon. In 1984, China -- the only country where pandas can be found in the wild -- finalized an arrangement in which they would be sent to overseas zoos for 10 years at a time.
Eighteen countries now have pandas on loan from China; they arrive in pairs, inevitably with great fanfare. Analysts say China uses them to project a friendly image and to reward countries it's pleased with. (When President Emmanuel Macron of France visited China last week, a French zoo director was in his delegation; on Tuesday, French and Chinese media reported that two pandas at the ZooParc de Beauval, Huan Huan and Yuan Zai, would have their stay extended through 2027.)
Matthew Fraser, an associate professor at the American University of Paris specializing in soft power and geopolitics, said that Beijing uses pandas to leverage its interests with trading partners. While politics are rarely cited explicitly when pandas are returned, he added, such gestures are often full of symbolic meaning, since the species is native only to China and inevitably become star attractions -- and main revenue drivers -- at zoos.
"Almost always when China gives a panda to a zoo in another country, it is usually facilitating some kind of good will and very frequently a trade deal," he said in a phone interview. "When China takes back a panda, it's usually because the regime is very displeased for some reason."
Ya Ya, who will turn 23 in August, is at the end of her second 10-year stint at the zoo, having arrived in Memphis with Le Le in 2003. On Tuesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said a Chinese expert and two employees of the Beijing Zoo were working with the Memphis Zoo to prepare for Ya Ya's relocation.
"The overall condition of the giant panda is relatively stable except for the fur condition caused by skin disease," Mr. Wang said. "The Chinese side has already made preparations to welcome Ya Ya home."
Rebecca Winchester, a spokeswoman for the Memphis Zoo, said the zoo had regularly provided Chinese officials with data about Ya Ya's health. She said the panda had a genetic condition that affected her immune system and made her fur look patchy. And at 190 pounds, she said, Ya Ya is naturally on the smaller side.
When Ya Ya paces in her enclosure -- another detail that alarmed people on social media -- she is likely exhibiting the hormonal influence of estrus, which female pandas undergo once a year, Ms. Winchester said.
"It is heartbreaking to have an entire narrative out there," Ms. Winchester said when asked about the criticism. "First of all it is hard to control. You don't speak the same language, and it is not easy to travel to Memphis and see her with their eyes."
Some of the zoo's critics were apparently opposed to animal captivity in general. "CLOSE ALL ZOOS!" one wrote on the zoo's Facebook page.
In a report last year, published in response to concerns on social media, the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens said that when Ya Ya first arrived in Memphis, experts suspected that she had mites, from which her mother had also suffered, and for which Ya Ya had undergone treatments with mixed results. The report also said she had lost weight since experiencing a "phantom pregnancy" in 2021.
In December, the zoo and the Chinese association announced that Ya Ya and Le Le would return to China in the spring. But Le Le died two months later, at 24. Another joint statement said he had likely died from heart disease. (Wild pandas have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, while captive pandas typically live for about 30 years.)
Chinese fans were glad she was coming home, and some said she should never have left. A video blogger who uses the nickname Yue Yue visited the panda enclosure. Calling out in the dialect of giant pandas' native province, Sichuan, she told Ya Ya to eat more and that she'd be home soon.
No exact date has been set for Ya Ya's trip home, because a federal agency still needs to finalize a permit for her travel. But she was given a send-off at the zoo last week, featuring speeches and performances from local Chinese organizations. Earlier, the zoo had filmed a less formal farewell, marching a goat, a tortoise, an aardvark, a sloth, a porcupine and a penguin up to Ya Ya's enclosure, where she nibbled on a stalk and presumably accepted their well wishes.

Finding the Perfect Apartment Through Algorithm: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: A family needed more space once their son began to grow up. The boy's father, who has a long history with social media, decided to conduct the search online.
Most of us turn to social media to find old friends or new fashions, dance moves or pet videos, but for Mikhail Lapushner, it was about finding the perfect apartment.
"For us to find this apartment -- it was fully my husband," said Jenna Driggers Lapushner. They've been married for five years.
"I gotta take my compliments where I can get them," Mr. Lapushner said, smiling.
It was the beginning of the pandemic and the couple felt like all their friends were fleeing the city.
"Everyone moved to Florida," Ms. Driggers Lapushner said. "Mostly Miami."
"What do they call Florida?" added Mr. Lapushner. "The sixth borough?"
But they didn't want to leave.
They were new parents -- their son, Alexander, was born in 2019 -- and they had both been in the city for many years. Ms. Driggers Lapushner grew up in Rhode Island and remembers coming to the city for ballet competitions throughout her childhood; she moved to New York for college and never left. Mr. Lapushner's family arrived in 1979 as refugees, fleeing the Soviet Union, and they've remained ever since.
"We are New Yorkers," he said, "we wanted to stay in the city."
The couple had been living in Midtown East, embracing the first exhausting, intoxicating days of parenthood. "The first eight months felt like a honeymoon period because he wasn't walking yet," Mr. Lapushner said. "It was really, really special."
But as their son grew it felt like their apartment was shrinking. "Once we decided we weren't leaving the city," he recalled, "I said to myself, 'OK, I want to go online and see every single possibility."'
He kept his search broad, looking not just in Manhattan but also throughout Brooklyn and in Long Island City. For Mr. Lapushner, geography mattered far less than the quality of the building. "I wanted a new building," he said, "world-class amenities."
He could have turned to StreetEasy or Zillow, like many apartment hunters, or he could have turned to a close friend in real estate, who had been helpful in the past. Instead, he turned to Facebook and Instagram.
"It's no surprise that social media can be a time-suck," he said, "but in this case it saved me time. And, as we all know, the true luxury in life is time."
$ 7,800 | Upper West Side, Manhattan
Mikhail Lapushner, 53; Jenna Driggers Lapushner, 36
Occupation: He is an independent venture capitalist, and she is an executive assistant at Innovid, an online advertising company.
On making it in America: When Mr. Lapushner's family arrived in New York as Russian refugees, he didn't speak English. "The American Dream, I thought, was making money," he said. "So, I went to Wall Street." At 24, he became a vice president at UBS and then went out on his own, and is currently focusing on cryptocurrency.
On a spacious neighborhood: Mr. Lapushner and Ms. Driggers Lapushner had never considered living in their neighborhood, but now they're attached to how roomy it feels. "I noticed right away that this part of town has this spaciousness that you don't get in other neighborhoods," Mr. Lapushner said. "You feel like you're in the suburbs and in New York City at the same time. Now I can't imagine living anywhere else in Manhattan."
Mr. Lapushner knew a thing or two about social media having invested in various platforms earlier in his career. "As someone who was involved with the early development, I have a lot of the same questions that others have around what is it doing to our society," he said, "and how it can be the biggest time suck in a person's life."
Still, he wanted to give the algorithms a try, to see how responsive they would be to his searches. "The algorithms that can sometimes annoy us by tracking all of our interest," he said, "that's exactly what I was looking for in this case. And the algorithms served me really well."
He began searching Facebook and Instagram for key phrases like "best amenities in N.Y.C.," "squash court," "tennis court," "basketball court," "playroom" -- all the things he and his wife were hoping for.
It was an advertisement -- on both Facebook and Instagram -- for Waterline Square, a development on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, that soon caught his eye. He saw nearly every amenity he'd been looking for, as well as an image of a grand staircase in the lobby, and he was hooked.
"I don't know who their chief media officer is," Ms. Driggers Lapushner added, "but they did really well. It was really fast and very accurate."
In June of 2020 they went to see an available two-bedroom apartment in Building Three of the complex. Construction on the development wasn't yet complete but they were already smitten by the unit they saw with two bathrooms and wide hallways, spacious bedrooms and floor-to-ceiling windows.
Four months later, they were some of the first residents to move in.
They like that the building has a garden, and that every Tuesday residents who sign up get leafy greens delivered to their door. Ms. Driggers Lapushner likes the ease with which she can commute to her office near Union Square, and they both like the on-site pet-care services for their 4-year-old Samoyed, Alpha.
But more than anything they like the activities that are offered in the building, particularly for Alexander -- and the sense of community that comes with them.
"He plays basketball, soccer, tennis," Mr. Lapushner said. "Every day after school he has a different activity -- all in the building. He's looking forward to using the golf simulator and the drum set in the music room, too. On freezing mornings, we can put on a robe with flip-flops and go straight down to the pool. Then he come upstairs and takes a nap. Getting the kid out in the winter? Oh my God, it takes forever. We've had Sundays where we never left the building and still did everything we wanted to do."
It's not just the ease and comfort that the family appreciates but also the central pursuit that Mr. Lapushner returns to again and again: "All of this gives us the luxury of time."
While some of the amenities require a paid membership in the building's social club, Mr. Lapushner said he is particularly grateful for the opportunity to share much of Waterline's luxury with his neighbors who live in the building's less expensive units, which are distributed through housing lotteries.
Mr. Lapushner said that while some buildings make the tenants in their affordable units feel like second-class citizens, that hasn't happened in his building.
"This building emphasizes community so much," he said. "It has super wealthy people and people just getting by and our kid has opportunities to develop relationships with all those families. That's so beautiful. It's truly an oasis."

A Bumper Crop of Blooming Wildflowers: [Travel Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the arrival of spring, there's a silver, or really, a multicolored lining to the extreme weather that has battered the west all winter: the promise of wildflower-filled weeks and months ahead, particularly in Southern and Central California and Arizona's Sonoran Desert.
"We are anticipating a good to better-than-average wildflower bloom," said Jorge Moreno, an information officer for California State Parks. Conditions are similarly favorable to the east, according to Michelle Thompson, chief of communications for Arizona State Parks and Trails.
The winter's precipitation has led to whispers of a "super bloom" this spring, similar to the frenzy of wildflowers that carpeted the California and Arizona desert in the winter and spring of 2019.
There's only one problem with that: "There is no universally accepted definition of a super bloom by the scientific community," said Ana Beatriz Cholo, a spokeswoman for the Pacific West region of the National Park System, adding that some definitions focus solely on desert blooms, while others simply refer to an above-average profusion of spring blooms. "But most folks will agree that a super bloom entails an unusually large and colorful display of wildflowers that result from substantial and well-timed rains."
The bottom line: 2023 is shaping up to be an outstanding spring for wildflowers. Some spots will hit super-bloom levels, though they are unlikely to be as widespread as in 2019.
Be prepared for crowded conditions at some wildflower destinations, and be certain to practice leave-no-trace principles -- stay on designated trails and roads, pack out all trash and don't trample or pick flowers in your quest for a perfect photo. Walker Canyon in Lake Elsinore, Calif., is currently closed to visitors after suffering damage as a major destination during the 2019 super bloom.
Check the Theodore Payne Foundation Wildflower Hotline for bloom updates in Southern and Central California, and both California and Arizona provide updated wildflower reports for their state parks. For all destinations, visit park websites when planning your visit for more flower updates, safety tips and more.
Here are 10 destinations for bloom-seekers to visit in California and Arizona, listed roughly from north to south in each state.
California
Carrizo Plain National Monument
What: A swath of grassland in the center of Central California just over an hour from San Luis Obispo, Carrizo Plain National Monument is shaping up to have a particularly stunning year for wildflowers, with hillside daisies, baby blue eyes and phacelia already blooming and more to come.
When: While there are already ample blooms to be found, park officials are expecting the flowers to peak in the coming weeks and last through the month, depending on weather. Visit the park's website and social media for updates on flowers and the condition of roads, some of which have been rendered impassable by recent storms.
Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve
What: An hour-and-a-half north of Los Angeles, the grasslands of the Mojave Desert come alive with golden orange California poppies, along with filaree and goldfields.
When: The poppies are in bloom, with more anticipated in the coming weeks; expect to find blooms in the reserve from early- to mid-May. You can check on the up-to-the-minute bloom status via the park's live poppy cam, and be sure to drive with caution on Lancaster Road; erratic driving and random stops for photos are to be expected, according to the park's website.
Channel Islands National Park
What: This stunning string of islands off the coast of Oxnard and Ventura is a destination for largely untouched wilderness, and is accessible via a one- to four- hour ferry ride with a park service contractor or private watercraft. Look for lupines, goldfields, blue dicks and giant coreopsis.
When: Bloom timing differs across the five islands, since each has a unique environment. Santa Barbara Island is expecting blooms from mid-April to early May, while San Miguel Island should bloom in early May. Visit dedicated island websites for more information.
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
What: Hugging the California coast north of Malibu and easily accessible from Los Angeles, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is expecting to have a super bloom, of sorts, with a wide variety of flowers, including white popcorn flowers, cream chaparral yucca flowers, purple lupines and more.
When: Blooms, including poppies, sunflowers and Mariposa lilies, are already popping up amid the mountains, which are lush and green from the extensive rains. Expect flowers to peak this month and into May, with some higher elevation areas blooming into the summer months. Check the What's Blooming newsletter from the park for updates.
Chino Hills State Park
What: Tucked in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains just east of Los Angeles, and about an hour's drive away, Chino Hills State Park is a much-photographed destination for hills lush with orange California poppies, plus black mustard, school bells, Canterbury bells and arroyo lupine.
When: The park is in bloom. Expect flowers through early- to mid-May. Check the park website for flower news and park updates; recent storms have caused extensive trail closures.
Cabrillo National Monument
What: San Diego's Cabrillo National Monument, which commemorates where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first stepped on the West Coast of the United States (the first European to do so), is also a bona fide flower destination. It perches on the tip of the Point Loma Peninsula, and visitors to the park can look for bush sunflowers, Indian paintbrush, sea dahlias and more.
When: Blooms are approaching their peak. Study up using the park's plant field guide, or download a dedicated app. Passionate wildflower enthusiasts can become a park volunteer and help with native plant preservation and propagation (email to learn more).
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park
What: California's largest state park, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, is two hours east of San Diego and is a frequent destination for wildflower viewing. The desert climate allows for some of the earlier blooms in California, including desert primrose, desert sunflower and blooming cactuses.
When: Because of the park's size, different sections get different amounts of rainfall. Parts of the park are already in bloom, and you can expect to find pockets of flowers through the spring and into early summer. Check the park's website for wildflower updates and photos.
Arizona
Lost Dutchman State Park
What: Forty miles east of Phoenix, at the base of the Superstition Mountains, Lost Dutchman State Park is named for a storied, vanished gold mine and is home to a variety of beautiful desert flowers, including chuparosa, lupines, fiddlenecks and Patagonia lilies.
When: The park started blooming in mid-March. Visit the park's Facebook page for weekly updates.
Picacho Peak State Park
What: About 75 miles south of Phoenix and 40 miles north of Tucson, Picacho Peak State Park boasted a true super bloom in March, with blankets of yellow poppies and purple lupines cascading down the mountain.
When: While the super bloom has passed and the poppies are fading, visitors can still find plenty of flowers in the weeks to come.
Catalina State Park
What: Just outside of Tucson, Catalina State Park is crouched at the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains and is a year-round destination for cactuses and desert plants, which are particularly stunning in bloom.
When: Cold weather has delayed the flowers at this park a bit, but blooms are now happening in earnest. Visit the park's Facebook page for the latest.

Fewer Voters Visited Untrustworthy Sites In 2020, Study Finds: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly 68 million Americans still visited untrustworthy websites 1.5 billion times in a month, according to Stanford researchers, causing concerns for 2024.
Not long after misinformation plagued the 2016 election, journalists and content moderators scrambled to turn Americans away from untrustworthy websites before the 2020 vote.
A new study suggests that, to some extent, their efforts succeeded.
When Americans went to the polls in 2020, a far smaller portion had visited websites containing false and misleading narratives compared with four years earlier, according to researchers at Stanford. Although the number of such sites ballooned, the average visits among those people dropped, along with the time spent on each site.
Efforts to educate people about the risk of misinformation after 2016, including content labels and media literacy training, most likely contributed to the decline, the researchers found. Their study was published on Thursday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.
"I am optimistic that the majority of the population is increasingly resilient to misinformation on the web," said Jeff Hancock, the founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab and the lead author of the report. "We're getting better and better at distinguishing really problematic, bad, harmful information from what's reliable or entertainment."
Still, nearly 68 million people in the United States checked out websites that were not credible, visiting 1.5 billion times in a month in 2020, the researchers estimated. That included domains that are now defunct, such as theantimedia.com and obamawatcher.com. Some people in the study visited some of those sites hundreds of times.
As the 2024 election approaches, the researchers worry that misinformation is evolving and splintering. Beyond web browsers, many people are exposed to conspiracy theories and extremism simply by scrolling through mobile apps such as TikTok. More dangerous content has shifted onto encrypted messaging apps with difficult-to-trace private channels, such as Telegram or WhatsApp.
The boom in generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot, has also raised alarms about deceptive images and mass-produced falsehoods.
The Stanford researchers said that even limited or concentrated exposure to misinformation could have serious consequences. Baseless claims of election fraud incited a riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. More than two years later, congressional hearings, criminal trials and defamation court cases are still addressing what happened.
The Stanford researchers monitored the online activity of 1,151 adults from Oct. 2 through Nov. 9, 2020, and found that 26.2 percent visited at least one of 1,796 unreliable websites. They noted that the time frame did not include the postelection period when baseless claims of voter fraud were especially pronounced.
That was down from an earlier, separate report that found that 44.3 percent of adults visited at least one of 490 problematic domains in 2016.
The shrinking audience may have been influenced by attempts, including by social media companies, to mitigate misinformation, according to the researchers. They noted that 5.6 percent of the visits to untrustworthy sites in 2020 originated from Facebook, down from 15.1 percent in 2016. Email also played a smaller role in sending users to such sites in 2020.
Other researchers have highlighted more ways to limit the lure of misinformation, especially around elections. The Bipartisan Policy Center suggested in a report this week that states adopt direct-to-voter texts and emails that offer vetted information.
Social media companies should also do more to discourage performative outrage and so-called groupthink on their platforms -- behavior that can fortify extreme subcultures and intensify polarization, said Yini Zhang, an assistant communication professor at the University at Buffalo.
Professor Zhang, who published a study this month about QAnon, said tech companies should instead encourage more moderate engagement, even by renaming "like" buttons to something like "respect."
"For regular social media users, what we can do is dial back on the tribal instincts, to try to be more introspective and say: 'I'm not going to take the bait. I'm not going to pile on my opponent,"' she said.
With next year's presidential election looming, researchers said they are concerned about populations known to be vulnerable to misinformation, such as older people, conservatives and people who do not speak English.
More than 37 percent of people older than 65 visited misinformation sites in 2020 -- a far higher rate than younger groups but an improvement from 56 percent in 2016, according to the Stanford report. In 2020, 36 percent of people who supported President Donald J. Trump in the election visited at least one misinformation site, compared with nearly 18 percent of people who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. The participants also completed a survey that included questions about their preferred candidate.
Mr. Hancock said that misinformation should be taken seriously, but that its scale should not be exaggerated. The Stanford study, he said, showed that the news consumed by most Americans was not misinformation but that certain groups of people were most likely to be targeted. Treating conspiracy theories and false narratives as an ever-present, wide-reaching threat could erode the public's trust in legitimate news sources, he said.
"I still think there's a problem, but I think it's one that we're dealing with and that we're also recognizing doesn't affect most people most of the time," Mr. Hancock said. "If we are teaching our citizens to be skeptical of everything, then trust is undermined in all the things that we care about."

How Putin Became a Hero By Permeating African TV: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pro-Russian content presenting a distorted version of the war in Ukraine and promoting Russia's interests in Africa is gaining an audience on the continent.
In South Africa, a social media influencer who added "Vladimir" to his Twitter name to convey his reverence for the Russian president transmits Russian-generated content over Twitter and Telegram to a growing audience that now numbers 148,000 followers.
On Afrique Média, a television channel based in Cameroon that reaches millions of people in Africa and recently signed a partnership with RT, the state-funded Russian television network, pundits regularly praise Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with one recently declaring, "Glory to Putin."
An animated video circulating online -- and a cause of alarm in one newly revealed U.S. intelligence document -- shows a brave Russian commando from the Wagner group, which is fighting for Russia in Ukraine, joining West African soldiers to defeat a horde of invading zombies from France.
Over the past year, a flood of pro-Russian content has increasingly been surfacing on news outlets and social media platforms in Africa. The messages aim to drum up support for the invasion of Ukraine, and to frame Russia's growing presence on the African continent as beneficial, while vilifying American and European -- especially French -- involvement in Africa.
Among the U.S. intelligence documents found leaked last week is a report saying that Russia's military intelligence agency in February planned a propaganda campaign using African media to "realign" public opinion in Africa with Russia, away from the West.
A broad mix of media has been carrying this content, including influencers on social media and news websites and television networks that have signed partnerships with Kremlin-funded operations.
Some of the outlets, according to experts, are affiliated with the Wagner group, the Kremlin-backed network that is operating in several African countries, seeding disinformation while sending thousands of mercenaries to prop up friendly governments and mine for gold and other natural resources.
"Russian fake news is produced on an industrial scale here," said Abdoulaye Guindo, the coordinator of Benbere, a fact-checking website based in Mali, where the Wagner group has a sizable presence. "The prowess of pro-Russian accounts is undeniable."
At the same time, the reach of Western news outlets has been dwindling on some parts of the continent. The BBC is cutting dozens of journalists in Africa and shutting down at least three channels broadcasting in local African languages, part of a broader retrenchment.
Radio France Internationale and France 24, which are publicly funded French outlets, have been suspended in Mali and Burkina Faso, where leaders aligned with Russia have expelled French reporters. Such bans and expulsions "have created space for media favorable to a pro-Russian narrative," Reporters Without Borders said in a recent study.
From the Central African Republic to Madagascar, Mali to South Africa, Russia aims to position itself as a bulwark against the West in Africa. That influence became even more apparent to Western governments when 26 of the continent's 54 countries refused to join a U.N. vote condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Interviews with more than two dozen government officials, analysts and journalists show how media and disinformation operations are promoting Russian interests in Africa.
"We're facing a juggernaut," said Gen. Pascal Ianni, a French military official in charge of countering Russia's disinformation operations in West Africa.
Help from China
Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union suspended the Kremlin-backed television network RT (short for Russia Today).
Since then, RT has expanded its operations in Africa and has been developing an "English language Africa hub" in Johannesburg to "cover the broadest possible range of stories that are of interest to local audiences and RT's international viewers alike," said Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor in chief, in response to questions.
Western countries, she said, have long sought "to curtail our journalistic work and stifle the perspectives we bring to public attention."
RT's French-speaking channel, RT France, had also sought to relocate from Europe to a Francophone country in West Africa, according to Séga Diarrah, a Malian journalist who said he had been commissioned by RT France's president to work on the move.
Those plans have not yet materialized, so Russia is also distributing its material through friendly African media outlets and influencers. RT and Sputnik, a Kremlin-funded news agency, have signed partnerships with at least a dozen African news outlets, said Maxime Audinet, who studies Russia's media operations in Africa at IRSEM, a research institute affiliated with the French defense ministry.
Afrique Média, which broadcasts from the Central African nation of Cameroon, announced a partnership with RT in December. "The end of the West's misleading propaganda," it said on a news banner.
Sputnik has rebranded its French-speaking service, once primarily aimed at reaching an audience in France, into Sputnik Afrique. Now most of its traffic, albeit shrunken, comes from African countries. In Mali, a Bamako-based radio station now broadcasts a Sputnik news podcast every evening.
"This is Moscow's way to expand across Africa," said Mr. Diarrah, the Malian journalist. "With mercenaries and media outlets."
Social media influencers also play an important role.
From his home just outside Johannesburg, Modibe "Vladimir" Modiba reposts video content from RT over Twitter and from his own news blog on Telegram. In an interview, he maintained that he is paid by family and friends -- not by Russia. He said his attitudes reflected growing "irritation" among young Black South Africans toward the West and to mainstream South African media.
Western countries, he said, "always want to interfere with African issues, or you're here to steal our resources."
There is also evidence of Chinese companies helping spread Russian content in Africa. StarTimes, a Beijing-based media and satellite television provider, has continued to make RT available to customers even as other companies dropped the channel following the war.
As part of a content-sharing agreement, Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, translated items from the Russian state news service, Interfax, which were then picked up by outlets in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries. Some articles promoted the false allegation that the United States was storing chemical weapons inside Ukraine, according to Dani Madrid-Morales, a disinformation expert at the University of Sheffield.
Russian heroes and French zombies
From 2019 to 2022, Meta took down at least eight different networks of accounts that were targeting African audiences on Facebook and Instagram, the company says. Many were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner network, according to Meta. Facebook pages in Mali also pushed pro-Wagner messages, just as Wagner mercenaries were arriving in the country last year.
The media campaigns have since grown more sophisticated and visible, said General Ianni, the French military official.
In an animated video that circulated on social media this year, a commando wearing a uniform emblazoned with the Russian flag and the insignia of the Wagner group jumps from a helicopter to come to the rescue of two besieged African soldiers, from Mali and Burkina Faso.
Together, the African soldiers and their Russian ally defeat France, the former colonial power, depicted as a pack of menacing zombielike skeletons and a giant snake. At the end of the video, the three head to the Ivory Coast -- traditionally an ally of the West.
"Happy to help," the Russian soldier tells his West African counterparts.
African and Western intelligence and military officials said they were alarmed by both the message and the format: Animated videos can reach even audiences who can't read.
According to a U.S. document found to be leaked this week, dated from February, the Ivorian President's chief of staff summoned Russia's ambassador to Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso to express "displeasure" with the video depicting Ivory Coast as the "next target" of the Wagner network.
Russia and the West have long competed for influence in Africa, and the use of influence operations and mercenaries there is not a Russian invention.
But with Russia shunned by much of the Western world over its invasion of Ukraine, it is now making a bid to pull more African countries into its orbit. And the Russian-generated media is having an impact, said Yurii Pyvovarov, Ukraine's ambassador to Senegal and to four other West African countries.
He said that a senior minister in Senegal asked him why Ukraine had attacked Russia -- a falsehood often promoted in Russian media. And Senegalese journalists asked him why Ukraine was harboring Nazis -- citing a propaganda article from Sputnik as proof.
"If African states are so attached to neutrality, which I fully respect, why are they so attached to Russian narratives?" Mr. Pyvovarov said in an interview.
Pro-Russian content on the war in Ukraine still dominates the coverage of television networks like Afrique Média, potentially shaping the views of generations of viewers.
Henri Doué Taï, 80, a retired oil company administrator, watches the channel from his living room in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city. A framed photograph of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, sat nestled among family pictures.
He was joined by his 41-year-old nephew, Serge Bah, who had studied oil engineering in Moscow. Mr. Bah said he preferred watching Afrique Média, Russia Today or a little-known Telegram channel that carries updates on the war in French.
Unlike Western news outlets that show biased coverage of the war in Ukraine, these sources, Mr. Bah insisted, are independent.
"It's firsthand material," he said.

New Dining Delights Are Closer Than You Think: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: It's closer than you think.
I have a bit of a reputation: If you're planning on going to Philadelphia, talk to Nikita. I'm by no means an expert, but I visit our sister city (brother city?) three or four times a year -- and I think you should, too!
The mental block that seems to keep many New Yorkers from heading to Philly -- besides the sports fandom -- is the distance. But by car, bus or train, it's a surprisingly easy two-hour trip, and an ideal weekend destination for the food-obsessed. This guide is not exhaustive or filled with deep cuts, but it's a starting point for what I hope will become your own love affair with one of my favorite places.
First Stop, South Philly
You may be inclined to start your day in Center City, the busy downtown area, but I recommend heading to South Philly instead. We're not going for cheesesteaks or for the heavenly South Philly Barbacoa, but for Mexican at a much newer spot, El Chingon. A few months ago, a friend invited me to lunch at the restaurant, on a quiet corner near Passyunk Square, from the chef Carlos Aparicio, a veteran of the local fine-dining scene.
El Chingon is more diner than fine dining, but it's no less exciting or delicious. The menu is rooted in the Puebla region, with shrimp and calamari aguachile, cemitas served on housemade bread, and tacos, like the arabes packed with marinated pork. I should mention that the tortillas are of the sourdough variety, which gives every bite a pleasant tang. It's also B.Y.O.B., so feel free to grab a four-pack from the nearby Cartesian Brewing to take to dinner.
If you're craving world-altering Vietnamese food, you have no choice but to visit Gabriella's Vietnam, the two-year-old restaurant from the chef Thanh Nguyen, also in South Philly. It was one of our reporter Priya Krishna's favorite restaurants of 2022, and for good reason: It has style and substance. Order the catfish hotpot with a tangy, sweet broth, and the artfully arranged water fern dumplings "topped with crackled pork and shrimp."
And on weekends, if you happen to be there, Gabriella's serves a Vietnamese-style brunch with dishes like chả lụa pork sausage on a toasty banh mi baguette, and fish-sauce-fried chicken and waffles with coconut syrup.
Fishtown Has Options
Is it time to go to Center City now? Nope, we're headed to Fishtown. Yes, this is pretty much the equivalent of telling a New York City tourist to spend the afternoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But like Williamsburg, Fishtown is teeming with options, which makes it a perfect place to hang out between your morning visit to the Barnes Foundation or the Eastern State Penitentiary or the Italian Market, and your evening meal.
Grab a coffee at what, I believe, is the city's largest La Colombe, or the L.G.B.T.Q.-owned Persimmon Coffee near the corner of Frankford and East Girard. Enjoy an afternoon tipple at the Middle Child Clubhouse, which has been hyped to death but really can't be beat for that liminal time of day when you have nothing to do but need a break from all the walking. (Beer heads should opt for Bottle Bar East.)
And then go to Kalaya. In a crowded restaurant scene, it stands out. A lot of that can be chalked up to its co-owner Nok Suntaranon, who is as singular as the Thai food she's known for, like duck larb salad and garlic chive rice cakes. And then you can drive or hop a bus or train home just like that -- and start planning your next visit to Philly.
In Other News ...
This week Pete Wells reviewed Hav & Mar, the newest restaurant from the chef Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster fame. The seafood-focused project combines Samuelsson's Ethiopian heritage with his Swedish upbringing.
Openings: The restaurant and bakery Greywind, from the chef Dan Kluger, of Loring Place, will open near Hudson Yards on Wednesday; as will Knock Knock in Long Island City, with a menu that reflects the Chinese heritage of its owners; and Revelie Luncheonette, from the team behind the SoHo bistro Raoul's, is now open on Prince Street for lunch.
Tejal Rao wrote about the world that has sprung up around the food at Disney parks, most of which is created in a "flavor lab" at Disney World.
Papaya King, the Upper East Side restaurant specializing in hot dogs and juices, will move across the street from its original location, Christina Morales reports.

A Social App for Gamers Finds Itself at the Center Of a Controversy, Again: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Browning, Kellen

Full text: Discord gained popularity among gamers. But as it has become mainstream, it has run into controversy over the past few years.
Discord, the eight-year-old social media and messaging platform popular among young people and video game players that has increasingly become a mainstream part of the internet, has once again run into controversy.
Leaked Pentagon documents were said to have been circulating on the platform as early as March before appearing on other sites. The leaks are the latest incident in recent years in which Discord has played a key role.
How did Discord get its start?
Discord was introduced in 2015 by Jason Citron, a video game player and computer programmer. Mr. Citron's game development studio was struggling to find traction, so he created a chat application that people could use to communicate with one another while playing games.
The platform was a niche product until the pandemic, when young people were searching for ways to chat with their friends and joining online communities. By late 2021, it had more than 150 million active users each month, up from 56 million in 2019. It was most recently valued at $ 14.7 billion, according to PitchBook, a market data provider.
What is a Discord server?
Discord is similar to the workplace tool Slack. There is no central social feed or timeline with posts for users to scroll through. Instead, it is split into servers -- essentially, chat rooms -- designed for specific groups or interests. Those servers are divided further into individual, topic-based channels.
Users can join public Discord servers, some of which have millions of members. Some servers are dedicated to discussion of specific games, like League of Legends or Fortnite, while others are communities for people to discuss art, music or artificial intelligence. They are similar to Facebook groups.
There are also private Discord servers, which require an invitation to join. These are often smaller communities, sometimes for a group of friends to message one another while they are online, just like an iMessage group chat. Because of the nature of these small, private servers, they often lack the moderation or platform oversight that a larger public server would have.
What are Discord's content moderation policies?
Discord has faced several controversies over the years regarding harmful content on its platform, including white nationalists organizing the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 on Discord servers, and the shooter who killed 10 people at a Buffalo grocery store posting his plans and racist messages on the platform before his attack last year.
The company has said that it has become more serious about content moderation, and that 15 percent of its more than 900 employees work on its trust and safety teams. Discord's community guidelines prohibit hate speech, harassment, threats, violent extremism, child sexual abuse material and misinformation. It was unclear whether the leaked documents violated the company's guidelines.
Enforcing its policies has been a tricky issue for Discord, particularly because of the small and private nature of many of its servers. The company has strengthened its automated tools for detecting harassing or offensive messages. It is also reliant on members of Discord servers to report violations to the company. Many Discord servers function as their own miniature governments, with the creator of the server deputizing other members to enforce the rules and giving them the power to prohibit miscreants from sending messages or kick them out of the server entirely.
How does Discord work with law enforcement?
Discord works with law enforcement officials by turning over user information and preserving records when it has received an "enforceable legal process," the company said in an online description of its policies. It also works with agencies when there are cases of "immediate danger" or "self-harm."
Last year, the company said it was doing "everything we can to assist law enforcement in the investigation" of the Buffalo shooter's postings on its platform. Within a few days of the attack, the company posted on its website that it had banned the shooter's account and deleted the server on which he posted his diary. Discord said Sunday that it was working with the authorities on the leaked Pentagon documents, as well.
"In regards to the apparent breach of classified material, we are cooperating with law enforcement," a company spokeswoman said in a statement. "As this remains an active investigation, we cannot provide further comment at this time."

FRONT PAGE
An article on Sunday about leaked Pentagon documents that reveal Russia's military struggles misstated the name of a U.S. law on national security surveillance. It is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, not the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act.
An article on Monday about North Carolina's role in the fight for Medicaid expansion misquoted Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina. He said: "They immediately sued me in federal court to stop me. And we could have set it aside at that point, but we persisted, and that's because we knew it was too important." He did not say, "They sued me in federal court to stop it, and we kind of set it aside."
An article on Saturday about risky moves from tech companies to win the race for artificial intelligence misstated the number of years that have passed since Microsoft shut down a chatbot called Tay. It was seven years ago, not five.
BUSINESS
An article on Friday about continued unproven claims online about Dominion Voting Systems misstated an election change that Shasta County approved last month. The county voted to hand-count paper ballots. It did not vote to use paper ballots, which were already in use.
An article on Saturday about Amazon's plan to release movies in theaters misstated the name of an AMC movie theater in Las Vegas. It is AMC Town Square, not AMC Town Center.
SPORTS
A picture caption with an article on Monday about Jon Rahm's victory in the Masters Tournament omitted the name of the golfer who shot a final-round score of 75. It was Brooks Koepka, not Rahm; Rahm shot a 69.
OPINION
An article on Friday about online advertising described a statistic about ad expenditures by Jeremy's Razors on Facebook incorrectly. In the 30 days ending March 26, Jeremy's Razors was the biggest ad buyer among advertisers whose spending is disclosed in Facebook's ad trans­parency reports, not the most overall.

Full text: The death of Ethan Boyes, 44, a cyclist who was struck by a car in the Presidio, highlights the city's struggles to reduce traffic fatalities.
A track cycling champion died after a car struck him while he was riding this week in San Francisco, a high-profile fatality that highlighted the city's struggles to reduce traffic deaths.
The cyclist, Ethan Boyes, 44, was struck around 4 p.m. on Tuesday at an intersection in the Presidio, the United States Park Police said in a statement.
The agency said Mr. Boyes was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries and was later pronounced dead.
The driver of the car, who was not publicly identified, was also transported to the hospital, with injuries that were not life-threatening. It was not immediately clear whether the driver was facing charges.
The police said they were working with federal prosecutors "as the investigation progresses."
The accident shocked the San Francisco cycling community, not just because of the loss of life but also because it happened in an area where bicycle safety activists have repeatedly called for improvements.
The heavily used cycling route connecting Golden Gate Park and the Presidio, a nearly 1,500-acre park at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge, has been a safety concern for cyclists for years.
The narrow and curvy stretch where Mr. Boyes was killed has painted bike lanes but no buffered space or bollards.
The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, a bike safety advocacy group, described Mr. Boyes as a "champion bicycle racer and beloved figure in the bicycling community." In a statement, the group demanded "immediate action" to protect cyclists in the park.
"One traffic fatality is one too many," it said.
San Francisco, like other large American cities, is working toward a "Vision Zero" plan of eliminating traffic deaths by 2024. However, the city last year recorded the largest number of traffic fatalities since at least 2014, with 20 pedestrian deaths, 16 motor vehicle or motorcycle deaths and one bicycle fatality.
"This stretch of Arguello Boulevard has two unprotected, paint-only bike lanes, which allows drivers to drive recklessly at unsafe speeds and may have contributed to Ethan's death," Luke Bornheimer, a sustainable transportation advocate, said in a statement. "There is simple infrastructure that is proven to increase safety for all people -- including drivers -- and make people feel safer riding bikes."
According to USA Cycling, Mr. Boyes was the reigning masters track world champion in the men's 40-44 age group for the time trial and sprint events, and he held several records in his age group, including from a flying start race (when cyclists start already in motion as opposed to from a standstill) in Aguascalientes, Mexico, in 2018, at a high-altitude track.
Track cycling, which encompasses a number of different racing formats, is a different cycling discipline than the better-known multistage distance road events, such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.
Events in track cycling are held on 250-meter banked, oval indoor tracks and, depending on the event, can require riders to use a tremendous amount of force on the pedals and handlebars to get the bicycle's wheels moving from a dead stop.
"Beyond Ethan's athletic achievements, he was an upstanding member of the American track cycling community," USA Cycling said in a statement on Facebook. "His loss will be felt at local, regional, national, and world events for years, as he brought a mixture of competition and friendliness to every race."
The fatal crash involving Mr. Boyes was the latest in a string of high-profile episodes in San Francisco this week.
Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App, was stabbed to death near the Bay Bridge, and Don Carmignani, a former San Francisco fire commissioner, was attacked with a metal pipe and knife in the Marina district.

Full text: A reader who has been dating her boyfriend for a year is unsure of how to negotiate his grief over the death of his wife, who was debilitated by severe dementia.
My boyfriend's wife died this week. For years, she lived with severe dementia -- unable to walk, feed herself or communicate. I respect that she was my boyfriend's great love and the mother of his adult children. Still, we have been dating for a year and are solidly in love. Some people disapprove, but we think we were respectful of his wife and family. We agreed that I should stay away from him now and from her funeral to keep the focus on his wife. We've had several discussions about what would happen after she died. I suggested he may want to play the field, but he was adamant about being with me. He is grieving now, but what should I do down the road -- let him bounce back into my life or insist he take time on his own?
GIRLFRIEND
I am not a grief counselor, but in my experience there is little point in trying to plan grief. It often takes unexpected paths, hitting us harder or later or just plain differently than we might have predicted. Here, you may think your boyfriend had a head start grieving his wife, given her diminished state. But he may be clobbered by grief. (He may also feel guilty about having moved on before she died -- not that he should.)
Try to take the future one day at a time. Your relationship with your boyfriend grew out of complicated circumstances. Now, he will be mourning his wife and his marriage, and his feelings for you and your complex relationship may be all over the place. So take care of yourself. No matter what your boyfriend thought he would want before his wife died, he may feel differently now that she has.
I hope both of you are open to counseling and support groups for those who have lost loved ones and those affected by dementia. I suspect your situation is not uncommon in some of those groups. And I wish you the best as you navigate your relationship amid fresh loss.
When Mom Can't Crack Her Daughters' Guest List
My oldest sister is having a big birthday this year. I've been planning a surprise all-sisters trip to celebrate for months. I mentioned it to my mother over the holidays. She has since learned of our weekend agenda and is under the impression that she's invited. I love my mom, but this trip was meant for her grown daughters. Can I tell her delicately that she's not invited?
DAUGHTER
I may be the wrong person to ask. I would give anything to be able to go on a trip with my mother again. In fairness, that's not your situation -- though it will be one day. Still, it seems unkind to tell your mother about a getaway with all her daughters and then exclude her from it.
You don't say how she came to be "under the impression" that she is invited or for how long she has labored under that belief. I would include her in any event. Enforcing your sisters-only concept seems mean if it requires barring the woman who connects you all. Next time: Shh!
A Friend's Request: Walk Me First, Then Your Dog
For years, I walked the neighborhood with a friend. We met at 7 a.m., got our exercise in and caught up on life. Out of nowhere, she started bringing a dog she inherited when her mother died. The dog is unruly -- stopping and starting, peeing on everything and barking at other dogs. Our formerly enjoyable walks became intolerable. I asked her nicely if she could leave the dog with her husband and take it out later. (She doesn't work.) She said if I wouldn't allow the dog, she wouldn't be coming, either. She dropped me like a stone after 15 years of friendship. What would you do?
FRIEND
Look at this from your friend's perspective: Her mother died, and she inherited a dog that needs a morning walk. Rather than waiting for her to get the hang of walking with you and the dog together, though, you suggested she add a second walk to her morning routine to accommodate you. That may have seemed selfish to her.
I would call her to apologize. Don't get me wrong: It may not work for you to walk with her (and the dog) anymore. But you can probably salvage your friendship by empathizing with her.
Recycle Your Empties, Escape With Your Spares
I am a sommelier. Often, I am invited to dinners with the understanding that I will bring the wine. I like doing it. I know I'll enjoy the wines I bring, and I like introducing them to people. Usually, I bring way too much: I don't know the exact menu or how much the guests will drink. Is it rude for me to take home the unopened bottles?
GUEST
Hang on! Do hosts actually ask you to bring all the wine, or do you offer? (I think I'm Diamond Jim when I bring two bottles to a dinner party.) Use your words here. When you and the host are discussing the evening, say: "I'll bring several bottles of wine and take home what we don't drink, OK?" No way to misunderstand that -- or your generosity, either.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

Twitter Acts To Halt Rival In Substack: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk's company made the norm-shattering move two days after the publishing start-up Substack unveiled a Twitter-like service.
SAN FRANCISCO -- On Wednesday, the newsletter service Substack announced that it had built a Twitter competitor. On Thursday, Twitter prevented Substack writers from sharing tweets in their newsletters. And on Friday, Twitter took steps to block Substack newsletters from circulating on the platform.
Twitter's move to swat an upstart was an abrupt deviation from normal behavior among internet companies and publishers. It also provided more grist for critics who say that while Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, has often hailed the importance of free speech, he has not shied from restricting competitors and content that he doesn't like.
The new fight with a young company is the latest controversy in Mr. Musk's chaotic ownership of Twitter, which he acquired about six months ago. He has laid off more than 75 percent of its employees, has been sued by commercial landlords for failing to pay office rent and has lost advertisers.
While Mr. Musk has long clashed with mainstream news outlets, targeting Substack largely affects independent writers, some of whom depend on Twitter to drive readers to their work.
"This is a huge inconvenience," said Hunter Harris, a writer who distributes her newsletter, Hung Up, on Substack. "It's incredibly petty."
Substack's founders, Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi, said in a statement that they were "disappointed" by Twitter's decision to stifle engagement with any tweets that featured a Substack link.
"Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else," they said. "This abrupt change is a reminder of why writers deserve a model that puts them in charge, that rewards great work with money and that protects the free press and free speech."
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Twitter and Substack share a major investor, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which could be called to play referee in the spat. A spokeswoman for Andreessen Horowitz, which led a $ 65 million investment round in Substack in 2021 and invested $ 400 million in Mr. Musk's Twitter last year, did not respond to a request for comment.
Substack's new feature, called Notes, mimics Twitter in several ways. It allows users to post brief updates and lets other people like, repost or reply to them. The changes by Twitter on Friday meant that Twitter users could still share links to Substack newsletters, but blocked other users from liking or resharing those links.
Before Mr. Musk acquired it, Twitter sometimes restricted likes and retweets as a way to prevent content that violated its policies from spreading widely on the platform. The measure was used to limit the reach of former President Donald J. Trump's tweets in which he made false assertions about how votes would be counted in the 2020 election.
Twitter has been an important distribution outlet for Substack authors, many of whom are independent of traditional media outlets and rely on subscriptions to make money.
Some of Substack's most popular writers have been vocal supporters of Mr. Musk, who gave them special access to comb through and release the "Twitter Files," internal communications that the billionaire said showed the biases of Twitter's previous management. One of those writers, Matt Taibbi, said in a tweet on Friday that he was "alarmed" and would leave Twitter because of its Substack restrictions and post on Substack Notes instead.
The changes outraged writers who use both Twitter and Substack to distribute their work. "I cannot explain how absurd and silly this is," Rohit Krishnan, who writes the newsletter Strange Loop Canon, wrote in a tweet. "Not to mention petty and vindictive."
Ms. Harris said that, while Twitter did not drive significant traffic to her newsletter, the restrictions penalized her readers who might want to share links to her work or discuss it on Twitter. Preventing Substack writers from including tweets in their newsletters also stripped proper credit from Twitter users, she added.
"Any Twitter alternative would be great," Ms. Harris said of Substack's move to build a competitor. "I want another place just like Twitter that's not Twitter."
Other writers said Mr. Musk's latest move contradicted his statements about enabling free speech at Twitter.
"In cutting off access to Substack, Elon is banning access to free and highly informative content on the internet," said Simon Rosenberg, who writes a newsletter on politics. "It is censorship of the very worst kind."
The Substack kerfuffle is not the first time that Mr. Musk has blocked competing services from being shared on Twitter. In December, he suspended Twitter users, including several journalists, for linking to Mastodon after a Mastodon user shared public information about the location of Mr. Musk's private jet.
He went on to bar users from sharing links to Facebook, Instagram and several other social media companies, but reversed course after a backlash. Under pressure from supporters who saw the move as an abandonment of his free speech principles, Mr. Musk said in December that he would step down as Twitter's chief executive once he found a replacement. Mr. Musk has not yet done so.
Mr. Musk has also escalated his long-running feud with mainstream media. Last Saturday, he revoked The New York Times's verification check mark, which had distinguished its Twitter account from impersonators. Mr. Musk had said Twitter would start removing verification badges starting on April 1, but most verified accounts have kept their check marks.
On Wednesday, Twitter added a label to the Twitter account of NPR, calling it "state-sponsored media." The label, which the platform used in the past to identify propaganda outlets, sparked backlash from press freedom organizations. In emails to an NPR reporter on Wednesday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that the label "might not be accurate" and added, "We should fix it."
This week, Mr. Musk has made a number of unexplained changes to Twitter, replacing the company's bird logo for a few days with the image of a Shiba Inu dog that's associated with the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.
On Tuesday, the company also covered the letter "w" in the name "Twitter" on a large public sign outside its San Francisco headquarters, in what some observers assumed was a vulgar joke.

Hoping to Travel Abroad? Passport Applications Face a Processing Backlog.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Processing times for new and renewed passports have increased again. The updated timeline, 10 to 13 weeks, leaves some would-be travelers feeling desperate.
With international travel beckoning this summer, Americans applying for new or renewed passports will have to practice patience: The State Department warned that it will take even longer to get their documents.
As of March 24, routine processing of passports will take 10 to 13 weeks, and expedited processing, which costs an extra $ 60, will take seven to nine weeks. That's a two-week increase from the previous timeline.
Applicants have been frustrated for years over the passport application system. Staffing shortages during the pandemic continue to cause both extensive delays and a scarcity of in-person appointments.
Lawmakers have vowed to solve the backlog, and the State Department piloted an online renewal system that was briefly offered to the public before being paused. But with a surge of applications and an especially busy summer travel season ahead, any significant easing of the jams may be a distant reality.
Why is it taking so long to get a passport?
The current delays were set off at the beginning of the pandemic, when demand for travel documents dropped and employees were let go or reassigned to other tasks, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a recent budget hearing.
"Emerging from Covid, we had to build back. And we have been in an intense effort to do that," he said, adding that demand for travel has surged. In the 2022 fiscal year, the department issued nearly 22 million passports, the highest on record. The number in 2023 is expected to increase.
The department receives about 500,000 passport applications each week, about 30 percent more than during the same time last year.
"In 40 years, I can honestly tell you I've never seen it this bad," said David Alwadish, the founder of itseasy.com, a passport and visa expediting service. The bulk of Mr. Alwadish's clients have already paid for expedited processing, he said, and many are desperate to secure a passport in time for a trip.
Travelers who need documents within 14 days can call to book an in-person appointment at a passport center. But callers who are hoping to secure an appointment or get updates on their submitted application have reported long hold times. Multiple attempts in late March to call the number listed on the State Department's website were met with a busy tone. A spokesman for the department said they were increasing the number of lines and staff to handle the influx of calls.
What's being done to speed things up?
Mr. Blinken said that a task force has been established to speed up processing times. And hundreds of additional staff are in the hiring pipeline, according to a State Department spokeswoman. Existing staff are already working overtime, and others have been enlisted from across the department to help with the demand.
The budget for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which provides passport services to U.S. citizens, has also been increased by nearly $ 211 million. The increase has funded contract labor, higher postage costs and new initiatives like online passport renewal, which the government began testing last year to make it more convenient for existing passport holders to renew their documents.
What happened to the online renewal program?
More than 500,000 people successfully applied online to renew their passports since the service was first offered to the public in August 2022. The government suspended online renewal on March 8, 2023, saying it would review customer feedback and make improvements.
Though some users reported positive experiences with the online system, others were frustrated. Mina Zimmerman, a Los Angeles resident, submitted an expedited application on Jan. 24 to renew her passport in time for her 15th wedding anniversary, which she planned to celebrate in Mexico on April 2 -- plenty of buffer time, she thought, for what the government said would be a three- to five-week wait.
But five weeks after her application was received, it still hadn't been processed. Despite repeated phone calls, Ms. Zimmerman was never able to get through. At times she even had trouble loading the website.
"It was a terrible experience, because you just had no help anywhere," she said, adding that, as the date of her trip approached, she began to panic.
Ultimately, Ms. Zimmerman found help on Reddit. Other passport applicants advised her to call a tech support line, where she found help. Her passport finally arrived more than seven weeks after she applied, and two weeks before her trip.
"They definitely made the right decision to shut it down for now," she said of the online renewal program, adding that she thought the website needed to be better equipped to handle the traffic and offer regular updates.
What if I need to travel this year?
The consensus from immigration experts and officials is to check your passport expiration date before making international plans -- and to renew it as early as possible, if necessary.
With the online process suspended, applicants can still renew by mail or make appointments at passport acceptance facilities, which can include post offices, libraries and local government offices. Appointments are limited, however and some applicants have reported traveling beyond their local office to snag one. Fuji Whittenburg, the chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association State Department Liaison Committee, recommends taking care to ensure the forms are completely filled out and that the correct fees are included with a money order or check.
If possible, she said, opt for expedited passport processing ( $ 160 for a renewal for an adult, plus the $ 60 fee for expediting) and expedited postage ( $ 19.53) to mail your old passport and return the new passport. The entire process should take between seven and nine weeks, with a day or two on either end for shipping.
If you need to travel imminently, within 14 days, you can try to book an in-person appointment at a passport agency. If all else fails, both Ms. Whittenburg and Mr. Alwadish suggest reaching out to your congressperson or your senator with your passenger record locator.
If you want to avoid the ordeal a little longer? Travel within America, Mr. Alwadish said.

Full text: Mr. Berlusconi, who is in the intensive care unit at a Milan hospital, has had the blood disorder for "some time," his personal physician said.
Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, is being treated in the intensive care unit of a Milan hospital for a lung infection related to a kind of leukemia that he has "had for some time," his personal physician said on Thursday.
A medical bulletin issued by the physician, Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, said Mr. Berlusconi, 86, had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which was not acute, and that he was being treated for the lung infection and for the blood cancer. Dr. Fabio Ciceri, head of the hospital's hematology and bone marrow transplantation unit, co-signed the bulletin.
Mr. Berlusconi had been admitted to San Raffaele hospital on Wednesday, for what Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, a close ally of Mr. Berlusconi and a member of his political party, had described as "a problem related to a previous infection."
While Mr. Berlusconi has a history of medical problems, the announcement on Thursday was received throughout Italy with the sense of an era coming to a close. Politicians across the political spectrum spoke about how dominating a figure he had been on the national scene for nearly three decades.
Long before he entered politics, Mr. Berlusconi revolutionized Italian society via three privately owned TV channels that brought flashy game shows and day and nighttime American soap operas into Italian living rooms. He lived large, buying his hometown soccer team, AC Milan, in 1986 and propelling it to victory in national and European championships by investing millions.
Even though he was married, he cultivated a man-about-town image. Rumors of sex parties at his villas attracted the attention of prosecutors, who accused him of paying hush money to keep the young women who frequented the parties quiet. He was acquitted of bribery charges in February. But the so-called "bunga bunga" parties tarnished Mr. Berlusconi's reputation and ended his marriage to Veronica Lario, who publicly rebuked her husband for his involvement with young women.
Buoyed by Mr. Berlusconi's public notoriety, it took barely a few months for Forza Italia, the party he formally presented in January 1994, to win national elections. The party rode a wave of savvy political branding and voters' rejection of traditional parties as a result of the so-called Tangentopoli, or "Bribesville," scandal that toppled the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties that had dominated Italy's postwar years.
Leukemia experts who have not examined Mr. Berlusconi or the particulars of his case say that his reported diagnosis presents difficulties for a person his age.
The kind of cancer he has, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, usually occurs in older people. It results from mutations in the bone marrow that cause the marrow to produce too many blood cells. Patients can spend years in a chronic phase but, said Dr. Timony Ley, a leukemia expert at Washington University in St. Louis, "when it progresses to an acute phase it's really bad."
When that happens, Dr. Ley added, "outcomes are dismal, especially at this age where therapeutic options are limited because of toxicity."
The medical bulletin issued by San Raffaele noted that Mr. Berlusconi's type of cancer was in a "persistent chronic phase" and had not yet turned into "acute leukemia." The hospital said Mr. Berlusconi was being treated with cytoreductive therapy to reduce his blood cell count.
Throughout the day, family members and close friends visited the hospital, though few spoke to the reporters who converged there when Mr. Berlusconi was first admitted.
Mr. Berlusconi was treated for prostate cancer in 1997, though he did not publicly acknowledge it until three years later in a newspaper interview, saying at the time: "I went through a nightmare lasting months. I am cured. I managed to come out of the tunnel."
He also had a pacemaker installed in 2006 and had open-heart surgery to replace a faulty heart valve a decade later. In September 2020, he was knocked out by a case of Covid, which he described as an "infernal disease" and "very ugly."
He spent 10 days at San Raffaele then, returning to the hospital for a considerably longer stay 10 months later because of long-term effects from the coronavirus, according to Italian news reports.
Mr. Berlusconi spent four days at the hospital again last week, for what Italian news outlets reported were routine medical checks. After being discharged, he posted upbeat messages on his Facebook page, including a photo last Sunday showing him smiling outside his home, surrounded by tulips.
Several lawmakers with Forza Italia, Mr. Berlusconi's party, said he had called them earlier on Thursday, something they took as an encouraging sign.
"I was relieved after the call," said Paolo Barelli, the Forza Italia leader in the lower house of Parliament.
"His call is a sign of hope," said the Senate vice president, Maurizio Gasparri. "He was positive, he called others, telling us to be alert, on the game," Mr. Gasparri said, the ANSA news agency reported.
Mr. Berlusconi, elected three times as prime minister, won a seat again in Parliament in September after spending nearly a decade on the political sidelines after being banned from office following a tax fraud conviction in 2012. But he continued to act as a kingmaker on the national scene.
Leaving the hospital on Thursday afternoon, Fedele Confalonieri, a close friend and the president of Mediaset, a broadcast company founded by Mr. Berlusconi, told reporters that there "is concern, but we're optimistic."

TikTok's Strident Defenders? Chinese Officials.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company has tried to distance itself, but the information push shows just how deeply invested Beijing is in its fate.
When members of Congress grilled TikTok's chief executive last month on Capitol Hill, the app's supporters sprang to its defense online.
The lawmakers were "old, tech-illiterate," one said. "Out of touch, paranoid and self-righteous," said another. The hourslong hearing "destroyed the illusion that US leads in cyber era," read another post.
These particular barbs did not come from TikTok's users -- 150 million and counting in the United States -- but from representatives of China's government.
In an information campaign primarily run on Twitter, Chinese officials and state media organizations widely mocked the United States in the days before and after the hearing, accusing lawmakers of hypocrisy and even xenophobia for targeting the popular app, according to a report released on Thursday by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan initiative from the German Marshall Fund.
TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance, has sought to assure American lawmakers that it is independent from China's influence, and that it has extensive plans for securing Americans' data and providing oversight of its content recommendations. Shou Chew, TikTok's chief executive, explicitly said at the House hearing that ByteDance was "not owned or controlled by the Chinese government."
China's information push, however, showed just how deeply invested Beijing was in the company's fate. Just hours before Mr. Chew's testimony last month, China's Commerce Ministry said it opposed a sale of TikTok in a direct rebuke of the Biden administration, which is pushing a sale.
Chinese officials "clearly feel a stake in it," said Michael H. Posner, a former assistant secretary of state and now director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
The report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy found that Twitter accounts from Chinese diplomats and state media outlets posted nearly 200 tweets about TikTok in the week around the congressional hearing on March 23. That compared with fewer than 150 posts in all of January and February.
Chinese state media accounts also ran more than 30 stories about TikTok in outlets like China Daily, the report said. The researchers said in an interview that they had found similar content on Facebook and YouTube.
Asked about its support for TikTok, China's foreign ministry said it opposed American actions that violate market principles and rules under the World Trade Organization to target foreign companies. "What the U.S. should do is to stop smearing and slandering, and provide a fair, just, open, and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world," the statement said.
China's effort has echoes of its defense of another Chinese company that has found itself in the cross hairs of American legal and political controversy: Huawei, the telecommunications giant, which the United States has identified as a potential national security threat.
The scale and tone of China's criticism of the U.S. government have intensified, though, reflecting the sharp deterioration of relations between the two countries despite a halting effort last year by President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to reverse the decline.
"This is how the U.S. talks to the world," a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, wrote last month on Twitter, in English, with the hashtag #TikTokHearing.
Her post, which was retweeted more than 1,200 times, included a clip from TikTok showing Representative Kat Cammack, Republican of Florida, who during the hearing called the app "an extension" of the Communist Party of China. When Mr. Chew asked for a chance to respond, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington and the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it was time to move on.
"What I think is surprising is how direct the attacks against U.S. lawmakers were," said Etienne Soula, a research analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy who wrote the report with Lindsay Gorman. "It's par for the course for them to go after the U.S. system in general, saying it's dysfunctional, that democracy doesn't work and that it's not a real democracy." It is far less common, he added, to see "very open insults."
Chinese officials, including diplomats around the globe, have become adept at using social media -- including platforms like Twitter and Facebook that are banned in China -- to spread their political views to an international audience. The latest campaign, however, sought to directly influence the political debate in the United States.
Posts by officials and state media mocked the political process. At least one stoked speculation of a potential "Gen Z rebellion" if lawmakers or the administration succeeded in banning the app or forcing its sale, as the Biden administration had been proposing.
"China is careful not to interfere with other countries' internal affairs or internal politics, so to have them weigh in so openly to encourage voters to riot -- it's outside the ordinary," Mr. Soula said.
Other posts compared tense photos of the roughly five-hour hearing with pictures of Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who was visiting China around the same time and smiling and posing with locals.
"Isn't it clear which side supports free trade and which side is against it?" said a post from the Twitter account of Global Times, a nationalist paper owned by the Communist Party.
Still others sought to deflect attention from TikTok, asking why lawmakers were highlighting its risks to young people while "doing nothing on gun-control legislation." They also called the criticism of the app "xenophobic." (TikTok's chief operating officer has also said calls to ban the app are xenophobic.)
More recently, Chinese state media outlets have continued to push the campaign on their Twitter accounts, with China Daily posting an article on March 31 titled: "US says China can spy with TikTok. It spies on world with Google."'
On TikTok itself, many users also rallied behind the company and Mr. Chew, who has become an unexpected celebrity. The hashtag #TikTokBan has been viewed more than two billion times. Brooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said Mr. Chew's popularity on the platform had increased organically.
The Alliance for Securing Democracy did not track Chinese propaganda on TikTok's service as part of the report. Several Chinese media outlets already have accounts on the app. Their accounts and videos are identified with labels that say "China state-controlled media," and their profiles have fewer followers than they do on Twitter, suggesting that the latter remains the principal platform for China's global messaging.
"We label state-affiliated media so our community is clear if they are engaging with content that may be controlled or influenced by a government," Ms. Oberwetter said. "This is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to review new accounts and add labels as and when they join the platform."
CGTN, the English-language channel of the Chinese state television network, posted a TikTok video on March 24 that featured defenses of the platform from some of the influencers the company flew to Washington to help defend it before the hearing.
"When it comes to hot-button topics involving autocratic actors, it can be difficult to tell the difference between organic arguments and arguments derived from autocratic propaganda, even in open, democratic information spaces," the Alliance for Securing Democracy said in its report. "Should geopolitical debates occur on Chinese-owned social media platforms like TikTok going forward, it could become even more difficult to differentiate between organic arguments and propaganda."
The potential to shape public opinion is one of the major security concerns that American intelligence officials have raised about TikTok.
"If there are 150 million U.S. users, and God knows how many in the rest of the world," Mr. Posner said, "it's a platform for disinformation just waiting to be exercised."

Senior Twitter Lawyer Is Said to Have Resigned, the Latest of Several Departures: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The lawyer had been closely involved in the company's talks with the Federal Trade Commission over promises it had made on privacy.
SAN FRANCISCO -- A senior lawyer at Twitter submitted his resignation on Thursday, four people familiar with the matter said, becoming the latest in a string of executives to leave the company since Elon Musk took it over nearly six months ago.
The lawyer, Christian Dowell, rose to the top of Twitter's legal department in recent months after the company's legal leaders resigned or were fired by Mr. Musk. Mr. Dowell had been intimately involved in Twitter's recent negotiations with the Federal Trade Commission, two people familiar with those discussions said.
The F.T.C., which currently has oversight over Twitter, is looking into a former executive's claims that the company has had security problems. The commission accelerated its inquiry after the sudden resignations of three Twitter executives responsible for privacy, security and compliance. They departed Twitter in November, shortly after Mr. Musk acquired the company.
The agency's investigation into Twitter has intensified in recent months, and is scrutinizing whether the company has the resources to uphold its privacy promises after mass layoffs and resignations.
Mr. Dowell did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Musk sought to meet with some of the F.T.C.'s commissioners in recent months to discuss the investigation, two people familiar with his efforts said. Only Christine Wilson, the departing Republican commissioner, accepted his request. Mr. Dowell coordinated Twitter's responses to the F.T.C.'s inquiries and participated in arranging the meeting, those people said.
Ms. Wilson stepped down from her position last Friday. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece about her decision to resign, she said Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, held "disregard for the rule of law and due process and the way senior F.T.C. officials enable her."
Mr. Dowell joined Twitter in 2020 after stints at the question-and-answer site Quora and Facebook, and focused on product issues before he was promoted in December, becoming the head of legal overseeing Twitter's product.
Mr. Dowell's departure follows a spate of exits by legal and compliance executives at the social media company. On the day that Mr. Musk closed his deal for Twitter in late October, he fired Vijaya Gadde, then the company's chief legal officer, and its general counsel, Sean Edgett.
In December, Mr. Musk fired James A. Baker, a Twitter lawyer and a former general counsel at the F.B.I., after Mr. Baker played a role in reviewing internal communications about the company's decision to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. The billionaire has also sidelined his personal lawyer from working at Twitter and rotated in other legal help from SpaceX, the rocket company he founded and operates.
Beyond the F.T.C. investigation, Twitter is facing a host of lawsuits over unpaid bills for software, vendor services and rent. Former employees have also sued the company, claiming that it violated labor laws during layoffs.
Twitter also sought to pursue legal action against an unknown person who leaked portions of its source code online and obtained a subpoena last month compelling GitHub, the software development collaboration platform that hosted the code, to divulge information about the person.
This week, a German federal body began proceedings to fine Twitter for what it said was the company's failure to deal with complaints of illegal content. "First I've heard about this," Mr. Musk tweeted on Tuesday about the German legal proceedings.
Mr. Dowell's resignation comes as Mr. Musk said he was building a "powerful litigation team" at Tesla, his electric carmaker. On Tuesday, he tweeted that this team would go "after the Wall St short-sellers, certain law firms & (sometimes) corrupt regulators who are the true evil."
Several Twitter executives have submitted their resignations, only to return to work at the company, and it is unclear whether Mr. Dowell might go back to Twitter at some point.
Robin Wheeler, a sales executive, resigned in November but came back and stayed for a few more weeks. It was not immediately clear who at Twitter might inherit Mr. Dowell's legal responsibilities.

Chinese Officials Flock to Twitter to Defend TikTok

Full text: Sorry, that profile name is taken. It belongs to a newborn.
Sophie Kratsas was only a few hours old when she received her first email: a "welcome to the world" message from her father, Nick Kratsas. He had created an email account for his newborn daughter while still standing in the delivery room. This was 2014, and Mr. Kratsas, 44, had already noticed a dearth of unclaimed email addresses with a person's full name without numbers, special characters or other concessions.
"I'm like, Man, if I can grab this for her now, eventually she'll be able to use this when she's ready for it," Mr. Kratsas said. A few days later, he created a Facebook profile for Sophie so he and his wife, Heather, 41, could begin tagging her in posts and photos. When she's old enough, they intend to turn over the email and Facebook accounts to her, along with the robust digital histories that come with them.
Sophie, now 9, is one of many children in her generation whose digital footprint precedes her physical one. In an age when teens and tweens are more online than ever, some parents find it just as important to invest in their offspring's digital futures, like securing their email addresses, domain names and social media handles, as it is to invest in their finances and education.
"Both the digital and children are sort of symbolic representations of a future," said Frances Corry, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center on Digital Culture and Society at the University of Pennsylvania. "And so putting those two things together is really salient and anxiety-provoking as people start to think about, What is the future going to look like for my child?"
Because of this, she added, the way parents approach their children's social media presence is most likely informed by the relationship they have had growing up with it.
Chelsea Moylan, 34, came of age in the early aughts when the internet was new and still largely unexplored. "Anytime there was a new social media, me and my friends were always on there early enough to get our names," Ms. Moylan said. It's a privilege she now wants for her two children, Josie, 2, and Franny, 6 months.
"I was like, I need to get them their names, and I didn't want to have to put a dot in it," she said. Franny and Josie now have their own email addresses and private Instagram handles, which Ms. Moylan used for only friends and family. She intends to hand over the accounts to her daughters when they turn 18.
Sapphiroula, 28, and Nicholas Condoleon, 32, parents and online creators better known as "The Condos," made an Instagram account for their 3-year-old son Georgii using his first and last name -- with no pesky dots or underscores -- in June 2019, two months before he was born. But their younger son, Charlie, 1, wasn't so lucky.
"Someone's got Charlie Condo," Mr. Condoleon said, holding his phone up in a video interview. "And it's like some random dude!"
Most of these digital artifacts sit untouched until parents think their children are ready -- but some parents are using them in the meantime. Matt Maguire, 40, made email addresses for his children, Sophie, 9, and Emerson, 5, a few months before they were born. He sends them messages documenting their childhoods that he plans to share as a kind of digital scrapbook when the time is right.
So far, Emerson has accumulated 601 emails from her father and other family members. For Sophie, that number is 1,198. It will be a heartfelt gift when the time comes, but one that requires some maintenance. According to its policy, Google may remove all of your content from any accounts that have been inactive for two years. Parents holding onto Gmail accounts, and the messages inside them, will need to ensure that they are logging in often enough to keep them afloat.
But starting a child's digital footprint at a young age raises some privacy concerns. While email accounts are not public-facing, the ethics become tricky when parents begin posting pictures of their children to social media, said Stephen Balkam, the founder of the nonprofit Family Online Safety Institute, which works with leaders in government and tech businesses to promote internet safety for children and families. "If you do want to upload photographs, keep it tight," he said.
A majority of policies governing when children in the United States can use social media platforms are based on the regulations set by Congress in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits websites from collecting information on users younger than 13 without parental permission. Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube and TikTok require users in the United States to be at least 13 to sign up for an account. On Instagram, any children younger than that age must clearly state in their bio that the account is managed by a parent or manager.
But as with any issues related to parenthood, Dr. Corry said, caregivers should expect the unexpected when the time comes to relinquish control of their children's social media accounts. "It's maybe creating an identity that your child isn't going to identify with," she said. "Would that parent be OK with their child taking those accounts that they're being handed and deleting everything? That's one possible outcome."
Ms. Moylan already plans to wipe her children's Instagram accounts before they inherit them. "You're not going to want to be 17, and if somebody scrolls back far enough, it's you in a diaper," she said.
Anthony Garmont, 53, has already given the digital real estate to his child, and the reaction was ... anticlimactic. Mr. Garmont sent about 15 messages to the email address he secured 18 years ago for his son, Riley. Their content was largely sentimental, so he thought it would be better for his son to read the emails on his own.
But did Riley understand the value of his father's yearslong digital planning? "He's a pretty nonchalant person," Mr. Garmont said with a laugh. So, in other words, not really.
Regardless of the platform, parents taking early ownership of their children's digital footprint allows for a certain degree of control over this newer and more unpredictable element of life. "I understand it as a benefit that you can exert some sort of reputation management over your child's identity," Dr. Corry said.
And while parents have no way of predicting what role social media may play in the future, acquiring these accounts is a relatively low lift for a potentially high reward. "What do we lose?" Mr. Kratsas said. "It's not like we paid for it or anything."
If he were to relive that day in the hospital room again, Mr. Kratsas would have done only one thing differently: secure his daughter an Instagram handle, too.

Introduce Your Teens to the City and Its Restaurants: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: See the sights, eat well and instill a love of this city.
A question that often appears in the Where to Eat inbox is, "Where should I take my teenager to eat when we visit New York City?" I love this question for two reasons: First, there's the "broadening horizons" of it all -- how else to create a potential future New Yorker? -- and second, it reminds me of my own formative trips to the city.
What follows is a nonexhaustive mixture of classic and not-so-classic recommendations, all conveniently located near tourist sites, that should be as appealing to you as to your Gen Z-er. I can't make your teens appreciate you, but I can make sure they'll be full enough to fall asleep on your shoulder on the ride back to the hotel.
Midtown Manhattan Eating and Jewish Deli Noshing
Let me be the first to tell you that Top of the Rock is the superior choice as far as tourist sites go, mostly because it has one of the best views of Central Park you can get without spending millions on real estate. And then you can take your bright-eyed teenager to either the food court under Rockefeller Center (check out the Pan-African rice bowl restaurant Fieldtrip) or Urban Hawker, a Singaporean food hall on West 50th Street. There, rejoice in the oyster omelets at Prawnaholic Collections, the rich and pungent shrimp fried rice at Mr. Fried Rice and the desserts from Lady Wong, one of the city's most exciting new bakeries.
Now, for your visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, don't try to do it all: Go to the Temple of Dendur, check out the Impressionist galleries and finish with the Costume Institute. Once you've gotten all those steps in, it's time for pastrami. I'm all about Katz's, on the Lower East Side, which should be your first choice. But if time is tight, you can't beat Pastrami Queen, a Met-adjacent, Upper East Side kosher deli institution. This is where you can revel in the wonders of pastrami on rye, latkes and matzo ball soup.
Chinatown Classics, People-Watching Pizza and a Brooklyn Hop
First up, proper Cantonese food. Old Chinatown and new New York seem to agree on Wu's Wonton King, a seven-year-old B.Y.O.B. restaurant on East Broadway where "whole ducks and suckling pigs gleaming from hooks" hang in the windows, as Ligaya Mishan wrote in her review for The Times in 2017. The storm-bringer is the deep-fried Dungeness crab, but the wontons in pork broth are just as occasion-worthy, as is the garlic crispy chicken. Come hungry.
Now you can start shopping on Broadway, in SoHo. (The new Glossier store is at Spring and Crosby, and the Nike store is one block away; get all your school-supply and basic-clothing needs met at Muji and Uniqlo; and thank me later!) Then pizza. Teens will love Upside Pizza, in NoLIta. The food and the people-watching are top-tier, and you can end with soft serve from Softside, next door. I prefer the thick Sicilian pepperoni slice, heartburn be damned.
And do visit Brooklyn. I and more than two million of my friends live here, and the view from Brooklyn Bridge Park will solidify a future love of New York City. That and a meal at Al Badawi, a Palestinian restaurant on Atlantic Avenue that's overflowing with all the warmth and hospitality New York isn't known for, but actually has in spades. Drag warm pita through more than a dozen mezzes, cut into the lamb shanks over rice and fight over the last slice of the pistachio flatbread -- though when it comes to competitive eating with teenagers, you'll always lose.
In Other News ...
Openings: Carriage House, a new celebrity-backed restaurant with butter candles, is now open in the West Village; the hotly anticipated Superiority Burger is taking diners; and ALF Bakery, from the pastry chef and chocolatier Amadou Ly, opens at Chelsea Market on Friday.
Gen Z-ers love cheese and yogurt as much as previous generations, but they can't seem to come around on milk. Kim Severson reported on the dairy industry's fight to change that.
The lesbian bar is alive and well at two new spots in Los Angeles, writes Tejal Rao: the Ruby Fruit, a natural wine bar in a Sunset Boulevard strip mall, and Honey's at Star Love.
With 20 seasons and nearly 300 episodes, "Hot Ones," the web series featuring celebrities eating progressively spicier wings, remains a winning formula, writes Maya Salam.
Doosie Morris wrote about the Australian equivalent of pumpkin spice lattes: hot crossed buns.

Russia Laying Mines in Area Where Attack Is Expected: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russia is strengthening its defenses in territory that it occupies in southern Ukraine by planting fields of land mines and building barriers to brace against a possible attack, a Ukrainian official said on Tuesday.
Moscow's forces have started to dig defensive barriers between the borders of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions and also between the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, according to Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which is in Zaporizhzhia. They are also digging a defensive line between two villages near Melitopol, he said.
"They are preparing to defend the temporarily occupied Melitopol," Mr. Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app. Although he is not based in Melitopol, given that Russia controls the city, he bases his information on contacts in the region.
Melitopol, a city about 60 miles south of the front line, is strategically important for Moscow, because it acts as a rail and road hub, linking Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with land that Russia occupies in eastern Ukraine. Should Ukraine recapture the city, it would effectively divide Russian territory, making resupply much more difficult.
Ukraine's senior military leadership has kept silent about the direction of any planned counteroffensive, and the east of the country, where fighting has raged for months, is a possible target. But Ukrainian officials have done little to dampen public expectation that the south could also be a target to follow up on the success of a military drive that began last summer and culminated when thousands of Russian troops withdrew from the city of Kherson.
The Ukrainians have used such uncertainty to their advantage before. In early September, after weeks of building expectation that the Kherson region of southern Ukraine would be the site of a Ukrainian attack, Kyiv's armed forces also staged a rapid offensive in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, apparently taking Moscow by surprise to stage a rout in a part of the country that Russia had only lightly defended.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a recent speech that made apparent reference to the coming fighting, "There will be a day when we will say: The last occupier has fled or been killed in the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kherson region and in our entire south."
A Ukrainian attack on the Zaporizhzhia region east of the Dnipro River could prevent Russian forces from continuing their near constant shelling of the city of Kherson and towns and villages near the river bank. There were 61 attacks on the area on Monday alone, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration. In all, 224 shells landed and one person was killed, he said in a post on Telegram.
Any new offensive would make use of an influx of Western military aid, including tanks from the United States and other allies as well as newly trained Ukrainian troops.
The region is economically vital because of its agriculture and because it contains a canal that supplies water to Crimea. It also has immense cultural significance.
"Russia occupies part of Ukraine's ancient heartland," said Mykyta Poturaev, a lawmaker in the country's Parliament who belongs to Mr. Zelensky's party. "That's why for us the liberation of part of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region is a principal preoccupation," he said in an interview.
In recent weeks, both sides have built their strength along the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to military experts and Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, who visited the area last week.
At the same time, there has been an intensification of Russian shelling of cities and towns near the front line, according to Ukrainian officials. On Monday, Russia conducted two area strikes on settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region, causing a large fire and destroying a gymnasium, the state emergency service said on Facebook. It said there were no casualties.

Shark Researchers Took the Bait: [Science Desk]

Full text: Scientists have retracted a study that showed a rare goblin shark washed up on a Greek beach after other researchers voiced doubts about the find.
Goblin sharks are deep-sea fish whose frightening, protrusile jaws served as an inspiration for the terrifying creatures in the "Alien" movie franchise. Little is known about these elusive sharks, and sightings of them are extraordinarily rare. They are known to live in deep coastal waters all over the world but have never been found in the Mediterranean Sea.
But recently, a group of scientists reported the discovery of what they said was a goblin shark that had washed ashore on a Greek beach. Their announcement of the find last year in the journal Mediterranean Marine Science has led to a series of events almost as bizarre as the goblin shark itself, involving competing scientific narratives, a retraction and the possibility that maybe all of the fuss was over a children's plastic toy.
According to the original scientific paper, the Mediterranean goblin shark was discovered by a man named Giannis Papadakis in August 2020. After finding the specimen, the paper said, Mr. Papadakis propped it on some rocks and snapped a photo. The image ended up in the hands of a group of local scientists, and two years later they published it alongside records of other species found in the Mediterranean for the first time.
The paper seemed like a success of citizen science, in which people with no formal scientific training assist professional scientists in research. But it wasn't long before shark experts around the world started to express their doubts, in a Facebook group, about the authenticity of the goblin shark.
"It didn't look right," said David Ebert, author of the book "Sharks of the World." Dr. Ebert said several things about the shark found in Greece were unusual. "It's too small, and its gills don't look like they're actually open," he said. "It doesn't look natural at all."
Dr. Ebert and others were also skeptical because there had been no direct examination of the shark. The paper was based solely on a photo and a brief description provided by Mr. Papadakis.
In November, a group of shark researchers published a comment paper questioning whether the goblin shark found in Greece was a real animal. "We have doubts," they wrote, that the goblin shark in the original paper "is a natural specimen." They argued that the specimen's lack of teeth, its overly rounded fins and its low number of gill slits were not characteristic of a goblin shark.
Soon after, another image was shared on social media, one that would cause the skepticism to crescendo. It was a plastic goblin shark toy sold by an Italian toy company, DeAgostini, and it had an uncanny resemblance to the goblin shark found in Greece.
DeAgostini, the toymaker, could not be reached for comment.
This toy "shows a great similarity to the specimen in the published image," said Jürgen Pollerspöck, an independent shark researcher and an author of the paper that presented the doubts about the Greek goblin shark's authenticity.
Earlier this month, the authors of the original paper doubled down, standing by their original claims in a reply to the concerns raised by Mr. Pollerspöck and his colleagues. They also amended their size estimate from about 30 inches to about seven inches and suggested that the goblin shark in question could be an embryo.
"Embryos of this size are not viable," Mr. Pollerspöck replied.
Then this week, the authors of the original paper retracted it, as well as their reply to the critique, conceding that there was too much uncertainty about the find. Reached by email, one of the paper's authors declined to answer additional questions.
So ended a nearly yearlong saga that had many shark sleuths squinting at their computer screens.
Mr. Pollerspöck said it was possible for goblin sharks to be lurking in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea. But he said that none had been found.
Whether the shark in this image is found to be a real fish or just a piece of plastic pollution, critics say that the publication of the image in a scientific journal draws attention to the imperfections of the scientific peer review process.
"In my opinion, the problem and responsibility lies with the editor of the journal and the reviewers," Mr. Pollerspöck said.
The shark's unusual appearance wasn't the only red flag reviewers of the paper should have seen, he said. That the claim in the paper was based on one image provided by a citizen scientist warranted increased scrutiny.
The editor of Mediterranean Marine Science did not respond to a request for comment.
Whether or not the researchers who published the now retracted Greek goblin shark paper ever concede that they published a picture of a toy, Dr. Ebert said he wouldn't be surprised if something like this happened again, given the problems with peer review and the rates of plastic pollution in the seas.
"Anything's possible," he noted.

Some Ukrainian Refugees See Welcome Mats Pulled Back: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than 280,000 Ukrainians have escaped the war through a program meant to resettle them into the homes of Americans. But not everyone has found a safe or welcoming place to stay.
For weeks, Stanislav Holotiuk had been searching for someone to help him flee the war in Ukraine and sponsor his resettlement in the United States.
He trawled through message boards on sites like Facebook late at night, when it was daytime in America. A few people in New York City and Chicago promised to help, then disappeared. Others asked him for money. Exasperated, he impersonated his girlfriend to see if that would change his luck.
After reaching out to more than 50 Americans, he finally received a message: "Sure, I'll help. Just send me your details."
Mr. Holotiuk, 27, was not sure of the sender's real name. The Facebook profile picture for the account showed an avatar. But finding a willing Samaritan sponsor was a prerequisite for a newly minted U.S. government program aimed at resettling thousands of Ukrainian refugees.
The program, led by the Department of Homeland Security, promised to vet both parties, so Mr. Holotiuk put his future into the hands of a stranger. In less than three days, he received his immigration papers.
But when he landed at Kennedy International Airport shortly afterward with his girlfriend, Maria Muzun, 22, last September, no one was there to greet them.
Stuck, with just $ 100 between the two of them, Mr. Holotiuk and Ms. Muzun spent their first night in America sleeping rough under a Coney Island pier. One night turned into weeks, so they pooled their dollars and bought a tent at a Walmart near J.F.K.
Mr. Holotiuk's case illuminates the ad hoc nature of the sponsorship program, Uniting for Ukraine, which was created two months after the Russian invasion last year and which the Biden administration has said was a radical shift in policy to help thousands of desperate people fleeing the war.
The program departs from the traditional, more time-consuming resettlement process, in which nongovernmental agencies help to house refugees and assign them caseworkers. After a vetting process that requires volunteer sponsors to sign a financial declaration and provide an income statement, Uniting for Ukraine hands the care of the refugees over to private individuals with no additional oversight. The Biden administration has also opened the process to Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Cubans.
The Ukrainians coming now are fleeing the worst ground war in Europe since World War II. More than 7,000 civilians have died, and supporters say the Uniting for Ukraine sponsorship program may have saved the lives of thousands.
"We are looking at this as a policy change that has allowed a significant number of people in need to very quickly and at scale leave a very dangerous situation," said Anya McMurray, president of Welcome.US, a nonprofit created after the fall of Kabul in 2021 to help Americans find ways to welcome refugees. Last year, the group, whose honorary chairs include former presidents and first ladies, expanded its work to help match Ukrainian refugees with American sponsors.
"I can't think of another time in our history when that has happened at that scale," Ms. McMurray added. "The question was, do we as a country ignore that tremendous need or do we find a creative alternative?"
For many of the Ukrainians coming through the program, the sponsorships are going well, supporters of the program say. Some have settled in with family, and others have been embraced by Americans eager to help in the war effort. Homeland Security has also issued warnings to Ukrainian refugees about the dangers of human trafficking, and the vetting process has been tightened in recent months.
Still, situations like Mr. Holotiuk's are "widespread," according to Kelly Agnew-Barajas, the director of refugee resettlement at Catholic Charities.
She said it was a common pattern for people to sign up as sponsors "who kind of were naïve, thinking, 'I'm doing a good deed,' but then really not following it up with anything."
Refugee resettlement agencies say that many refugees have arrived at their doors after sponsors bailed, despite volunteers signing a form declaring a two-year commitment to the person they're resettling. Agency staff also cited more extreme cases, like a Ukrainian woman who was asked by her sponsor to become a surrogate mother and another who had her passport confiscated and was pressured to become a second wife. New York City officials say some Ukrainians have ended up in homeless shelters.
About 282,000 Ukrainians have been either authorized to travel to or have already arrived in the United States as of March 21 under Uniting for Ukraine, which launched last April, according to the most recent statistics from Homeland Security. The refugees are granted a temporary legal status known as humanitarian parole, which allows them to work legally. (An additional 167,000 Ukrainians have been processed to arrive in the United States outside of Uniting for Ukraine.)
The American sponsorship program is modeled on one in Canada, although it differs because sponsors under the Canadian program must be organizations, community groups or groups of at least five individuals. This way the costs of resettling new arrivals are spread out and there is a smaller risk of a refugee being stranded.
A sponsor program in Britain has also run into some problems, including over a thorny application process and long waits for visas.
By far, New York has welcomed the most refugees coming to the United States. Many go to Brighton Beach, home to a sizable Ukrainian diaspora.
In addition to having the financial means, sponsors under Uniting for Ukraine must promise to house refugees and help them with health care and enrolling children in school. But the financial threshold is just above the poverty line, Ms. Agnew-Barajas said.
"It's a pretty low bar," she said.
Angelo Fernandez, a spokesman for Homeland Security, explained the vetting process as "a series of fraud and security-based screening measures" aimed at "protecting the refugees against exploitation and abuse to ensure that they are able to financially support the beneficiary."
"D.H.S. remains committed to supporting Ukrainians in the United States, and we continue to explore opportunities to provide avenues for humanitarian relief and protection for Ukrainians fleeing Russia's unprovoked war," Mr. Fernandez said.
He said he could not comment on specific cases.
Even when refugees connect with sponsors, problems can ensue. Elena Afanasieva, 38, arrived in a small town in Pennsylvania in late June last year with her two daughters, who are 13 and 16. Ms. Afanasieva is originally from Kyiv, where she worked in a beauty salon. She found a sponsor, a 56-year-old woman who promised to help Ms. Afanasieva until she was self-sufficient, through a Facebook group.
Not long after she and her daughters arrived, things started to go awry.
Local groups raised money to help support the refugee family, but Ms. Afanasieva said that the sponsor wouldn't let her use it to pay for her daughter's school supplies, telling her she was selfish for asking for the money.
Eventually, Ms. Afanasieva said she was asked to leave. (The sponsor did not respond to requests for an interview.)
In desperation, Ms. Afanasieva moved to New York City, where she knew a friend from high school. She and her daughters contacted Catholic Charities for help and now live in a homeless shelter -- a small hotel room in Manhattan -- where they share a queen size bed.
"I feel excited to be here but also was disappointed by what humanity had to offer," she said through a translator.
Many refugees are settling in just fine, though sometimes the arrangements can be uncomfortable. Zoya Tatarinova, 63, was sponsored by a distant third cousin living in New Jersey. But she ended up staying in the living room of a friend in New York City. What was supposed to be a short sojourn turned into months.
"I felt guilty that weeks turned longer," she said.
The traditional process for sponsoring refugees is led by humanitarian organizations, like HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit, which said it has a tighter vetting process and recommends that a group of people serve together as sponsors so that the financial burden is spread out. The organization also discourages beneficiaries from living with their sponsors in order to avoid relationship breakdowns.
But the tighter the vetting, the smaller the pool of sponsors. The number of sponsors for Ukrainian refugees approved by HIAS is in the low thousands, compared with hundreds of thousands for Uniting for Ukraine.
Supporters of Uniting for Ukraine say that overall, the program has been successful.
Ms. McMurray, of Welcome.US, said that the nation's refugee system would otherwise not have had enough capacity to take in the staggering number of Ukrainians in need.
"More of them are coming every month because it is working," she said of the program, "because the stories that they are sending back to Ukraine is that this is a path worth taking. You can find safety here. The American people are welcoming you."
Mr. Holotiuk, who ended up homeless in Coney Island, is not ungrateful to his sponsor, even though he did not uphold his end of the bargain. (The sponsor could not be reached for comment.)
Ukraine has drafted most of its men to serve in the war, but Mr. Holotiuk, a computer scientist from Mykolaiv, a city that came under Russian attack early on, had medical issues and was allowed to leave.
He has been astounded by the generosity of Americans he has met. "Here, you can at least let your guard down. There are no sirens nor bombs. You can breathe," he said recently, as he walked down the Coney Island Boardwalk.
"I've made friends with them," he added, gesturing toward a gathering of homeless people who live under the pier.
Recently, Mr. Holotiuk and Ms. Muzun moved in with a fellow Ukrainian they met at a public library.
Not all of the sponsorship breakdowns involve strangers, refugee agencies said.
Mariia Semashkina, 30, a Ukrainian who came to the United States a decade ago and settled in White Plains, N.Y., offered to sponsor a family member when the war broke out. Her brother suggested she take in his ex-girlfriend, Alona Davydenko, 24.
The tension was palpable on a recent afternoon as the pair sat in a cafe.
"Thank God we have separate bathrooms," said Ms. Semashkina. "We hardly ever see each other because we're always working."
Last year, Ms. Semashkina bought Ms. Davydenko airplane tickets -- even accompanying her because she was nervous about flying -- and found her a job in a restaurant, so she could help with rent.
"I wanted her to land and go to work right away. But she wanted to take a few days off first, and I was upset," Ms. Semashkina said. "I have money invested in her, OK? Give me my money back and then you can take your days off."
She laughed and gave a side-look at Ms. Davydenko, who giggled uncomfortably. Ms. Davydenko, a pharmacist who is originally from eastern Ukraine, has been teaching herself English and is eager to strike out on her own.
"I'm also not, like, a super easy person to deal with," Ms. Semashkina added. "She didn't know me, and she literally just packed her life in a backpack."

Full text: Caitlin Reichel and Kristy Graziano met at a holiday party in Orlando, Fla., in 2016, but it would take three more years to become a couple.
Caitlin Skye Reichel was doing handstands at a corporate holiday party in Orlando, Fla., the first time Kristy Marie Graziano laid eyes on her.
It was not unusual for Ms. Graziano to see circus professionals balancing upside down on their hands or forearms -- after all, she's one herself, and on that evening in November 2016, she was managing the entertainment for the event. But somehow Ms. Reichel stood out.
"I didn't know anything about her, but I wanted to be her friend," Ms. Graziano said.
The two had a brief conversation that evening, and Ms. Graziano even entered her digits into Ms. Reichel's phone. Ms. Reichel was dating someone then, so the phone number went unused.
Fast forward three years. In December 2019, it occurred to their mutual friend and fellow acrobat, Joshua Johnson, that they might be a good match.
"They are both phenomenal performers," Mr. Johnson said. "It's difficult for performers to match with non-performers, because even when not working, we still have to train, and few understand how much that imposes on our social lives."
Plus, he added, "Kristy tends to be earnest and Caitlin more whimsical. I thought they would be able to balance each other and could grow together."
When he told each about the other, including the fact that both are queer, Ms. Graziano wasted no time and sent Ms. Reichel a friend request on Facebook. But Ms. Reichel barely uses the social media platform. Mr. Johnson had to tell her to check her account.
Ms. Reichel, 29, spent the early years of her life traveling around the country and in Canada with the circus, until her Dominican-American mother, Mary Reichel, and Jewish father, Steven Reichel, established a home base in Orlando just before her ninth birthday. They were clowns in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, among other circuses. (Her mother still performs independently with fire; her father retired from performing and now works in construction.)
Ms. Reichel started training in acrobatics as a child, and studied classical ballet as a teen. Her specialty is spinning up to 30 hula hoops at a time on various body parts, or fewer while on pointe, juggling several hoops while doing splits and more. Her stage name is Caitlin Skye, and in addition to performing, she coaches and teaches circus arts independently, and just started working with Cirque du Soleil in Orlando in the props crew.
Ms. Graziano, 35, is an aerial performer, specializing in aerial silks and duo trapeze, performing most often with a partner as Duo Dames. Originally from Paducah, Ky., she has an associate degree in graphic design and commercial art from Nossi College of Art in Nashville.
She was introduced to circus arts while working in the costume department at Walt Disney World Resort. A colleague there had invited her to join her at a class, and she took to it immediately. She, too, coaches and works in the rigging department for Cirque du Soleil.
Their Facebook messenger chats soon turned to phone calls. When Ms. Graziano gave her phone number to Ms. Reichel, she realized she already had it in her phone.
Before going on a date, Ms. Reichel took Ms. Graziano's aerial class in February 2020. While Ms. Graziano invited Ms. Reichel to stay after to watch her and her partner rehearse, neither knew it would be another two hours before she finished, around 11:30 p.m.
When they walked to their cars afterward, they each saw that the other drove a Mini Cooper, which Ms. Graziano took as a sign.
"She stayed that whole time just to have a couple minutes with me," Ms. Graziano said. "Later, I called my trapeze partner and said, 'That was really big. I like her so much."'
While their training and performing schedules didn't allow for a proper date for a bit longer, each visited the other at practice. It was on one of those visits that they shared their first kiss.
They went to a horror movie for their first date: "Gretel & Hansel."
Successive dates took place at Universal CityWalk, part of Universal Orlando, and picnicking at a local cemetery. Ms. Reichel, in particular, likes cemeteries because they are peaceful, well-kept places; in Orlando, there are few places free of tourists. Also, she said, "because people are there to be with their loved ones."
By the time everything shut down for Covid in early 2020, including their work, they considered themselves a couple.
Dates now consisted of elaborate meals at home in Orlando and craft nights. One night, Ms. Graziano brought soup to a sick Ms. Reichel. They put their favorite movie on, "It," and Ms. Reichel fell asleep on Ms. Graziano. She had never before felt so comfortable that she had fallen asleep on someone, she said.
Ms. Graziano said she "just wanted to keep holding her" even though her arm was cramping.
Though they spent much of their free time together, they didn't want to rush their relationship.
There was their age gap, and the fact that Ms. Reichel had less relationship experience. But by this point each knew she was in love.
"I was not overly emotional or sensitive before. I was a little cold," Ms. Reichel said. "Kristy warmed my heart and showed me how to really love. She taught me how to love her, but also how to love my family and friends better."
"In my past relationships, I had lost the ability to laugh and have fun, and I laugh with Caitlin every day," Ms. Graziano said. "Caitlin is so talented and I admire her dedication so much, and I do the same for her."
While combining a ground act with an aerial act isn't simple, the couple are thinking about a duo act they can perform together. (Ms. Reichel often does poi spinning with her mother.)
In August 2021, Ms. Graziano moved into Ms. Reichel's house in Orlando, where she lived with her terrier mutt, Samantha.
In October 2021, both women were hired to dress as fairies at a "Pirates of the Caribbean"-themed wedding at Paradise Cove, and to interact with the guests and be part of the bridal party, even though they didn't know the couple. They both realized they could envision their own wedding at the venue, largely since it satisfied one of their requirements: There was space for a trapeze rig.
Ms. Graziano then got the Reichels' blessing to marry their daughter. She then planned a trip to Las Vegas in November 2021. Ms. Reichel got her nails done in anticipation.
But despite Ms. Reichel's mother's regular texts to Ms. Graziano asking if it had happened yet, the proposal would have to wait, as Vegas wasn't exactly the romantic backdrop Ms. Graziano was hoping for.
"Someone was throwing up in a corner, men were handing out fliers with naked women," Ms. Graziano said. "It was gross." They cut their stay short there and headed to the Grand Canyon. Days after they returned, at the Reichels' house, Ms. Graziano put the aquamarine ring in a mesh bag tied to Samantha's collar. When Ms. Reichel spotted it, Ms. Graziano got down on one knee.
"I had that ring for a year and a half before I asked," Ms. Graziano said. "I waited until I knew this is what Caitlin wanted."
Ms. Reichel wanted to propose as well. She bought a ring similar to the one Ms. Graziano had chosen, though with an alexandrite stone, and proposed at her parents' house as well, on her own birthday in March 2022.

They were married in front of 92 guests on Feb. 16 at Paradise Cove in Orlando by Ms. Reichel's sister, Amy Wright, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion. Both wore bridal gowns with long trains. Ms. Reichel was walked down the aisle by her father, while Ms. Graziano, who is taking Ms. Reichel's name, was escorted by her older sister, Bobbi Billow.
"Seeing my sister not only being overwhelmingly loved by her bride, but also being embraced into a family who loves and accepts her, brought me to uncontrollable tears," Ms. Billow said.
Both women wrote their own vows, which, unbeknown to them beforehand, referenced "The Addams Family."
"I promise to love you fiercely and irrationally like the most romantic couple ever portrayed, Gomez and Morticia," Ms. Graziano said, while Ms. Reichel said, "You're the Morticia to my Gomez, but with better arms."
At the reception, there were performances from the Duo Rose trapeze act, who are close friends of the couple, as well as Ms. Graziano's trainers.
And then, in the "Don't Say Gay" state, not only did their queer community show up with pride flags and other accouterments to bring a queer club atmosphere to the dance floor, but two drag queens, Chavela Belleza and Mr Ms Adrien, performed.
Ms. Reichel told their guests, "Being at our wedding shows you choose love in a world full of hate; you're proving you have love in your heart."

Full text: An email from her husband's visiting boss about a higher-than-expected charge from dinner rattled a reader enough to send a check. Was it an overreaction?
My husband's boss, an executive at a multinational firm, came to our city on vacation and invited us to dinner. We made reservations at our favorite restaurant. When the bill came, the boss's husband picked up the check and said: "We've got this." We thanked them and said we hadn't intended for them to pay. The next day, my husband received an email from his boss saying he just saw the credit card charge, which was larger than expected. He planned to ask the restaurant if there was an error. We were embarrassed; we ordered more to drink than them. So, we pulled up the menu online, totaled our share with tax and tip, and sent them a check. (It was $ 37 more than their share.) We apologized for not insisting on splitting the bill. Did we do the right thing?
WIFE
Well, you didn't do the wrong thing, but you may have overreacted. In your view, the boss believed he was overcharged by about $ 40. That seems like small potatoes to make a fuss about, considering he hadn't bothered to check the bill the night before and presumably saw you ordering more drinks. I would have thought he was concerned about a bigger error: a swanky bottle of wine added to the tab by mistake, for instance. You didn't see the bill, though, so we don't know the scale of the problem.
On the other hand, if the boss didn't want you to pony up, why would he have shared his intentions with your husband? He could have saved a step and simply called the restaurant. Better safe than sorry, I suppose, when it comes to odd (or passive-aggressive) bosses. My advice now is to put this episode behind you. You settled up -- for better or worse; now let it go.
Mistaken Condolences? Cringe and Move On.
My husband and I received an email from a club we belong to telling us that a fellow member -- part of a married couple with whom we are friendly -- had died. Unfortunately, we misread the note and believed that the husband had died when it was, in fact, the wife who had passed away. We sent flowers and a warm note to the wife when we should have sent them to the husband. Now, we are mortified! How do we recover from this terrible faux pas and send proper condolences -- or is that impossible? I am happy to admit I am an idiot, if that helps.
MISREADER
You are not an idiot! I confess that I winced, though, when I read your email -- as I'm sure you did when you recognized your error. Still, I found my way back to the heart of this matter pretty quickly: A friend of yours has suffered probably one of the biggest losses of his life. What's a stray letter or bouquet of flowers compared with that?
Yes, you feel foolish. But don't let your (understandable) embarrassment upstage your friend's grief: This is not about you. Send another condolence note promptly. Apologize that your first letter may have added to your friend's distress, and then set aside your error. Make sympathy for his loss the focal point of your second note. We all make mistakes; it's how we respond to them that tells people who we are.
Part of the Family, and Not Just in Life
I just learned from the vet that my beloved dog of 13 years must be put down within the next few days. I work at a company that has a compassionate-leave policy for deaths in the family, but my boss refused the request of a colleague to take time off when her cat died last year. I think he was wrong, and I suspect I will need a couple of days off during (and after) my dog's final illness. What should I do?
DOG DAD
I am sorry for you and your dog! Grief is grief. Take the leave if you need it. Tell your boss (or the appropriate manager): "A family member is dying, and I will be out of the office for two days." In my view, that statement is wholly accurate.
Don't lie, though. (That could be a firing offense.) If your coldhearted boss asks who is dying, be truthful. If he then denies your leave, take the days as vacation instead -- and fight the unjust policy when you are in better shape emotionally.
No One Likes a Trash-Day Tyrant
My next-door neighbor (a single man) is a traveling salesman. He lives on the road from Tuesday mornings until Thursday nights. The problem: Trash pickup is on Wednesdays -- which means he brings his trash bins to the curb a day early and leaves them out a day too long. I find this unsightly and rude. Any advice?
NEIGHBOR
Yes, as a matter of fact. Many people's lives are hard, as your neighbor's seemingly arduous schedule suggests. Don't make them harder.
If this unavoidable issue with your neighbor's trash bins bothers you enough, volunteer to bring them down to the curb and back to the garage yourself closer to the pickup time. Or you could pay a neighborhood kid a few bucks to do it for you -- in either case, after securing your neighbor's permission.

Full text: Tornadoes in Arkansas injured at least 30 people. A person was killed and at least 28 others hospitalized after a roof collapsed at a theater in Illinois.
NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A deadly storm system swept through the country's midsection Friday, spawning ferocious tornadoes in Arkansas, collapsing a roof at a packed concert venue in Illinois and leaving millions of people under tornado watches from Texas to Michigan.
In Arkansas, the governor declared a state of emergency Friday afternoon after officials said one person was killed in North Little Rock and two died in Wynne, about 100 miles to the east, in separate tornadoes.
The mayor of Little Rock, Frank Scott Jr., said at least 30 people were hospitalized there and more than 2,000 homes were damaged. The storm did extensive damage to businesses and apartment complexes, the local police said.
In Wynne, Mayor Jennifer Hobbs told CNN that the town had been "cut in half by damage from east to west." The precise scope of the damage was not immediately clear, and a dispatcher at the police department declined to comment early Saturday. A junior high school in the town had been opened for people seeking shelter and food.
On Friday night in northwestern Illinois, a person was killed and 28 others hospitalized after the roof collapsed at a theater in Belvidere with 260 people inside, the fire chief, Shawn Schadle, told reporters at the scene. He said five people had severe injuries.
Footage posted to social media appeared to show patrons at the venue, the Apollo Theater, trying to find people beneath the rubble.
One of the bands on the bill, Morbid Angel, said in a Facebook post that the band's members were still sheltering in place at the venue. The National Weather Service reported "possible tornado damage" in Belvidere.
About 200 miles south, in the village of Sherman, Ill., more than a dozen homes were significantly damaged, Trevor J. Clatfelter, the mayor, said by phone Friday night. The storm, he said, had also caused major gas leaks, electricity outages and downed power poles across the village.
In Covington, Tenn., six patients were hospitalized after a tornado touched down in the city, Kimberly Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Baptist Memorial Hospital, said by phone on Friday night. On Facebook, the Covington Police Department described the city as "impassable."
In addition to Arkansas, Illinois and Tennessee, tornadoes were also reported to the National Weather Service across Wisconsin, Iowa and Mississippi.
The governor of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that officials there were on alert for the death toll to rise. "We're hopeful that it doesn't, but I think given the nature and the volatility of the situation, we're certainly preparing that it could," she said at the news conference on Friday night.
Mr. Scott, Little Rock mayor, said at a news conference on Friday night that more than 30 people had been hospitalized in the city. Many residents had also been displaced, he added.
In an interview, Mr. Scott said at least 2,100 homes had been destroyed by the tornado and that it was too soon to know how much the damage might cost.
"I suspect we'll be working through the damage for a week, if not longer," Mr. Scott said.
In addition to the tornado emergency for parts of Little Rock, forecasters also declared an emergency for parts of nearby Sherwood and Jacksonville, Ark. More than 100,000 customers in Illinois, and 65,000 in Arkansas were without power as of Friday night, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.
Baptist Health's medical centers in Little Rock and North Little Rock were already treating a total of 21 patients -- five of whom were in critical condition -- Cara Wade, a spokeswoman, said early Friday night. The two hospitals were anticipating a surge of additional patients.
Joshua Cook, a spokesman for CHI St. Vincent Infirmary, said the hospital's emergency department was seeing a "high volume of people with injuries," but he did not know their severity.
Leslie Taylor, a spokeswoman for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, said that at least three trauma patients had been taken to the hospital.
In Indian Hills, a middle-class neighborhood in North Little Rock, about a dozen homes appeared to have been damaged, including the home of Mildred Loy, 95, who said she had nearly been crushed when a tree fell through her roof.
Ms. Loy said that her caregiver had scooped her off the sofa and moved her to the hallway, where she climbed on top of Ms. Loy to protect her. "As she laid down, we heard boom," Ms. Loy said. "It crashed right where I was sitting."
Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Little Rock had to move to a tornado shelter on Friday afternoon, as it became clear that their office was in the tornado's path. The Memphis office of the Weather Service planned to issue warnings and monitor the weather on their behalf, said Desiree Meadows, a meteorologist in Memphis.
Stephanie Carruthers, a manager at Trio's restaurant in Pavilion in the Park shopping center in Little Rock, said about 25 employees and customers safely rode out the storm in the kitchen.
"It blew over so fast," Ms. Carruthers said. "It started raining real hard, so we all ran into the kitchen. I turned around, and the front doors just blew up."
Officials from fire departments in the Little Rock area said that search and rescue teams were on the ground, checking homes door to door for injured residents.
"At this time it doesn't seem to be very many," said Captain Dustin Free, a spokesman for the North Little Rock Fire Department. But, he added, the situation was still very fluid.
Footage posted to social media appeared to show a large tornado touching down in Sigourney, a town of about 2,000 people about 70 miles southwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Other images from the region appeared to show torn-apart buildings and upturned cars.
Manny Galvez, a resident of Coralville, a city about 20 miles south of Cedar Rapids, said he had hunkered down in his basement just before 5 p.m. "That was terrifying," Mr. Galvez said in a phone interview, adding that he had emerged about 40 minutes later to find nearby homes torn apart and trucks upturned.
The storms could affect parts of Mississippi that were devastated last week by tornadoes that left at least 26 people dead.
President Biden on Friday visited Rolling Fork, the Mississippi community hit hardest by the tornadoes last week. Tornadoes killed 13 people and destroyed homes and businesses in Rolling Fork and in surrounding Sharkey County.

A Failure to Launch
May Sink Virgin Orbit
The failure in January of what was to be the first launch of a satellite from Britain was a mighty disappointment for a fledgling British space program. Now, it seems like the botched flight may lead to the demise of Virgin Orbit, the launch company.
In a U.S. securities filing on Thursday, the California company, part of Richard Branson's Virgin Group, said it was laying off 675 employees, or about 85 percent of its work force. Virgin Orbit said it was acting because of "inability to secure meaningful funding."
Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit's chief executive, had been scrambling to find additional money since the company's rocket failed to reach orbit after its launch from Cornwall, England. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment beyond the filing.
The company's stock, whose value has largely evaporated in recent months, plummeted 40 percent on Friday.
Virgin Orbit's woes may raise doubts about the company's unusual method of putting satellites in orbit. The company used a converted Boeing 747 aircraft that would carry aloft a satellite-packed rocket under its wing. Once airborne, the rocket would detach and fire its engine, climbing upward into orbit before releasing the satellites.
This launch format had the advantage of being more flexible and cheaper than vertical rocket launchers because it could operate from airstrips around the world. For that reason, it is likely to remain of interest to governments including the United States, some analysts say.
Virgin Orbit's woes leave a hole in Britain's space ambitions. Britain has a robust satellite-manufacturing industry that has felt hampered by the lack of a launching site at home. STANLEY REED
LABOR
Tesla and Musk Lose
Ruling on Union Issues
A federal appeals court on Friday affirmed a finding that Tesla illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing, and that the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, had illegally threatened workers' stock options if they chose to unionize.
The opinion, by three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, allows the National Labor Relations Board to enforce a 2021 order requiring Tesla to reinstate, with back pay, the employee, Richard Ortiz, and Mr. Musk to delete a Twitter post suggesting workers could lose stock options if they unionize.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the ruling.
The case at issue dates to 2017. At the time, Mr. Ortiz was known to be involved in an effort to unionize the company's plant in Fremont, Calif., when he posted screenshots of his anti-union co-workers on a private Facebook page.
When a company investigator asked Mr. Ortiz where the screenshots came from, Mr. Ortiz said he didn't remember. Mr. Ortiz later admitted that his response was a lie, and the company claimed it fired him over the false statement.
The labor board concluded that Mr. Ortiz had been fired because he was engaged in union activity, not because he lied. The circuit court agreed that "substantial evidence" pointed to that conclusion.
Mr. Musk's post from May 2018 said there was nothing stopping Tesla's employees at the plant from voting for a union, adding, "But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?"
The labor board concluded that the post would have been interpreted by employees as a threat to eliminate their stock options if they chose to unionize and ordered Mr. Musk to delete it. NOAM SCHEIBER

NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — A deadly storm system swept through the country’s midsection Friday, spawning ferocious tornadoes in Arkansas, collapsing a roof at a packed concert venue in Illinois and leaving millions of people under tornado watches from Texas to Michigan.
In Arkansas, the governor declared a state of emergency Friday afternoon after officials said one person was killed in North Little Rock and two died in Wynne, about 100 miles to the east, in separate tornadoes.
The mayor of Little Rock, Frank Scott, Jr., said at least 30 people were hospitalized there and over 2,000 homes were damaged. The storm did extensive storm damage to businesses and apartment complexes, local police said.
On Friday night, in northwestern Illinois, a person was killed and 28 others hospitalized after the roof collapsed at a theater in Belvidere with 260 people inside, the fire chief, Shawn Schadle, told reporters at the scene. He said five people had severe injuries.
Footage posted to social media appeared to show patrons at the venue, the Apollo Theatre, trying to find people beneath the rubble.
One of the bands on the bill, Morbid Angel, said in a Facebook post that the band’s members were still sheltering in place at the venue. The National Weather Service reported “possible tornado damage” in Belvidere.
About 200 miles south, in the village of Sherman, Illinois, more than a dozen homes were significantly damaged, Trevor J. Clatfelter, the mayor, said by phone Friday night. The storm, he said, had also caused major gas leaks, electricity outages and downed power poles across the village.
In Covington, Tennessee, six patients were hospitalized after a tornado touched down in the city, Kimberly Alexander, a spokesperson for the Baptist Memorial Hospital, said by phone Friday night. On Facebook, the Covington Police Department described the city as “impassable.”
In addition to Arkansas, Illinois and Tennessee, tornadoes were also reported to the weather service across Wisconsin, Iowa and Mississippi.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said officials there were on alert for the death toll to rise. “We’re hopeful that it doesn’t but I think given the nature and the volatility of the situation, we’re certainly preparing that it could,” she said at a news conference Friday night.
Frank Scott Jr., the mayor of Little Rock, said at a news conference Friday night that more than 30 people had been hospitalized in the city. Many residents, he added, had also been displaced.

NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — At least three people were killed and two dozen were injured in tornadoes that raked Arkansas on Friday and a roof collapsed at a concert venue in Illinois, as a storm system swept through the country’s midsection, from Wisconsin to Texas, officials said.
In Arkansas, the first tornado struck about 3 p.m. near Little Rock and prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency. It killed one person in North Little Rock, the coroner of Pulaski County, Gerone Q. Hobb, confirmed.
Later, in northwestern Illinois, a roof at a theater in Belvidere collapsed while people were inside the building, creating a “mass casualty incident,” dispatchers at the Boone County Sheriff’s Office said by phone Friday night, without providing more details. Footage posted to social media appeared to show patrons frantically trying to find people beneath the rubble.
One of the bands on the bill, Morbid Angel, said in a Facebook post that the band’s members were still sheltering in place at the venue, the Apollo Theatre. The National Weather Service reported “possible tornado damage” in Belvidere, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said on Twitter that his office was “closely monitoring the roof collapse” there.
In Covington, Tennessee, six patients were hospitalized after a tornado touched down in the city, Kimberly Alexander, a spokesperson for the Baptist Memorial Hospital, said by phone Friday night. Images posted to Facebook by the Covington Police Department showed downed trees and power poles. “Please do not get in vehicles and drive around,” police said.
In addition to Arkansas, Illinois and Tennessee, tornadoes were also reported to the weather service across Wisconsin, Iowa and Mississippi.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said officials there were on alert for the death toll to rise. “We’re hopeful that it doesn’t but I think given the nature and the volatility of the situation, we’re certainly preparing that it could,” she said at a news conference Friday night.
Frank Scott Jr., the mayor of Little Rock, said at a news conference Friday night that more than 30 people had been hospitalized in the city. Many residents, he added, had also been displaced.
In an interview, Scott said at least 2,100 homes were destroyed by the tornado and that it was too soon to know how much the damage might cost.
“I suspect we’ll be working through the damage for a week, if not longer,” Scott said.
A second tornado, in Wynne, Arkansas, about 100 miles east of Little Rock, struck about 6 p.m. and killed two people, the Arkansas emergency manager, Rebekah Magnus, said. No other information was immediately available.
In addition to the tornado emergency for parts of Little Rock, forecasters also declared an emergency for parts of nearby Sherwood and Jacksonville, Arkansas. More than 100,000 customers in Illinois, and 65,000 in Arkansas were without power as of Friday night, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country.
Baptist Health’s medical centers in Little Rock and North Little Rock were treating 21 patients — five of whom were in critical condition — Cara Wade, a spokesperson, said early Friday night. The two hospitals were anticipating a surge of additional patients.

The Memphis, Tennessee, office of the weather service planned to issue warnings and monitor the weather on their behalf, said Desiree Meadows, a meteorologist in Memphis. In the aftermath of the tornado, another tornado warning was issued for the Little Rock area.
Stephanie Carruthers, a manager at Trio’s restaurant in Pavilion in the Park shopping center in Little Rock, said about 25 employees and customers safely rode out the storm in the kitchen.
“It blew over so fast,” Carruthers said. “It started raining real hard, so we all ran into the kitchen. I turned around, and the front doors just blew up.”
Officials from fire departments in the Little Rock area said that search and rescue teams were on the ground, checking homes door-to-door for injured residents.
“At this time it doesn’t seem to be very many,” said Capt. Dustin Free, a spokesperson for the North Little Rock Fire Department. But, he added, the situation was still fluid.
Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, said that the service had recorded at least a half-dozen tornado reports from southeast Iowa into northwest Illinois on Friday.
Footage posted to social media appeared to show a large tornado touching down in Sigourney, a town of about 2,000 people about 70 miles southwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Other images from the region appeared to show torn-apart buildings and upturned cars.
Manny Galvez, a resident of Coralville, a city about 20 miles south of Cedar Rapids, said he had hunkered down in his basement just before 5 p.m. “That was terrifying,” Galvez said in a phone interview, adding that he had emerged about 40 minutes later to find nearby homes torn apart and trucks upturned.
A line of thunderstorms, ranging from strong to severe, extended from Little Rock and Memphis to southwestern Arkansas and into eastern Texas on Friday evening, Bann said, adding that some of those storms could produce tornadoes.
Damaging wind gusts and very large hail were expected in the region through Friday evening, the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center said. Widespread and damaging thunderstorms were likely, and flash flooding was also possible, forecasters said.
“Keep in mind that these storms will be fast moving today,” said Ashton Robinson Cook, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. “So if you find yourself in the path of one, be prepared to take shelter immediately.”
The storms were expected to move east through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, where they are expected to bring damaging winds and large hail, and may spawn strong tornadoes.
The storms could affect parts of Mississippi that were devastated last week by tornadoes that left at least 26 people dead.
President Joe Biden on Friday visited Rolling Fork, the Mississippi community hit hardest by the tornadoes last week. Tornadoes killed 13 people and destroyed homes and businesses in Rolling Fork and in surrounding Sharkey County.

Adidas Ends Opposition To B.L.M. Trademark
Two days after Adidas objected to a trademark application by the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for a logo featuring three parallel stripes, right, the German sportswear company said that it would withdraw its opposition. Adidas challenged the trademark application in a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Monday. On Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement that it would withdraw its opposition "as soon as possible." In the filing on Monday, Adidas said that it opposed the Black Lives Matter application because it showed a trademark that "incorporates three stripes in a manner that is confusingly similar" to the company's familiar three-stripe logo "in appearance and overall commercial impression." The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation filed the trademark application for a yellow three-stripe logo design in November 2020. The group is one of several organizations associated with the wider Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its statement, Adidas did not say why it was reversing its opposition to the trademark application. In September 2022, the window opened for individuals and groups to file their opposition to the foundation's trademark application. Adidas repeatedly sought to extend the window before submitting its notice of opposition on Monday, according to the filing. Adidas said that it had been using a three-stripe mark on footwear since at least 1952 and that the design had been used in its partnerships with professional athletes. In the filing, the company said that the public understood that the three-stripe mark "distinguishes and identifies Adidas's merchandise." AMANDA HOLPUCH

Group Criticizes Uganda Over Anti-L.G.B.T.Q. Bill
A business group including corporate giants like Google says it opposes Uganda's anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, calling it "a concern for global businesses and investors operating or planning to invest" in the East African country. The legislation, which prescribes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some homosexual offenses, would hurt Uganda's economy, the Open For Business coalition said in a statement Wednesday. "Diversity and inclusion are core principles of our coalition partners in the conduct of their businesses," the statement said. The legislation, if signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni, "would undermine Uganda's attractiveness as a place to do business and invest," it said. In addition to Google, the Open For Business coalition includes companies such as Microsoft, MasterCard, HSBC and Facebook's owner, Meta. Uganda's legislature last week passed the anti-homosexuality bill. The legislation is now with Mr. Museveni, who can sign it into law or return it back to the parliamentary speaker with proposed changes. The bill has wide support in Uganda, including among church leaders. It was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish the "promotion, recruitment and funding" of L.G.B.T.Q. activities in the country. Only two of 389 legislators present to vote opposed the bill. ASSOCIATED PRESS

After Drubbing, Defending TikTok Chief Goes Viral: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After lawmakers grilled TikTok's chief executive last week, the app's users argued that the platform should not be banned in the United States over national security concerns.
The latest viral trend on TikTok is defending TikTok.
"Now is the time to fight the ban on TikTok," read a caption of a TikTok video that was posted on Thursday about the app's future. "#savetiktok #keeptiktok."
"Do I believe TikTok should be banned? No," Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said on Friday in her first TikTok video, which netted more than 3.7 million views.
Other TikTok users shared video montages of the app's chief executive, Shou Chew, to the tune of pop songs and applied the "fancam" treatment typically reserved for celebrities.
Across TikTok, users have in recent days leaped to the defense of the popular video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. In hundreds of videos, they have argued that the app should not be banned in the United States over national security concerns, questioned why American social media apps aren't facing similar scrutiny and expressed concerns that their First Amendment rights are under attack.
The outcry follows rising concerns from lawmakers and the Biden administration over whether TikTok provides sensitive data about American users to Chinese authorities. On Thursday, Mr. Chew appeared before Congress and was grilled for roughly five hours, with lawmakers questioning whether TikTok was spying on Americans on behalf of the Chinese government, endangering young people with toxic content and invading people's privacy.
Mr. Chew said TikTok had a plan to protect American user data and denied that the Chinese government controlled ByteDance. But his answers were largely met with derision by lawmakers, fueling calls for TikTok to be banned entirely from Apple's and Google's app stores in the United States. The Biden administration has also pushed for TikTok to be separated from ByteDance through a sale, a move that China has opposed, or for it to try to strike an agreement with the U.S. government over data security concerns.
But on TikTok itself, lawmakers' concerns landed with a thud.
"There needs to be an age limit on congressional positions bc this was so embarrassing," one user wrote in the caption of a video posted on Friday.
Many were solidly against a TikTok ban in the United States. Doctors, self-defense experts, parenting influencers and others shared videos saying they were already researching ways to maintain access to the app even if it became banned and blamed Facebook and Google for the criticism.
The hashtag #TikTokBan had 1.7 billion views on Monday, up from 983 million on March 18.
Many TikTok users also rallied behind Mr. Chew, who is Singaporean. They highlighted lawmakers asking the executive yes or no questions and then interrupting him. They also portrayed Mr. Chew's responses as wins against uninformed lawmakers, who sometimes posed basic questions about the internet.
And they made their displeasure known in their videos. Some users cut together older photos of Mr. Chew and clips from the hearing with viral TikTok songs, like Chris Brown's "Under the Influence." One user posted videos of the "Schitt's Creek" character David Rose sighing and rolling his eyes to express disdain for lawmakers' questions. One account shared a video of a young child responding to the clips with exasperation.
The response was probably what TikTok had hoped for. Mr. Chew, who has avoided the public eye for much of his tenure as chief executive, posted a video last week on TikTok's main account and told American users that lawmakers "could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you." He posted another video after the hearing, reiterating TikTok's messages to lawmakers. Each video received more than 25 million views.
"It seems clear that much of America did not experience the hearing the same way many members of Congress and political insiders did," Brooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said in a statement.
Mr. Chew's messages were apparently taken to heart by some fans who posted on TikTok that they found him attractive. One video spliced photos of Mr. Chew to the beat of lyrics from the K-pop girl group New Jeans: "Oh my, oh my God, I was really hoping that he will come through." The caption read, "Come through for us shou oppa," referring to a Korean term for older men. It garnered more than 4.3 million views.
Others called Mr. Chew, 40, who is married with two children, a "zaddy," a slang term that rhymes with "daddy" and refers to older, attractive men.
"If TikTok bad, why is he Fine???" one user posted in a video with three-million-plus views. "shou zi chew didn't chew he devoured," one comment, which had some 29,000 likes, said under another video supporting the TikTok chief executive.
Mr. Chew, who had fewer than 20,000 followers on his personal TikTok account on March 21, now has 557,000, according to Trendpop, a social media analytics firm.
TikTok users also mocked some of the questions from lawmakers. One target of their ire was Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina, who asked Mr. Chew at last week's hearing if TikTok "can access the home Wi-Fi network." The exchange -- including Mr. Chew's puzzled response saying, "Only if the user turns on the Wi-Fi" -- was shared in multiple posts.
One caption read, "We're ... not entirely sure ... if Rep. Richard Hudson knows how TikTok OR WiFi works?" Another caption featured a series of wide-eyed blushing emojis.

Nashville in Anguish After Horror Strikes Haven: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As investigators searched for a motive in the killing of six people at the Covenant School in Nashville, the close-knit community there was struggling with the enormity of its loss.
NASHVILLE -- In a stately stone building on a hill, the Covenant School was a private academy designed as an escape from the bustle of Nashville and a haven where students could learn and grow, with a curriculum that reflected the Christian values of the families who sent their children there.
Katherine Koonce, the head of school, had a zeal for learning and saw in students potential they did not see in themselves. "You've got it," she would tell a struggling student. Mike Hill, a custodian, found fulfillment in work that his daughter said he absolutely loved. And there were bright students like 9-year-old Evelyn Dieckhaus, "a light for her family," her pastor said.
That carefully built sense of security was punctured on Monday when an armed assailant breached the campus, opening fire at random students and staff members. The community surrounding the Covenant School was now wrestling with a horrifying reality: Dr. Koonce, Mr. Hill and Evelyn were all dead, as were two other 9-year-old students and a substitute teacher who had been fatally shot in the attack.
"Our hearts are completely broken," Evelyn's family said in a short statement released on Tuesday. "We cannot believe this has happened."
As investigators try to piece together a motive for the attack, the authorities praised the actions of the Nashville police officers who rushed into the school, saying they moved swiftly in pursuing and fatally shooting the assailant.
The authorities said on Tuesday that the 28-year-old perpetrator had legally purchased seven firearms recently -- including the three used in the shooting -- and was being treated by a doctor for an emotional disorder. Chief John Drake of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said that the assailant's parents had felt that their child "should not own weapons" and believed that their child did not.
Tennessee does not have what is known as a red flag law that would allow the authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from those found to be in danger to themselves or others, and the Republican-controlled State Legislature has steadily loosened restrictions on owning guns.
Still, Chief Drake said that if the police had known that the perpetrator was suicidal or intended to hurt others, "then we would have tried to get those weapons."
Even with the uncertainty over what motivated the attack, the magnitude of the loss was clear as relatives, friends and people who knew the victims expressed their grief.
The other children who were killed were identified as William Kinney and Hallie Scruggs, whose father is the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, the church connected to the school. Cynthia Peak, 61, was the substitute teacher killed.
Hannah Williams, who knows the Scruggs family, struggled to wrap her head around the trauma that those closest to the victims were now enduring.
"This family did not deserve this," Ms. Williams wrote on a post on Facebook. "No family does. They deserve to wake up from this nightmare with Hallie by their side."
In a video statement on Tuesday evening, Gov. Bill Lee said that Ms. Peak was a close friend of his wife, Maria. "Cindy was supposed to come over to have dinner with Maria last night," he said. He described the anguish caused by the shooting -- "the emptiness, the lack of understanding, the desperate desire for answers, the desperate need for hope," he said.
"We're enduring a very difficult moment," Mr. Lee said. "Everyone is hurting, everyone."
Nashville has weathered turbulence and heartache in recent years. There were floods and a deadly tornado. In 2020, a man consumed by bizarre conspiracy theories detonated a van filled with explosives on Christmas morning, killing himself and severely damaging a swath of downtown.
But this was different, as it kindled in the city a level of terror that other communities had faced amid recurring mass shootings but Nashville had not. In a post on Twitter not long after the shooting, Mayor John Cooper said, "Nashville joined the dreaded, long list of communities to experience a school shooting."
The shooting has reverberated beyond Nashville, too, stoking fury and frustration and invigorating once again the country's divisions over violence and access to guns. President Biden called for a ban on assault rifles, as he has done after other recent mass shootings -- a repetition he acknowledged with a sense of exasperation on Tuesday. "I can't do anything except plead with the Congress to act reasonably," he said.
In Dallas, as worshipers gathered on Tuesday at Park Cities Presbyterian Church, the pain was much more personal. Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church and Hallie's father, had been the pastor there before moving to Nashville.
"The reality is, this event in Nashville is not merely an event for one school or one church or city," said Paul Goebel, an associate pastor at Park Cities Presbyterian. "It touches our church, our community deeply, but it also affects and touches our whole nation."
Mr. Scruggs, who left that congregation in 2018, returned to Dallas in February to preach, pointing out Hallie and her three siblings sitting in the pews. "Their story, in many ways, began here," he said at the time.
Mark Davis, the current pastor at Park Cities Presbyterian, said he spoke to Mr. Scruggs on Monday afternoon; in that conversation, Mr. Scruggs acknowledged that "he's in shock." The congregation also had ties to Ms. Peak, the substitute teacher who was killed. Her sister worshiped there. Some who stood to pray for the victims during the vigil on Tuesday referred to Ms. Peak as "Aunt Cindy."
"We're here because our hearts are broken," Pastor Davis told the congregation. "We're here because we have questions."
The Covenant School, which was founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, has about 200 students attending its campus in an affluent area of Nashville, where streets overwhelmed by the city's rush of development in recent years give way to tree-covered hills.
It is part of a network of conservative evangelical churches and private schools in Nashville that is tight-knit, even across denominational lines. Some families attended church at one place and school in another. Palmer Williams, whose older son went to the Covenant School for his first several years of school, said she took her children out of the school only because she was involved in founding another school with a similar approach. "We wanted more schools like Covenant," she said.
Dr. Koonce, the head of school since 2016, had previously worked at Christ Presbyterian Academy, a private school just five miles away. There, she nurtured a passion for working with students who had learning disabilities.
"She has always been a woman who is deeply passionate about kids having a love of learning," said David Thomas, a longtime friend of Dr. Koonce's and a director of family counseling at Daystar Counseling Ministries in Nashville.
She tutored Joseph Fisher in math years ago. He's 34 now but still remembers the way she encouraged him. "She just believed that I have more to give -- and I did," he said. When he learned that she had been killed, Mr. Fisher, now a truck driver, said that he parked and walked up a mountainside, stunned.
Mr. Hill, a father of seven and grandfather of 14, liked to cook and spend time with family, his family said in a statement. He was "beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years," the statement said.
The Covenant School had a student-teacher ratio of 8 to 1, and Dr. Koonce was invested in building a nurturing environment for students.
On the morning of the shooting, students sang "Amazing Grace" in the chapel and practiced saying "jambo" -- a traditional Swahili greeting -- with a missionary doctor who was visiting the school.
"It was just such a sweet interaction with those kids," said Dr. Britney Grayson, the visiting doctor, a pediatric surgeon from Kenya. "Everything was normal about our day. It went exactly like we thought it would -- better than expected."
She left shortly before the shooting, stirring conflicting feelings: She knew she avoided witnessing the shooting, but wondered if she could have been in a position to help.
Dr. Grayson said she had operated on children with gunshot wounds before, including one child who was injured in a school shooting in the United States. "It's like, 'Why wasn't I still there?"' she said. "And in the very next breath, you think, 'Well, I might be dead, too.' I don't know that I'll ever be able to process those conflicting thoughts."
The shooting also stirred fears about the lasting consequences it would have for children in the community, particularly those close to the victims.
"They are a family that has impacted more people than they will ever know," Hannah Williams wrote in a Facebook post about the Scruggs family. "Hallie's brothers: John Randall, Charlie, and Carter have lost their one and only sister at ages where this trauma will impact their forming brains forever."
But there was also hope that the spirit of the school -- the sense of closeness and warmth -- would endure.
On Monday night, Palmer Williams's family joined others at a baseball field, gathering spontaneously to tie ribbons to a chain-link fence. Her son knew William Kinney through a baseball league. The children were running the bases -- "grieving the way kids do," Ms. Williams said, "which is sadness but also just being kids."

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — In a stately stone building on a hill, the Covenant School was a private academy designed as an escape from the bustle of Nashville and a haven where students could learn and grow, with a curriculum that reflected the Christian values of the families who sent their children there.
Katherine Koonce, the head of the school, had a zeal for learning and saw in students potential they did not see in themselves. “You’ve got it,” she would tell a struggling student.

They were children, two girls and a boy, all 9 years old.
They were substitute teachers and custodians and the head of school.
All six were killed on Monday, when a 28-year-old assailant opened fire inside The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, in the latest school shooting to plague America.
The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department on Monday identified the children killed in the shooting as Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney and Hallie Scruggs, and the school employees as Mike Hill, 61, a school custodian; Katherine Koonce, 60, Covenant’s head of school; and Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher.
Clay Stauffer, the senior minister of Woodmont Christian Church in Nashville, who said that he knows the Dieckhaus family from church, called Evelyn “an amazing young girl,” and said that her sister, who attends his church’s disciples class, is “absolutely heartbroken.” The Dieckhaus family said in a statement that Evelyn was “a shining light in this world” and that “we cannot believe this has happened.”
Before holding a prayer vigil at his church on Monday, Stauffer said he spent much of the day across the street at Woodmont Baptist Church, which was set up as a reunification area for parents to meet their children.
“That was very hard, very emotional,” Stauffer said. “Not only did we lose a third grader, we also had many other children who are part of our church who were in that building and who were able to make it out to see their families.”
Hallie Scruggs used to live in Dallas, where her father, Chad Scruggs, served as the minister of the Park Cities Presbyterian Church, before moving to Nashville. Now the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, Chad Scruggs in February returned to the pulpit in Dallas to preach, describing the Park Cities community as “incredibly formational in the life of my kids.”
“Their story, in many ways, began here,” he told the congregation.
Hannah Williams, who knew the Scruggs family from when they lived in Dallas, said she babysat the Scruggs children a couple of times.
“This family is pure sweetness and kindness,” Williams said in a Facebook post. “They are a family that has impacted more people than they will ever know. Hallie’s brothers: John Randall, Charlie, and Carter have lost their one and only sister at ages where this trauma will impact their forming brains forever.”
Williams added: “When you see Hallie’s name in Instagram posts, news stories, see this family. This family did not deserve this. No family does. They deserve to wake up from this nightmare with Hallie by their side.”
The family of Hill, the school custodian, said in a statement on Tuesday that they are grateful that he was “beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years.” He liked to cook and spend time with family, they said, including his seven children and 14 grandchildren.
At Covenant, Hill worked a “job that everyone knows he absolutely loved,” a daughter, Brittany Hill, wrote on Facebook on Monday.
Koonce, the head of school, had served in the role at Covenant since 2016, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that, she had worked for 16 years at Christ Presbyterian Academy, a private school in Nashville just 5 miles from Covenant, the academy said.
David Thomas, a longtime friend of Koonce’s and a director of family counseling at Nashville-based Daystar Counseling Ministries, said Koonce was a “steady, strong and wise” leader at both schools. At Christ Presbyterian, she worked for many years with students with learning disabilities, and was “such a champion of celebrating kids who struggled with learning,” he said.
“She has always been a woman who is deeply passionate about kids having a love of learning,” Thomas said.
Diane Button, 64, met Koonce in the early 2000s, when she and her family moved to Nashville and her three children began school at Christ Presbyterian. The two became close friends, spending hours discussing parenting, faith and what it means to live a good life, Button said in a Facebook message.
“Katherine was as solid as a friend could be,” Button said. “Her faith was her foundation. Her family was her greatest love, yet she always wanted to work and give back so other families and children could also feel loved and cared for.”

The Holey Clog Is Transcending Pandemic Chic: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While other brands that thrived with customers in quarantine have dropped off, sales of the easily slipped-on clogs are up nearly 200 percent since 2019.
Like Peloton, Etsy and Zoom, Crocs saw its business boom during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. The company's aesthetically questionable but easily slipped-on clogs were the perfect footwear for Americans puttering around their homes, gardens and kitchens during quarantine.
But while many people got off their exercise bikes, cut back on D.I.Y. arts projects and resumed in-person meetings as a sense of normalcy returned to the world, they have kept their Crocs on.
Maggwa Ndugga of Raleigh, N.C., bought his first pair in 2020 and now has five. And he is spreading his enthusiasm, giving his parents and sisters each a pair for Christmas.
"They're not the most appealing things to look at," Mr. Ndugga, 25, said, but they offer support to his flat feet and can be worn whether he's working at his standing desk at home, running errands, hiking on the weekends or lifting weights.
"I roll into the gym with my Crocs on and everything, and people ask, 'Aren't you going to change shoes?"' Mr. Ndugga said. "No, this is how I'm going to live life for now."
Fans like Mr. Ndugga -- along with celebrities like Questlove, who has been known to sport the clogs at award shows -- have helped Crocs emerge as a rarity in the business world. It is a pandemic winner whose success might outlast pandemic shopping behavior.
The stock prices and sales of Peloton, Etsy and Zoom have dropped since their sharp rises in the pandemic, but Crocs' stock has soared 167 percent since January 2020. The company's annual sales have increased 200 percent since 2019.
At a recent conference in New York held by the wealth manager UBS, Andrew Rees, the chief executive of Crocs, said he often heard from the investment community that "Crocs was a pandemic beneficiary and it's going to return to its norm."
"There is very little chance of that happening, quite honestly," Mr. Rees told a room of investors and analysts.
Last month, after announcing that quarterly sales rose 61 percent, Crocs said it anticipated another record year of growth. Its management team laid out an ambitious business plan that promised more robust profits and revenues when many in the retail industry are trying to temper investor expectations. (Part of the surge in overall sales is coming from the company's acquisition of the footwear brand Hey Dude.)
Crocs said in November that it expected revenue from its namesake shoe line to reach more than $ 5 billion in three years, a nearly 90 percent increase. It sees its adjusted operating margin staying around 26 percent even as other consumer companies are feeling a squeeze in their profits.
Of course, the company, which is based in Broomfield, Colo., might not reach these goals. Fashion is notoriously fickle, and footwear is a category that relies on the popular apparel of the moment, such as the latest jean cut.
But the reason for the optimism, company executives and analysts say, is a steady stream of new products and shrewd marketing, especially on social media, where Crocs has cultivated a devoted customer base. It has 165,000 followers on Twitter and even more on TikTok (920,600), Instagram (1.6 million) and Facebook (6.9 million).
Over the years, the brand has developed a distinctive online voice through its use of emojis and memes, making shoppers feel that its aim is creating a community rather than just getting people to buy more clogs.
The company is adept at seizing cultural moments, as it did when it tweeted about Questlove wearing black Crocs on the Oscars' champagne-colored carpet this month. And during the pandemic, it drove customers to its mobile app with the promise of discounts, which it called Appy Hours.
"It's not like people haven't heard of using social media to create brand awareness and brand relevance, but this management team is just doing it better," Jay Sole, a retail analyst at UBS, said.
Crocs has steadily become more popular among Generation Z shoppers, a coveted demographic for any retail brand. In the fall, teenagers ranked Crocs No. 5 on a list of footwear brands, according to a biannual Piper Sandler survey. In 2017, it was No. 38. Hey Dude also cracked the top 10 in the most recent survey.
The more obsessive customers collect Crocs, which often sell for $ 49.99; it's not uncommon for someone to have a dozen pairs or more. They can be accessorized with Jibbitz, the personalized trinkets pushed into the holes of Crocs clogs.
Adreanna Alleyne, who has at least 60 pairs, is the kind of loyal customer Crocs is counting on to spur future growth. She likes the look of the sandals and the wedges, is active in a Crocs Facebook fan page and sees the brand as a way to connect with others.
"My Crocs are part of my self-care," said Ms. Alleyne, 33, of Roanoke, Va. "I'm not going to give up my therapy because the economy is going to crap. You go in for the shoe, but you stay for the community."
Her 8-year-old son is now hooked, too. He owns 20 pairs and recently received a pair from his father, who lives in Kuwait. (Ms. Alleyne and her son have a long way to go before catching up to Doogie Lish Sandtiger, whose 2,100 pairs of Crocs are reputed to be the most.)
This type of customer loyalty is cost-efficient because a company has to spend more money and time on marketing to win over a new shopper.
"The chance of them buying another one is high," Mr. Sole said of customers who buy into Crocs' community aspect. "That means you don't have to remarket to them."
To reach its ambitious sales targets, Crocs will rely on sandals and lightweight Hey Dude shoes in addition to its classic clog.
"Like any large company, the meteoric growth of the early years becomes more and more difficult to replicate," said Matt Powell, the founder of Spurwink River, a retail consulting firm. "They recognize that the clog is the most important product. They've worked really hard to diversify away from that to take some pressure off of it."
Crocs' sandals carry lower profit margins than its clogs, but people generally buy sandals more frequently than other types of footwear. And a person who buys a pair of Crocs sandals, Mr. Rees said, is one who can be converted into a clog wearer.
Crocs' sandal business had $ 310 million in sales in 2022, and the company is projecting $ 400 million this year. Mr. Rees says he and his team have more work to do overseas, noting that sandals are a $ 30 billion global category. They hope to increase sales in India and countries throughout Southeast Asia, where many people wear sandals year-round. Currently, North America accounts for 60 percent of all sales for the Crocs brand.
Hey Dude has its own devoted following. On average, a typical customer owns four pairs of its shoes. The brand has expanded under Crocs by tapping into the company's marketing resources and relationships with national retailers. It is on track to reach $ 1 billion in sales this year.
During times of economic uncertainty, companies often spend less money on marketing. Crocs said it would continue to lean on its slate of influencers, brand partnerships and digital advertising campaigns. It invests about 7 to 8 percent of its sales into marketing, and the company said it would spend more than $ 200 million on marketing initiatives this year. That will include rolling out more celebrity and big-name partnerships targeted toward specific regions around the world, and having a presence at live events like the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
This wasn't a push that emerged during Covid. The company's marketing strategy started to change when Mr. Rees took over in 2017. The focus became all digital -- no more TV ads, for example -- and celebrities like Post Malone, Zooey Deschanel and Bad Bunny were signed to endorsement deals.
The elements of Crocs' current expansion plan are not all that dissimilar from what the company tried to do under previous management teams. After its debut in 2006 as a publicly traded company, it released leather boots and golf shoes and bought Jibbitz. It opened hundreds of stores, from fashionable neighborhoods like SoHo in New York to dowdy airports.
Executives said that initial expansion had come at a high cost. Without a cohesive global marketing strategy, the company lost focus on the classic clog as new merchandise flooded the market. The brand lost relevancy.
"They were selling everybody and weren't delivering to very many people, at least consistently," Mr. Powell said.
Crocs faces the risk that the cultural winds can shift away from them. Customers could start falling in love with another type of shoe. But analysts say its management team has shown that it can pinpoint consumer behavior and use those insights to sell even more shoes that customers like.
"They found a way to get into the better market -- the more fashion-forward market," Mr. Powell said. "They really are really hitting on a lot of the right notes right now."

Full text: The digital version of the SIM card, included on many newer phones, is set to become prevalent. It also offers affordable cellular data abroad.
As vacation season looms, now is as good a time as ever to bite the bullet and become familiar with a smartphone feature that many of us have ignored for years: the eSIM, the digital version of the SIM card that carries your phone number.
Among many benefits, eSIM technology is a boon for travelers, and pretty soon we will all be using it because the physical SIM card will be no more. Let me explain.
Last year, Apple eliminated the SIM card tray from the iPhone 14 to free up space. That means the SIM card, which acts as a key that connects your phone with cellular networks, is being phased out for Apple phones.
Where Apple leads, others typically follow, so you can expect handset makers like Samsung and Google to also go all-in on eSIM -- a digitized SIM card embedded into the phone's computer chip that you can activate with any cellular network's service plan.
"Whether we like it or not, it's coming," Roger Entner, a telecom expert and founder of the research firm Recon Analytics, said about eSIM technology.
But this move isn't really all about Apple. The Federal Communications Commission also favors eSIM technology, because it makes it easier for people to switch to a different carrier by using software instead of going to a store for a physical SIM card. And the technology has security benefits: If your phone is stolen, thieves can't remove an eSIM to hijack your phone number and commit identity theft, as they could with a physical SIM card.
Most important, the experience of using eSIM data plans for travel has greatly improved. About five years ago, eSIM data plans for international roaming were overpriced, and cell service was sometimes unreliable. But in the last year, I've tested a few eSIM services when I left the country and found them to be cost-effective and zippy.
As is always the case with new technology, there are downsides. Activating a data plan on a foreign network with an eSIM is not as straightforward as sticking a different SIM card into your phone. The process is especially challenging for those who are less familiar with technology, putting the onus on more tech savvy companions to help them make the switch.
There are also privacy concerns. Many eSIM service providers offer apps that collect your data for tracking purposes.
You can use my experience as a template for navigating the inevitable transition to eSIM. Recently, I tried eSIM data plans when traveling with several members of my family and acted as their tech sherpa through the switch.
Step 1: Pick an eSIM
The main reason to use eSIM services for travel is to save money. The big U.S. carriers, like AT&T and Verizon, offer international roaming options, including $ 10 day passes for using your phone in foreign countries. The costs quickly add up for a two-week trip with family.
In contrast, an eSIM data package that can be used for the entirety of your trip costs a few dollars. The tricky part is choosing an eSIM service provider because there are many, and most are unfamiliar brands like Airalo, GigSky and Flexiroam. (Apple provides a list of eSIM service providers on its website.)
For a recent weeklong trip to Montreal, I researched travel blogs and picked Nomad, which offered a gigabyte of data that could be used for seven days in Canada for $ 7. I had the option to activate the plan with Nomad's app or by following setup instructions on the company's website. The app had high reviews in the App Store, so I clicked the download button.
Step 2: Activate the eSIM Service
A nice thing about eSIM is that you can buy a plan and set up the service on your phone well in advance of a trip, then activate it when you arrive at your destination. After you buy a plan, the eSIM service provider sends you a list of instructions.
The Nomad app showed a list of steps. In the iPhone's settings app, I clicked on the cellular menu, clicked "Add eSIM" and typed in an activation code. As I crossed the border into Canada, I went back into the cellular settings, selected the Nomad phone line and toggled on the option for "Turn on this line."
(If you still use a physical SIM card for your domestic phone line, you need not remove it. In the phone's cellular settings, you just switch off the service for your primary line to avoid roaming charges.)
After I picked this eSIM plan, I shared the Nomad app with my wife and brother-in-law, who each followed the instructions to set it up by themselves. I didn't know how to advise my mother-in-law, who never downloads apps, how to set up the plan, so I did it for her.
Herein lies the real problem: Less tech-inclined folks are probably not going to know how to use eSIM services. When my mother-in-law went on a trip to Hong Kong alone and I wasn't nearby to set up the service for her, I told her to pay for AT&T's international roaming plan and find a store later to buy a SIM card from a Hong Kong phone carrier.
Terry Guo, a chief product officer of LotusFlare, the company that developed Nomad, agreed that the main demographic of travelers using eSIM service plans comprised younger, more tech-savvy people.
"We are doing a lot of work in the app to make this simpler," he said.
Optional (but Important) Step: Protect Your Privacy
Another downside to eSIM services is privacy-related. All the eSIM service providers I researched in Apple's App Store said in their app descriptions that they did some tracking of users across different apps and websites.
Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a company that helps businesses reduce their wireless bills, underlined the importance of safeguarding personal information from eSIM providers. He said many of these companies, known as mobile virtual network operators, had struggled to generate profit.
"One way they think they'll make money is selling your information," Mr. Toikka said. "That's why you should always opt out of any tracking. You shouldn't sell yourself for pennies on a dollar."
Mr. Guo said that the Nomad app contained Google's analytics technology to see how people were using the app, and that people who logged into the app with their Facebook accounts could also be tracked by Facebook.
A simple workaround to data collection is to avoid logging into an app with third-party sites like Facebook and Google. Apple users can also click "Ask app not to track" when opening an eSIM app for the first time.
Android users don't have the option to ask apps not to track them, so their best option is to buy the eSIM plan from the company's website and set up the service without downloading the app.
Bottom Line
Overall, the pros of eSIM outweigh the cons. Traveling with a smartphone with SIM cards wasn't relaxing because you needed to carry a pin to eject the card tray; plus you had to make sure not to lose the tiny SIM card.
When returning from a trip using eSIM services, all you have to do is go back into the phone's settings app and switch your domestic phone line back on. That simplicity and peace of mind make eSIM worth the hassle.

Toxic Spill Flows Toward Delaware River: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than 8,000 gallons of an acrylic polymer solution leaked on Friday into a tributary of the Delaware River, a source of the city's drinking water.
Philadelphia officials on Sunday evening stepped back from a suggestion earlier in the day that residents consider using bottled water rather than tap water for drinking and cooking after a chemical leaked into a tributary of the Delaware River, a source of drinking water for about 14 million people across four states.
The previous advisory, issued on Sunday morning, came after a pipe ruptured at Trinseo PLC, a chemical plant, late on Friday, sending about 8,100 gallons of a water-soluble acrylic polymer solution into Otter Creek in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, officials said.
Officials emphasized that contaminants had not been found in the city's water system.
Officials said residents, out of an abundance of caution, could consider buying bottled water because, they said, it could not "be 100 percent sure that there won't be traces of these chemicals in the tap water throughout the afternoon."
At a news briefing later on Sunday, Michael Carroll, Philadelphia's deputy managing director for transportation, infrastructure and sustainability, said such measures were unnecessary.
"If you want to store water, you should feel free to draw it from your tap, store it in a bottle, you can put in a pitcher, put it in your fridge," he said. "There's no need at this time for people to be rushing out and buying bottled water."
Further, he said, the chance of contamination was diminishing over time. Flyovers by helicopter revealed no visual evidence of plumes in the river and tests revealed no levels of contamination near a water plant intake.
Nonetheless, the spill, coming more than a month after the catastrophic release of chemicals in a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, appeared fresh on the minds of Philadelphia residents.
On a Facebook page featuring the earlier city news conference, commenters drew parallels to the Ohio derailment and sounded a reluctance to drink the municipal tap water.
Videos on social media showed a rush to buy bottled water and local television news also showed residents emptying grocery shelves of bottled water.
In an update on Sunday evening, Mr. Carroll said that tidal conditions and rain on Saturday should help the river "flush itself out" into the Delaware Bay.
"In a matter of days, the water in the Delaware should be OK," Mr. Carroll added, emphasizing that the water in the tap -- coming from water treatment facilities that were sampled for contamination earlier in the day -- would be safe to drink until at least Monday evening.
After the spill, the city took in enough river water to supply its customers through 11:59 p.m. on Monday. Officials were confident that the supply was not contaminated. They planned to take in more water Sunday evening to reach customers' taps by Tuesday -- if testing proves that the fresh supply is safe.
The chemical leak appeared to result from an equipment failure, Trinseo said in a statement. Company representatives could not immediately be reached for further comment on Sunday.
"It's like the material you find in paint," Tim Thomas, a vice president at the Trinseo chemical plant, told WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. "It's your typical acrylic paint you have in your house. That's what really this material is, in a water base."
Philadelphia's water system serves about 2 million people in the city and surrounding counties, sourcing more than half of it from the Delaware River basin. The Delaware River also supplies water to Delaware, New Jersey and New York.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection said as of Sunday morning, "no additional product was leaving the facility and entering the Delaware River." Still, the U.S. Coast Guard, which also responded to the spill, said that people should avoid the site where cleanup operations were underway.
Two of the chemicals released through the burst pipe were butyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate, both colorless liquids with an acrid odor that are used for making paints, caulks and adhesives.
Both chemicals can cause breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes and skin, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Butyl acrylate was among the hazardous materials aboard the Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Ohio.

Apple's Newest Product Is Nearly Here. Some Employees Are Far From Excited.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is expected to unveil an augmented reality headset in a few months. Some employees wonder if the device makes sense for Apple.
When Apple held a corporate retreat in California's Carmel Valley about five years ago to discuss its next major product, Jony Ive, its longtime design chief, captivated a room of the company's 100 top executives with a concept video as polished as an Apple commercial.
The video showed a man in a London taxi donning an augmented reality headset and calling his wife in San Francisco. "Would you like to come to London?" he asked, two people who saw the video said. Soon, the couple were sharing the sights of London through the husband's eyes.
The video excited executives about the possibilities of Apple's next business-altering device: a headset that would blend the digital world with the real one.
But now, as the company prepares to introduce the headset in June, enthusiasm at Apple has given way to skepticism, said eight current and former employees, who requested anonymity because of Apple's policies against speaking about future products. There are concerns about the device's roughly $ 3,000 price, doubts about its utility and worries about its unproven market.
That dissension has been a surprising change inside a company where employees have built devices -- from the iPod to the Apple Watch -- with the single-mindedness of a moon mission.
Some employees have defected from the project because of their doubts about its potential, three people with knowledge of the moves said. Others have been fired over the lack of progress with some aspects of the headset, including its use of Apple's Siri voice assistant, one person said.
Even leaders at Apple have questioned the product's prospects. It has been developed at a time when morale has been strained by a wave of departures from the company's design team, including Mr. Ive, who left Apple in 2019 and stopped advising the company last year.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans for future products.
Apple's headset is considered a bellwether for virtual and augmented reality. For more than a decade, tech leaders have been hyping it as the next wave of computing after the smartphone. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, told university students last year that in the near future "you'll wonder how you lived your life without augmented reality, just like today you wonder: How did people like me grow up without the internet?"
But the road to deliver augmented reality has been littered with failures, false starts and disappointments, from Google Glass to Magic Leap and from Microsoft's HoloLens to Meta's Quest Pro. Apple is considered a potential savior because of its success combining new hardware and software to create revolutionary devices. Still, the challenges are daunting.
Meta, Facebook's parent company, has plowed billions of dollars into trying to build a virtual reality business. The experience has been humbling. It has sold about 20 million of its $ 400 Quest 2 headsets since 2020 and recently cut the price of the Quest Pro, its premium device, to $ 1,000 from $ 1,500 amid lackluster sales.
By comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million iPhones annually with an average selling price of more than $ 800.
Unlike the iPhone, which incorporated many existing technologies, virtual reality is requiring Apple and others to design new chips and wearable displays, said Matthew Ball, author of "The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything." "The difficulty of the problem has been far greater than anyone expected," he added.
Uncertainty about the potential of Apple's project has led some people who have worked on it to speculate that the company could delay its release, especially in light of the shaky economy, these people said. The company has postponed other new products in the past, including AirTags, the coin-size location tracking devices, which Apple withheld for more than a year as it addressed privacy issues. But at this point, headset manufacturing is underway for a planned reveal in June, the people said.
Apple is projected to ship fewer than 500,000 headsets in a year, according to Counterpoint Research, a market research firm. By comparison, the company was expected to ship about 40 million Apple Watches after its debut. The modest expectations for the headset speak to the challenges in a category where sales declined 12 percent last year to $ 1.1 billion, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
Seeking to define a nascent market is an aberration for Apple.
"Apple is always pretty good at coming into a market when the market is already established and changing that market," said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies. "This is not the case for Apple VR and XR. There's still a lot of learning."
Some internal skeptics have questioned if the new device is a solution in search of a problem. Unlike the iPod, which put digital songs in people's pockets, and the iPhone, which combined the abilities of a music player and a phone, the headset hasn't been driven by the same clarity, these people said.
The product is being birthed during a period of limbo. This year, Mr. Ive's successor overseeing industrial design, Evans Hankey, departed. With design's leadership in flux, Mike Rockwell, an engineer, has been leading development of the device.
The headset looks like ski goggles. It features a carbon fiber frame, a hip pack with battery support, outward cameras to capture the real world and two 4K displays that can render everything from applications to movies, two of the people said. Users can turn a "reality dial" on the device to increase or decrease real-time video from the world around them.
The New York Times has previously reported on some features, as have Bloomberg and The Information.
The headset is expected to cost about $ 3,000, three of the people said. And it is considered a bridge to a future product, such as augmented reality glasses, that would have broader appeal but require technical breakthroughs.
Because the headset won't fit over glasses, the company has plans to sell prescription lenses for the displays to people who don't wear contacts, a person familiar with the plan said.
During the device's development, Apple has focused on making it excel for videoconferencing and spending time with others as avatars in a virtual world. The company has called the device's signature application "copresence," a word designed to capture the experience of sharing a real or virtual space with someone in another place. It is akin to what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, calls the "metaverse."
The device will double as a tool for artists, designers and engineers, tracking them as they draw freely in space in image-editing applications and tracking hand gestures for the editing of virtual reality films. Lastly, it will function as a high-resolution TV with custom-made video content from Hollywood filmmakers such as Jon Favreau, the director of "Iron Man."
Apple is expected to pitch its device as something different from those that Meta has introduced. During an interview last year with the Dutch publication Bright, Mr. Cook said he avoided using the term "metaverse" because it was foreign to the average person.
The headset's price and applications suggest that it will appeal more to businesses such as design firms than to many of the one billion iPhone owners. Apple has enriched itself by selling expensive smartphones but always balanced price with utility.
Mr. Ball, the author of "The Metaverse," compared the company's strategy with this device to Tesla's strategy with the Roadster, its initial $ 100,000 electric vehicle. Eventually, Tesla followed it with lower-priced cars with broader appeal.
Ms. Milanesi said Apple's experimental approach with the goggles appeared to be more like its execution of the Apple Watch than its introduction of the iPhone. Apple initially portrayed the watch as a miniature extension of an iPhone. After learning what consumers were doing with the watch, the company marketed it more as a fitness accessory akin to a Fitbit.
"It's not very Apple-like," Ms. Milanesi said. "But Apple is a very, very different company."

For Cherry Blossoms, a Big Fan Base: [Style Desk]

Full text: The interactive maps that track the progress of cherry blossom buds each spring have attracted an enthusiastic fan base.
Weeks before the Brooklyn Botanic Garden updated CherryWatch, the online tracker that documents the progress of a majority of the garden's 220 cherry blossom trees, staff members noticed that some people had already begun to check the website for the first signs of spring.
"People will sort of jump the gun and see that we've turned on the map even before we've officially announced it," said Elizabeth Reina-Longoria, the communications director at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Once people see the first blossoms appear on the map, which usually occur sometime in March, there is a flood of regular visitors to the site. She said that the spirit was very much: "'It's on! It's game time!"'
For many New Yorkers -- and for some former city dwellers, too -- the map serves a practical purpose as well as a more whimsical one. It is a handy tool for visitors to use in planning their travels and to ensure that they can see the maximum number of cherry blossoms when they go. (At Brooklyn Botanic Garden, there is a period of about five to six weeks in which different species and cultivars of trees are flowering.) But over the years, monitoring the tree tracker has become its own springtime rite. Some refresh the site almost as regularly as they would Instagram or Twitter.
"When I lived in New York City, I absolutely checked on a daily basis," said Christine Amorose Merrill, 34, who now lives in San Diego and works in ad sales. She plans to visit New York's cherry blossoms sometime this spring, as has become her annual tradition. But, she said, "Frankly, I just find it really fun to see all of the little icons turn to pink and wonder about whose job it is to keep it updated."
Indeed, the map has its aesthetic charms. Though it is more technologically advanced than it was when the Brooklyn Botanic Garden introduced it in 2006 -- at the time, it was a graphic that staff members would manually update every day -- the interactive map still recalls the early days of the internet. On a 2-D map of the garden, prebloom buds are represented by pale green dots that turn into pink, and then purple, flower icons. Trees past their peak turn to dark green dots.
"There's something nice about how simple it is -- it's really low-fi," said Jackie Liu, 26, a user experience product designer who lives within walking distance of the garden. She tends to keep the blossom map in a tab on her laptop to revisit every few days.
"It is genuinely such a joyful part of being online," said Meredith Carey, who works as the deputy editor at TripAdvisor. (She does not work with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in her role.) When she shared a screenshot of the map on her Instagram Stories last week, she said, several friends messaged her looking forward to planning visits this spring.
As for whose job it is to monitor the buds, it is usually the same one or two people who walk the grounds every weekday and take a look themselves, Ms. Reina-Longoria said. It's a similar case with the Central Park Conservancy's tracker, which went live for the first time this season after the success of an interactive map for the park's fall foliage. According to a spokesman for the conservancy, a team of people who maintain Central Park's 18,000 trees report back on which cherry blossoms are in bloom so the tracker can be updated.
In Washington, D.C., David Coleman's cherry blossom tracker, which he started around 2010, has about 42,000 followers on Facebook who read his regular reports on the trees. Once buds begin to peek through in late February and March, Mr. Coleman, a professional travel photographer, typically hits the pavement every few days to capture the blossoms around the Tidal Basin.
"I get, every year, to hear the excitement that spring is back -- to hear from ex-locals who have moved away and like to follow along from afar for a little taste of home, to hear from visitors planning trips to tick off a longtime bucket-list item," Mr. Coleman, 50, said. "What really brings it alive for me each spring is the palpable enthusiasm people have for them."

Full text: One person was found alive overnight in the rubble after the explosion at the R.M. Palmer Company chocolate factory in West Reading, Pa., on Friday, officials said.
WEST READING, Pa. -- The authorities on Saturday searched for the cause of a powerful explosion that ripped through a chocolate factory in West Reading, Pa., on Friday, killing at least three people, sending a plume of smoke into the air and shaking houses blocks away.
Officials said that at least four people remained missing, though one person was found alive in the rubble overnight.
That discovery "provides hope that others still might be found," said Wayne Holben, the West Reading police chief. Search and rescue workers were clearing debris on Saturday and using dogs and specialized imaging equipment to find signs of life, he said.
The explosion, which occurred around 5 p.m., destroyed one building and damaged another at R.M. Palmer Company's factory, Chief Holben said at a news conference on Friday. The cause of the explosion was under investigation, he said.
The chocolate factory is just west of the Schuylkill and one block from Penn Avenue, a busy thoroughfare lined with cafes, ice cream shops and restaurants in West Reading, a borough of about 4,500 people that is about 60 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
A two-story factory building was flattened in the explosion, and on Saturday an excavator moved through mounds of damaged wood and warped metal where it once stood.
Frankie Gonzalez, 40, stood on a hillside overlooking the damage on Saturday afternoon, waiting for an update on his sister, Diana Cedeno, 45, a factory worker who has been missing since the explosion.
Mr. Gonzalez said that his family had waited at the hospital all night, unsure if Ms. Cedeno was even there. He said that Ms. Cedeno, who is married and has a 25-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter, packaged candy at the factory.
Mr. Gonzalez said other workers had told him that before the explosion, they had been warning each other that they smelled natural gas and reported it to plant managers. He said that his son and a nephew had worked at the factory within the past year and had also told their supervisors they smelled gas.
Joseph Swope, a spokesman for UGI Utilities, a natural gas and electric company that serves the area, said that the company was cooperating in the investigation and that it was helping emergency workers on Saturday.
"The explosion damaged some of UGI's facilities at the site, so gas was turned off to aid the firefighting efforts," he said. "UGI did not receive a call prior to the incident for a gas odor or gas leak."
Joshua Ramos, 30, said he was waiting to hear about the condition of his friend, Ziomaru Ivette, 28, who was hospitalized with injuries from the blast.
"They said she's hanging in there," Mr. Ramos said. "I hope she makes it. It's heartbreaking."
On Saturday, state and local officials reported different death tolls from the explosion.
The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday morning that five people had died and six others were missing. Officials in West Reading disputed those numbers and said on Saturday night that three people had died.
At least 10 people had been admitted to Reading Hospital, a spokeswoman, Jessica Bezler, said in an email on Saturday. She said two of the patients had been transferred, two had been admitted in fair condition and the others were discharged.
The explosion sent a column of debris, flames and dust shooting into the air, as shown in a video that was captured by weather cameras and that Eddie Kadhim, a reporter for Fox 29 News in Philadelphia, shared on Twitter.
"The explosion was so big that it moved that building four feet forward," Mayor Samantha Kaag, who is also a firefighter, said at the news conference on Friday after she responded to the scene.
In an interview, Ms. Kaag said she had felt the explosion at her house, four or five blocks from the factory.
"I didn't hear a boom," she said. "I just felt it shake my house."
R.M. Palmer was founded in 1948 and employs around 850 people, according to its website. It is known for making seasonal chocolates, including hollow milk chocolate bunnies for Easter.
Philip Wert, the vice president for the West Reading Borough Council, said at a news conference on Saturday that R.M. Palmer had been a "community partner" for decades.
"Whether it is donating candy for our Easter egg hunt and things like that, they have been an upstanding member of the community," he said.
In a statement on Facebook, R.M. Palmer said it was devastated by the explosion and was focused on supporting its employees and families.
"We have lost close friends and colleagues, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of all who have been impacted," the company said.
The company said that its phones, email and other communication systems were down and that it was relying on emergency medical workers and disaster recovery organizations to help relay information.

Full text: A reader doing battle with 25 percent annual interest is tempted by her boyfriend's offer of an interest-free loan, but she worries it may be inappropriate to accept.
I started dating a new guy two months ago. Things have been going very well. I also have $ 5,000 in credit card debt that I am working hard to pay down. The subject came up when he asked me why I always use a debit card. (I don't want to add a penny to my credit card balance.) He comes from a very wealthy family; I do not. Out of the blue, he offered to pay off my entire balance in exchange for a zero-interest loan that I could repay to him over time. This is obviously attractive compared with the 25 percent interest I now pay. But yikes! This is huge. Is it wildly inappropriate that I am entertaining his offer?
GIRLFRIEND
Mixing business with (new) romance is a risky cocktail, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should refuse your boyfriend's offer. The two of you should discuss it carefully. For starters, thank him! Even if you decide against accepting his proposal, it probably came from a kindhearted place: He saw that he could make your life much better at relatively little cost to himself.
The practicalities are easily handled: Create a simple written agreement with clear payment terms to govern the loan in case your fledgling romance sours. The repayment must be independent of your relationship. Also, confirm with an accountant that the dollar amount here is too small to trigger any gift tax, or to count as reportable income.
That leaves my primary concern, which only you and your boyfriend can assess: Will taking this loan make you feel indebted to him -- beyond the $ 5,000? Will you defer to him on other issues because you "owe" him? Will he feel entitled to that deference? If this is a good relationship (and you can both compartmentalize), you may be able to handle this extra wrinkle; if not, the loan may cause serious problems. Talk it out together and then decide.
Like Water Off a Slicker, Let This One Slide
My wife bought a relatively inexpensive rain jacket she liked so much that she bought another one for her sister. (It wasn't a special occasion; she just gave her a gift.) Her sister returned it promptly to the retailer, and a credit was issued to my wife's credit card. Now, her sister says we owe her the cost of the jacket and should send a check in that amount. My wife wants to do it to keep the peace. You can imagine my response. Advice?
HUSBAND
I agree that your sister-in-law's request is odd. You and your wife don't owe her anything. But do you know what I find even odder? That you want to interpose yourself between two sisters.
I get your desire to stop an injustice here, and I think it's sweet that you want to protect your wife from her grabby sister. But there's not a lot of money at stake, and your wife knows her sister better than any of us. If she wants to give her cash "to keep the peace" in an important relationship, I would defer to her. She'll know better about gifts to her sister the next time.
'Rebate'? Think of It as a Wedding Gift to Your Guests.
My fiancé and I are having a destination wedding. We chose a reasonably priced resort, but the cost to our guests will still be substantial. In its marketing materials, the resort mentioned six free rooms as part of our wedding package, but those rooms turn out to be a cash rebate for the value of six rooms that we will receive after the wedding. We had intended to give those rooms to family and friends of lesser means. Any ideas about what to do now without wounding anyone's pride?
BRIDE
I don't want to sound like a scold, but you may have hurt your invitees already, by inviting them on an expensive vacation they can't afford but feel obliged to take anyway. If you and your fiancé have the resources to pay for this event, you probably have the cash to advance the forthcoming rebate, too.
Offer free rooms to family and friends just as you intended, even though you won't receive cash back from the hotel until afterward. It's simply a timing issue. As you noted, you are asking your guests to shell out a lot of money (on flights and food and drink). I would communicate gently with all your invitees that you understand entirely if your destination wedding is not practical for them.
His Shred Time, Your Bedtime
I have a good friend who plays in a heavy metal band. Occasionally, he sends out email blasts announcing shows, but his band usually takes the stage after 9 or 10 p.m. That's too late for me! I go to bed early, and I have little kids who go to bed earlier. I know my friend understands this. Is it better to send regrets explaining why I can't come, or is that ruder than being vague about it?
FRIEND
Tell the truth. I think it's kind that you respond to your friend's email blasts. If I were he, though, I might interpret a "vague" excuse as lack of interest on your part when the actual reason makes perfect sense. So, be honest -- and rock on!

Beijing Denies Pressuring Companies Like TikTok to Spy for China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Foreign Ministry rebuffed claims by U.S. lawmakers that TikTok could be a tool of surveillance for the Chinese government.
China on Friday denied pressuring companies to collect information abroad on behalf of the government, rebuffing claims that American lawmakers made about the viral video app TikTok, which is at the center of an escalating dispute between Washington and Beijing over politics, technology and economics.
At a news conference, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said China "has never and will not" ask companies or individuals to collect data stored in foreign countries in a way that violates those countries' laws.
A day earlier, during a heated, five-hour congressional hearing, U.S. lawmakers grilled TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, over the app's ties to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, as well as its possible use as a surveillance tool by the Chinese government.
China's reaction to the hearing highlighted how TikTok, which has roughly 150 million users in the United States, has become a point of contention in the geopolitical tussle between the world's two largest economies. Hours before Mr. Chew's hearing on Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce said it would oppose a forced sale of the app, a rebuke to the Biden administration, which recently called for the app's Chinese owners to sell it or face a possible ban in the United States.
This month, the White House endorsed a bipartisan Senate bill that would give the Commerce Department power to ban any app that endangered Americans' security, putting potential restrictions on TikTok on more solid legal footing.
U.S. lawmakers and regulators fear that Beijing could compel TikTok to hand over sensitive data about U.S. users, or tweak its recommendation algorithm to serve propaganda. They point to expansive Chinese laws that require citizens and private companies to cooperate with authorities' public security investigations and intelligence work.
At Thursday's hearing, lawmakers repeatedly pressed Mr. Chew on ByteDance's admission that employees had obtained the data of U.S. users, including two American journalists.
Tensions between the superpowers intensified after the discovery of a Chinese surveillance balloon floating over U.S. territory in February. One Republican lawmaker recently called TikTok a "spy balloon in your phone."
China's claim that the government would never ask companies to spy for it was "similar to their argument that they don't censor the internet," said Lokman Tsui, a fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto and an expert on Chinese censorship, who called it "preposterous and laughable."
China's strict internet censorship laws require companies -- including TikTok's domestic counterpart, Douyin -- to surveil their users, he added.
In the early 2000s, the Chinese authorities asked the U.S. internet giant Yahoo to hand over the emails of a Chinese journalist, who was subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison. Chinese rules also blocked some U.S. tech companies, including Google and Facebook, from operating in the Chinese market entirely, a decision that led to complaints about unfair market practices.
At the briefing on Friday, China turned that criticism on its head.
The U.S. government should "stop unreasonably suppressing foreign companies" like TikTok, Ms. Mao of the Foreign Ministry said. Instead, she added, it should "respect the market economy and principle of fair competition."

How Bragg And Soros Are Linked: [National Desk]

Full text: Donald Trump's allies have accused the district attorney bringing a case against him as having been "bought" by Mr. Soros, the philanthropist. That is misleading, though the men do have a financial connection.
WASHINGTON -- As a potential indictment looms over former President Donald J. Trump, he and his allies have sought to tie the Manhattan district attorney bringing the case to a familiar Republican specter: George Soros, the financier and Democratic megadonor.
Mr. Soros, who has backed Democratic candidates and causes as well as democracy and human rights around the world, has for years been a boogeyman on the right, confronting attacks that portray him as a "globalist" mastermind and that often veer into antisemitic tropes.
The connections between him and Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, are real but overstated. In reality, Mr. Soros donated to a liberal group that endorses progressive prosecutors and supports efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system -- in line with causes that he has publicly supported for years. That group used a significant portion of the money to support Mr. Bragg in his 2021 campaign.
A spokesman for Mr. Soros said that the two men had never met, nor had Mr. Soros given money directly to Mr. Bragg's campaign.
Here's a fact check.
"Alvin Bragg received in EXCESS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS from the Radical Left Enemy of 'TRUMP,' George Soros."
-- Mr. Trump, in a Truth Social post on Monday
"Alvin Bragg is bought by George Soros. He allows violent criminals to walk the streets of New York City, but will prosecute the likely Republican nominee (and former president) on a baseless misdemeanor charge. These people are trying to turn America into a third-world country."
-- Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, in a Twitter post on Saturday
"Alvin Bragg is bought and paid for by George Soros and has repeatedly showed his hatred for President Trump based on purely political motives."
-- Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, in a Twitter post on Saturday
These claims are exaggerated.
While the link between Mr. Bragg and Mr. Soros exists, arguments that the district attorney was "bought" by the philanthropist are misleading.
Mr. Bragg announced his candidacy for the position in June 2019. Nearly two years later, on May 8, 2021, the political arm of Color of Change, a progressive criminal justice group, endorsed him. It pledged to spend $ 1 million on direct mailers, on-the-ground campaigning and voter turnout efforts on his behalf. (It did not donate to Mr. Bragg's campaign directly.) A few days later, on May 14, Mr. Soros contributed $ 1 million to the group, which intended to help Mr. Bragg with the money.
Color of Change did not meet its pledge. It eventually spent nearly $ 500,000 in support of Mr. Bragg. That amounted to about 11 percent of the group's $ 4.6 million in total spending during the 2021-22 election cycle, according to the campaign finance website Open Secrets.
A spokeswoman for the political arm of Color of Change said that the group reviewed and interviewed reform-minded district attorney candidates each election cycle, and that the process was independent of funders. Mr. Soros was just one of many large donors to the group. Past donors included members of the wealthy Pritzker family, the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the hip-hop group the Beastie Boys.
Mr. Bragg was not the only candidate Color of Change endorsed and aided through organizing efforts in 2021. The group also helped re-elect Larry Krasner, the district attorney of Philadelphia, by contacting more than 300,000 voters and sending nearly 200,000 pieces of direct mail on his behalf. In addition, it operated phone banks, ran advertisements and mobilized voters to support a local candidate in Virginia and a ballot initiative in Minneapolis.
Nor was Mr. Soros's $ 1 million contribution particularly unusual. Mr. Soros gave to the group multiple times before it endorsed Mr. Bragg; he personally donated $ 450,000 between 2016 and 2018, and his political action committee, Democracy PAC, gave $ 2.5 million in 2020.
Neither Mr. Soros nor Democracy PAC contributed directly to Mr. Bragg's campaign, according to Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Mr. Soros.
"George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never met in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom, etc.," Mr. Vachon said. "There has been no contact between the two."
Mr. Vachon also noted that Mr. Soros had been open about his yearslong support of progressive prosecutors. In a 2022 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Soros explained his thoughts on overhauling the criminal justice system and wrote that "the idea we need to choose between justice and safety is false."
"I have supported the election (and more recently the re-election) of prosecutors who support reform," he wrote. "I have done it transparently, and I have no intention of stopping."

Cause of Death Is Still Being Sought as 8 More Dolphins Wash Up in New Jersey: [National Desk]

Full text: It was the latest instance of marine mammals being found dead on the state's beaches, raising concerns among residents over what might be the cause.
Eight dolphins were dead after a pod of the marine mammals washed ashore in a mass stranding in Sea Isle City, N.J., on Tuesday, the authorities said, prompting questions over what caused their deaths.
It's unclear how the glossy, gray Common dolphins ended up splayed on the sands of southern New Jersey, with two dead and the other six deteriorating so rapidly that they had to be euthanized, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center said.
The center responds to reports of marine mammals in distress along the waterways of New Jersey.
A veterinarian examined the six dying dolphins and determined that euthanizing them was the best option "to prevent further suffering, as returning them to the ocean would have only prolonged their inevitable death," the center said.
The eight dolphins were taken to the New Jersey State Lab for necropsies. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment late Tuesday night.
"We share in the public's sorrow for these beautiful animals, and hope that the necropsies will help us understand the reason for their stranding," the center said.
The discovery on Tuesday came about a week after the Marine Mammal Stranding Center reported that two other Common dolphins -- an adult and a calf -- died after also washing ashore on a sandbar in Sandy Hook Bay, near a pier. Workers with the center climbed over a guardrail of the pier and trekked through rock and marsh to get to the calf, which was placed on a stretcher and taken to a veterinarian's office, where it was euthanized.
While Common dolphins are not endangered, the deaths in recent weeks have still worried locals.
In Facebook comments on the Marine Mammal Stranding Center's posts about the dolphins, some have questioned what may have caused the deaths.
"In all my 30 years down here, I've only seen one big, huge dolphin washed up," Alan Nesensohn, who lives near the beach where the dolphins were found on Tuesday, told ABC 6 news.
Several residents have speculated whether work being done offshore, such as ocean floor sonar mapping, is the catalyst, The Asbury Park Press reported.
Representative Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey, and other Republican lawmakers held a hearing last week with residents about a proposed wind farm to be located off the coast of southern New Jersey.
Cindy Zipf, the executive director of the environmental organization Clean Ocean Action, said at the hearing that while "climate change is real" and the wind farms could help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, there was still concern over whether the wind turbine farms would be safe for marine life, the newspaper reported.
Whales have also faced danger in recent months along the northeastern coastline. Since early December, at least 23 dead whales have washed ashore along the East Coast, including 12 in New Jersey and New York, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Post-mortem examinations have suggested that ship strikes are likely the cause of many of those deaths.
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement last week that all offshore wind survey activities have been "deemed safe for marine mammals."
Arthur Kopelman, a marine biologist and president of the Coastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, said on Tuesday that offshore wind farms did not appear to be the direct cause of the mass strandings in recent months.
"I'm not discounting it fully, but there doesn't seem to be evidence that offshore wind is the primary cause, that a much more reasonable, direct cause is ship strikes, at least for most of them," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York says the drive to ban TikTok stems from anti-China "hysteria." His Democratic colleagues disagree.
Of TikTok's 150 million American users, there may be none more valuable to the embattled platform right now than Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York.
A backbench Democrat, Mr. Bowman commands neither TikTok's largest following (he has about 159,000 fans) nor exceptional legislative clout. But in recent days, he has gone where almost no one else on Capitol Hill would, appointing himself the platform's unofficial defender in face of a bipartisan race to target what President Biden sees as a national security threat.
"Why the hell are we whipping ourselves into a hysteria to scapegoat TikTok?" Mr. Bowman asked in a telephone interview as he traveled by train to Washington on Wednesday.
Hours later, he held a news conference outside the House touting the platform's virtues, alongside dozens of influencers brought in by TikTok for a day of lobbying ahead of Thursday's congressional hearing with its chief executive. Only two other Democrats attended, while some of the congressman's most outspoken allies declined to weigh in, like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow member of the group of left-leaning lawmakers known as the squad.
It is not hard to see why. Mr. Biden and prominent congressional leaders have locked arms around the idea that the platform, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, poses a serious national security threat at a time of growing competition with China. They are now looking to ban the video app from devices nationwide, or at least to force TikTok's owners to sell to prevent China's leaders from gaining access to a trove of data on Americans' daily lives or being able to use the popular platform as a disinformation tool.
Mr. Bowman, who posts short videos under the handle "repbowman," said the issue was being warped by Washington groupthink. He argued that the Biden administration had yet to produce meaningful evidence that the platform was being manipulated by Chinese authorities and said that he feared it was being singled out amid "xenophobic anti-China rhetoric."
The app's opponents in Washington warn that Beijing could use Chinese laws to force TikTok to hand over user data of American consumers. They have also hammered the app over ByteDance's admission that some of its employees gained access to the data of U.S. users, including reporters who cover the company, while investigating leaks of internal corporate information.
Mr. Bowman said he wants to see Congress take a more holistic approach to regulating social media giants -- rather than just targeting one company. "We didn't talk about a ban on Facebook" after Russia used it to influence the 2016 election, he said.
But his unexpected campaign has left many of his colleagues baffled or outright hostile, particularly as some of his arguments have echoed TikTok's own talking points.
"Anyone defending TikTok is either too caught up in being a social media celebrity or they've been brainwashed by the Chinese government's propaganda," said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a moderate New Jersey Democrat in favor of banning the app or forcing its sale. "Both put our national security at risk."
As scrutiny over TikTok's practices has grown, the platform has built a multimillion-dollar lobbying operation led by former congressional aides. In recent weeks, its staffers have accompanied its chief executive, Shou Chew, around Capitol Hill as he told lawmakers about the benefits of a plan to store the app's data with an American company.
"We appreciate the support of these members of Congress, and we will remain steadfast in our commitment to building a safe, secure and innovative platform," a TikTok spokesman, Jamal Brown, said.
Mr. Bowman, who shuns corporate political donations, insisted he had never taken a meeting with anyone who works for TikTok. But one of his aides said that the company did help facilitate a meeting that Mr. Bowman had with influencers it paid to travel to Washington to talk up the platform's benefits to lawmakers.
As for Wednesday's news conference, Mr. Bowman agreed to hold it after a representative of the company told his office that the influencers were looking to address reporters on Capitol Hill to cap off their visit. A TikTok spokesman was later on hand to help wrangle reporters.
Mr. Bowman does have some allies. "It is fantastic that Bowman is speaking out for the 150 million Americans that use this app and whose rights he's trying to protect," said Jenna Leventoff of the American Civil Liberties Union.
A former middle school principal in the Bronx, Mr. Bowman, 46, first won his Westchester County-based seat in 2020 after upsetting a three-decade incumbent from the left and has sought to push his party in that direction.
He said he has come to see the value of the platform, particularly to communicate with young constituents and activists. Telegenic and gregarious, he posts on weighty topics like Alaskan oil drilling and transgender rights but also trolls Republicans.
A recent selection shows the congressman ranking legendary hip-hop songs in his Washington office (he put "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" by Dr. Dre as No. 1), playfully shaving his head before a hearing ("Gotta make sure the baldy's looking fresh and clean") and packing up a box of books to send to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to help him on his "anti-racist journey."
He said he decided to become more active on issues of data privacy and monopolies after reading two books about the inner workings of Facebook last fall. But his stance may be equally tied to foreign policy views that are much to the left of the Democratic or Republican mainstream.
Mr. Bowman and other progressives bucked party leadership in January to vote against the creation of a House select committee on "strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," and he generally opposes bipartisan defense policy bills. (He also voted against Mr. Biden's signature 2021 infrastructure bill.)
"I'm concerned mostly with our own affairs here in America," he said. "The West in general has had a huge footprint in world affairs. The us-against-them ideology is killing everyone."
Wednesday's news conference took place at a podium adorned with a "Keep TikTok" sign. Mr. Bowman, accompanied by Representatives Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Robert Garcia of California, traded testimonials with the influencers.
C-SPAN was on hand to capture it all, as were some of the TikTokers at the news conference, who held up phones to record videos that were likely to be destined for a far wider audience.

Full text: Irvo Otieno's death was a devastating ending to a journey that began when his family immigrated from Kenya when he was a young boy, "compelled by the American dream."
HENRICO, Va. -- Surveillance video from a state psychiatric hospital in Virginia shows a group of sheriff's deputies and medical staff members piling on a handcuffed man, Irvo Otieno, and pinning him on the floor for around 11 minutes, until his death on March 6.
The video shows at least seven deputies from the Henrico County sheriff's office entering a room at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County and dragging Mr. Otieno, who is in handcuffs and leg shackles. The deputies set him up against a small seat and then, when he appears to make a movement, swarm around him and force him to the floor, where they pinion him until his death, the video shows.
The Dinwiddie County prosecutor, Ann Cabell Baskervill, has charged seven sheriff's deputies and three employees of the hospital with second-degree murder. On Tuesday afternoon, a grand jury in Dinwiddie County formally indicted the 10, confirming the prosecutor's charges.
Mr. Otieno, who struggled with mental health problems and had been taken from his home three days earlier, was moved to Central State Hospital by sheriff's deputies from a county jail earlier on March 6.
In the video, people who seem to be part of the medical staff are seen walking in and out of the room as the deputies pile on Mr. Otieno, 28, pinning his legs and arms and holding his body down with their knees. The video was first obtained by The Washington Post and then by The New York Times.
Mr. Otieno's family said that while he was in the jail, he was deprived of medication that he needed for his mental illness. They disputed initial police reports that he was violent at the first hospital where he was taken.
"All the systems failed my son," his mother, Caroline Ouko, said in an interview on Monday, listing the institutions whose job it was to guard his welfare over those three days, including the police, the hospitals and the judiciary system. "They set a trap for him."
When the episode started three days earlier, Ms. Ouko said, Mr. Otieno appeared to be experiencing mental distress. He had walked to a neighbor's lawn and picked up some solar-powered lights laid out on the property, and was banging on the neighbor's front door before his mother retrieved him.
A neighbor called the Henrico Police Department to report someone breaking and entering. Officers who responded placed Mr. Otieno under an emergency custody order and took him to a local hospital "for further evaluation," the police said in a statement.
At that hospital, the police said, Mr. Otieno was "physically assaultive" toward officers, who arrested him, took him to the Henrico County Jail and charged him with three counts of assault on a law enforcement officer and one count each of disorderly conduct in a hospital and vandalism.
Mr. Otieno was kept in the jail over the weekend, and then was taken on March 6 to the state hospital. In court last Wednesday, Ms. Baskervill said that Mr. Otieno had suffocated from the weight of the deputies smothering him at the state hospital, and that he "was not agitated and combative."
The seven deputies from the Henrico County Sheriff's Office have been placed on administrative leave. Sheriff Alisa Gregory said last week that the events of March 6 "represent a tragedy because Mr. Otieno's life was lost."
That Mr. Otieno died as he did -- three days after being taken from his home in an ambulance -- was almost beyond his mother's comprehension. His death was a devastating ending to a journey that began in 1998, when Ms. Ouko arrived with her children in the suburbs of Richmond, Va., having left her home in Kenya, "compelled by the American dream." Irvo, her younger son -- known as Ivor, or simply Vo -- was 4, barely old enough to remember living anywhere else.
When the family was newly settled in the Richmond suburbs, Mr. Otieno and his older brother, Leon Ochieng, found a new community at the local Y.M.C.A. They became regulars on the basketball court and formed a team with a circle of new friends, some of whom came from similar backgrounds.
Esayas Mehretab, 29, who was born in Ethiopia and came to the United States when he was five, said Mr. Otieno was universally liked, as sharp on the court as he was quietly good-natured off it. "Such a genuine, gentle kid," Mr. Mehretab said, "never got into a fight, never argued." Mr. Otieno eventually began playing football as well, doing well enough that he went on to play at a college in California, with dreams of one day turning professional.
"But unfortunately," his mother said on Monday, "he had the breakdown."
Late one night in November 2014, according to local press reports, police officers in Merced, Calif., arrested Mr. Otieno after he had run naked through a shopping mall, knocking items off shelves. They used a stun gun on him in the parking lot and assumed he was on drugs. But Ms. Ouko said the police soon understood what was really happening and took him to a hospital.
"Here he was, he'd had a breakdown so far away from home," Mr. Ouko said in an interview, her voice trembling. "They took good care of him eventually."
His older brother, Mr. Ochieng, flew to California and helped to bring his younger brother home, where Ms. Ouko quickly found him a doctor and got him on medication. She declined in an interview to say what the specific diagnosis was.
She said her son did his best to adjust. Several years later, he met Allan-Charles Chipman at a small Bible study group, comprised mostly of Black members of a predominantly white church. They met in private homes to read scripture and talk. Mr. Otieno joined in those conversations.
Mr. Otieno also had aspirations as a hip-hop artist, rapping under the name Young Vo about issues in his own life and in the country at large. In Mr. Chipman's home studio, Mr. Otieno recorded one of his own tracks: "Give it time, Young Vo, you'll be up and coming," he raps. "Family first, responsibility coming / I ain't running."
He and Mr. Chipman had long discussions about their identities as Black men growing up in America.
In a photo posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Otieno posed with his fist raised in front of the toppled Jefferson Davis Memorial in Richmond, which had been tagged with a rainbow of protest graffiti during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations of 2020.
On Jan. 7, 2021, the day after the U.S. Capitol was raided by an angry mob of Trump supporters, Mr. Otieno wrote on Facebook about "two justices in America, one for us and one for the white folks."
Mr. Mehretab said that, like his own parents, his friend Ivor had gradually come to learn of his new country's entrenched racial injustices, a lesson that was not clear from overseas. "One thing they have realized is, like, you won't be trusted, they'll take someone else's word over your word here," Mr. Mehretab said. "They understand the system itself is sort of against African Americans."
As the years went by, Mr. Otieno and his mother learned to live with his mental illness. There were long stretches of stability, Ms. Ouko said, when he was taking his medication and seeing his doctor. But there were flare-ups, too -- times when Ms. Ouko would take him to a hospital, and Mr. Otieno would need to be restrained.
"He said to me, 'Mama, why do they have to tie me to a bed?"' she remembered.
Sometimes these episodes happened when he was with her at home, in a quiet subdivision of single-family houses outside Richmond. The police would come, along with a medical team, she said; they would take him to the hospital, where he would be treated.
According to the Henrico County police, that is more or less what happened on the afternoon of March 2, when they responded to a call from a neighbor about a "suspicious situation," only to be reassured by Mr. Otieno and his family that it was a mental health problem, not a criminal matter.
Ms. Ouko had noticed some changes in her son that week, including that he had been uncharacteristically arranging things in the house. On the morning of March 3, she called his doctor to ask that a team be sent to take him to the hospital again.
While she was on the phone with the doctor's office, she saw her son walking into the neighbor's yard, pulling up the light fixtures and banging on the door, perhaps mistaking the neighbor's house for his own.
"All I say was, 'Son, let's come home,"' she recalled.
Not long after she got him home again, a dozen police officers were in their yard, responding to a neighbor's report of someone breaking and entering. Some of the officers had drawn their stun guns, Ms. Ouko said.
"I blanketed myself on my son and held him as we walked out," she said. "I raised my voice and said, 'My son is going through mental distress."'
The police handcuffed Mr. Otieno and tried to put him in the back of a squad car, Ms. Ouko said, but she insisted that he be taken to the hospital, not the police station. In about 45 minutes, an ambulance came.
Ms. Ouko said she spent the next three days going to the hospital, the county jail and a courtroom in an exasperating effort to find out where the authorities were keeping her son and to urge the police, doctors and a judge to understand his condition and get him his medication.
On March 7, she finally received definitive word of his whereabouts: he had been taken to Central State Hospital in Petersburg, about half an hour's drive away, the day before. And now he was dead.
The family was shown the video last week. It was excruciating for Ms. Ouko, according to one of her lawyers, Benjamin Crump, who also represents the families of Tyre Nichols and George Floyd. Mr. Crump said there was also video taken inside the jail, showing five officers approaching Mr. Otieno, who is naked, and throwing him to the ground.
After watching the footage of her son's death, Ms. Ouko spoke briefly to reporters.
"Ivor Otieno is my son," she said, telling of how she brought him to the United States here as a young child. "Ivor is as American as apple pie."

Maybe It's Not So Bad When the Internet Is Down: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Who's really in charge of our online behavior? No one, David Auerbach argues in "Meganets."
"Just one word. Are you listening?" Mr. Maguire said to Benjamin Braddock in "The Graduate" (1967). "Plastics."
Twenty-five years later a puckish French horn player warned me, a literature major who didn't yet have an email address, that the future lay in something called "hyperlinks."
Now here comes David B. Auerbach with a new piece of argot, and a book, for our fast-changing times: "Meganets." It's a muscular-sounding term that a few companies, including a communications provider and sprinkler system, have already claimed. (I found this out, naturally, on Google, which along with Microsoft once employed Auerbach as a software engineer.) But his definition of "meganet" is in essence a big blob of mortal and computing power, a "human-machine behemoth" controlled by no one. If the internet is the fictional doctor and scientist Bruce Banner, furtive and a little troubled but basically benign, meganets are Incredible Hulks, snarling and uncontainable.
About the competing concept of the metaverse, the vision of an imminent, investable digital world that has been on everyone but especially Mark Zuckerberg's lips, Auerbach is a little hand-wavy, calling it "terribly vague." And moreover nothing so new. "Don't we already socialize, play and work in an all-too-immersive online world?" he writes. "That world may not be 'The Matrix,' but all the connecting tissue is already there."
Along with all the literature about "unplugging" or learning "How to Do Nothing," as Jenny Odell titled her flower-festooned 2019 best seller, "Meganets" made me feel deeply queasy about the amount of time I spend on Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and Twitter. Not Facebook, never Facebook -- "a fount of misinformation," as Auerbach calls it, "a petri dish in which false facts and crazy theories grow, mutate and metastasize" -- except for the burner account I use occasionally to see what exes are up to.
When my tiny, "private" Instagram account was hacked last year by an enterprising bitcoin entrepreneur in a faraway land, I went into full-blown panic -- especially after a nameless entity at Insta requested and then rejected a series of slow-mo video selfies, tilting head to the ceiling even, to verify my account.
Was this the experience of a validation addict going through withdrawal? No, let's reframe: I was trapped in a meganet (especially now that Facebook's parent company, Meta, owns Insta): a middle-aged mermaid thrashing about in the great online ocean as data floated around me, multiplying like plankton.
A Gen Xer might well feel at sea too in Auerbach's extensive chapter about cryptocurrency. "Reality bites," we naïvely thought, but here "reality forks," with blockchain doubling back on itself like a caterpillar. "No Rousseau-esque 'General Will' emerges from the bugs and forks," is the takeaway.
Auerbach is as at home with literature and philosophy as in the engine room, quoting Kenneth Burke, George Trow and Shakespeare (in a discussion of artificial intelligence's inability to determine the authorship of the Elizabethan play "Arden of Faversham"). "I have waited more than five years for Amazon to notify me of an available copy of Grigol Robakidze's novel 'The Snake's Skin,"' he writes, "supposedly published in 2015" -- this would be a reissue of a 1928 Georgian modernist classic that does sound fascinating -- "but I will never get that notification because the book's Amazon page is in reality a tombstone for a book that never existed."
According to his previous, memoirish book, "Bitwise," Auerbach first gave America the ability to type smiley faces in chat. If I were responding to "Meganets" that way, it would be with ð, which can obscure an intermittent lack of comprehension. This is a deeply interesting book, but for the average "user," which is what the meganets have made of readers and writers, a sometimes hard to access one. It was fascinating to be reminded of the failed experiment of Google+ (remember?), the search index's answer to Facebook, and more about Aadhaar, India's national identification program: "a unified, government-sanctioned meganet," Auerbach writes. A "Data Abundance" chart that shows how many messages are sent and photos shared on various platforms each minute renders life's new entwinement with unsettling precision.
But trying to follow along as Auerbach described a virtual pandemic called Corrupted Blood that spread through the video game World of Warcraft in 2005, arguing that "the distance between Corrupted Blood and a global financial meltdown is smaller than you think," this "user" felt trapped in a dark rec room with a hoodie pulled over my face. It was like attempting to solve CAPTCHAs with different kinds of obscure motor vehicles. (Why never flowers?)
"Cloud" is a term Auerbach finds as nebulous as the "metaverse," and yet his own text is pretty densely fogged -- though worth the trip for the occasional breaks through to see the horizon; the lightning bolts of his own philosophical insight.
"We search for where the power really lies, when it does not lie anywhere -- or else it lies everywhere at once, which is no more helpful."
"If you do not give people what they want, what do you give them?" ("What they never knew they wanted," Diana Vreeland would retort.)
And, in a Biblical-sounding proposal to mitigate this Orwellian hell: "If Big Brother can't be stopped, we should focus on throwing sand in his eyes rather than futilely trying to kill him."

Full text: Businesses are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to add in-house production and broadcast facilities to their offices.
Ann Duskus and Vicky Vuong, sneaker artists in San Francisco, met on Instagram early in the pandemic, a time when Ms. Duskus was giving Zoom classes on topics like how to take apart a Nike Air Force 1 basketball shoe and Ms. Vuong was gaining a following for embellishing footwear with paint, embroidery and fake pearls.
When they decided to rent an office together in 2021, they equipped it to function not only as a workshop for making their creations but also as a camera-ready studio for giving online classes, taking product shots and recording unboxing videos.
"We make the shoes. We make content," said Ms. Vuong, whose company is Cestlavic.
Americans threw themselves into producing photos, videos and podcasts for social media during the homebound portions of the pandemic. Now, as workers return to the office, businesses are turning into content creators. And many are adding in-house production and broadcast facilities to pull it off.
Companies are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to outfit office space with acoustical paneling, lighting rigs and recording equipment, and some are building broadcast studios modeled on the ones news stations use.
Media companies have long had such facilities, of course. And it's no surprise that social media companies have them, too. YouTube and TikTok built studios in their Manhattan offices where top creators can make videos.
But now firms in a wide variety of industries -- even ones not known for being trendy, like banking -- are getting in on the act. In the process, some are saving millions of dollars that they would have spent for others to create content for them.
"A significant portion of the business world is engaged on some level with content creation," said Gabe Marans, a vice chairman at the real estate services company Savills, which recently added a soundproofed studio in its New York office. Mr. Marans has used the space himself to make podcasts and videos that he has posted on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
"It's a new frontier," he added.
In the past, many companies farmed out content creation to production studios or creative shops. But the pandemic forced them to rely on their own devices, even if the results were not quite as polished. And the widespread embrace of social media -- Americans spend more than two hours a day on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other platforms, according to recent data -- gave rise to the idea that everyone and anyone can be a creator.
Then, too, there is the speed at which content is consumed these days -- often there's just not enough time to outsource the task.
"It's important to do this on the fly," said Michelle Cleverdon, a vice president in the workplace advisory practice at Colliers, the commercial real estate brokerage firm.
The National Hockey League acquired that agility when it set up a 600-square-foot broadcast studio in its new headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. The space, created with the help of TPG Architecture and other designers and fabricators, is lined with LED screens and light-box arrays that can be programmed to, say, orange, if the Philadelphia Flyers happen to be visiting, or red, when the Carolina Hurricanes arrive.
Staffed by a content creation team that in recent years grew to more than 60 employees, from just a handful, and equipped with 18 routable monitors, four robotic cameras and a control room that can seat 12, the studio has enabled the league to start programs on YouTube such as the magazine show "NHL Mash-Up" and the gambling show "NHL Puckline." A so-called whisper room for audio mixing was just added to the facility.
"We changed the philosophy of the entire business to be more media- and entertainment- and content-oriented," said Steve Mayer, the chief content officer and senior executive vice president for the N.H.L.
The language-learning app Duolingo -- which turned its mascot, a plush, green owl, into a TikTok sensation and invited social media influencers to a "Creator Day" last year -- added a production studio when it recently expanded its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The space has enabled executives to give television interviews without traveling to a network's facilities, and the company has been doing its quarterly earnings calls as webcasts from the studio.
But the addition of an in-house studio by a national sports league or an educational tech company is one thing. Perhaps more surprising are the many financial firms that are building podcast rooms -- sometimes called content rooms -- even if some are not quite sure what they're going to do with the new spaces.
"It's a trial thing for them," said Lisa Lombardy, a studio creative director at TPG, which has been designing lounge spaces in offices where companies can host guests for recorded round-table discussions. "They're trying to figure out how this is going to work for them."
Citizens Bank still does business with outside creative agencies but recently set up a production suite in a new building designed by SGA in Westwood, Mass. The setup includes a photo studio with a curved white wall that functions as a seamless backdrop -- good for taking staff headshots -- and two video studios with motorized blue and green backdrops and a video-editing area. A recent addition: a podcast room with a sound booth used to record voice-overs, animations and in-store announcements for the bank's retail branches in supermarkets.
Truist, another banking company, went all out on a 5,000-square-foot production and broadcast studio at its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., created with the assistance of architects at Perkins & Will and some lighting and acoustical consultants.
The space has a newscaster-style desk in front of a backdrop made of movable light boxes with LED backlights that can be changed to display photos or the company's logo, depending on the segment being filmed. There are editing bays for postproduction work, a makeup area and a green room. The studio's staff is part of an in-house creative agency.
Most of the 200 or so videos made in the studio last year were for internal use, with the occasional social media post thrown in -- like one the company quickly pulled together and posted on LinkedIn to celebrate National Intern Day. Truist expects to do more social posts in the years to come, said Vinoo Vijay, the bank's chief marketing officer.
Mr. Vijay declined to disclose how much the studio cost to build, but he did say the company had saved $ 3.5 million that it would have had to pay outside agencies to create content.
Such sophisticated studios often require additional electrical power to operate the lighting rigs and other equipment and, because the machinery heats up, supplemental air-conditioning. Costs for creating these spaces can range from $ 250 per square foot to well over twice that, real estate experts say.
Ms. Duskus and Ms. Vuong, the sneaker artists, did not have that kind of budget -- or even room for a separate studio in their 350-square-foot work space.
But with help from the commercial arm of the furniture company Room & Board, they picked out pieces that would be practical and look good on camera. Ms. Vuong, for example, was initially drawn to white marble for her desktop, but when a Room & Board expert advised her that glare on the hard, shiny surface might be an issue when video lights were on, she opted for wood instead.
The studio has worked out so well that the artists have been experimenting with a podcast in which they discuss issues they face running their footwear businesses.
The only problem is that their recordings sometimes pick up loud noises from the metal shop on the floor below their studio. But they just try to accept the "audio challenges" that come with their space, said Ms. Duskus, whose company is Studio Duskus.
"Sometimes getting it done is better than getting it perfect," she added.

HENRICO, Va. — Surveillance video from a state psychiatric hospital in Virginia shows a group of sheriff’s deputies and medical staff members piling on a handcuffed man, Irvo Otieno, and pinning him on the floor for around 11 minutes, until his death on March 6.
The video shows at least seven deputies from the Henrico County Sheriff’s Office entering a room at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County and dragging Otieno, who is in handcuffs and leg shackles. The deputies set him up against a small seat and then, when he appears to make a movement, swarm around him and force him to the floor, where they pinion him until his death, the video shows.
The Dinwiddie County prosecutor, Ann Cabell Baskervill, has charged seven sheriff’s deputies and three employees of the hospital with second-degree murder. On Tuesday afternoon, a grand jury in Dinwiddie County formally indicted the 10, confirming the prosecutor’s charges.
Otieno, who struggled with mental health problems and had been taken from his home three days earlier, was moved to Central State Hospital by sheriff’s deputies from a county jail earlier March 6. In the video, people who seem to be part of the medical staff are seen walking in and out of the room as the deputies pile on Otieno, 28, pinning his legs and arms and holding his body down with their knees. The video was first obtained by The Washington Post and then by The New York Times.
Otieno’s family said that while he was in the jail, he was deprived of medication that he needed for his mental illness. They disputed initial police reports that he was violent at the first hospital where he was taken.
“All the systems failed my son,” his mother, Caroline Ouko, said in an interview Monday, listing the institutions whose job it was to guard his welfare over those three days, including the police, the hospitals and the judiciary system. “They set a trap for him.”
When the episode started three days earlier, Ouko said, Otieno appeared to be experiencing mental distress. He had walked to a neighbor’s lawn and picked up some solar-powered lights laid out on the property, and was banging on the neighbor’s front door before his mother retrieved him.
A neighbor called the Henrico Police Department to report someone breaking and entering. Officers who responded placed Otieno under an emergency custody order and took him to a hospital “for further evaluation,” the police said in a statement.
At that hospital, police said, Otieno was “physically assaultive” toward officers, who arrested him, took him to the Henrico County Jail and charged him with three counts of assault on a law enforcement officer and one count each of disorderly conduct in a hospital and vandalism.
Otieno was kept in the jail over the weekend, and then was taken on March 6 to the state hospital. In court on March 15, Baskervill said Otieno had suffocated from the weight of the deputies smothering him at the state hospital, and that he “was not agitated and combative.”
The seven deputies from the Henrico County Sheriff’s Office have been placed on administrative leave. Sheriff Alisa Gregory said last week that the events of March 6 “represent a tragedy because Mr. Otieno’s life was lost.”
That Otieno died as he did — three days after being taken from his home in an ambulance — was almost beyond his mother’s comprehension. His death was a devastating ending to a journey that began in 1998, when Ouko arrived with her children in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, having left her home in Kenya, “compelled by the American dream.” Irvo, her younger son — known as Ivor, or simply Vo — was 4, barely old enough to remember living anywhere else.
When the family was newly settled in the Richmond suburbs, Otieno and his older brother, Leon Ochieng, found a new community at the local YMCA. They became regulars on the basketball court and formed a team with a circle of new friends, some of whom came from similar backgrounds.
Esayas Mehretab, 29, who was born in Ethiopia and came to the United States when he was 5, said Otieno was universally liked, as sharp on the court as he was quietly good-natured off it. “Such a genuine, gentle kid,” Mehretab said, “never got into a fight, never argued.” Otieno eventually began playing football as well, doing well enough that he went on to play at a college in California, with dreams of one day turning professional.
“But unfortunately,” his mother said Monday, “he had the breakdown.”
Late one night in November 2014, according to local press reports, police officers in Merced, California, arrested Otieno after he had run naked through a shopping mall, knocking items off shelves. They used a stun gun on him in the parking lot and assumed he was on drugs. But Ouko said the police soon understood what was really happening and took him to a hospital.
“Here he was, he’d had a breakdown so far away from home,” Ouko said in an interview, her voice trembling. “They took good care of him eventually.”
Ochieng flew to California and helped to bring his younger brother home, where Ouko quickly found him a doctor and got him on medication. She declined in an interview to say what the specific diagnosis was.
She said her son did his best to adjust. Several years later, he met Allan-Charles Chipman at a small Bible study group, comprised mostly of Black members of a predominantly white church. They met in private homes to read Scripture and talk. Otieno joined in those conversations.
Otieno also had aspirations as a hip-hop artist, rapping under the name Young Vo about issues in his own life and in the country at large. In Chipman’s home studio, Otieno recorded one of his own tracks: “Give it time, Young Vo, you’ll be up and coming,” he raps. “Family first, responsibility coming / I ain’t running.”
He and Chipman had long discussions about their identities as Black men growing up in America.
In a photo posted on his Facebook page, Otieno posed with his fist raised in front of the toppled Jefferson Davis Memorial in Richmond, which had been tagged with a rainbow of protest graffiti during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations of 2020.
On Jan. 7, 2021, the day after the U.S. Capitol was raided by an angry mob of Trump supporters, Otieno wrote on Facebook about “two justices in America, one for us and one for the white folks.”
Mehretab said that, like his own parents, his friend Ivor had gradually come to learn of his new country’s entrenched racial injustices, a lesson that was not clear from overseas. “One thing they have realized is, like, you won’t be trusted, they’ll take someone else’s word over your word here,” Mehretab said. “They understand the system itself is sort of against African Americans.”
As the years went by, Otieno and his mother learned to live with his mental illness. There were long stretches of stability, Ouko said, when he was taking his medication and seeing his doctor. But there were flare-ups, too — times when Ouko would take him to a hospital, and Otieno would need to be restrained.
“He said to me, ‘Mama, why do they have to tie me to a bed?’ ” she remembered.
Sometimes these episodes happened when he was with her at home, in a quiet subdivision of single-family houses outside Richmond. The police would come, along with a medical team, she said; they would take him to the hospital, where he would be treated.
According to the Henrico County police, that is more or less what happened on the afternoon of March 2, when they responded to a call from a neighbor about a “suspicious situation,” only to be reassured by Otieno and his family that it was a mental health problem, not a criminal matter.
Ouko had noticed some changes in her son that week, including that he had been uncharacteristically arranging things in the house. On the morning of March 3, she called his doctor to ask that a team be sent to take him to the hospital again.
While she was on the phone with the doctor’s office, she saw her son walking into the neighbor’s yard, pulling up the light fixtures and banging on the door, perhaps mistaking the neighbor’s house for his own.
“All I say was, ‘Son, let’s come home,’” she recalled.
Not long after she got him home again, a dozen police officers were in their yard, responding to a neighbor’s report of someone breaking and entering. Some of the officers had drawn their stun guns, Ouko said.
“I blanketed myself on my son and held him as we walked out,” she said. “I raised my voice and said, ‘My son is going through mental distress.’”
The police handcuffed Otieno and tried to put him in the back of a squad car, Ouko said, but she insisted that he be taken to the hospital, not the police station. In about 45 minutes, an ambulance came.
Ouko said she spent the next three days going to the hospital, the county jail and a courtroom in an exasperating effort to find out where the authorities were keeping her son and to urge the police, doctors and a judge to understand his condition and get him his medication.
On March 7, she finally received definitive word of his whereabouts: He had been taken to Central State Hospital in Petersburg, about half an hour’s drive away, the day before. And now he was dead.
The family was shown the video last week. It was excruciating for Ouko, according to one of her lawyers, Benjamin Crump, who also represents the families of Tyre Nichols and George Floyd. Crump said there was also video taken inside the jail, showing five officers approaching Otieno, who is naked, and throwing him to the ground.
After watching the footage of her son’s death, Ouko spoke briefly to reporters.
“Ivor Otieno is my son,” she said, telling of how she brought him to the United States here as a young child. “Ivor is as American as apple pie.”

Baskervill had announced that she would release the video publicly Tuesday, though some defense lawyers had filed motions asking a judge to block its release.

Full text: The cuts follow a round of layoffs announced several months ago that affected more than 18,000 jobs.
Amazon plans to lay off 9,000 corporate and tech workers by the end of April, adding to the 18,000 roles it already cut late last year and this January, Andy Jassy, the company's chief executive, said in a note to employees on Monday.
The new layoffs, which amount to less than 3 percent of its corporate work force, will target workers in some of Amazon's most profitable divisions, which had previously been spared, including Amazon's cloud computing business and advertising operations. Those two segments of the business are much higher-margin operations than Amazon's core retail business, according to financial analysts and filings.
Mr. Jassy wrote that the annual planning session that the company's leaders wrapped up last week had focused on streamlining costs and head count.
"The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole," he wrote.
For more than a year, Mr. Jassy has been pursuing cost cuts at Amazon. The company rapidly added employees during the pandemic and put a priority on some projects that lacked obvious ways to become profitable. He has pulled back on expansion of the company's warehouse operations, and paused work on the largest phase of Amazon's planned second headquarters near Washington, D.C.
The company froze hiring last fall and by November had plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, a target that expanded to 18,000 in early January.
Amazon had about 380,000 corporate employees at the end of 2022, according to a person familiar with its work force.
Most of Amazon's roughly 1.5 million employees are hourly workers who power its warehouse operations.
The tech industry is undergoing its largest contraction since the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Nearly every major tech company has laid off workers. Last week Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced plans to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, part of what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called a "year of efficiency." It had already laid off 11,000 workers late last year.
At Amazon, last year the initial layoffs affected employees working on the Alexa voice assistant and devices, then they spread to other divisions, including teams working on plans for automated stores, drones and the company's broader consumer retail business. Human resources employees -- recruiters in particular -- were affected as well.
In the latest quarter, which ended in December, Amazon reported almost no profit, driven in part by unexpected weakness in its cloud computing business.
Twitch, the livestreaming site popular with video gamers that Amazon bought in 2014, said it was laying off more than 400 people, about 22 percent of its total staff. In the uncertain economy, "user and revenue growth has not kept pace with our expectations," Dan Clancy, Twitch's chief executive, said in a blog post. Mr. Clancy took over as chief executive from Twitch's longtime leader, Emmett Shear, last week.
Amazon's share price was down a little more than 1 percent at the close of trading on Monday.
Mr. Jassy said that management had not yet determined the workers who would be laid off, but that it expected to do so by mid to late April. He said the company could still pursue some "limited hiring" in strategic areas.

Writing Your Wedding Vows? A.I. Can Help.: [Society Desk]

Full text: Artificial intelligence is steadily becoming a trusty tool for composing wedding speeches. Should it be?
Josh Withers likes it when the couples he marries mess up their vows, such as when someone says, "I take you as my awfully wedded," instead of the standard "lawfully wedded."
But lately, Mr. Withers -- an international marriage celebrant who helped found the Celebrant Institute, a training and mentoring organization in his native Australia -- has been worrying that artificial intelligence will ruin those moments. He has already heard murmurs about the chatbot ChatGPT's potential role in weddings.
"I'm seeing people using it to write speeches and write vows on wedding Facebook groups," he said. "If a computer makes the words you speak at a wedding, what you're going to get is recycled clichés. You'll lose the humanity, the moments that make us feel love."
Since its release last November, ChatGPT has become a source of concern in classrooms because of how students can use the chatbot to complete their assignments. Now, the increasing use of A.I. in weddings has raised even more questions about its potential and its ethical boundaries.
Ben Hart, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, runs ToastWiz, an A.I. wedding speech-writing business that provides best men, maids of honor and couples' parents with scripted remarks. He started the service in December, after a bout of nerves gripped him a few years ago at his own mother's wedding, when he had headed to the microphone to propose a toast, and blanked.
After that deer-in-the-headlights moment, Mr. Hart heard what might have been a worse speech at another wedding: "It was a father of the bride speech, where the father was bragging about how much he paid for the wedding. It was awkward and uncomfortable."
For $ 30, and in less than 15 minutes, ToastWiz generates three original speeches with the help of GPT-3, another A.I. chatbot. Chris Noessel, an author and public speaker who helps audiences understand A.I., and whose day job is actually designing A.I. for IBM, said that even though bots such as ChatGPT are free, the $ 30 price tag will be worth it for some.
"Just because you have access to this tool doesn't mean you're going to know how to use it well," he said. Those who are terrified of wrestling with words for a speech and are not tech-savvy, he said, may find a service like ToastWiz -- which is tailored to write specifically for weddings, unlike ChatGPT -- more helpful.
Mr. Noessel, who lives in Richmond, Calif., is among the few ever to be married by an A.I. officiant. On April 2, 2018, he and his husband, Benjamin Remington, a user experience designer, exchanged vows read aloud by a chatbot.
Having a disembodied voice officiate was their way of honoring their relationship in a way that their 150 guests would recognize. "We kind of have a brand," Mr. Noessel said.
The vows were handwritten, but had ChatGPT been around then, and Mr. Noessel felt as if he needed help crafting language to express his love and commitment, he wouldn't have dismissed it. As an idea generator for ceremonies, toasts and vows, "there are ethical ways and unethical ways of using it," he said.
"If you went to ChatGPT and said, 'My bride-to-be's name is Marcia and we met on the beach, write me vows,' what you'll get is inauthentic because ChatGPT doesn't know Marcia. It's just regurgitating stuff out to you," Mr. Noessel said. But if the chatbot generates vows where "you end up going, 'I like the structure, but I'm going to replace these sentences with heartfelt sentiments,' I think it's fine. It's the human gate that makes it ethical in my consideration."
Myka Meier, an etiquette consultant and wedding conduct guru, believes that gate or no gate, vows assisted by A.I. may be a technological bridge too far.
"Those are words that are supposed to set the precedent for the rest of your lives together," she said. "If you feel you won't do that justice without using A.I., consider letting the officiant say them rather than writing your own."
On the other hand, Ms. Meier said she doesn't believe in using up honeymoon time writing thank-you notes when a bot can help. After her wedding in 2013, she spent hours hand writing personal thank-you cards en route to the Maldives for her honeymoon. Ms. Meier said she would never endorse using fill-in-the-blank, impersonal thank-you letters, but ChatGPT, she recently discovered, doesn't produce that kind.
Another question for those with A.I. experience and the inclination to use it might be: Why stop at vows or speeches?
Krystal Webber said she would design A.I. for her own wedding if she had the time. Ms. Webber, who lives in Austin, Texas, will be married on May 20. Her work as a partner at IBM's Global Strategic Partners Division is focused on A.I., which enables her to understand its wedding-related capabilities. Yet, she claimed that there isn't an AI interface designed with wedding considerations in mind.
"You could use technology to do comparison shopping," she said. "It could be something like, 'I'm getting married in Austin on this day, and I'm serving upscale tacos to 125 guests. What are my three best options?"' Shopping for wedding gowns could be a matter of typing, "'I'm 5-foot-2, I generally wear this size and I'm looking for something in one of these three cuts.' The technology exists. We just need somebody to build it."
Ms. Webber can rattle off a full kit of fantasy A.I. bridal tools, including one that greets out-of-town guests with a custom welcome message when they land at the airport, and another that figures out whether it's cheaper to stay at a hotel within walking distance of the venue or stay farther away and pay for cabs.
For now, though, she's stuck poring over wedding spreadsheets and envisioning a day when technology will allow for more time to focus on bridal tasks that don't involve sitting in front of a computer.
"If I could spend 10 percent of the time I'm spending on comparisons and calculations thinking about lighting and decorations, it would matter to me tremendously," she said.

YouTube Lifts Ban Put on Trump's Account After Jan. 6: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Google-owned video platform became the latest of the big social networks to reverse the former president's account restrictions.
YouTube suspended former President Donald J. Trump's account on the platform six days after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The video platform said it was concerned that Mr. Trump's lies about the 2020 election could lead to more real-world violence.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, reversed that decision on Friday, permitting Mr. Trump to once again upload videos to the popular site. The move came after similar decisions by Twitter and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.
"We carefully evaluated the continued risk of real-world violence, while balancing the chance for voters to hear equally from major national candidates in the run up to an election," YouTube said on Twitter on Friday. Mr. Trump's account will have to comply with the site's content rules like any other account, YouTube added.
After false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen circulated online and helped stoke the Jan. 6 attack, social media giants suspended Mr. Trump's account privileges. Two years later, the platforms have started to soften their content rules. Under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter has unwound many of its content moderation efforts. YouTube recently laid off members of its trust and safety team, leaving one person in charge of setting political misinformation policies.
Mr. Trump announced in November that he was seeking a second term as president, setting off deliberations at social media companies over whether to allow him back on their platforms. Days later, Mr. Musk polled Twitter users on whether he should reinstate Mr. Trump, and 52 percent of respondents said yes. Like YouTube, Meta said in January that it was important that people hear what political candidates are saying ahead of an election.
The former president's reinstatement is one of the first significant content decisions that YouTube has taken under its new chief executive, Neal Mohan, who got the top job last month. YouTube also recently loosened its profanity rules so that creators who used swear words at the start of a video could still make money from the content.
YouTube's announcement on Friday echoes a pattern of the company and its parent Google making polarizing content decisions after a competitor has already taken the same action. YouTube followed Meta and Twitter in suspending Mr. Trump after the Capitol attack, and in reversing the bans.
Since losing his bid for re-election in 2020, Mr. Trump has sought to make a success of his own social media service, Truth Social, which is known for its loose content moderation rules.
Mr. Trump on Friday posted on his Facebook page for the first time since his reinstatement. "I'M BACK!" Mr. Trump wrote, alongside a video in which he said, "Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated."
Despite his Twitter reinstatement, Mr. Trump has not returned to posting from that account.
In his last tweet, dated Jan. 8, 2021, he said he would not attend the coming inauguration, held at the Capitol.

After TikTok Bans, China Asks for Fair Treatment
China appealed Friday to other governments to treat its companies fairly after Britain and New Zealand joined the United States in restricting use of TikTok due to fears the Chinese-owned video service might be a security risk.
Governments are worried TikTok's owner, ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China's government or promote propaganda and disinformation.
"We call on the countries concerned to recognize the objective facts, effectively respect the market economy" and provide "a non-discriminatory environment" for all companies, said foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.
In February, the White House told federal agencies to delete TikTok from government-issued mobile devices within 30 days. Congress, the U.S. armed forces and more than half of American state governments prohibit use of the app by their employees.

SOCIAL MEDIA
Meta Users Can Now Pay For a Verified Account
Meta on Friday launched its subscription service in the United States, allowing Facebook and Instagram users to pay for verification in the same vein as Elon Musk-owned Twitter.
The Meta Verified service will give users a blue badge and will cost $ 11.99 per month on the web or $ 14.99 a month on Apple's iOS system and Google-owned Android, Meta said in a statement.
The service is the company's latest effort to diversify its revenue away from advertising.
After a $ 44 billion buyout by Musk last year, Twitter had rolled out its Blue subscription service, which lets people pay for the blue check mark previously limited to verified accounts of politicians and other public figures.
The initial launch of Twitter Blue in November led to a surge in users impersonating celebrities and brands on the platform, which prompted the company to halt the service and reintroduce it with different colored checks for individuals, companies and governments. REUTERS
WORKERS' COMPENSATION
Minimum Wage in Greece
Raised to Pre-Bailout Level
Greece announced on Friday an increase in the minimum wage that will restore pay to levels existing before sweeping cuts were imposed more than a decade ago during an international bailout.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the gross minimum monthly salary will go up on April 1 to 780 euros ( $ 830) from 713 euros.
"I have no illusions. We know that in our country, wages are still low, and they are being squeezed even more by inflation," said Mr. Mitsotakis, whose center-right government faces a general election in the spring.
Greece imposed severe pay cuts in 2012 during bailout programs funded by a European Union rescue fund and the International Monetary Fund.
As the country was on the brink of bankruptcy, the government took control of wage policy and slashed the minimum monthly pay f to 586 euros.

In Need of a Ticket, A Miracle or Both: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: After "historic demand" led to a Ticketmaster debacle, the singer's most devoted online fans sprang into action to get each other into the Eras Tour at fair prices.
When tickets for Taylor Swift's first tour in nearly five years went on sale last November, Tina Studts, the mother of two young girls, thought she was well prepared.
Like millions of others, Studts signed up for Ticketmaster's "verified fan" program for early access, and she logged previous purchases of Swift merchandise that were supposed to provide a "boost." She even watched hours of YouTube tutorials about how best to sign in and pick seats during a high-intensity drop.
Her family had moved to Colorado from Kentucky in 2020, and adjusting amid a pandemic was tough, especially for her older daughter, Shannon, 15, who is autistic. But Swift had been Shannon's "special interest" since elementary school, her mother said, and the vibrant fan culture around the pop star had provided a lifeline.
With the holidays approaching, Studts knew that tickets to the stadium spectacle of Swift's Eras Tour, which begins Friday in Glendale, Ariz., would give Shannon something to look forward to. Her daughter's best friend from back home in Kentucky was even planning a surprise visit to Denver so they could all attend together.
"It was the most obsessive thing I've ever done," Studts, 51, said of training for her ticket mission. "I had this extreme self-imposed pressure to not disappoint my 15-year-old."
But as the Ticketmaster calamity unspooled that day, her hope dissipated. Studts waited and waited for eight hours at work, clicking around fruitlessly while fielding anxious texts from her daughter. The next morning, Shannon "didn't even want to go to school because she was afraid of seeing people who had tickets," Studts said.
Their crushing experience matched the struggle of many Swifties -- as the singer's superfans are known -- whose vocal anguish and collective online might, paired with Swift's own public frustration, led to a canceled general sale and a congressional hearing. But what happened next was a welcome surprise to Studts and others who know pop fandom as a cutthroat (and pricey) battle royale -- an arms race of haves and have-nots all jockeying for limited access.
Instead of leaving one another to scrap it out on the official secondary market, where ticket prices were astronomical and scammers were salivating, some resourceful fans banded together, using their tight-knit community on social media to problem solve: From Twitter and Facebook to Tumblr and TikTok, on pages like @ErasTourResell and TS Tour Connect, volunteers created a network of spreadsheets, Google Forms and online bulletin boards to facilitate face-value sales and exchanges among fellow devotees.
"The fandom can be kind of crazy," said Amanda Jacobsmeyer, 29, the founder of the TS Fandom Fund, a Tumblr collective that seeks to address, however incrementally, economic inequality among Swifties. "But it really is a community and we look out for each other. With Ticketmaster just completely failing at their one job, people have really stepped up to make sure that actual fans are in the audience."
In a sea of bots, frauds and profit-seekers, most Swift fans involved are merely matchmaking and amplifying seemingly trustworthy deals for those in need, rarely touching the money or tickets themselves.
Their only motive, Jacobsmeyer said, is altruistic enthusiasm: "We want Taylor to look out and see people who actually know the words to these songs, and we want to be surrounded by the people who make up our community, not just randoms."
Looking for tickets became "like my second job," Studts said. "It felt like this puzzle to solve." But with the help of the @ErasTourResell Twitter account, where tickets were vetted and announced by city, she was able to secure four seats with no markup in time to surprise her daughters on Christmas morning.
"It's really refreshing," she said of the fan efforts. "I can't believe that somebody would voluntarily spend this much of their time to make sure that we can get to the concerts. They just love seeing Taylor fans not getting screwed over by scammers and not being overcharged three or four times over."
Long a struggle for followers of the most popular live acts -- I need a miracle, goes the ancient Grateful Dead fan prayer -- landing hot concert tickets without taking out a second mortgage has only become more difficult amid rising prices and fees, post-pandemic demand and the continued consolidation of an industry that some lawmakers say is dominated by a monopoly. (The Justice Department is said to be investigating Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, the concert giant that merged with the ticketing behemoth in 2010.)
Last month, amid extended hand-wringing about ticket prices, a leading Bruce Springsteen fanzine announced it would shut down after 43 years. To avoid a repeat of the Swift debacle, a more elaborately plotted set of staggered presales for Beyoncé's new tour had rules and requirements resembling a brainteaser -- with some fans opting still to travel to distant locations for easier, better deals. This week, it's fans of the Cure feeling the pain.
"It's like a lottery to get stolen from now," said Holly Turner, 26, who recalled spending just $ 23 -- on the day of the concert -- for floor tickets to her first Swift stadium show in 2011.
By 2020, when Swift's Lover Fest tour was planned to kick off, competition had turned steeper; Turner said she waited eight hours in a digital queue for those tickets, but had eventually gotten them. (The shows were later canceled because of Covid-19, only heightening demand for the Eras Tour, the singer's first set of concerts since 2018.)
Still, on Tumblr, the niche social network where many of Swift's longest-serving and most loyal fans congregate, ticket release days were known to be a time of shared nervousness and then celebration. But this time around, joy was in short supply. Even among those who had managed to get Eras tickets, a sense of guilt prevailed.
"Once the general sale got canceled, everyone just felt really, really distraught," Turner said. "But the next day, after it set in, there was a lot of, 'O.K., here's what we're going to do. Don't give up hope."'
Using her sizable Tumblr following of some 20,000 Swifties, Turner's TS Tour Connect page became a hub for those looking to sell tickets they could no longer use -- at fair prices -- to other loyalists. "I don't have the resources to confirm if a ticket is real," she said, "but what I can do, because I've been in the Tumblr community for so long, is make sure that they're an actual fan who's selling."
Risks abound regardless. Even as Jacobsmeyer was facilitating deals for others via the TS Fandom Fund, she lost $ 1,200 when she tried to buy tickets to attend Swift's Nashville date with her sister from a Facebook group that turned out to be bogus.
"It's ripe for scammers, but it's also been very ripe for showing the good sides of the community," Jacobsmeyer said.
Courtney Johnston, 24, of San Francisco, said she was inspired to start @ErasTourResell on Twitter after seeing similar pages dedicated to tickets for Harry Styles and other pop stars.
She then recruited Channette Garay, 24, and Angel Richards, 27 -- who met through the online fandom and are now dating and living together in Connecticut -- to lend a hand. The three fans estimate that they are cumulatively spending more than 40 hours per week, in between work and school, sorting through ticket submissions and trying to verify them via screen recordings and confirmation emails before blasting the listings out to eager Swifties.
With nearly 38,000 followers, the group has now helped arrange more than 1,300 deals and counting -- a milestone they will celebrate when they meet up in Arizona to enjoy the opening night of the tour together.
"I get to play a small part in someone getting tickets that they never thought they would get," said Johnston, who plans to attend eight shows in all. "That's really cool to me."
Garay and Richards, who have tickets to four tour dates, agreed. "At the end of the day," Garay said, "honestly, we just love Taylor."

Twitter's Talks Over Licensing Music Stalled Under Musk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Twitter didn't move forward with the music licensing deals because of costs, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Twitter explored the licensing of music rights from three major labels before negotiations stalled after Elon Musk's takeover of the company, said eight people with knowledge of the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Twitter is one of the last big social media platforms without music licensing deals, which allow the sites to host virtually all commercially available audio content without fear of takedowns or legal reprisal. Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have all made agreements for music rights.
Twitter had avoided signing deals for music rights, which require social media companies to compensate rights holders when users post or play content with song. The costs of the licenses can vary, but can be well over $ 100 million a year for established social-media platforms. Twitter has forgone the licensing deals because of the costs, five former employees said.
Twitter and Mr. Musk did not respond to an email request for comment.
Twitter began negotiations with the three major music conglomerates -- Universal, Sony and Warner -- in the fall of 2021, according to six people close to the talks. When Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy the company last April, some music industry leaders saw his involvement as an opportunity to finally get the deals done.
"Twitter uses a significant amount of music but unlike all other mainstream social media platforms has refused to license that music or compensate songwriters," David Israelite, the chief executive of the National Music Publishers' Association, a trade group, tweeted at Mr. Musk that month. "Please help."
For the music companies, licensing agreements with Twitter would not only represent an additional source of revenue but also resolve longstanding problems of copyright infringement on the platform.
After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in October for $ 44 billion, talks continued as he flirted with the idea of challenging TikTok and resurrecting Vine, a once-popular short-video app that Twitter had bought in 2012 but shut down in 2016.
Mr. Musk's team was intrigued by the idea of adding music to the platform, and his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, who has also represented artists including Jay-Z and Megan Thee Stallion, held meetings to understand the status of the label negotiations and assess the costs, four people familiar with the internal discussions said.
Mr. Spiro, who oversaw Twitter's legal portfolio during Mr. Musk's acquisition, left the company in December. He successfully defended Mr. Musk in a Tesla shareholder lawsuit this year.
The internal chaos at Twitter after Mr. Musk's takeover disrupted the negotiations, six people said. The company eliminated some of the people responsible for the music rights talks in several rounds of layoffs, leaving the labels with few remaining Twitter contacts, said four people at the major music companies who were briefed on the discussions.
Mr. Musk's team has also cut hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures at Twitter -- missing office rent payments, shortchanging software vendors and eliminating a data center -- while requiring that every financial outlay be justified under new budgets. With those mandates, two people said, the company had little means to justify paying tens of millions of dollars to music rights holders.

When Fish Need Homes, She Opens Her Tanks: [National Desk]

Full text: Three hundred goldfish in a hospital basement, a suckermouth at the airport: When fish are in crisis, a Bronx beautician and a partner in Pennsylvania ride to the rescue.
Construction workers have been at work demolishing an abandoned tuberculosis hospital in Queens over the past several months, dismantling the long-empty wards and carting off the bricks. But first, they had to figure out what to do with a school of goldfish which for unknown reasons had come to call the flooded basement home. Three hundred of them.
Their go-to goldfish rescuer? A beautician from the Bronx.
Brenda Prohaska, who teaches cosmetology at an alternative learning high school, had only a passing interest in fish when she joined a local aquarium interest group a few years ago. She just had some questions about how to treat ich, an illness that had wiped out her mollies. Then the pandemic lockdown began and the fish club became a fish 911.
Messages poured in: There were sultan fish languishing in a closed acupuncture office in Midtown Manhattan, a cluster of spike-topped apple snails forfeited by a Bronx family fleeing the contagion, and a nearly 20-year-old Oscar fish in Co-Op City whose owner had died of the coronavirus.
"I thought someone else would answer the call," Ms. Prohaska, 51, said in an interview in her house on City Island in the Bronx, over the burble of hundreds of gallons of aquarium water. Beside her, the foot-long sultan fish from the acupuncture office chewed a fresh earthworm she had plopped in his tank. "They didn't, so I had to."
Ms. Prohaska has since taken up a heavy mantle few -- including herself -- knew was there for the taking-up: She has become the city's on-call fish rescuer. The safe extraction of most of the mysterious goldfish from beneath the Neponsit Adult Home in Rockaway Park was just one of about 90 rescues she has undertaken in the past three years.
(Like any good fish tale, the goldfish caper gets bigger in the retelling: The Rockaway rescue effort included not just nets, traps and crusts of bread but a group of L.G.B.T.Q. activists who frequented the beach nearby, a disabled construction worker from Pennsylvania and a woman who asked to be known as a "fish fairy godmother" for privacy. But more on that later.)
The pandemic has ebbed, but Ms. Prohaska has not stopped. The fish need her too much, she says. The volume may be related to a post-pandemic phenomenon: giving away pets that were purchased as a lockdown balm. Small-animal intakes spiked by more than 12 percent nationwide in 2022, compared with the year before, according to Shelter Animals Count, which collects data from more than 6,000 shelters, though they still remain about 9 percent lower than before the pandemic. Via her Facebook page, NYC Fish Rescue, people alert Ms. Prohaska to their fish problems.
They are as varied as fish in the sea: a messy divorce in which a restraining order prevented a spouse from collecting his fahaka pufferfish; a man moving to California stopped by Transportation Security Administration agents at the airport for trying to take his suckermouth catfish in his carry-on bag.
Though people give Ms. Prohaska fish and their trappings, NYC Fish Rescue is not a business. She plans to create a nonprofit entity but has not yet had time.
Ms. Prohaska has a hard time explaining why the plight of helpless fish called to her. A cancer survivor, she says saving them gave her a sense of control, particularly during the pandemic. "I always have been a giver, so it almost comes easy to me," she said. "They are living things, and I feel like nobody really cares that much."
At first she kept every angelfish, betta and gourami. She drove to save them in a beat-up hearse that she bought from a haunted attraction in Connecticut and that now serves as her fish rescue ambulance. (It is filled with fish gravel, aquarium filters and a terrifying clown mannequin from its previous life.) But the stress of cleaning multiple tanks and worrying about the creatures was too taxing, she said. She had to move one tank out of her bedroom because fretting over the cichlid's happiness left her sleepless.
"It's taxing -- I worry about the fish," she said. "It's what drives me; I do it. But I don't know if it's good for me because it just causes me heartache and stress."
Eventually, a man named Laboy Wiggins rescued the fish rescuer. Mr. Wiggins, 51, a disabled construction worker who lives in West Pittston, Pa., found NYC Fish Rescue on Facebook in 2020. The connection between the two fish sympathizers was instant, both said. Now, sometimes several times a week, he loads his Lincoln Navigator with the tools of the fish rescue trade -- buckets and nets -- and drives upward of three hours to New York City to rescue the fish to which Ms. Prohaska directs him.
Fish grew from a pastime to a solace for Mr. Wiggins, who took up the hobby when a car accident shattered his leg in 2009, requiring more than 30 surgeries, he said. Soon, it became an all-encompassing passion. "I just went berserk," he said. "I went really crazy with it, but it's a good kind of crazy. Fish is peaceful."
He gets peace from the 700-gallon tank he installed in his living room, and the 500-gallon one upstairs, home to two Amazonian pacus that he rescued at Ms. Prohaska's behest from a Long Island Rail Road depot in Queens. Their owner, a longtime railroad employee who was retiring, had kept them for over a decade, Mr. Wiggins said, but could not take them home. They are huge.
He found that keeping fish was much more than just a way to pass time while immobilized: A child sexual abuse survivor, Mr. Wiggins spent 18 years in prison for robbery and assault and was released about 15 years ago. "I was acting out my trauma," he said. In 2020 he joined a number of men in suing a Pennsylvania reform school where he says he was abused. The opportunity to rescue fish with Ms. Prohaska felt healing.
"These fish is innocent," he said. "And they are being mistreated -- they didn't ask for that."
Mr. Wiggins and Ms. Prohaska find it galling that, while dog and cat rescues abound, there are few dedicated fish rescues, and that the animals, some of which live for decades, are often dumped or even flushed.
Since 2018, Animal Care Centers of New York City, which takes in surrendered animals, has received just 144 fish and one hermit crab, according to Katy Hansen, a spokeswoman. "It's hard to believe that in a city of nine million we've only taken in about 140 fish, when we've taken in thousands of other animals," Ms. Hansen said. "My biggest fear is that people are just flushing them down the toilet, and they are sentient beings."
In the next few days, Mr. Wiggins will receive a special delivery from New York City: the last of the goldfish from underneath the tuberculosis hospital.
It is the end of a journey for the Queens goldfish, though their beginnings remain a mystery: Some theorize they were washed under the building after flooding from Hurricane Sandy scooped them from private ponds.
When the hospital's destruction was announced, activists associated with the abutting beach, Bay 1 of Jacob Riis Park, a longtime refuge for L.G.B.T.Q. and other marginalized people, began a grass-roots effort to save the fish.
Beachgoers scooped out as many fish as they could and demanded that demolition wait until the whole goldfish school could be spared. In response, New York City Health and Hospitals, which owns the Rockaway property and oversaw the demolition, contacted the fish rescue.
In New York City parks, fish rescues are rare, according to Bonnie McGuire, the director of the parks department's urban park rangers. Fish that are released in park waterways most often do not survive, she said. "Goldfish -- or any other domesticated pets -- don't belong in parks. Do not release any pets into wild areas," Ms. McGuire said in an email. "It's not good for the ecosystem or the pet!"
Ms. Prohaska arrived in Rockaway with nets, but the subbasement was too deep to reach the goldfish, she said. She set traps loaded with Italian bread and caught more than 100; large ones went to a private pond in Mount Vernon, and 50 or so fry went to a woman in Scarsdale, who declined to give her name. ("I would like to be the gold fish fairy," she said, in a text message to Ms. Prohaska.)
The mission continued. Since September a contractor working on the site has methodically fished them out with baited traps, according to New York City Health and Hospitals. It will end when the final fish are delivered to Mr. Wiggins in the next week. They will live in a pond outside a nearby Catholic church, he said -- the ones he can bear to part with.
"It's not every day you find fish at your construction site," Manny Saez, the vice president of facilities at New York City Health and Hospitals, said in an email. "But we're happy they found a safe home."

A Dying Wife, and 10 Feet of Snow in His Way: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two days into the relentless snowfall it became clear: There would be no leaving the mountains.
Robert Rice was initially unfazed by warnings of the impending storm. The 79-year-old had lived for more than four decades in the same home in Running Springs, a community tucked into the San Bernardino National Forest. Snow had often blanketed the landscape.
Although arthritis plagued his hands and knees, Mr. Rice was in good health, accustomed to walking a few miles every day at elevation with his Labrador retriever, Ranger. His garage held a generator and an extra canister of gasoline, the pantry was stocked with soup and chili. A Vietnam War combat veteran, he was not worried about hunkering down for a while.
But as flurries fell at a record pace, stacking high outside his windows, Mr. Rice received distressing news.
His wife, Ann Rice, was struggling to breathe. She had been on a ventilator for three years, but something had changed. Carbon dioxide was building up in her lungs, and doctors cautioned the end could be near. The skilled nursing facility where she lived was 27 miles away.
Ms. Rice, 81, had long suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had also developed congestive heart failure. In December, when breast cancer invaded her body, she was in no shape for radiation or chemotherapy. The cancer spread to her bones.
Mr. Rice visited her nearly every day.
The two had been together for 54 years, ever since meeting through a bowling league in Pasadena, Calif. He was a police officer at the time and tended to be stoic, while she was generous and gregarious -- an extrovert who struck up conversations in the grocery aisle. They soon married in Las Vegas, raised three children and became known as an inseparable pair who liked to read in their matching brown recliners.
Now, with miles of snow between them, Mr. Rice feared he would be unable to say a final goodbye.
It was one desperate situation of many that played out in the shadows of a record-breaking storm in Southern California. Beginning in late February, rain turned to days of ceaseless snow that trapped residents in the San Bernardino Mountains, in a region about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. Nearly 10 feet of snow would ultimately fall, causing roofs to cave and leaving many without power or access to food or help. Shovels and snowblowers were no match against what became a towering icy mass. The local Sheriff's Office would end up responding to at least 13 deaths.
Residents whose homes suffered damage have had little respite since, their troubles exacerbated by two atmospheric rivers over the last week that pounded the area with several inches of rain. The latest storm departed on Wednesday after leaving a slushy mess in the mountain regions and flooding various parts of California.
When last month's snowstorm began, Mr. Rice thought he could at least maintain a clear portion of the driveway that sloped down from the street and ran 50 feet to his attached garage.
"But it was snowing so hard, it just didn't do any good," he said. "It was almost like a blizzard condition; wind was blowing, and I just couldn't keep up with it."
Mr. Rice had been a paratrooper and sergeant in the Army for six years before becoming a police officer. For almost three decades he held a second job as a corporate security supervisor for UPS. He liked to take charge and lead. He did not like asking for help.
He had gotten word about his wife's condition from his daughter Shelley Renison, who lived out of the snow's reach in San Bernardino. By that time, Ms. Renison, her sister and her brother had gone to their mother's bedside.
Their mother's decline had been difficult to watch. Once able to get around with an oxygen tank, she now had a tracheal tube. About a year ago, she grew uninterested in using the valve attachment required to speak.
Mr. Rice bought her a tablet so they could communicate through a messaging app. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he sat outside her window with a dry erase board, holding up bits of conversation. She replied with notes on her own board.
But about six months ago, Ms. Rice appeared to lose awareness of her surroundings. She did not always recognize who visited. Her family lived for the rare moments when her eyes would suddenly focus and she smiled or mouthed, "I love you." This had not happened for a while. And the family had recently agreed to a do-not-resuscitate order.
And so it seemed, on the last weekend of February, that Ms. Rice would die with her three children around her but her husband far away.
"We just kind of came to accept the fact that he wasn't going to be there, and we were trying to prepare him for that," said Ms. Renison, a middle school vice principal and teacher. "He was in denial. He kept thinking he'd figure out a way to get himself down here."
On Feb. 26, Mr. Rice decided to dig a path up the driveway so that he might be able to walk to the street, which he couldn't even see. The snow loomed above his head, near the edge of his roof.
He began hacking at the icy mass with a shovel, and then used the snowblower to try to clear what fell. He repeated the routine again and again, his fingers aching in the 25-degree chill.
But after two hours, sweaty and exhausted, he gave in. He had managed to scrape out only a 10-foot line.
"I looked out there and said, 'There's no way I'm getting out."'
That evening, he received a call. Doctors had managed to find a way to help his wife dispel the carbon dioxide through her ventilator. It bought Mr. Rice some time.
Still, the days would continue with no solution to all of the clogged driveways and impassable roads. When the snow finally stopped, an eerie stillness came over the neighborhood. Social media posts revealed the hard truth. So many in the region were stuck at home.
Mr. Rice passed the hours with episodes of "M*A*S*H" and "Dragnet" that he had thought to download before his satellite dish was buried. Luckily his power went out for only a short period of time. He called the nursing facility every day to check on Ms. Rice's condition and constantly messaged his daughter for updates.
He and his wife had bought their butterscotch-colored two-story house in 1979 while it was still under construction. Ms. Rice had walked inside and declared, "This is the place."
She was the one who charmed the neighbors, offering rides to everyone's kids. Quick-witted and playful, she endeared herself to customers while running the beloved Good Witch's Bakery at Santa's Village, a nearby amusement park.
Mr. Rice was more restrained, uncomfortable with displays of emotion.
Years of active duty had hardened him, he admitted. "I learned when I was overseas you don't make really good friends because, my God, you might lose him or never see him again," he said. In many ways he was drawn to his wife because of the light she seemed to exude.
After his wife moved out five years ago, he had refused to make any changes to their home, insisting that he needed her input. A part of him believed she would get better and come back.
By March 5, Mr. Rice noticed the bay window in his living room was cracking from the weight of the snow. The only walkable area outside was the patio where Ranger had taken to relieving himself before rushing back indoors. There was still no conceivable way to get up the driveway.
A couple of friends eventually trudged over with shovels. But after a day of work, their efforts felt futile.
Then three days later, Mr. Rice received word that his wife's hemoglobin levels were dropping because of internal bleeding. She was already undergoing blood transfusions every other day. Nothing was helping.
The doctors recommended stopping intervention. Ms. Rice could have six months left, they said. A handful of weeks was more likely.
Mr. Rice tried to absorb what he heard. He opened a book to busy himself, but had an urgent and terrible feeling.
"I sat there and thought, 'Oh my God, she's going to die before I get there."'
Then the tears came.
That's when he decided to take a different approach. He went to his laptop and began to type.
"I never thought I would have to do this. Here goes," he started. "My wife Ann is in a skilled nursing facility down the hill. She does not have long to go. I can't even get down to say goodbye. Is there anyone who can help with my driveway. It's about half done, needs to be wider so I can back my small car up. I'm a Army Vietnam veteran and retired LEO. This is very embarrassing for me to even ask for help. Sorry."
He added his phone number, and then posted the plea on a local Facebook group.
"I was hoping that people wouldn't think I sound corny," he said. "There were other people who probably needed the help more than me."
It did not take long before Mr. Rice's phone began to ring. Someone wanted to drop off food. A man offered to donate money for a hotel near his wife. One woman said she could ferry him to her in a Jeep. Firefighters stopped by for a wellness check. Five neighbors showed up at his front yard with shovels. Numerous people thanked him for his service. And many told him he should not feel embarrassed.
It was his longtime neighbor who appeared that day with the answer: a tractor with a front loader bucket purchased a few years ago for the winters. He could manage the roads because an agency had recently made a pass through the area with a plow. After three hours, a path had been carved out of Mr. Rice's driveway.
On Thursday morning, March 9, Mr. Rice hopped in his Chevrolet Trax and began to back it out of the garage, but it soon scraped against the wall of snow. The path was still not wide enough. He spent another two hours broadening the opening.
Finally, he managed to get up onto the street. He eased down the mountain, flanked by giant snow berms that had created what felt like a one-way tunnel. Relief surged through his veins as he headed toward his wife.
When he arrived at her side, he reached out and clasped her hand. He smoothed her face and hair and told her how he had spent his days, how much he had missed her, loved her. How he wanted to make it to her before she slipped away.
Mr. Rice could not tell whether his wife knew he was there. But he had heard that those close to death retained their hearing long after other senses gave out. Hopefully she knew at least that she was not alone.
He would be back tomorrow.

In Meta Plan For Layoffs, 10,000 Jobs Are Targeted: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It would be the tech company's second round of cuts since November. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has declared 2023 the "year of efficiency."
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a "year of efficiency."
The layoffs will affect Meta's recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company's website. The announcement is the company's second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta's hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
"This will be tough and there's no way around that," he wrote.
Meta's stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or "managers managing managers." He said he took responsibility for last year's layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta's layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple's privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta's ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta's data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a "metaverse" company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Mr. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it's unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in A.I. for years but lately has not been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday's announcement of layoffs -- especially in the recruiting division -- felt "gut-punched," according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
"People are entering a job market that is the worst I've ever seen," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta's cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
"There's a lot of uncertainty," Ms. Sumner said. "There's a lot of anger, and there's the question many folks are asking: 'How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?"'
In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Mr. Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Mr. Zuckerberg's crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange.
In his note, Mr. Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
"The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew and our growth slowed considerably," he said. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years."

Lincoln Center, the Land Of New Dining Options: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Dining out near the arts complex has never been more exciting.
If the new dining scene at Rockefeller Center was the restaurant event of 2022, something slightly smaller but no less exciting is playing out at Lincoln Center. Last summer, I addressed a reader question about where to dine near the arts complex and found myself struggling to find pre-ballet-opera-Philharmonic options that were on the newer side.
In just four short months, that has become a nonissue.
Dinner Without Leaving Geffen Hall
Let's start with Tatiana, the first New York City restaurant from the chef and reality television star Kwame Onwuachi. It sprang up in the lobby of the newly renovated David Geffen Hall a few weeks before Thanksgiving, promising cheffed-up takes on African-diaspora favorites like Jamaican patties and braised oxtails.
I stopped by the dimly lit restaurant soon after it opened for a quick bite before taking in "Jurassic Park" -- for the first time, if you can believe it -- shown with a live orchestra. The food was all-in-all delightful and creative, and this week Pete Wells, awarding the restaurant three stars, wrote that it "gives us food from cultures that are part of Mr. Onwuachi's world but that weren't usually on display at Lincoln Center, to put it mildly." Tatiana also serves a small late-night menu (and its tip-top cocktails) from 10 to 11 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays, for any post-performance hunger pangs.
If you can't get a seat at Tatiana -- an unavoidable post-review woe -- consider Bad Roman, the latest restaurant from the Quality Branded group. You have to take two escalators to reach this clubby restaurant inside the Shops at Columbus Circle, but once you're inside, you'll quickly forget you're dining at the mall. (You will unfortunately be reminded when you leave; as one of my dining companions said, "I can't believe Per Se is also here.")
Bad Roman is ... not bad! There are some misses -- do not under any circumstances order the "reverse affogato," a cloudy mess of milk-washed vodka and coffee granita -- but do order the crispy pepperoni cups with ranch dressing and fresh basil, the spicy gem Caesar, the grilled pork shoulder, the truly excellent penne luongo alla Gricia and the lemon cheesecake, which is a credit to both cheesecakes and desserts in general.
A Pre-Show Seafood Tour
So Tatiana and Bad Roman are slammed. Luckily for you, one of Columbus Circle's best-kept secrets, at least for now, is El Fish Marisqueria, the latest restaurant from the chef Julian Medina and the restaurateur Louis Skibar, best-known for their theater district and Upper West Side favorite, Toloache. At West 67th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, El Fish is close enough to Lincoln Center to keep you from arriving late to the Met and being sent to opera jail, or as the Met's tardiness policy calls it, "List Hall."
Unsurprisingly, seafood is the star player at El Fish, though there are options like pollo a la plancha and Caesar salad. This Medina project is quiet, intimate and the service is top-notch. Start with the lobster aguachile, its tender pieces of lobster arranged in a circle over a bed of rich peanut butter-yuzu sauce. Split the pescadillas Acapulco, two corn tortillas stuffed with a hearty fish hash and topped with super-ripe avocado. Make your own pan-fried lobster tacos with the langosta Ensenada and close the show with ice cream and a warm churro. (Throw in a couple of watermelon margaritas along the way.)
Finally, sidle up to whatever show you're taking in that evening and let the undeniable beauty of the finest fine arts -- and a great meal -- swallow you whole.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, which he says "sets itself apart with its New York focus and New York style."
Openings: The Midtown townhouse that was once home to Lidia Bastianich's Felidia will become Anto, a new Korean fine-dining restaurant on March 22; Wylie Dusfresne of ~wd50 fame will open Stretch Pizza in collaboration with Breads Bakery on Friday; and a new Cambodian restaurant, Lula Mae, arrives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
Guess who's back? Angel's Share, the beloved cocktail bar, will rise again in a new location, 45 Grove Street, Robert Simonson reports. It will be under the ownership of Erina Yoshida, the daughter of the original owner, Tony Yoshida.
This week, Eric Asimov wrote in praise of winemakers who aren't focused on producing the world's best Riesling or the most noteworthy Cabernet, but "the best possible wine from the place where the grapes are grown."
Brett Anderson wrote about the enduring interest in "Top Chef," entering its 20th season, as both a reality television show and a barometer of America's obsession with food television.
There's nothing sad about leftovers, especially not with the growing number of cookbooks, including a new one from Tamar Adler, dedicated to no-waste cooking, Tejal Rao writes.

Meta to Lay Off 10,000 More Workers

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect its recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The new announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13% of its workforce at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing in March 2022.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also include WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or “managers managing managers.” He said he took responsibility for last year’s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta is dealing with many challenges these days. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta’s ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a “metaverse” company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it’s unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in AI for years but has not lately been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
In his announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out a new vision to streamline the company’s organization, including removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering. He added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
“The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he said. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

To the Editor:
Re "Where New York's Asian Neighborhoods Shifted to the Right" (news article, nytimes.com, March 5):
Asian Americans are a critical, diverse and often overlooked voting bloc on the national stage. While multiple factors are at play in the rightward shift you write about, missing from the article is the role of disinformation on platforms like WhatsApp.
Often used by first- and second-generation Americans who still have family in other parts of the world, the app fomented confusion around the 2020 election (not unlike Facebook or Twitter), and surely still plays a role in informing voters, especially middle-aged and older ones.
Crime rates and "culture wars" may be influencing their votes, but where, how and from whom are they getting this information?

Full text: A reader wants to shore up her brother against financial hardships, but she's unsure how to stipulate what the money is to be used for without coming off as controlling.
My brother and his wife live on a fixed income. They make ends meet by doing grocery shopping for a food-delivery service. I don't believe they have any savings. (Their current financial situation seems much different from their previous marriages: There was plenty of money then.) When I can afford to, I send them checks to make their lives easier. I learned recently that they used some of the money I sent to take a trip to Europe. When my brother called to thank me, I gently told him that I give them money for emergencies -- for unexpected medical bills and the like. Before I send them any more money, how can I make sure they will use it as a safety net -- but without dictating how they spend it?
SISTER
Let me first acknowledge your generous concern for your brother and his wife. Watching you zigzag through your question, though, it seems as if you want it both ways: to give them openhanded gifts (which recipients are free to use as they choose, including on European jaunts and Fabergé eggs) and to control how they spend your money. Before you send another check, decide what you want.
There is nothing wrong with calling your brother to say: "Please tell me to butt out if you like, but I worry about your financial security. If you ever have an emergency and can't pay an essential bill, please let me know, and I will try to pitch in." From a distance, this seems to be what you want to do: help protect them without becoming their bank or fairy godmother.
But to continue giving them money and then feeling resentful when they spend it differently from how you imagined, isn't fair to any of you -- particularly given your hazy sense of their financial condition and prudence. Who knows? Your brother may be grateful to have a backstop for emergencies.
What's in a Name? Perhaps a Bigger Problem.
My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. We've had all the serious talks you would imagine: our timeline for marriage and kids, where we'll live, our financial goals. So, I was surprised when one topic blew up in our faces: I want to hyphenate our kids' surnames -- his-name-then-mine or vice versa. He refuses, and it may be a deal breaker for us. I want my family's legacy and my identity to be part of our children's names, and not just their middle name. His only argument is that it's "not traditional." How can I get him to understand how important this is to me?
GIRLFRIEND
Well, presumably, you've told him it's important to you, yes? I am less concerned, frankly, about the surnames of your unborn children than I am by your boyfriend's failure to engage with you meaningfully. This is a question of gender equality, in my opinion, and his lazy reliance on tradition is troubling, especially when that tradition has historically been used to sideline women.
Will he expect you to shoulder all the child care and domestic labor, for instance, because it was "traditional" for many of our mothers to do so? Your boyfriend may be aces, and this may be an isolated problem, but if it reflects his general willingness to communicate and compromise, think twice before marrying him.
It's an Invitation, Not a Summons
The daughter of close friends lives in New York City. She announced that she and her fiancé were eloping to a fancy resort out of state. No guests were invited. On their return, they invited us to a dinner reception at an expensive restaurant in New York, and -- oh, yes -- it will be black-tie. So now, we are expected to buy a tux and a gown, travel to another state and stay at a hotel at New York prices -- all without the benefit of attending an actual wedding. Your thoughts?
FAMILY FRIEND
Back it up, friend! Given your apparent distress at the mere prospect of traveling to New York to be fed a free dinner at an expensive restaurant, I can only imagine your palpitations at having to attend a wedding at "a fancy resort out of state." Let's turn it down a notch, OK?
You were invited to dinner. That's all. (It is probably in New York because that's where the bridal couple lives.) Refuse the invitation politely if you don't want to shell out for a tuxedo rental, a hotel for the night or for any other reason. No one wants a grouchy guest -- not even close friends.
Hospitality Has No Tax Bracket
My son joined a competitive sports team on which most of the players come from families of modest means. My wife and I quite like the other parents and would like to socialize with them. We are relatively well off, with a large home and a cottage at a nearby lake. Would invitations to either of these places be construed as flaunting our wealth?
DAD
The parents of your son's teammates are probably aware that some people in the world are better off than they are. If you and your wife focus on making your guests feel truly welcome in your homes, then I predict that's how they will feel. Go for it!
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

The Perils of Working on the Boss's Pet Project: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Big tech companies have long been willing to fund efforts with no obvious payoff. But those groups have been hit hard in recent layoffs.
SEATTLE -- For years, working on a project that didn't make a lot of sense to outsiders but was championed by the boss was a badge of honor for employees at some of the tech industry's biggest companies. Google tried to create augmented reality glasses. Amazon developed its own high-end smartphone. Facebook changed its name to Meta and jumped headlong into the virtual world of the metaverse.
When those projects have fizzled, workers have often slipped into another job at the company. The business usually bore the risk of a failed product or bad idea -- not the employee.
But as tech companies have turned to mass layoffs in recent months, the big bets have increasingly looked like bad bets for holding on to a job. When companies have looked for cuts, they have turned to the groups that could be years from making something that will turn a profit.
At Amazon, the ax fell on teams working on the Alexa voice system, drones and automated stores, all projects championed by Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, who no longer runs the company. At Google, it hit ventures like autonomous trucks and other so-called moonshots once championed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who also no longer run their company.
The shifting economy and executive transitions away from founders have ushered in a new era, and employees wonder: Is their leader marching them to make their mark on the future, or right off a cliff?
That concern has compounded in recent months as tech companies have undertaken their biggest payroll purge in at least 15 years. Boring and profitable has never looked better. And working on the fun idea that may never pay off has never looked so precarious.
"They have all shown they are willing to throw entire squadrons under the bus to cut costs," said Kharis O'Connell, a veteran designer of futuristic products whom Amazon recruited from Google two years ago. He was laid off in November. "If you are not in a profit center, you're kind of screwed."
The scenario is flipped for employees at Meta, which has had significant layoffs this year. Mark Zuckerberg still runs the company he founded, but he wants to take it in a new direction, the metaverse. He had made it clear that employees had better get on board even though Facebook's metaverse plans are probably years from making serious money. A big part of the company has become one of those risky projects.
Mr. Bezos often praised ambitious goals at Amazon, even if they flopped. "If the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle," he wrote to investors in 2019.
Working on a "Jeff project" meant facing regular scrutiny, with frequent meetings and updates, according to people who worked on the Fire phone and other priority projects.
But when the phone was killed after tepid consumer reaction, employees were largely redeployed to other projects. Many went on to build Alexa, Mr. Bezos told investors. At one point, more than 20,000 people were employed on the Alexa project. Employees worked hard for it to succeed, but "I don't know anyone in the Alexa org who thinks it will be profitable," said David Anderson, who spent more than a decade at Amazon, including on Alexa devices.
In July 2021, Mr. Bezos handed Amazon's chief executive title to Andy Jassy, who had built and run the company's highly profitable cloud computing division. Mr. Jassy took a hard look at the company's operations and costs. And when the economy started to appear shaky, he had an opportunity to make cuts and reflect his priorities, said Brad Porter, a former Amazon vice president and the founder of Collaborative Robotics.
"What we're trying to do is streamline our costs and a bunch of different areas while, at the same time, making sure that we keep betting on the things that we believe long term could change," Mr. Jassy said at The New York Times's DealBook conference in December.
When just under 2,000 people who worked on Alexa and other devices were laid off late last year, Mr. Anderson posted on LinkedIn that he was unnerved. In the past, if Mr. Bezos proposed a "goofy" idea -- say, "Jeff wants to build robots to take dogs on walks" -- talented engineers would still join, knowing leadership supported the work.
"We always said it was like a start-up," Mr. Anderson wrote, "with zero risk if you failed."
The layoffs, which totaled about 18,000 across Amazon, came with a hiring freeze, limiting options for movement internally. Numerous employees of the company wrote Mr. Anderson that his post had hit a nerve. They told him that they hoped to switch roles internally, he said, and were "never working on one of these crazy projects again."
Still, employees remain excited to work on Amazon's big bets, including satellite internet, health care and driverless taxis, said Brad Glasser, a company spokesman.
"The opportunity to work on projects that are transformative for customers at scale and to build and use cutting-edge technology is the reason many employees join the company and grow their careers here," he said.
Google has long been the poster child for big, offbeat ideas. In 2009, Mr. Page convinced Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor, that after the company had conquered the internet, its next feat would be to transform the real world.
Autonomous vehicles were one of several ideas that Google began working on at the secretive division that Mr. Thrun would start, Google X, nicknamed the company's "moonshot factory." Some efforts succeeded, such as Google Brain, an artificial intelligence lab that is now part of the company's research division. Others failed, including Google Glass, augmented reality glasses that attracted ridicule, and Loon, a plan that intended to beam internet from giant balloons but never landed on a business model.
Many of these early projects were hatched by Google's co-founders and their inner circle of advisers, Mr. Thrun said in an interview. "We found the thing to work on and the mountain to climb," he said.
Over the four years Mr. Thrun ran the division, whose name was later shortened to X, he had only one conversation with the finance official assigned to his group, he said, and never spoke to Google's chief financial officer.
When layoffs struck X in January, the unit cleaved all but one member of its strategy team -- the same group that would often note if a project was unlikely to ever make money. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said it would lay off 12,000 employees in total, or 6 percent of its work force. Several moonshots fared worse, with Verily, a health company, slashing 15 percent of its workers and Intrinsic, a robotics arm, downsizing by 20 percent.
Waymo, the self-driving car business run by Alphabet, expected to have a significant business by 2015, Mr. Thrun said. But it still has ride-hailing operations in only Phoenix and San Francisco, and is heading to Los Angeles next.
This year, Alphabet cut workers involved with Waymo's efforts to move freight, which some thought had a more obvious business model than its passenger business. Now Waymo has only a skeleton crew of trucking employees left, after shedding 72 workers in January. Last week, Waymo culled another 137 roles, according to an internal email reviewed by The Times, bringing Waymo's staff cuts to 8 percent this year.
Waymo said it was confident that it had the right teams to succeed, while Google declined to comment.
Even Apple, the most profitable of the tech giants, isn't immune. The company hasn't made sweeping layoffs and generally is more selective in the projects it takes on. In recent years, it has pursued ambitious efforts to develop a mixed-reality headset, an autonomous car and custom mobile chips.
But since beginning its car project in 2015, Apple has revamped its approach several times, and laid off about 200 employees as part of a project overhaul in 2019.
At Meta, employees are trying to keep their jobs safe by following Mr. Zuckerberg to his metaverse. In November, he cut more than 11,000 jobs across the company, or roughly 13 percent, and extended a hiring freeze that was to last through the first quarter of 2023. Internal rumors that more cuts may come in the months ahead abound.
The division that felt the least impact? Reality Labs -- the locus of Mr. Zuckerberg's metaverse efforts.
About 15 months ago, Mr. Zuckerberg went all in on the metaverse and renamed the company Meta. Some insiders were excited. But others were caught off guard by what felt like a near-overnight transformation of the company's roughly 80,000-person work force.
Meta declined to comment.
Many employees had to reapply for jobs responsible for building the metaverse, and working on Mr. Zuckerberg's pet project was widely seen as the fastest way to advance.
But many still question the strategy and are concerned that it will take much longer than the company's predicted 10-year horizon for the technology to improve enough for general use, and longer still for the mainstream to embrace it -- if it does at all.
Workers have found the software that runs Meta's VR platform too buggy. Or just pointless. Last fall, a manager sent a memo urging employees to use the products more regularly.
"Everyone in this organization should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds," the manager said in the memo, according to a copy obtained by The Times. "You can't do that without using it."

Others failed, including Google Glass, augmented reality glasses that attracted ridicule, and Loon, a plan that intended to beam internet from giant balloons but never landed on a business model.
Many of these early projects were hatched by Google’s co-founders and their inner circle of advisers, Thrun said in an interview.
“We found the thing to work on and the mountain to climb,” he said.
Over the four years that Thrun ran the division, whose name was later shortened to X, he had only one conversation with the finance official assigned to his group, he said, and never spoke to Google’s chief financial officer.
When layoffs struck X in January, the unit cleaved all but one member of its strategy team — the same group that would often note if a project was unlikely to ever make money. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said it would lay off 12,000 employees in total, or 6% of its workforce. Several moonshots fared worse, with Verily, a health company, slashing 15% of its workers, and Intrinsic, a robotics arm, downsizing by 20%.
Waymo, the self-driving car business run by Alphabet, expected to have a significant business by 2015, Thrun said. But it still has ride-hailing operations in only Phoenix and San Francisco and is heading to Los Angeles next.
This year, Alphabet cut workers involved with Waymo’s efforts to move freight, which some thought had a more obvious business model than its passenger business. Now Waymo has only a skeleton crew of trucking employees left, after shedding 72 workers in January. Last week, Waymo culled another 137 roles, according to an internal email reviewed by The Times, bringing Waymo’s staff cuts to 8% this year.
Waymo said it was confident that it had the right teams to succeed, while Google declined to comment.
Even Apple, the most profitable of the tech giants, isn’t immune. The company hasn’t made sweeping layoffs and generally is more selective in the projects it takes on. In recent years, it has pursued ambitious efforts to develop a mixed-reality headset, an autonomous car and custom mobile chips.
But since beginning its car project in 2015, Apple has revamped its approach several times and laid off about 200 employees as part of a project overhaul in 2019.
At Meta, employees are trying to keep their jobs safe by following Zuckerberg to his metaverse. In November, he cut more than 11,000 jobs across the company, or roughly 13%, and extended a hiring freeze that was to last through the first quarter of 2023. Internal rumors that more cuts may come in the months ahead abound.
The division that felt the least impact? Reality Labs — the locus of Zuckerberg’s metaverse efforts.
About 15 months ago, Zuckerberg went all-in on the metaverse and renamed the company Meta. Some insiders were excited. But others were caught off guard by what felt like a nearly overnight transformation of the company’s roughly 80,000-person workforce.
Meta declined to comment.
Many employees had to reapply for jobs responsible for building the metaverse, and working on Zuckerberg’s pet project was widely seen as the fastest way to advance.
But many still question the strategy and are concerned that it will take much longer than the company’s predicted 10-year horizon for the technology to improve enough for general use, and longer still for the mainstream to embrace it — if it does at all.
Workers have found the software that runs Meta’s VR platform too buggy — or just pointless. Last fall, a manager sent a memo urging employees to use the products more regularly.
“Everyone in this organization should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds,” the manager said in the memo, according to a copy obtained by The Times. “You can’t do that without using it.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Dinner, drinks and dancing? No problem.
March is here, which means spring and the gift of later sunsets are just around the corner. I feel downright ebullient. I can't wait to see the city in bloom, to eat outside and to celebrate the first anniversary of this newsletter. (Can you believe?)
Nearly 12 months in, and you all are still sending me questions that test my knowledge and push me to (happily) explore on your collective behalf. This month, we have a reader looking for a "special-occasion-worthy" spot for their 35th anniversary and another planning a birthday party. I also have a fascinating question about finding a specific kind of Mexican bread.
As always, email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com with your questions or advice, and you may see your message featured here.
"Special-Occasion-Worthy" Dining
Our 35th anniversary is coming up on Memorial Day weekend, which is the same weekend as my aunt's 95th birthday -- her party is that Saturday. We are looking for a place to go to dinner on Sunday. We want a place that is special-occasion-worthy: elegant with excellent food. Our budget is high, but not unlimited, nothing more expensive than the Jean-Georges $ 268 prix fixe. -- Larry W.
Talk about a budget ceiling! You'll have plenty of good options at that price, but I'm not going to lie: I usually find fine dining to be so terribly cold. Crown Shy in the financial district is an exception. (Pete Wells awarded the restaurant two stars in 2019.) The space is lovely and romantic, but more important, every part of the wide-ranging menu is strong, from the appetizers (Gruyère fritters) and entrees to the wine list and the desserts (sticky toffee pudding for two). It's definitely worthy of a special occasion. I sent a friend there for her one-year-of-dating anniversary a few years back -- she ended up marrying the guy.
In Search of Bolillos
I have been searching the city for almost two years for Mexican bolillos. Found a variety of sandwich rolls but haven't found any place that bakes or sells them. Any suggestions? -- Heron M.
When I'm at a loss, I look to more knowledgeable people. And in this case, that person is Natalie Hernandez, the chef and owner of the Mexican restaurant-turned-pop-up Boca Santa. She told me that while bolillos -- a type of short baguette -- in New York City pale in comparison with those in Texas or Mexico, you can't go wrong with Tulcingo Bakery in Corona, Queens, which she calls "a proper Mexican bread place." She has also found quality bolillos at (the completely unrelated) Tulcingo Deli Grocery, a bodega in Bushwick that sells fresh masa and cheese as well as barbacoa on weekends. It's a real one-stop shop for superior sandwiches.
One Night of Birthday Shenanigans
I'm hoping to dazzle some friends and family (we're all in our early to late 30s) with a celebratory, but delicious dinner downtown for my birthday. We're mostly vegetarian but adventurous, and I'm very into natural wines and inventive cocktail menus. Can you recommend a place large enough to seat a party of eight on a Saturday night that has an interesting atmosphere? Also, some funky lounges or bars around the restaurant to keep the party going and possibly for some light dancing (with snacks)? -- Megan R.
I admittedly am semiretired from the party life, so I reached out to our occasional Where to Eat contributor Becky Hughes. She pointed me toward HiLot, an Alphabet City bar with a disco dance vibe that bills itself as "your cool rich uncle's house." They take reservations via Tock (how mid-30s is that), though you have to DM on Instagram for larger parties. It's down the street from Cadence, an excellent vegan restaurant, now in a larger space that has great cocktails and wine plus plush velvet booths. Email the restaurant to book: reservations@cadencenewyork.com.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Okiboru House of Tsukemen, a new restaurant on the Lower East Side that specializes in brothless ramen and "approximates the speed and efficiency of the Japanese model" of high-speed dining.
Openings: Principe, a new Italian-leaning restaurant from two NoMad alums will open on Thursday in SoHo; another hotel restaurant -- the Press Club Grill at the Martinique New York -- enters the chat on Monday; and Slutty Vegan arrives in Harlem.
Christina Morales wrote about the rise of more globally minded food toys, including lumpia, tacos and dim sum, that appeal to adults and children alike.
Americans' love affair with ice-cold drinks goes back more than two centuries. So it only makes sense, Becky Hughes reported, that people are now increasingly obsessed with specialty ice.
Meet the Pasta Puffer, which, as Priya Krisha writes, has become the "it" winter coat.
Did you know that mocha gets its name from the city of Mukha, Yemen, or that romaine does, in fact, refer to Rome? These are just a few examples of food word etymologies that are explained in a new book by the medieval scholar Judith Tschann, Kim Severson reports.

To Address Migrant Surge, New York City Is Creating A New Agency and Center: [National Desk]

Author: Mays, Jeffery C

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The city hopes the new Office of Asylum Seeker Operations will help with thousands of migrants, but skeptics wonder how it will work in practice.
New York City will open a 24-hour center to welcome migrants and create a new agency to coordinate efforts to deal with the arrival of thousands of asylum seekers, Mayor Eric Adams announced on Tuesday.
More than 50,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City since last spring, and there has been an increase of 8,000 since last month. About 30,000 of the new arrivals are in city shelters.
The city has already tried tents, opened half a dozen hotels and suggested the idea of cruise ships to house newcomers. It has opened welcome centers, contracted with nonprofits and begged the state and federal government for help. The mayor even traveled to Washington and the border to highlight the city's struggles.
New York City's plan was announced as President Biden faces a broader immigration crisis, as people fleeing violence and economic problems in their countries have gathered at the southern border. The president is considering whether to revive a Trump-era policy to detain migrant families who cross the border illegally, ahead of the May 11 expiration of a public health order that allowed for migrants to be quickly expelled from the country.
The newly formed Office of Asylum Seeker Operations will coordinate the city's efforts to house migrants and provide them with access to legal services in one place, moving migrants away from the current arrival point at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
The city's new blueprint also calls for coordinating with other cities willing to accept asylum seekers and creating a partnership with the State University of New York Sullivan, which agreed to take in 100 asylum seekers who would live on the school's campus and receive work force training skills.
"I am concerned about what's going to happen when the borders reopen. New York City is still a destination," Mr. Adams said. "There's still fake Facebook pages in countries that are stating: 'come to New York,"' the mayor added. "So I am concerned, and so we need to be prepared for whatever is in the future."
Details of the plan, such as the location of the arrival center, have not been worked out. The mayor also declined to disclose which cities might be interested in receiving migrants. Members of the news media "enjoy playing cities against cities," he said.
Some volunteer organizations that have been stationed for months at Port Authority providing new arrivals with donations, food and help expressed concern that they will not be welcome at the city's new arrival center.
Power Malu, of the group Artists Athletes Activists, greets buses arriving at the bus station and connects them with services. He said he was unsure of how the city's announcements would affect the work his organization is doing.
"I think it's a good idea that we're going to have a 24-hour location. I just hope that they include us in the equation," Mr. Malu said.
Mr. Adams said that the new location is part of an effort to create a strong structure to deal with a complicated issue, not a plan to shut anyone out. "We will make sure all those who want to assist the asylum seekers get an opportunity to do so," the mayor said.
The blueprint laid out by the city lacked details about an issue raised for months by advocates: How to move shelter occupants into permanent housing. A report released Tuesday by the city comptroller, Brad Lander, calls for the city to "shift its focus to helping those in shelter."
The city estimates that it will spend more than $ 4 billion to house and care for migrants in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. New York State has pledged $ 1 billion over the next two fiscal years and the city is expected to receive a large chunk of $ 800 million allocated by the federal government to help localities deal with the migrant crisis.
Murad Awawdeh, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said he gave the Adams administrations credit for "putting out some semblance of a structured plan that they want to move forward with," adding, "I just don't know how they're going to operationalize it or execute it."

A New Dashboard Simplifies Family Travel: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Kwai, Isabella

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Department of Transportation is launching a new online resource for travelers to see which airlines guarantee seating families with children age 13 and under together.
The Department of Transportation is introducing an online dashboard that will allow passengers to identify which U.S. airlines will seat children 13 and younger next to an accompanying adult at no extra cost. It is the latest attempt by the Biden administration to pressure airlines to reduce airline fees for everything from seating to reimbursement after flight delays.
The creation of the dashboard is in response to complaints that the D.O.T. has received from travelers who say they have been seated apart from their children, some as young as 11 months.
The new dashboard would help passengers see which airlines actually guarantee family seating while the D.O.T. works on a rule that would ban charging families more to sit together. For airlines to receive a green check on the dashboard, they must guarantee that parents or an accompanying adult can sit next to their children for free if the seats are available.
"Parents traveling with young kids should be able to sit together without an airline forcing them to pay junk fees," said Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, in a statement, adding that the department had been pressing airlines to make those guarantees. "All airlines should do this promptly, even as we move forward to develop a rule establishing this as a requirement across the board."
In an announcement on Monday, the D.O.T. added that the new dashboard would allow parents to sidestep "confusing claims" on family seating policies and make it easier for passengers to know which airlines had "stepped up." Making the guarantee in their customer service plans also means that if airlines failed to uphold the policy, the D.O.T. could step in to enforce it, the department said.
In recent weeks, airlines have said they would change their policies to help accommodate families. United Airlines announced in February that it would allow children under 12 to sit next to accompanying adults at no extra cost, and updated the seat map technology on its online booking system to allow families to more easily find adjacent seats. If no adjacent seats are available, passengers can rebook on a different flight for free.
Frontier Airlines also announced that it had been making efforts to ensure its system would automatically assign at least one parent a seat with their children under 14. And American Airlines said that it had updated its customer service plan in February to guarantee that children under 15 will sit with accompanying adults for free, and offer travelers free rebooking or a refund if the seating wasn't available.
Southwest Airlines said in a statement that it did not charge a fee for seat assignments and offered a service for families to choose their preferred seats during boarding.
The changes come after the Department of Transportation said that in a review begun last year it found that no airline guaranteed seating families together for free, though many airlines said they would make their best efforts. The Biden administration is now planning legislation that would legally enshrine family seating.
In February, a group of Democratic senators introduced the Families Fly Together Act, which would require every airline to seat children 13 and under next to an accompanying adult without a surcharge.
In the meantime, the administration appears to be using dashboards as a way to urge airlines to publicly declare their commitments to their passengers. A similar dashboard, introduced in August, allowed passengers to see which airlines guaranteed services like meals or accommodations when flights were delayed or canceled for reasons under an airline's control. The department said that the dashboard compelled 10 U.S. airlines to explicitly guarantee meals and rebooking services, and nine to guarantee accommodations. Many airlines, however, said that they already had such policies in place or made small tweaks to existing services to meet the standard for a green check.
The push for air travel reform from the administration follows a spate of public fiascos. In January, a Federal Aviation Administration system outage grounded domestic flights in the country for 90 minutes and caused disruptions throughout the day. And in December, a winter storm left thousands of passengers stranded by bad weather. The situation was compounded for Southwest Airlines passengers after the airline's inadequate computer systems led to what analysts called the airline's largest operational meltdown in its five-decade history.

Longer Stays in Ukraine's Animal Shelters: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first thing you hear after entering the animal sanctuary in Znesinnya Park near the center of Lviv are the dogs. There are scores of them barking and howling, members of a raucous makeshift orchestra sounding out a discordant opera.
They are orphans of war, rescued from bombed-out cities or left by refugees who were uprooted from their homes and unable to care for their pets anymore.
Their residence now is a hulking shed, previously abandoned, that has been hastily outfitted with rows of wooden and metal cages, castoff blankets and towers of bagged pet food.
Orest Zalypskyi started Domivka: Home of Rescued Animals five years ago primarily to care for endangered and injured wild creatures: foxes that were used to train hunting dogs and had their claws and teeth removed, a circus monkey about to be euthanized, an owl with a clipped wing.
But since the Russians invaded last year, Domivka has also become a center for rescued pets -- dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, lambs and birds. Before the war, the sanctuary contained roughly 200 animals. Now, it has more than 500.
"We didn't have any place for them," said Viktoria Stasiv, a volunteer. "It was crazy." They rushed to put together the dog kennel in an old brick and concrete shed that had been used for trash.
At a different site, about an hour away, are 170 sheep, goats and llamas that Domivka volunteers are caring for on a plot of donated land. The animals belonged to a petting zoo in Zaporizhzhia that had to be abandoned.
Over the past year, the group has hosted thousands of animals, Mr. Zalypskyi said.
There was a brief period last spring, after the war began, when animal owners and rescuers were allowed to take animals across the border into other European countries without the usual requirements for things like vaccinations. Busloads of volunteers from Germany and Poland came and took dogs, rabbits and cats back with them. Nearly 5,500 pets were rescued and found new homes outside Ukraine; another 1,500 were adopted inside the country.
But now, adoptions have slowed. Anyone outside Ukraine who wants to liberate a pet from the misery of war has to pay about 200 euros and pick it up. When it comes to dogs, most people want puppies, Ms. Stasiv said, but most of the abandoned dogs are older and bigger. Some are injured.
Chip, a sweet-faced mutt, arrived from Kherson, a heavily besieged city 560 miles away, where he was blinded during an attack. Bonie, a large black dog with tan paws and snout, has a steel rod in his back after his spine was broken in a shelling. Lina Brithna, a rehabilitation worker, is helping him learn to walk again. Zubik, a black and white part-malamute, lost one of his front legs.
There are a couple of puppies that were found in a trash can in Lviv. They are kept in a small indoor shelter along with other injured animals and recent arrivals that are quarantined for their first two weeks. They scamper around Ms. Brithna as she cleans their cages. The cats watch, occasionally poking their paws through holes in the plexiglass doors, and wait their turn.
All the dogs are taken for walks three times a day along the snowy grounds -- by volunteers, visiting families and sometimes former owners, who would love to keep their pets but are themselves refugees and can't provide a home.
Domivka did not previously have a website, but with so many more animals under its care, the nonprofit is now fund-raising on Facebook and Instagram. Over Christmas it sold branded calendars that featured longtime residents and war evacuees, including a white-tipped eagle named Galya.
This small shelter in a Lviv park is one of several domestic and international organizations, like U-Hearts Foundation, UAnimals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, working to help feed and care for animals during the war.
The shelter needs more staff, enclosures and food, Mr. Zalypskyi said through a translator. "The needs are growing every day as the number of animals increase."
Yurii Shyvala contributed reporting.

Full text: Three men have been arrested in the attack on Gov. Roel Degamo, who died on Saturday along with five citizens who had been meeting with him.
MANILA -- Armed men in military gear attacked a provincial governor in the central Philippines on Saturday, killing him and several other people, according to the police. Hours later, three were arrested in connection with the case.
The motive for the killing, the latest in a series of deadly attacks on political leaders, was not immediately clear. Initial police reports said that the governor, Roel Degamo, had been at home in the town of Pamplona, in the province of Negros Oriental, when the attack took place.
At least five other people present were also killed. They were described as citizens who had been meeting with Mr. Degamo to seek aid from the governor's welfare program.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., calling for a speedy investigation, vowed that the killers would be caught.
"My government will not rest until we have brought the perpetrators of this dastardly and heinous crime to justice," Mr. Marcos said in a statement. "I am warning all those involved in this killing: You can run, but you cannot hide."
Hours later, the police said that three men had been arrested in connection with the crime. They were all aged 40 to 50; two were described as former soldiers. The police also reported seizing a .45-caliber pistol and ammunition.
A police statement issued before the arrests had said that the perpetrators wore camouflage uniforms and bulletproof vests and carried long guns to carry out their "treacherous attack."
Mr. Degamo, 56, came from a political family and was allied with Mr. Marcos. Mr. Degamo initially lost his election last May but successfully challenged the results. His disqualified rival, Pryde Henry Teves, served as governor briefly but stepped aside for Mr. Degamo.
The vice president, Sara Duterte, expressed her condolences for a "political ally" and "dear friend" in a post on Mr. Degamo's Facebook page. Her post also alluded to unrest in the province, saying, "Authorities must start looking at the political feud that has gripped Negros Oriental and has taken so many lives, not just of Gov. Degamo."
Violence related to political rivalries is common in the Philippines, where politicians are known to employ private armies. In last year's general election, the police said they had identified 150 "private armed groups" and had fanned out across the country in an effort to disband them.
Many of these private armies operate in areas far from the capital, Manila, in places where power is determined by political clans, officials have said.
Last month, in the southern Philippine province of Lanao del Sur, four police officers were killed and three others, including the province's governor, Mamintal Adiong, were injured in a roadside ambush.
In another attack also last month, gunmen disguised as police officers waylaid a van carrying Rommel Alameda, the vice mayor of Aparri, a town in the north, killing him and five companions.

Full text: Distressed by her grandson's failure to pay for the support of his daughter, a reader wonders whether she should try to engage with him -- and his absenteeism.
My grandson has been married three times and has two children: a baby boy with his third wife and an 8-year-old daughter from his first marriage. He refuses to have any contact with his daughter or pay any child support to his first wife. I am hurt and angry by his abandonment of his child! I have not seen his new baby yet, nor do I want to. This marriage may fail, too, and I may never see my new great-grandson. Meanwhile, my heart breaks for my great-granddaughter, who just wants to see her daddy. My grandson and his new wife are avoiding my family, so I'm not sure what to do. Should I speak to him or have nothing to do with him?
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER
I understand your focus on your grandson. He is probably the person you know best in this story, and he seems to be the worst behaved. Call him and urge him to help support his daughter financially and emotionally. (Why not?) I have another idea, though, that may prove more beneficial to your great-granddaughter, and its results are more within your control.
According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 30 percent of noncustodial parents who were required to make child support payments failed to pay anything. It's worth a try to call your grandson, but your request may not have much effect on a deadbeat dad. I hope your grandson's ex-wife hires a killer lawyer and collects every penny to which she is entitled -- with interest.
Your energy is probably better spent on your great-granddaughter. Be as involved with her as possible (without creating extra burdens for her mother). Consider regular visits, outings, Zoom calls -- even special greeting cards. Make sure she knows how much you love her. This will not compensate for her father's abandonment of her, but it may create a tremendous bright spot in her life.
When 'Thanks' Leads Straight to 'I'm Sorry'
I was invited by a friend and his wife to stay at their home during a brief vacation. I had a wonderful time! They treated me royally, chauffeuring me around town and refusing my frequent offers to pay for meals. Afterward, I sent them a thank-you note and a large gift certificate. That's when things went wrong: My friend asked me to take back the certificate and told me I had offended him by treating his house like a hotel. In hindsight, I wish my gift hadn't had an obvious cash value, but I can't fix that now. We haven't spoken since our uncomfortable exchange. What should I do?
HOUSEGUEST
Call your friend to apologize. You inadvertently offended him; that's what apologies are for. It was hardly a capital offense, though. Loads of people give gift certificates without incident. Your point about their clear cash value is true, I suppose, but I'm not sure that's what he meant by "treating his house like a hotel." Are you?
When you get him on the phone, tell him that he and his wife were superb hosts and thank them again for a lovely visit. Then say: "I am so sorry that I upset you. Can you please forgive me?" Then listen. He may elaborate on the cause of his distress.
Good Idea: Split the Check
A friend has an annoying habit of ordering expensive meals and alcohol when we go out to eat. I order modestly and never order alcohol. When it's time to pay, she suggests splitting the bill in half, or she asks me to contribute more to the tip than I should. I don't want to look petty or cheap, but this drives me crazy. I also don't want to burden the waiter by asking for separate checks. What to do?
DINER
Burden the waiter! If you are aggravated by paying a few bucks more in tip than you owe, I can't imagine a solution here for splitting taxes and tips that doesn't involve complex math. In my experience, waiters don't mind separate checks for small parties if you ask for them upfront.
Worse than hard math, I suspect the alternatives to this approach will harden your instinct that your friend is ordering lavishly to take advantage of you -- which is probably not the case. I respect your desire (or perhaps your need) for frugality when dining out, but you can accomplish that with a simple request: "May we have separate checks, please?"
Bad Idea: Check Out the Split
I am a woman of retirement age, and I started taking yoga classes with a young male teacher. I admire his enthusiasm, but not his low-slung exercise shorts that often leave several inches of his butt crack exposed. Is there a nice way to ask him to invest in higher-waisted shorts?
YOGA STUDENT
Your yoga class seems different from mine, where low-cut bra tops and skintight leggings prevail. There aren't many inches of flesh left to the imagination.
If you can't tolerate the mildly risqué sight of a man in low-rise shorts, look away from his bottom. If that doesn't suit you, find another class. Your payment does not give you veto rights over his wardrobe.

Foul Play at the Midway: [National Desk]

Full text: In the time-honored tradition of small-time schemes everywhere, the operator of a Jersey Shore game of chance is found guilty of deception.
There are a million stories on the boardwalk. Here is one.
The summer of 2022 was two days old when a specialized state investigator headed for the South Jersey beach community of North Wildwood. Among his particular skills: finding the scams and cons that lurk behind the sunburns and the melting frozen custard of the boardwalk.
He represented a small agency called the Legalized Games of Chance Control Commission -- the L.G.C.C.C. for short, or maybe just the commission. They're the people who make sure that when you step right up, you have a fair shot at winning that musty plush toy you suddenly want more than life.
While pounding his beat, the investigator stopped at an amusement booth offering a familiar basketball challenge: Make the shot, look big in front of your partner or your sugar-addled kid, and take home a stuffed something to put out with the trash by fall.
Anyone who has whiled away time on the gaudy midway of life knows how these things can go. Leaded milk bottles impossible to knock down. Darts too dull to pop a balloon. Basketballs with too much air arcing toward distant hoops about the width of a dinner plate.
The investigator tested the air pressure of the three balls available for suckers -- er, customers. All were inflated to well more than double the manufacturer's specifications and were "thus not in accordance with the Basketball Game's Certification of Permissibility," according to state documents.
A deflating day, then, for Christine Strothers, the operator in name of this and a few other boardwalk games. She had at least one prior offense in the realm of amusement violations, having paid $ 16,500 in penalties in 2021.
A registered nurse, Ms. Strothers is married to Brett Strothers, who, according to local news reports, pleaded guilty in 2016 to a federal charge that he and a brother, Evan Strothers, had bought thousands of counterfeit sports jerseys to give as prizes at booths they operated on the boardwalk in Wildwood and North Wildwood.
According to state officials, applicants for amusement-game licenses must disclose any criminal history and submit to a criminal-background check. Evan Strothers had licenses from 2008 to 2015. Ms. Strothers received her first amusement license in 2018.
A month after finding those overinflated basketballs, the same investigator visited two basketball booths operated by Ms. Strothers in Wildwood. All five balls he inspected there were inflated beyond specifications, making them quite likely to bang off the rim and deny glory to the would-be Steph Currys of the boardwalk.
Investigators returned three more times to the booths, where money was exchanged for the fleeting use of overinflated balls. In one case, an employee saw the approaching agent and shoved 10 displayed basketballs under the counter, as if to be able to say, What basketballs?
Six of the 10 had too much air.
In the wide-open world of grifts and schemes, an overinflated basketball may not rank with identity theft, Facebook come-ons from a Nigerian prince or even a hurried game of three-card monte. That does not make it right, according to Cari Fais, the acting director of New Jersey's Division of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the Legalized Games of Cha -- the commission.
"It offends people's sense of fair play," Ms. Fais said on Friday. "No one should walk away from the boardwalk feeling that the games were rigged against them or their kids."
Fairness is the commission's core mission, she said. It regulates games of chance operated by nonprofit organizations: your church carnivals, casino nights and 50-50 raffles. It also oversees the games in places like amusement parks, arcades -- and boardwalks.
Last year, commission investigators conducted nearly 7,000 inspections, most of which involved checking on those infuriating crane games, in which the mechanical claw never seems able to pick up the box containing an iPhone. Most games are aboveboard, Ms. Fais said. But not all.
"Basically, the investigators are making sure that the games haven't been modified to disadvantage the player," Ms. Fais said. "The crane machines with prizes too heavy for the claw to pick up. Or overinflated basketballs that ricochet off the backboard."
The Case of the Overinflated Basketballs wended its way through the New Jersey system. The violations also included a few minor offenses, including one instance of the old bait-and-switch: displaying large plush animals that could not be won.
In the end, Ms. Strothers, who did not respond to requests for comment, declined to attend a hearing on the state's findings, and the commission entered a default judgment against her. It was a blow for the integrity of the Jersey Shore experience, according to Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin.
"The Jersey Shore is one of the biggest draws in the state for families looking for fun and recreation, and we are making sure those families are not being scammed out of their hard-earned money," Mr. Platkin said in a news release.
When summer returns, the Jersey boardwalk will again have many games of chance to relieve you of your money and make you believe that a stuffed pink unicorn would look great in your living room. Tossed rings will clink and fall between bottles; guns will limply squirt water into the mouths of clowns; mushy softballs will knock over nothing.
But there will be no basketball games operated by Ms. Strothers, who has been barred from obtaining an amusement-games license for at least 10 years. She has also been fined $ 15,500 -- $ 500 for each of the 31 basketballs customized for us suckers.

Thai Hunger Strikers Calling for Changes to Monarchy Are at Risk of Dying

A stream of protesters outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok held up the three-fingered salute — a symbol of defiance against the government. “Fight, fight, fight,” they yelled to two young women who were taken out of a makeshift tent in stretchers, both so weak that they could not open their eyes.
The women — Tantawan “Tawan” Tuatulanon, 21, and Orawan “Bam” Phuphong, 23 — were taken to a hospital Friday evening after their family members and lawyer said that they were on the brink of death. They were on their 44th day of a hunger strike, protesting the detention of Thai political prisoners, calling for judiciary changes and the repeal of a law that criminalizes criticizing the Thai monarchy.
Their plight has been discussed by Thailand’s House of Representatives and has drawn urgent expressions of concern from international human rights groups, which have called on the government to engage with the activists.
In 2022, both women were accused of violating the law against criticizing the monarchy after they conducted a poll asking whether the royal motorcade was an inconvenience to Bangkok residents. They were released on bail in March that year under the condition that they no longer participate in protests or organize activities that defame the royal family.
The doctors are now most concerned about the women’s kidneys failing, according to their lawyer, Krisadang Nutcharut. “Their parents and I were consulting each other and saw that they wouldn’t make it past tonight, according to the blood results,” Krisadang said.
The women’s protest has presented the Thai government with a political dilemma two months before a general election: Meet their demands and risk appearing weak among voters or do nothing and face a potential fallout that could trigger widespread unrest.
Kasit Piromya, a former Thai foreign minister, has called on Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand to address the women’s demands. Prayuth, through a government spokesperson, has said he hopes the two women are safe but urged parents to “monitor their children’s behavior” and for all Thais to “help protect the nation, religion and monarchy.”
The women began their hunger strike in January. Last month, Tantawan, a university student, and Orawan, a grocery store worker, were hospitalized and put on saline drips after their conditions became critical. They have stopped drinking water but are sipping electrolytes on doctors’ orders.
On Thursday, the pair announced that they would stop taking electrolytes, too. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday evening, Krisadang said the women’s spirits remain unbowed.
In January, Thailand’s justice minister told Tantawan and Orawan that the government would consider reforming the bail system, though he did not address their core demands, which include reforming the country’s judicial system.
Thailand’s opposition parties, Pheu Thai and Move Forward, submitted an urgent motion for a debate in the House of Representatives in February to propose measures to save the women’s lives. The debates stopped short of addressing the activists’ demands to abolish lèse-majesté, the law that makes criticizing the monarchy illegal, fearful of alienating royalists before the election. (The protesters are also calling for the abolition of Thailand’s sedition laws.)
Thailand has one of the world’s strictest lèse-majesté laws, which forbids defaming, insulting or threatening the king and other members of the royal family. Known as Article 112, the charge carries a minimum sentence of three years and a maximum sentence of up to 15 years. It is the only law in Thailand that imposes a minimum jail term.
Previously, Thai authorities confined the use of lèse-majesté against people who explicitly criticized the leading members of the monarchy. But after Prayuth seized power in a coup in 2014, the number of topics that constituted lèse-majesté expanded to include criticism of the institution and even deceased kings.
Thailand informally suspended the use of the lèse-majesté law in 2018, according to Chanatip Tatiyakaroonwong, Amnesty International’s regional researcher on Thailand. The move coincided with calls from the international community for Thailand to respect their commitments to the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
But after the 2020 protests, Prayuth, who has repeatedly vowed to remain loyal to the monarchy, instructed all government officials to “use every single law” to prosecute anyone who criticized the monarchy.
Authorities have charged at least 225 people, including 17 minors, for violating the lèse-majesté law since 2020. Thousands more have been slapped with other criminal charges. As more activists were targeted, the mass protests slowly began to wane.
Sunai Phasuk, the senior researcher for Thailand for Human Rights Watch, said the case of Tantawan and Orawan and their public survey was the clearest example of how the law is being arbitrarily enforced. “The use of the lèse-majesté law has become more and more arbitrary, in that even the slightest criticism of both the individuals and the institution can lead to legal action,” he said.
On Thursday evening, dozens of supporters appeared outside the Supreme Court in support of the women. They held sunflowers and cards that read, “Abolish lèse-majesté law.” (Tantawan’s name in Thai means “sunflower.”)
“These kids are so brave, my generation cannot compete with them,” said Yupa Ritnakha, a 65-year-old supporter who was holding a bunch of sunflowers outside of the Supreme Court. “They are willing to die for their cause.”
This is not Tantawan’s first hunger strike. In April 2022, she went on a hunger strike for more than a month after she was detained for violating her bail by posting details of the royal motorcade on Facebook. She was released on bail once again but placed under house arrest.
Friends of Tantawan and Orawan say they are disappointed that the women’s campaign has failed to sway the general public or motivate the government to introduce reforms.
“It’s unfortunate for them that this is happening at a low point of the protest movement,” said Chanatip. “After three years of an official crackdown on the protests, people are quite burned out.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Mayor Disappeared, but Questions of His Loyalty Did Not: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: KHERSON, Ukraine -- The jailhouse near the Dnipro River where the Russians imprisoned and tortured hundreds of Ukrainians sits empty now. Many of its inmates were freed when Ukraine's forces liberated the city more than three months ago.
But one prominent prisoner is still missing: the city's former mayor, Ihor Kolykhaev.
The mayor, who refused to flee and for a while remained at his post after Russian forces swept into Kherson, was arrested in June and put in solitary confinement. In the fall, as Ukrainian forces advanced on the city, Mr. Kolykhaev's jailers moved him deeper inside Russian-held territory, according to witnesses.
He has not been heard from since.
The disappearance has deepened questions swirling around Mr. Kolykhaev and the role he tried to play. Though he refused to acknowledge the Russians' authority or swear fealty to them, he remained at his desk, working to keep the lights on and the buses running. The decision helped to ensure a livable city but also smoothed the way for Russian forces to create an occupation government.
Many city residents consider the 52-year-old former mayor a hero for staying put even as much of the political and security establishment fled in the opening days of the war.
But others harbor suspicions about the mayor's loyalties that even his arrest and imprisonment have not dispelled.
The competing views about Mr. Kolykhaev underscore the complexities of assessing loyalties in wartime Ukraine, particularly in occupied territories.
With Russians in control, what counts as treachery is often fuzzy. It does not have to be something as serious as abetting the Russian military. Teachers and police officers who did nothing more than continue to show up at work have been disparaged by those who fled, and in some cases, they were arrested after liberation.
"There's a lot of talk and leaks saying that he's a traitor, he gave up the city," said Dmitry Poddubnyi, a Kherson City Council member, who remained by the mayor's side until his arrest. "We spent so much time with him. We slept all together in the City Council building. Every day we were together, and I never saw anything like that."
Kherson's prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into the mayor's disappearance but said in an interview that he had no information regarding his whereabouts. The lack of progress has angered Mr. Kolykhaev's son, Svyatoslav, who said that he had started his own inquiry, interviewing as many as 20 people who laid eyes on his father during his incarceration. But he has come up with little more than rumors.
"I got information that he got sick," he said. "For now, I honestly don't know."
Supporters say Mr. Kolykhaev never intended to collaborate with the occupiers. Days after the invasion started, heavily armed commandoes marched up to his third-floor office and demanded he capitulate. The Russian military already effectively controlled the city, and a refusal could have resulted in arrest, imprisonment or worse.
He refused, according to his bodyguard, who was present.
The mayor "told them, 'I can't do that because I am a citizen of Ukraine, because the people elected me and I won't abandon them,"' said the bodyguard, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals over his own role during the occupation.
Why Russian forces let him remain in place remains a mystery, but it was an uneasy accommodation.
The Russian forces seemed happy to have him at the helm at first, as he freed them from the responsibility of running the city as they set about building an occupation government. In exchange, the mayor refrained from openly criticizing them or publicly supporting the large protests against the occupation that broke out in the first weeks.
But the mayor refused to acknowledge the Russians' authority. He rebuffed several attempts by Russian commanders, sometimes at gunpoint, to compel him to switch sides, according to people who were with him throughout the occupation. And he ensured that the Ukrainian flag still flew over the city administration building while he continued to work there.
In his frequent Facebook posts, which he wrote in Russian, the most commonly spoken language in Kherson, he tried to buck up the spirits of Kherson residents and often signed off with the phrase "Kherson is Ukraine," accompanied by a Ukrainian flag emoji.
"I'm not a soldier," the mayor wrote in one Facebook post in June. "My task is to preserve our common home and maintain our city in proper condition."
The stance earned him critics, among them the former governor of the Kherson region, Hennadiy Lahuta, who fled Kherson on the second day of the war. In a lengthy interview in June with the Ukrainian news outlet Glavkom, Mr. Lahuta said he had advised Mr. Kolykhaev to leave as well.
"On Feb. 25, Kolykhaev definitely understood that the enemy would enter Kherson," Mr. Lahuta said. "No matter his elected office and business, he should have left the city, because a parallel existence between the occupier and the Ukrainian government doesn't exist. Those lines will eventually cross."
That viewpoint, held by others who left Kherson, helped foster suspicions about Mr. Kolykhaev's loyalties that still linger today.
Mr. Kolykhaev dismissed the criticism of outsiders whom he accused of failing to grasp the reality of life under occupation.
"Unlike those who carry out their service to the country only through television screens, I am present in the city, responsible for its functioning and the security of those living in it," he wrote in one Facebook post. "Only the city residents can judge me and my actions."
Among the mayor's strongest supporters are those who suffered most during the occupation.
Andriy Andryushchenko, 28, was a nightclub director before the invasion and helped form an underground resistance group. He said he was arrested over the summer and tortured for 47 days at the same prison where Mr. Kolykhaev was held. Russian guards, he said, knocked out half his teeth and administered electric shocks through wires attached to his genitals. He and his fellow inmates were given one cup of macaroni and a glass of water per day.
Mr. Andryushchenko is now a member of the Kherson military administration overseeing the distribution of humanitarian aid. He said he had known the mayor for years.
"I don't think he's a traitor," he said of the mayor. "He supported the city and didn't give it up. Of course, he had to be in contact with them, but under the barrel of a gun."
All the mayor's efforts at accommodation did not save him from imprisonment. In April, Russia's military commandants expelled him and his team from the city administration building, installing a puppet mayor as Mr. Kolykhaev continued to work from another location. In June, Russia's domestic intelligence service, the F.S.B., arrested him and his bodyguard and threw them into a jail for political prisoners. His bodyguard was released months later.
The Russians were quick to use the ambiguity of the mayor's situation in their efforts to break resistance to their presence.
The first question a Russian interrogator asked Oleksandr Maksimenko after he was arrested in July was about the mayor, Mr. Maksimenko said. How would he feel, the interrogator asked, if he learned that the mayor had capitulated, obtained a Russian passport and abandoned his people?
"I had doubts," said Mr. Maksimenko, who said he was imprisoned because he was head of the local affiliate of a Ukrainian government think tank. "What if it's true?"
It was a few weeks later when, by accident, he saw Mr. Kolykhaev, who was largely kept out of sight of the other inmates. A guard in the prison had left the mayor's cell door ajar, and he happened to be standing in the doorway.
"We saw each other and looked each other in the eyes," Mr. Maksimenko said. "He sincerely smiled at me and I at him. In that way, we supported each other."
"That was the last I saw him," he said.

Kherson now has a new mayor, Halyna Luhova, who is a member of Mr. Kolykhaev's political party.

The heavy booms elicited no reaction from Natalia Havrilenko, who was wearing a green camouflage flak jacket over a pink and blue puffer jacket. Ms. Havrilenko said she spent the first part of the occupation smuggling food and weapons to a small group of armed partisans fighting the Russians behind enemy lines.
Then she was arrested.
Though she spent several weeks at the same Kherson jail as the mayor, she saw him for the first time only in October, as Ukrainian forces were pressing in and the Russians moved them to another location across the river. He had grown thinner, she said, but showed no signs of torture.
She said she saw "no fear in his eyes," and from their brief conversations in the prison yard, she said, she believed that he had remained true to Ukraine.
Some residents of Kherson think Mr. Kolykhaev is being held captive in Russian-controlled territory. Others think he is dead. Those more skeptical of his actions wonder if he is living it up in Russia.
Ms. Havrilenko is firm in her conviction. Kherson had many traitors, she said. The mayor was not one of them.
"Everyone abandoned the city," she said. "There was no one from the leadership left. He was the only one who stayed."

KHERSON, Ukraine — The jailhouse near the Dnieper River where the Russians imprisoned and tortured hundreds of Ukrainians sits empty now. Many of its inmates were freed when Ukraine’s forces liberated the city more than three months ago.
But one prominent prisoner is still missing: the city’s former mayor, Ihor Kolykhaev.
The mayor, who refused to flee and for a while remained at his post after Russian forces swept into Kherson, was arrested in June and put in solitary confinement. In the fall, as Ukrainian forces advanced on the city, Kolykhaev’s jailers moved him deeper inside Russian-held territory, according to witnesses.
He has not been heard from since.
The disappearance has deepened questions swirling around Kolykhaev and the role he tried to play. Though he refused to acknowledge the Russians’ authority or swear fealty to them, he remained at his desk, working to keep the lights on and the buses running. The decision helped to ensure a livable city but also smoothed the way for Russian forces to create an occupation government.
Many city residents consider the 52-year-old former mayor a hero for staying put even as much of the political and security establishment fled in the opening days of the war.
But others harbor suspicions about the mayor’s loyalties that even his arrest and imprisonment have not dispelled.
The competing views about Kolykhaev underscore the complexities of assessing loyalties in wartime Ukraine, particularly in occupied territories.
With Russians in control, what counts as treachery is often fuzzy. It does not have to be something as serious as abetting the Russian military. Teachers and police officers who did nothing more than continue to show up at work have been disparaged by those who fled, and in some cases, they were arrested after liberation.
“There’s a lot of talk and leaks saying that he’s a traitor, he gave up the city,” said Dmitry Poddubnyi, a Kherson City Council member, who remained by the mayor’s side until his arrest. “We spent so much time with him. We slept all together in the City Council building. Every day we were together, and I never saw anything like that.”
Kherson’s prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into the mayor’s disappearance but said in an interview that he had no information regarding his whereabouts. The lack of progress has angered Kolykhaev’s son, Svyatoslav, who said he had started his own inquiry, interviewing as many as 20 people who laid eyes on his father during his incarceration. But he has come up with little more than rumors.
“I got information that he got sick,” he said. “For now, I honestly don’t know.”
Supporters say Kolykhaev never intended to collaborate with the occupiers. Days after the invasion started, heavily armed commandos marched up to his third-floor office and demanded he capitulate. The Russian military already effectively controlled the city, and a refusal could have resulted in arrest, imprisonment or worse.
He refused, according to his bodyguard, who was present.
The mayor “told them, ‘I can’t do that because I am a citizen of Ukraine, because the people elected me and I won’t abandon them,’” said the bodyguard, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals over his own role during the occupation.
Why Russian forces let him remain in place remains a mystery, but it was an uneasy accommodation.
The Russian forces seemed happy to have him at the helm at first, as he freed them from the responsibility of running the city as they set about building an occupation government. In exchange, the mayor refrained from openly criticizing them or publicly supporting the large protests against the occupation that broke out in the first weeks.
But the mayor refused to acknowledge the Russians’ authority. He rebuffed several attempts by Russian commanders, sometimes at gunpoint, to compel him to switch sides, according to people who were with him throughout the occupation. And he ensured that the Ukrainian flag still flew over the city administration building while he continued to work there.
In his frequent Facebook posts, which he wrote in Russian, the most commonly spoken language in Kherson, he tried to buck up the spirits of Kherson residents and often signed off with the phrase “Kherson is Ukraine,” accompanied by a Ukrainian flag emoji.
“I’m not a soldier,” the mayor wrote in one Facebook post in June. “My task is to preserve our common home and maintain our city in proper condition.”
The stance earned him critics, among them the former governor of the Kherson region, Hennadiy Lahuta, who fled Kherson on the second day of the war. In a lengthy interview in June with the Ukrainian news outlet Glavkom, Lahuta said he had advised Kolykhaev to leave as well.
“On Feb. 25, Kolykhaev definitely understood that the enemy would enter Kherson,” Lahuta said. “No matter his elected office and business, he should have left the city, because a parallel existence between the occupier and the Ukrainian government doesn’t exist. Those lines will eventually cross.”
That viewpoint, held by others who left Kherson, helped foster suspicions about Kolykhaev’s loyalties that still linger today.
Kolykhaev dismissed the criticism of outsiders whom he accused of failing to grasp the reality of life under occupation.
“Unlike those who carry out their service to the country only through television screens, I am present in the city, responsible for its functioning and the security of those living in it,” he wrote in one Facebook post. “Only the city residents can judge me and my actions.”

Readers Recommend Their Favorite Cozy Restaurants: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: We asked for recommendations, and you delivered.
In anticipation of a frigid winter that never quite panned out, I wrote about cozy dining in late December. You know those restaurants, the ones that make you feel as if you've been spirited away to a quieter part of New York City reserved just for you and yours.
In the same dispatch, I asked for your own recommendations and, let me say, in nearly a year of writing this newsletter I've never received such an enthusiastic response. With this week shaping up to be a little cooler, if not downright cold, I thought I'd provide a grand survey of what cozy means to you all, my incredible readers.
Greenwich Village Was Built for This
No particular neighborhood seems to have a corner on the homey market, but one area kept popping up: Greenwich Village. As one of Manhattan's oldest landmark historic districts, it has always had a head start on Old World charm.
Joe D. shared that his family has been dining at Piccolo Angolo, at the corner of Hudson and Jane Streets, for 25 years. "My brother came upon this little place soon after it opened and it has become -- for us and its devotees -- like a family dining room," he wrote, adding that it's "intimate and never loud." It mixes the old and the new: Wild boar ragù sits right next to vegan asparagus ravioli on the menu. Bruno M. asked me to consider Oscar's Place, a British-Belgian restaurant, also on Hudson Street, that he called his "idea of cozy." It's beloved for its fish and chips and full English breakfast.
Another reader, Donna A., flagged the French restaurant La Sirène, on Broome Street. Her order: French onion soup and a glass of red wine. It "screams -- OK, whispers -- cozy when temperatures drop," she wrote.
You could be convinced that the French invented cozy from the many, many emails pointing me toward restaurants of that ilk: Le Fond in Greenpoint; La Bonne Soupe and Deux Amis in Midtown; Le Gigot in the West Village; Le Parisien in Kips Bay; the Odeon in TriBeCa; and two votes for Chez Napoléon in Hell's Kitchen. ("Small, quiet and wonderful old-fashioned French cuisine," Jane D. wrote.)
For New Yorkers, Comfort Means Pasta
As I've reported before, we know that New Yorkers are obsessed with French food. The only close second? Italian. Adam S. recommended Mario's, a 104-year-old red sauce restaurant on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, where his family celebrates "all occasions, birthdays and anniversaries, and lots in between" in a "homey and warm" environment.
Farther south, in the shadow of Carmine's, on the Upper West Side, is the newish, bookshelf-lined Italian restaurant Osteria Accademia, on Amsterdam Avenue. Vicki W. wrote, "The overall effect is of a library, but not too dark and it keeps the noise of this small room under nice control." Her favorites include the fennel salad with oranges and pistachios, the tabliolini neri and all the fish dishes. At Trattoria Dell'Arte, near Carnegie Hall, you'll find Tom P. He said that the upstairs dining room, with its portraits of famous noses, is good for "whispered conversations away from the boisterous space below" and "secret assignations." You do you, Tom P.!
I'd travel far and wide for a good meal in a lovely space, but I always come home to roost in Brooklyn. So, I think I'll spend my next late-winter evening in Brooklyn Heights per a recommendation from Steve M., who would rather go out to eat than "mess up a perfectly clean kitchen," which is so, so real. He usually goes for the Italian restaurant Noodle Pudding, on Henry Street.
"The food is fresh and well prepared and the overall feel is 'Cheers'-friendly and welcoming," he wrote. And with nary a website or Resy page and no signage, it's truly hidden away. All that, and the lamb Bolognese, sound like just my cup of tea.
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Torrisi Bar & Restaurant, the latest New York City restaurant from Major Food Group. The décor, Wells writes, leans into a "more is more" aesthetic, but the chef Rich Torrisi is doing "the most subtle and evocative cooking of his career."
Openings: Brooklyn Winery in Williamsburg has moved to a bigger space and opened Rosette at Brooklyn Winery, a full-service restaurant; Bar Bastion, an elegant new bar above Le Jardinier in Midtown, opens on Thursday; and Sushi Nikko, an omakase-style counter, is now open on the mezzanine level of the food hall JACX&CO in Long Island City.
These are boom times for sake in America, Eric Asimov reported in his latest Pour column, with imports of the rice wine more than doubling over the last decade.
More than a decade after it was canceled, the cater-waiter comedy "Party Down" is back. It's a show that doesn't "fetishize food or cooking at all," Tejal Rao writes, but "feels sharper, more perceptive and possibly more honest about food service as a whole."
Julie Creswell reported on the shrinking benefits for participants enrolled in loyalty programs at Starbucks, Dunkin' and other restaurant chains. The companies' excuse? Inflation.

For Ukraine’s Animals, a Home Is Getting Harder to Find

LVIV, Ukraine — The first thing you hear after entering the animal sanctuary in Znesinnya Park near the center of Lviv are the dogs. There are scores of them barking and howling, members of a raucous makeshift orchestra sounding out a discordant opera.
They are orphans of war, rescued from bombed-out cities or left by refugees who were uprooted from their homes and unable to care for their pets anymore.
Their residence now is a hulking shed, previously abandoned, that has been hastily outfitted with rows of wooden and metal cages, castoff blankets and towers of bagged pet food.
Orest Zalypskyi started Domivka: Home of Rescued Animals five years ago primarily to care for endangered and injured wild creatures: foxes that were used to train hunting dogs and had their claws and teeth removed, a circus monkey about to be euthanized, an owl with a clipped wing.
But since the Russians invaded last year, Domivka has also become a center for rescued pets — dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, lambs and birds. Before the war, the sanctuary contained roughly 200 animals. Now, it has more than 500.
“We didn’t have any place for them,” said Viktoria Stasiv, a volunteer. “It was crazy.” They rushed to put together the dog kennel in an old brick and concrete shed that had been used for trash.
At a different site, about an hour away, are 170 sheep, goats and llamas that Domivka volunteers are caring for on a plot of donated land. The animals belonged to a petting zoo in Zaporizhzhia that had to be abandoned.
Over the past year, the group has hosted thousands of animals, Zalypskyi said.
There was a brief period last spring, after the war began, when animal owners and rescuers were allowed to take animals across the border into other European countries without the usual requirements for things like vaccinations. Busloads of volunteers from Germany and Poland came and took dogs, rabbits and cats back with them. Nearly 5,500 pets were rescued and found new homes outside Ukraine; another 1,500 were adopted inside the country.
But now, adoptions have slowed. Anyone outside Ukraine who wants to liberate a pet from the misery of war has to pay about 200 euros and pick it up. When it comes to dogs, most people want puppies, Stasiv said, but most of the abandoned dogs are older and bigger. Some are injured.
Chip, a sweet-faced mutt, arrived from Kherson, a heavily besieged city 560 miles away, where he was blinded during an attack. Bonie, a large black dog with tan paws and snout, has a steel rod in his back after his spine was broken in a shelling. Lina Brithna, a rehabilitation worker, is helping him learn to walk again. Zubik, a black and white part-malamute, lost one of his front legs.
There are a couple of puppies that were found in a trash can in Lviv. They are kept in a small indoor shelter along with other injured animals and recent arrivals that are quarantined for their first two weeks. They scamper around Brithna as she cleans their cages. The cats watch, occasionally poking their paws through holes in the plexiglass doors, and wait their turn.
All the dogs are taken for walks three times a day along the snowy grounds — by volunteers, visiting families and sometimes former owners, who would love to keep their pets but are themselves refugees and can’t provide a home.
Domivka did not previously have a website, but with so many more animals under its care, the nonprofit is now fundraising on Facebook and Instagram. Over Christmas it sold branded calendars that featured longtime residents and war evacuees, including a white-tipped eagle named Galya.
This small shelter in a Lviv park is one of several domestic and international organizations, like U-Hearts Foundation, UAnimals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, working to help feed and care for animals during the war.
The shelter needs more staff, enclosures and food, Zalypskyi said through a translator. “The needs are growing every day as the number of animals increase.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tested and Tempered by War, Zelensky Rises to the Moment: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In much of the world, President Volodymyr Zelensky, once brushed off as a political lightweight, has become a household name, representing Ukraine's tenacity and underdog victories against Russia.
As Russian tanks rumbled into Ukraine in the predawn a year ago, President Volodymyr Zelensky recorded a simple video address to his nation: "We are strong," he said. "We will defeat everyone because we are Ukraine."
Amid the swirl of chaotic battles, shifting military fortunes and the thorny terrain of global diplomacy that followed, one thing remained constant: Mr. Zelensky showing up in selfies filmed on his phone, to deliver speeches and to appear in slickly produced videos beamed into foreign parliaments, his haggard, bearded but defiant appearance becoming the face of Ukraine's struggle at home and abroad.
For years, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedic actor, had been brushed off by critics as a lightweight, new to politics, naïve about Russia and buffeted by the political headwinds of a presidential impeachment in the United States and a failed diplomatic endeavor with Russia. That is no longer the case.
After three successful counteroffensives, in which his army defeated Russian forces on the battlefield and upended long-held ideas about the balance of military power in Europe, Mr. Zelensky, 45, has grown more confident and battle-tested.
His soldiers have reclaimed nearly half of the land Russia seized in the invasion's opening days, and for now have successfully resisted a new Russian offensive. Western nations rallied behind him in high-profile meetings this month, capped by President Biden's visit to Kyiv last Monday.
And in much of the world, Mr. Zelensky has become a household name, representing Ukraine's tenacity and underdog victories against Russia. Despite wearing T-shirts and having once voiced over the cartoon character Paddington Bear, Mr. Zelensky has been transformed by the war into a leader on the world stage with as much gravitas as any other.
Operating in the crucible of violence, Mr. Zelensky navigated the quickly evolving needs of his army and country. First, he had to survive. When the invasion came and he became a target for Russia, he refused to be spirited out of Kyiv for safety. Pivotal early decisions hinged on whether and when to simply go outside, to videotape his presence in the capital, risking missile strikes.
He has softened his early chiding of foreign leaders over weapons supplies, which irritated Western officials, including Mr. Biden; he was cordial and diplomatic in meetings with European leaders this month -- in part because he has largely gotten what he wanted from them.
He has not bent to pressure from some Western allies to engage in peace talks, sticking to his demand that any deal must include the return of captured territory -- a condition Russia would almost certainly reject.
Mr. Zelensky has also shed the second-guessing he exhibited last summer about life-or-death military decisions, and has accumulated the stature to be able to fire top officials to cleanse his administration of corruption.
"He is more at peace with himself," said an adviser to Mr. Zelensky, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose private observations. "He has a clear understanding what Ukraine should do. There is no ambiguity: There is no peace with Russia, and Ukraine must arm itself to the teeth."
As commander in chief, Mr. Zelensky decides key military questions, like the major offensives Ukraine has undertaken, but otherwise delegates to his generals. He is briefed on battlefield developments early every morning, aides say.
Mr. Zelensky has been accused by his political adversaries of exploiting his wartime authority to solidify his grip on the levers of power through martial law and through the consolidation of the media.
Television news broadcasts from several channels were banded into one, for example, controlled by the state, which critics say stifles free speech. The criticism intensified in late December when Mr. Zelensky signed a bill expanding the authority of Ukraine's state broadcasting regulator to cover the online and print news media.
A year into the war, the first cracks have appeared in Mr. Zelensky's tight coterie of aides and top advisers with a string of firings in January over corruption allegations, including claims that officials cut deals that overcharged the military for food.
And in a country accustomed to pluralistic politics, opposition parties have seen in Mr. Zelensky's leadership an over-personification of Ukraine's struggle, centered on him at the expense of the thousands of other top officials and the millions of Ukrainians engaged in the war effort.
Still, once the invasion began, Mr. Zelensky decided he would need to maintain a continual public presence, to show the country that he was confident and had no fear, the adviser said.
Mr. Zelensky is often said to lead through public relations, and those efforts became a hallmark of his outreach -- to his own citizens, and to the world.
Analyses of this copious wartime output -- in videos, ad-libbed comments on his cellphone and nightly addresses to Ukrainians -- show he has, from the opening day of the invasion, turned to recurring themes: Ukraine will prevail through unity and patriotism, Russia is a terrorist state, and Ukraine will be blunt in asking for aid from allies.
"Sometimes, those of us who study politics tend to be very cautious of highlighting leadership," said Olga Onuch, a political science professor at Manchester University in England and co-author of a book on Mr. Zelensky's tenure in Ukraine, "The Zelensky Effect." "We tend to be skeptical of politicians," she added. "But his leadership has been hugely important" for Ukraine.
Even some in the political opposition before the invasion say that Mr. Zelensky's publicity-driven approach to wartime leadership has been effective.
"Before the war, I was a very vocal critic," Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity Party, said in an interview. "But I should be absolutely frank: He is doing a great job as commander in chief. He became the face of Ukraine and a face the world admires."
Through the war, Mr. Zelensky has shifted toward a more nationalist stance, cracking down on a Russian-affiliated church that was spreading Moscow's influence in Ukraine, for instance, and banning a pro-Russian political party.
But close observers of Mr. Zelensky's presidency say that he did not so much change as fit, improbably, into Ukraine's moment of need. By the time of the invasion, they say, he had already evolved -- in his politics, his style and his persona -- into the leader the world would only come to know once the war started.
Through 2021, Mr. Zelensky had tried, without success, to revive talks with Moscow over settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine that had been simmering since Russia intervened militarily in 2014. And, brushing off criticism of naïveté, in 2019, Mr. Zelensky even surrendered territory to Russian proxies in a policy of disengagement along the front line, in hopes of easing talks.
The failure of this initiative, and a backlash at home -- with street protesters in Kyiv accusing him of treason for surrendering land -- steered the Ukrainian president to a political formula in which he rejected concessions forced by Moscow.
Instead, he has bet on Ukrainians' will to fight and the backing of allies, an approach that has so far proved successful.
Though Mr. Zelensky made a career in Russian-language cinema before entering politics, he embodied the pivot to the Ukrainian language in nearly all public settings that many people in Ukraine took after the invasion -- but Mr. Zelensky began that turn at the outset of his 2019 presidential campaign and early in his presidency.
On foreign policy, Mr. Zelensky was schooled before the Russian attack through a brush with American political scandal, shaping his stance on relations with allies. Just days after his election in 2019, Mr. Zelensky was confronted with a threat of abandonment of military aid by his country's most important ally, the United States, if he did not bend to a request from Donald J. Trump, then the president, and associates to open a politically motivated investigation of Hunter Biden.
Through this episode, which led to Mr. Trump's first impeachment, Mr. Zelensky began speaking about the need for Ukraine, despite foreign aid dependency, to be a "subject" in talks with allies, not an object of discussion to be pushed around by the internal politics of foreign countries.
"Zelensky as a wartime president hasn't actually changed as a leader," said Ms. Onuch, the co-author of the academic study of his presidency. "Those who are looking for somebody born into leadership on Feb. 24, 2022, need to do their homework."
A more forceful tone emerged when Mr. Zelensky thought it necessary -- and it became a hallmark of his wartime interaction with allied governments. His relationship with Western allies has at times grown tense as he pressured them for more aid and resisted suggestions from leaders like Emmanuel Macron of France that he should negotiate a peace deal.
"Ukrainian politicians have not always spoken up and out about the pressures they face from Western allies, sometimes mistakenly, sometimes naïvely," said Volodymyr Yermolenko, the editor in chief of the multimedia news platform UkraineWorld. "If Ukraine is to be treated as an equal, he has to make clear Ukraine's position."
Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly said that he is lucky to be the leader of Ukraine, a nation with a strong tradition of self-organizing and volunteerism.
"My feeling is he is led by the nation, rather than he is the leader of the nation," said Mr. Yermolenko, referring to Mr. Zelensky's success in channeling the country's resilience and anger at Russia. "Zelensky is the embodiment of this resistance but not the source."
Mr. Zelensky has worked with at least two speechwriters, Yuriy Kostyuk, a former screenwriter at his comedic television production company; and Dmytro Lytvyn, a former journalist, Ukrainian news media have reported.
Some speeches wove in elaborate theses on geopolitics or were redolent with historical references to wartime leaders of the past, including Winston Churchill; others were simple, poignant reflections on the cost of war.
"This is the story of people who lived in Borodyanka," Mr. Zelensky said in a speech in May about a Kyiv suburb bombed by the Russian military. They "raised and kissed their children before going to bed and somehow went to sleep and never woke up again."

Williamson Plans to Run Again in 2024: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Williamson, a self-help author, called Trumpism a symptom of a disease in the American psyche during her last bid for the Democratic nomination.
Marianne Williamson, the self-help author and spiritual adviser who ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, will run again in 2024, she told supporters this weekend.
"Since the election of 2016 it's odd for anyone to think they can know who can win the presidency," she said in a statement that was emailed to supporters and posted on Facebook. "And I'm not putting myself through this again just to add to the conversation. I'm running for president to help bring an aberrational chapter of our history to a close, and to help bring forth a new beginning." She added, "Washington is filled with good political car mechanics, but the problem is that we are on the wrong road."
She will formally announce her campaign in a speech on Saturday.
Four years ago, Ms. Williamson was one of more than 25 candidates for the nomination that Joseph R. Biden Jr. ultimately won. This time around, so far, she is the only candidate -- entering the 2024 race before even Mr. Biden has done so, though he is widely expected to run for re-election.
Ms. Williamson, 70, became famous within the self-help world as an author of several best-selling books and a spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey. In the 1980s, she founded the Los Angeles and Manhattan Centers for Living, which supported people with H.I.V. and AIDS, and Project Angel Food, which provides free meals to people with serious illnesses.
A signature proposal in her first presidential campaign was to establish a federal Department of Peace, which would seek nonmilitary solutions to foreign conflicts and oversee efforts to combat domestic extremism, including white supremacy. She also supported reparations for slavery, arguing in a Democratic debate that they were better described not as "financial assistance" but rather "payment of a debt that is owed."
But what brought her the most attention were her spiritual pronouncements, particularly her declaration that Trumpism was a symptom of an illness in the American psyche that could not be cured with political policies.
On a Democratic debate stage in 2019, she spoke directly to then-President Donald J. Trump: "Mr. President, if you're listening, I want you to hear me, please: You have harnessed fear for political purposes, and only love can cast that out." She added: "I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field, and sir, love will win."
In the 12 months of her last presidential campaign -- from January 2019 until she dropped out of the race in January 2020, before the first votes were cast -- Ms. Williamson never exceeded low single digits in polling averages. After dropping out, she endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Ms. Williamson has promoted dubious or debunked medical theories, particularly on mental illness. In books, interviews and social media posts before and during her 2020 campaign, she described clinical depression as a "scam," argued that antidepressants were recklessly overprescribed, and suggested with no evidence that they might have been to blame for some celebrity suicides.
In an interview with The New York Times in 2019, she said she regretted the "scam" description and did not categorically oppose antidepressants. But she largely stood by her claims that they were overused and potentially dangerous, including in a message posted on Twitter after the designer Kate Spade died by suicide: "How many public personalities on antidepressants have to hang themselves before the F.D.A. does something, Big Pharma cops to what it knows, and the average person stops falling for this?"
There was no public evidence that Ms. Spade was taking antidepressants. The Food and Drug Administration has found no indication of an increased risk of suicidal thinking with antidepressant use in people over 24, and untreated depression is a major risk factor for suicide.
Ms. Williamson also drew attention in 2019 for calling vaccine mandates "Orwellian" -- a reference to vaccinations against diseases like measles and polio that most schoolchildren have long been required to receive. Within days, she apologized for sounding "as though I question the validity of lifesaving vaccines," but said that it was reasonable to be suspicious of pharmaceutical companies' motives.
Public skepticism of science and medicine has only grown since then, coalescing into a political force with significant public health consequences. Many politicians, mainly Republicans, have stoked it -- among them Mr. Trump, who is running again in 2024, and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a potential candidate.
In Twitter posts since 2020, Ms. Williamson has supported a strong government response to the pandemic, said she was vaccinated against Covid and forcefully rejected descriptions of herself as anti-vaccination, but called vaccine mandates "a legitimate civil rights issue for a lot of people."

Full text: Years after coming to grips with her husband's infidelity, a reader still feels an urge to make his lover suffer.
I have been married for 20 years. Some time ago, I discovered that my husband had an extramarital affair early in our marriage. The affair lasted for several years. After the deception came to light, we decided to stay together and work on our marriage in counseling. My husband was very remorseful, and I have forgiven him. We are trying to move on, and we aren't doing badly. The problem: I know the woman he was involved with. I remain filled with anger at her and obsessed with confronting her. I am pretty sure this isn't healthy for me, but I can't get past my hurt or my intense desire to make her suffer. Advice?
SPOUSE
I am sorry for your anguish. And I agree that fixating on your husband's former lover is probably unhealthy. If I were you, I would explore individual counseling. From a distance, your claim that you have forgiven your husband isn't persuasive. I get that staying angry at him may be uncomfortable or even frightening, but haven't you simply shifted your anger from him onto the woman with whom he cheated?
I suspect that many of us will identify with your fantasy of confronting this woman -- as if a single, white-hot tirade would resolve your feelings. But emotions are often messier than that, and, frankly, I think you're focusing on the wrong party: This woman never promised to be faithful to you, nor did she cheat on you. Your husband did those things.
In one-on-one counseling -- apart from your husband -- you would be free to explore all your feelings safely. You may discover that your keen desire to make this woman suffer is really displaced fury at your husband. (Or not.) Your therapist may also suggest a return to couples counseling. I'm sorry that I can't offer a quick fix here. Rebuilding trust often takes lots of time and hard work.
A Cat Benefit Analysis
My elderly mother is in poor physical condition. She uses a walker most of the time and can't bend over or carry anything. She had to leave her cat unexpectedly after she fell and had to spend six weeks in a hospital and rehabilitation facility. I placed her cat with a colleague, who is willing to keep it. But now that my mother is returning to her home -- no stronger than she was before her fall -- she wants the cat back. I've tried to explain that she will be better off without the cat, which could easily cause her to fall, and that the cat will be better off where it can be cared for properly. But my mother says, "The cat is all I have!" Am I being cruel?
DAUGHTER
Of course not! Here's something I wish I had understood better, though, when I was in your (difficult) position: The longest life isn't necessarily the best one. Assuming your mother is of sound mind, it's not unreasonable for her to choose a beloved pet over the possibility of a better health outcome. That cat may be her greatest comfort.
Explain the risks to her clearly, then let her choose. (Perhaps regular feline visits are an option?) I know you want what's best for your mother, but don't substitute your judgment for hers. You say she is going home, but as you describe her condition -- unable to "bend over or carry anything" -- I suspect she may need some assistance performing basic functions. If her helper (or you) is willing to feed the cat and clean its litter box, do your best to respect your mother's decision.
Would It Have Killed Her to Go Door to Door?
A woman I consider a close friend got engaged recently. I discovered it by scrolling on social media. I've known her for eight years. I don't want to stain her good news. Quite the opposite! I want to celebrate her. But I am hurt that she didn't notify me personally. Can I tell her that?
FRIEND
So now, on top of the showers and registries and other bridal pageantry, you want to require individual notification by the bridal couple to all their friends? No, I am putting my foot down. Your friend's social media post was clearly adequate: You saw it!
Think of her good news like your birthday. You don't tell everyone it's coming to court birthday wishes. (Facebook does that, or the date is in people's calendars.) Just be happy for your friend and congratulate her.
Don't Bring Anything (but Leave the Hummus)
I love to give dinner parties. When guests ask what they can bring, I say, "No need," or suggest something to munch on during cocktails. So, I was taken aback when a friend who brought hummus and carrot sticks started packing them up after dinner to take home with her without asking me if I wanted them. (I did!) Should I have told her? (Note: This wasn't a potluck or a financial issue.)
HOSTESS
People are weird. (Every single one of us.) Maybe your friend wanted to take her serving dish home or thought she was helping with cleanup? Those are the best explanations I've got for her odd behavior, anyway. And for the record: Yes, if you want to keep your friend's hummus after you've fed your guests, ask her nicely to leave it.

Full text: When Cat Lukaszewski and Steven Whalen met in Los Angeles, she was new to the city and he was lost in his hometown. Then they found each other.
Catherine Ann Lukaszewski was on a small side street in Los Angeles, looking for the Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral, when she met Steven James Whalen who was looking for the same.
It was November 2016, and they were participating in the Great Los Angeles Walk, a self-guided pedestrian tour of part of the city. When Mr. Whalen saw that Ms. Lukaszewski had a map, something that he lacked, he approached her for directions.
The pair got to talking and were so absorbed in their conversation about historical architecture that they missed the cathedral. They ended up walking together for about four hours, including a stop for lunch.
However, there wasn't much of an initial attraction between the two. Ms. Lukaszewski, who goes by Cat, attributes that to the practical hat Mr. Whalen was wearing. "It was one of those sun hats that has the floppy ears," she said.
Ms. Lukaszewski, 37, moved to Los Angeles in May 2016 from Manhattan, where she was born and raised. She received a bachelor's degree in art history from New York University and is now a project manager in the science department of the Getty Conservation Institute.
Mr. Whalen, 56, is "a lifelong Angeleno." He received a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in educational psychology, both from the University of California Los Angeles, and is a director of engineering at VideoAmp, an advertising technology firm.
In Mr. Whalen, Ms. Lukaszewski found a passionate tour guide, and in her, he found a newcomer looking for tips. They became friends on Facebook and Mr. Whalen told Ms. Lukaszewski he would send her his top 10 spots to see in the city. Instead, he sent her a list about 100 points long. The list even included a dentist, which Ms. Lukaszewski "really appreciated."
For Ms. Lukaszewski, the interest in historic architecture came from touring sites with her parents throughout her childhood. Mr. Whalen said he loves "things that are built to last."
Despite how well they got along, romance still wasn't in the air for their first several meetings. Together, they took an Art Deco walking tour with the Los Angeles Conservancy and visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House.
It wasn't until a trip to the Griffith Observatory on Jan. 21, 2017 when Ms. Lukaszewski suspected things were starting to change. "We saw the sunset that night and I thought 'Maybe I'm falling in love with this guy'."
The moment of romantic realization happened on Feb. 2 of that year at the Gaslite, a "seedy and divey" bar in Santa Monica, Calif. As patrons sang karaoke, Mr. Whalen and Ms. Lukaszewski had their first kiss. Valentine's Day plans followed and the friendship evolved into a relationship. In early 2019, Mr. Whalen moved into Ms. Lukaszewski's apartment in Westwood, a neighborhood within Los Angeles, where they live today.

The couple said their relationship grew deeper over the pandemic and they began talking about getting married someday. Someday eventually became "soon," but no plans were made until last February, when Ms. Lukaszewski found a French Art Deco engagement ring sold by her friends' antique and vintage jewelry company, Pebble & Polish. The ring arrived and Mr. Whalen proposed in their living room in March.
On Feb. 10, the couple was married in a civil ceremony performed by deputy commissioner Sydney Bennion at the courthouse across the street from the Beverly Hills City Hall. Ms. Lukaszewski's parents, Anthony and Caroline Lukaszewski, and Mr. Whalen's cousin and his wife, Tony and Betty Whalen, were also in attendance. (Both of Mr. Whalen's parents are deceased.)
The party of six went to dinner at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel and then had cake and champagne in their rented room at the Sunset Tower Hotel.
Before the wedding, Ms. Lukaszewski had been offered the chance to hike from Lukla, Nepal to the Mount Everest base camp in April with a group of friends. She discussed it with Mr. Whalen because she knew she wouldn't have enough vacation days for both the trek and a honeymoon. Mr. Whalen encouraged her, saying: "We can go on many honeymoons for the rest of our lives."
About three years after they first tried, the couple eventually returned to see the Greek Orthodox cathedral they had been looking for on the day they met. Ms. Lukaszewski, who will be taking her husband's last name, said she now has her own practical sun hat with floppy ears.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Arriving in record numbers, they're ending up in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws -- including in factories that make products for well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom.
It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., but inside the factory everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had never met.
About every 10 seconds, she stuffed a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It could be dangerous work, with fast-moving pulleys and gears that had torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp.
The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina, who had crossed the Southern border by themselves and were now spending late hours bent over hazardous machinery, in violation of child labor laws. At nearby plants, other children were tending giant ovens to make Chewy and Nature Valley granola bars and packing bags of Lucky Charms and Cheetos -- all of them working for the processing giant Hearthside Food Solutions, which would ship these products around the country.
"Sometimes I get tired and feel sick," Carolina said after a shift in November. Her stomach often hurt, and she was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incessant roar of the machines, or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. "But I'm getting used to it."
These workers are part of a new economy of exploitation: Migrant children, who have been coming into the United States without their parents in record numbers, are ending up in some of the most punishing jobs in the country, a New York Times investigation found. This shadow work force extends across industries in every state, flouting child labor laws that have been in place for nearly a century. Twelve-year-old roofers in Florida and Tennessee. Underage slaughterhouse workers in Delaware, Mississippi and North Carolina. Children sawing planks of wood on overnight shifts in South Dakota.
Largely from Central America, the children are driven by economic desperation that was worsened by the pandemic. This labor force has been slowly growing for almost a decade, but it has exploded since 2021, while the systems meant to protect children have broken down.
The Times spoke with more than 100 migrant child workers in 20 states who described jobs that were grinding them into exhaustion, and fears that they had become trapped in circumstances they never could have imagined. The Times examination also drew on court and inspection records and interviews with hundreds of lawyers, social workers, educators and law enforcement officials.
In town after town, children scrub dishes late at night. They run milking machines in Vermont and deliver meals in New York City. They harvest coffee and build lava rock walls around vacation homes in Hawaii. Girls as young as 13 wash hotel sheets in Virginia.
In many parts of the country, middle and high school teachers in English-language learner programs say it is now common for nearly all their students to rush off to long shifts after their classes end.
"They should not be working 12-hour days, but it's happening here," said Valeria Lindsay, a language arts teacher at Homestead Middle School near Miami. For the past three years, she said, almost every eighth grader in her English learner program of about 100 students was also carrying an adult workload.
Migrant child labor benefits both under-the-table operations and global corporations, The Times found. In Los Angeles, children stitch "Made in America" tags into J. Crew shirts. They bake dinner rolls sold at Walmart and Target, process milk used in Ben & Jerry's ice cream and help debone chicken sold at Whole Foods. As recently as the fall, middle-schoolers made Fruit of the Loom socks in Alabama. In Michigan, children make auto parts used by Ford and General Motors.
The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States climbed to a high of 130,000 last year -- three times what it was five years earlier -- and this summer is expected to bring another wave.
These are not children who have stolen into the country undetected. The federal government knows they are in the United States, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for ensuring sponsors will support them and protect them from trafficking or exploitation.
But as more and more children have arrived, the Biden White House has ramped up demands on staffers to move the children quickly out of shelters and release them to adults. Caseworkers say they rush through vetting sponsors.
While H.H.S. checks on all minors by calling them a month after they begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by The Times showed that over the last two years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children.
An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency wanted to release children swiftly, for the sake of their well-being, but had not compromised safety. "There are numerous places along the process to continually ensure that a placement is in the best interest of the child," said the spokeswoman, Kamara Jones.
Far from home, many of these children are under intense pressure to earn money. They send cash back to their families while often being in debt to their sponsors for smuggling fees, rent and living expenses.
"It's getting to be a business for some of these sponsors," said Annette Passalacqua, who left her job as a caseworker in Central Florida last year. Ms. Passalacqua said she saw so many children put to work, and found law enforcement officials so unwilling to investigate these cases, that she largely stopped reporting them. Instead, she settled for explaining to the children that they were entitled to lunch breaks and overtime.
Sponsors are required to send migrant children to school, and some students juggle classes and heavy workloads. Other children arrive to find that they have been misled by their sponsors and will not be enrolled in school.
The federal government hires child welfare agencies to track some minors who are deemed to be at high risk. But caseworkers at those agencies said that H.H.S. regularly ignored obvious signs of labor exploitation, a characterization the agency disputed.
In interviews with more than 60 caseworkers, most independently estimated that about two-thirds of all unaccompanied migrant children ended up working full time.
A representative for Hearthside said the company relied on a staffing agency to supply some workers for its plants in Grand Rapids, but conceded that it had not required the agency to verify ages through a national system that checks Social Security numbers. Unaccompanied migrant children often obtain false identification to secure work.
"We are immediately implementing additional controls to reinforce all agencies' strict compliance with our longstanding requirement that all workers must be 18 or over," the company said in a statement.
At Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina's ninth-grade social studies teacher, Rick Angstman, has seen the toll that long shifts take on his students. One, who was working nights at a commercial laundry, began passing out in class from fatigue and was hospitalized twice, he said. Unable to stop working, she dropped out of school.
"She disappeared into oblivion," Mr. Angstman said. "It's the new child labor. You're taking children from another country and putting them in almost indentured servitude."
On the Night Shift
When Carolina left Guatemala, she had no real understanding of what she was heading toward, just a sense that she could not stay in her village any longer. There was not much electricity or water, and after the pandemic began, not much food.
The only people who seemed to be getting by were the families living off remittances from relatives in the United States. Carolina lived alone with her grandmother, whose health began failing. When neighbors started talking about heading north, she decided to join. She was 14.
"I just kept walking," she said.
Carolina reached the U.S. border exhausted, weighing 84 pounds. Agents sent her to an H.H.S. shelter in Arizona, where a caseworker contacted her aunt, Marcelina Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez was at first reluctant: She had already sponsored two other relatives and had three children of her own. They were living on $ 600 a week, and she didn't know Carolina.
When Carolina arrived in Grand Rapids last year, Ms. Ramirez told her she would go to school every morning and suggested that she pick up evening shifts at Hearthside. She knew Carolina needed to send money back to her grandmother. She also believed it was good for young people to work. Child labor is the norm in rural Guatemala, and she herself had started working around the second grade.
One of the nation's largest contract manufacturers, Hearthside makes and packages food for companies like Frito-Lay, General Mills and Quaker Oats. "It would be hard to find a cookie or cracker aisle in any leading grocer that does not contain multiple products from Hearthside production facilities," a Grand Rapids-area plant manager told a trade magazine in 2019.
General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Nature Valley, said it recognized "the seriousness of this situation" and was reviewing The Times's findings. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, declined to comment.
Three people who until last year worked at one of the biggest employment agencies in Grand Rapids, Forge Industrial Staffing, said Hearthside supervisors were sometimes made aware that they were getting young-looking workers whose identities had been flagged as false.
"Hearthside didn't care," said Nubia Malacara, a former Forge employee who said she had also worked at Hearthside as a minor.
In a statement, Hearthside said, "We do care deeply about this issue and are concerned about the mischaracterization of Hearthside." A spokesman for Forge said it complied with state and federal laws and "would never knowingly employ individuals under 18."
Kevin Tomas said he sought work through Forge after he arrived in Grand Rapids at age 13 with his 7-year-old brother. At first, he was sent to a local manufacturer that made auto parts for Ford and General Motors. But his shift ended at 6:30 in the morning, so he could not stay awake in school, and he struggled to lift the heavy boxes.
"It's not that we want to be working these jobs. It's that we have to help our families," Kevin said.
By the time he was 15, Kevin had found a job at Hearthside, stacking 50-pound cases of cereal on the same shift as Carolina.
'So Many Red Flags'
The growth of migrant child labor in the United States over the past several years is a result of a chain of willful ignorance. Companies ignore the young faces in their back rooms and on their factory floors. Schools often decline to report apparent labor violations, believing it will hurt children more than help. And H.H.S. behaves as if the migrant children who melt unseen into the country are doing just fine.
"As the government, we've turned a blind eye to their trafficking," said Doug Gilmer, the head of the Birmingham, Ala., office of Homeland Security Investigations, a federal agency that often becomes involved with immigration cases.
Mr. Gilmer teared up as he recalled finding 13-year-olds working in meat plants; 12-year-olds working at suppliers for Hyundai and Kia, as documented last year by a Reuters investigation; and children who should have been in middle school working at commercial bakeries.
"We're encountering it here because we're looking for it here," Mr. Gilmer said. "It's happening everywhere."
Children have crossed the Southern border on their own for decades, and since 2008, the United States has allowed non-Mexican minors to live with sponsors while they go through immigration proceedings, which can take several years. The policy, codified in anti-trafficking legislation, is intended to prevent harm to children who would otherwise be turned away and left alone in a Mexican border town.
When Kelsey Keswani first worked as an H.H.S. contractor in Arizona to connect unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in 2010, the adults were almost always the children's parents, who had paid smugglers to bring them up from Central America, she said.
But around 2014, the number of arriving children began to climb, and their circumstances were different. In recent years, "the kids almost all have a debt to pay off, and they're super stressed about it," Ms. Keswani said.
She began to see more failures in the vetting process. "There were so many cases where sponsors had sponsored multiple kids, and it wasn't getting caught. So many red flags with debt. So many reports of trafficking."
Now, just a third of migrant children are going to their parents. A majority are sent to other relatives, acquaintances or even strangers, a Times analysis of federal data showed. Nearly half are coming from Guatemala, where poverty is fueling a wave of migration. Parents know that they would be turned away at the border or quickly deported, so they send their children in hopes that remittances will come back.
In the last two years alone, more than 250,000 children have entered the United States by themselves.
The shifting dynamics in Central America helped create a political crisis early in Mr. Biden's presidency, when children started crossing the border faster than H.H.S. could process them. With no room left in shelters, the children stayed in jail-like facilities run by Customs and Border Protection and, later, in tent cities. The images of children sleeping on gym mats under foil blankets attracted intense media attention.
The Biden administration pledged to move children through the shelter system more quickly. "We don't want to continue to see a child languish in our care if there is a responsible sponsor," Xavier Becerra, secretary of health and human services, told Congress in 2021.
His agency began paring back protections that had been in place for years, including some background checks and reviews of children's files, according to memos reviewed by The Times and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.
"Twenty percent of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged," said Ms. Keswani, who stopped working with H.H.S. last month.
Concerns piled up in summer 2021 at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the H.H.S. division responsible for unaccompanied migrant children. In a memo that July, 11 managers said they were worried that labor trafficking was increasing and complained to their bosses that the office had become "one that rewards individuals for making quick releases, and not one that rewards individuals for preventing unsafe releases."
Staff members said in interviews that Mr. Becerra continued to push for faster results, often asking why they could not discharge children with machine-like efficiency.
"If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an assembly line," Mr. Becerra said at a staff meeting last summer, according to a recording obtained by The Times.
The H.H.S. spokeswoman, Ms. Jones, said that Mr. Becerra had urged his staff to "step it up." "Like any good leader, he wouldn't hesitate to do it again -- especially when it comes to the well-being and safety of children," she said.
During a call last March, Mr. Becerra told Cindy Huang, the O.R.R. director, that if she could not increase the number of discharges, he would find someone who could, according to five people familiar with the call. She resigned a month later.
He recently made a similar threat to her successor during a meeting with senior leadership, according to several people who were present.
'It Was All Lies'
While many migrant children are sent to the United States by their parents, others are persuaded to come by adults who plan to profit from their labor.
Nery Cutzal was 13 when he met his sponsor over Facebook Messenger. Once Nery arrived in Florida, he discovered that he owed more than $ 4,000 and had to find his own place to live. His sponsor sent him threatening text messages and kept a running list of new debts: $ 140 for filling out H.H.S. paperwork; $ 240 for clothes from Walmart; $ 45 for a taco dinner.
"Don't mess with me," the sponsor wrote. "You don't mean anything to me."
Nery began working until 3 a.m. most nights at a trendy Mexican restaurant near Palm Beach to make the payments. "He said I would be able to go to school and he would take care of me, but it was all lies," Nery said.
His father, Leonel Cutzal, said the family had become destitute after a series of bad harvests and had no choice but to send their oldest son north from Guatemala.
"Even when he shares $ 50, it's a huge help," Mr. Cutzal said. "Otherwise, there are times we don't eat." Mr. Cutzal had not understood how much Nery would be made to work, he said. "I think he passed through some hard moments being up there so young."
Nery eventually contacted law enforcement, and his sponsor was found guilty last year of smuggling a child into the United States for financial gain. That outcome is rare: In the past decade, federal prosecutors have brought only about 30 cases involving forced labor of unaccompanied minors, according to a Times review of court databases.
Unlike the foster care system, in which all children get case management, H.H.S. provides this service to about a third of children who pass through its care, and usually for just four months. Tens of thousands of other children are sent to their sponsors with little but the phone number for a national hotline. From there, they are often on their own: There is no formal follow-up from any federal or local agencies to ensure that sponsors are not putting children to work illegally.
In Pennsylvania, one case worker told The Times he went to check on a child released to a man who had applied to sponsor 20 other minors. The boy had vanished. In Texas, another case worker said she had encountered a man who had been targeting poor families in Guatemala, promising to help them get rich if they sent their children across the border. He had sponsored 13 children.
"If you've been in this field for any amount of time, you know that there's what the sponsors agree to, and what they're actually doing," said Bernal Cruz Munoz, a caseworker supervisor in Oregon.
Calling the hotline is not a sure way to get support, either. Juanito Ferrer called for help after he was brought to Manassas, Va., at age 15 by an acquaintance who forced him to paint houses during the day and guard an apartment complex at night. His sponsor took his paychecks and watched him on security cameras as he slept on the basement floor.
Juanito said that when he called the hotline in 2019, the person on the other end just took a report. "I thought they'd send the police or someone to check, but they never did that," he said. "I thought they would come and inspect the house, at least." He eventually escaped.
Asked about the hotline, H.H.S. said operators passed reports onto law enforcement and other local agencies because the agency did not have the authority to remove children from homes.
The Times analyzed government data to identify places with high concentrations of children who had been released to people outside their immediate families -- a sign that they might have been expected to work. In northwest Grand Rapids, for instance, 93 percent of children have been released to adults who are not their parents.
H.H.S. does not track these clusters, but the trends are so pronounced that officials sometimes notice hot spots anyway.
Scott Lloyd, who led the resettlement office in the Trump administration, said he realized in 2018 that the number of unaccompanied Guatemalan boys being released to sponsors in South Florida seemed to be growing.
"I always wondered what was happening there," he said.
But his attention was diverted by the chaos around the Trump administration's child separation policy, and he never looked into it. The trend he saw has only accelerated: For example, in the past three years, more than 200 children have been released to distant relatives or unrelated adults around Immokalee, Fla., an agricultural hub with a long history of labor exploitation.
In a statement, H.H.S. said it had updated its case management system to better flag instances when multiple children were being released to the same person or address.
Many sponsors see themselves as benevolent, doing a friend or neighbor a favor by agreeing to help a child get out of a government shelter, even if they do not intend to offer any support. Children often understand that they will have to work, but do not grasp the unrelenting grind that awaits them.
"I didn't get how expensive everything was," said 13-year-old Jose Vasquez, who works 12-hour shifts, six days a week, at a commercial egg farm in Michigan and lives with his teenage sister. "I'd like to go to school, but then how would I pay rent?"
Occupational Hazards
One fall morning at Union High School in Grand Rapids, Carolina listened to Mr. Angstman lecture on the journalist Jacob Riis and the Progressive Era movement that helped create federal child labor laws. He explained that the changes were meant to keep young people out of jobs that could harm their health or safety, and showed the class a photo of a small boy making cigars.
"Riis reported that members of this family worked 17 hours a day, seven days a week," he told the students. "The cramped space reeked of toxic fumes." Students seemed unmoved. Some struggled to stay awake.
Teachers at the school estimated that 200 of their immigrant students were working full time while trying to keep up with their classes. The greatest share of Mr. Angstman's students worked at one of the four Hearthside plants in the city.
The company, which has 39 factories in the United States, has been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 34 violations since 2019, including for unsafe conveyor belts at the plant where Carolina found her job. At least 11 workers suffered amputations in that time. In 2015, a machine caught the hairnet of an Ohio worker and ripped off part of her scalp.
The history of accidents "shows a corporate culture that lacks urgency to keep workers safe," an OSHA official wrote after the most recent violation for an amputation.
Underage workers in Grand Rapids said that spicy dust from immense batches of Flamin' Hot Cheetos made their lungs sting, and that moving heavy pallets of cereal all night made their backs ache. They worried about their hands getting caught in conveyor belts, which federal law classifies as so hazardous that no child Carolina's age is permitted to work with them.
Hearthside said in a statement that it was committed to complying with laws governing worker protections. "We strongly dispute the safety allegations made and are proud of our safety-first culture," the statement read.
Federal law bars minors from a long list of dangerous jobs, including roofing, meat processing and commercial baking. Except on farms, children younger than 16 are not supposed to work for more than three hours or after 7 p.m. on school days.
But these jobs -- which are grueling and poorly paid, and thus chronically short-staffed -- are exactly where many migrant children are ending up. Adolescents are twice as likely as adults to be seriously injured at work, yet recently arrived preteens and teenagers are running industrial dough mixers, driving massive earthmovers and burning their hands on hot tar as they lay down roofing shingles, The Times found.
Unaccompanied minors have had their legs torn off in factories and their spines shattered on construction sites, but most of these injuries go uncounted. The Labor Department tracks the deaths of foreign-born child workers but no longer makes them public. Reviewing state and federal safety records and public reports, The Times found a dozen cases of young migrant workers killed since 2017, the last year the Labor Department reported any.
The deaths include a 14-year-old food delivery worker who was hit by a car while on his bike at a Brooklyn intersection; a 16-year-old who was crushed under a 35-ton tractor-scraper outside Atlanta; and a 15-year-old who fell 50 feet from a roof in Alabama where he was laying down shingles.
In 2021, Karla Campbell, a Nashville labor lawyer, helped a woman figure out how to transport the body of her 14-year-old grandson, who had been killed on a landscaping job, back to his village in Guatemala. It was the second child labor death she had handled that year.
"I've been working on these cases for 15 years, and the addition of children is new," Ms. Campbell said.
In dairy production, the injury rate is twice the national average across all industries. Paco Calvo arrived in Middlebury, Vt., when he was 14 and has been working 12-hour days on dairy farms in the four years since. He said he crushed his hand in an industrial milking machine in the first months of doing this work.
"Pretty much everyone gets hurt when they first start," he said.
Targeting the Middlemen
Charlene Irizarry, the human resources manager at Farm Fresh Foods, an Alabama meat plant that struggles to retain staff, recently realized she was interviewing a 12-year-old for a job slicing chicken breasts into nuggets in a section of the factory kept at 40 degrees.
Ms. Irizarry regularly sees job applicants who use heavy makeup or medical masks to try to hide their youth, she said. "Sometimes their legs don't touch the floor."
Other times, an adult will apply for a job in the morning, and then a child using the same name will show up for orientation that afternoon. She and her staff have begun separating other young applicants from the adults who bring them in, so they will admit their real ages.
Ms. Irizarry said the plant had already been fined for one child labor violation, and she was trying to avoid another. But she wondered what the children might face if she turned them away.
"I worry about why they're so desperate for these jobs," she said.
In interviews with underage migrant workers, The Times found child labor in the American supply chains of many major brands and retailers. Several, including Ford, General Motors, J. Crew and Walmart, as well as their suppliers, said they took the allegations seriously and would investigate. Target and Whole Foods did not respond to requests for comment. Fruit of the Loom said it had ended its contract with the supplier.
One company, Ben & Jerry's, said it worked with labor groups to ensure a minimum set of working conditions at its dairy suppliers. Cheryl Pinto, the company's head of values-led sourcing, said that if migrant children needed to work full time, it was preferable for them to have jobs at a well-monitored workplace.
The Labor Department is supposed to find and punish child labor violations, but inspectors in a dozen states said their understaffed offices could barely respond to complaints, much less open original investigations. When the department has responded to tips on migrant children, it has focused on the outside contractors and staffing agencies that usually employ them, not the corporations where they perform the work.
In Worthington, Minn., it had long been an open secret that migrant children released by H.H.S. were cleaning a slaughterhouse run by JBS, the world's largest meat processor. The town has received more unaccompanied migrant children per capita than almost anywhere in the country.
Outside the JBS pork plant last fall, The Times spoke with baby-faced workers who chased and teased one another as they came off their shifts in the morning. Many had scratched their assumed names off company badges to hide evidence that they were working under false identities. Some said they had suffered chemical burns from the corrosive cleaners they used.
Not long afterward, labor inspectors responding to a tip found 22 Spanish-speaking children working for the company hired to clean the JBS plant in Worthington, and dozens more in the same job at meat-processing plants around the United States.
But the Labor Department can generally only issue fines. The cleaning company paid a $ 1.5 million penalty, while JBS said it had been unaware that children were scouring the Worthington factory each night. JBS fired the cleaning contractor.
Many of the children who were working there have found new jobs at other plants, The Times found.
"I still have to pay back my debt, so I still have to work," said Mauricio Ramirez, 17, who has found a meat processing job in the next town over.
'Not What I Imagined'
It has been a little more than a year since Carolina left Guatemala, and she has started to make some friends. She and another girl who works at Hearthside have necklaces that fit together, each strung with half a heart. When she has time, she posts selfies online decorated with smiley faces and flowers.
Mostly, though, she keeps to herself. Her teachers do not know many details about her journey to the border. When the topic came up at school recently, Carolina began sobbing and would not say why.
After a week of 17-hour days, she sat at home one night with her aunt and considered her life in the United States. The long nights. The stress about money. "I didn't have expectations about what life would be like here," she said, "but it's not what I imagined."
She was holding a debit card given to her by a staffing agency, which paid her Hearthside salary this way so she did not have to cash checks. Carolina turned it over and over in her palm as her aunt looked on.
"I know you get sad," Ms. Ramirez said.
Carolina looked down. She wanted to continue going to school to learn English, but she woke up most mornings with a clenched stomach and kept staying home sick. Some of her ninth grade classmates had already dropped out. The 16-year-old boy she sat next to in math class, Cristian Lopez, had left school to work overtime at Hearthside.
Cristian lived a few minutes away, in a bare two-room apartment he shared with his uncle and 12-year-old sister, Jennifer.
His sister did not go to school either, and they had spent the day bickering in their room. Now night had fallen and they were eating Froot Loops for dinner. The heat was off, so they wore winter jackets. In an interview from Guatemala, their mother, Isabel Lopez, cried as she explained that she had tried to join her children in the United States last year but was turned back at the border.
Cristian had given his uncle some of the money he earned making Chewy bars, but his uncle believed it was not enough. He had said he would like Jennifer to start working at the factory as well, and offered to take her to apply himself.
Cristian said he had recently called the H.H.S. hotline. He hoped the government would send someone to check on him and his sister, but he had not heard back. He did not think he would call again.

The Freshly Unemployed, Sent Reeling, Land on TikTok: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some workers are using the platform to share stories about job cuts, give advice and search for new roles.
Bailey Harris, 25, worked as a recruiter for a big tech company for more than a year and a half before she was laid off in January. After the initial shock wore off, she decided to tell her story three days later on TikTok. "I was never really worried about layoffs," she said in the video, which she recorded from a car. "I just didn't see this coming," she added.
It was only the second TikTok video Ms. Harris had ever made, but within a day it had more than 100,000 views. That number has since quadrupled.
She continued to post about being newly unemployed. In one, she shared how she was saving money. In another, she told her viewers about a new side hustle helping a friend flip real estate. (These videos performed much better than the others she later posted, which focused on topics like dating, fitness and nutrition.)
"I was like, 'This is relevant -- why not speak about it because I know a lot of people have been going through the same thing?"' she said. The videos, she continued, were "getting a lot of comments about how people like my attitude toward my situation."
As tech workers continue to get laid off across the country -- more than 50,000 employees were let go from Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft alone in the last few months -- some have turned to TikTok to share their experiences.
An emerging microgenre on the platform, layoff vlogs can be a source of validation and community, or a self-esteem boost, for young workers who have recently lost their jobs. In these videos, some creators vent about their former employers or expose perceived wrongdoings. Others have a more practical objective in mind: using the platform to find their next gig.
Mass layoffs by companies are hardly new, and neither is the idea that former employees will find an outlet to talk about what happened to them. When some nine million Americans lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis, workers might have called each other, met up at a bar or posted on Facebook and Twitter.
And during the last major economic upheaval at the beginning of the pandemic -- over a single week in March, more than three million Americans became unemployed -- TikTok was another available avenue. But while some workers did use the platform for talking about layoffs, a majority of the videos didn't resonate as they do now.
"This is the first time employees can get laid off, and press record on their phone and have something go mega-mega-megaviral," said Gabrielle Judge, a content creator who helps women find jobs in tech. She noted that platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, where disgruntled employees might have gone in the past to vent, don't have the same viral potential as TikTok.
Calon DiPiero, 30, said that when she was laid off last month from an event planning job at Attentive Mobile, an S.M.S. marketing platform, she filmed a TikTok video to keep her situation in perspective. The caption read: "When you were laid off so you spent the last 48 hours crying in the same comfort hoodie but then you remember you're just unemployed not ugly." Posting the video helped her overcome the shame she felt when she was first let go, she said.
"Initially, if this happens, your ego gets bruised," Ms. DiPiero said. "But then if you can take a step back and say, OK, this is happening to a lot of people. It's not a personal vendetta against me."
Tech recruiters said TikTok could be helpful for networking and job hunting. Dozens of companies, including Target, Chipotle and Sweetgreen, have used the app for hiring.
"If you say in a video that you would love to connect with anyone who has a role for you, a lot of people will see it," said Jonathan Javier, the chief executive and founder of Wonsulting, which helps people, especially those who come from nontraditional backgrounds, find jobs in tech.
The trick, Mr. Javier said, is to strike the right tone: "If you are a prospective employer, seeing someone vent about a past employer can be a red flag. I encourage everyone to stay positive, to focus on the actions you are taking to find a new job."
Some people are heeding that advice. Ms. Harris, for example, opted not to say which company she worked for in her videos. "Obviously people can do their research and find out where I worked through LinkedIn," she said. "But I really wanted to stay positive and not name names."
Brit Levy, 35, who said she was laid off by Meta in November, used TikTok to talk about her frustrations with the severance agreement she said the company was offering, amassing almost 800,000 views. Dozens of former Meta employees reached out to her after the series of videos she posted, she said. "We are finding a little community with each other," said Ms. Levy, who lives in Oceanside, Calif.
She said she has also had hiring managers reach out to offer support and give her professional advice on the next steps she should take in her career.
TikTok creators who share details about the circumstances of their layoffs, however, can risk legal trouble, depending on which they talk about. "There are many companies that require you to sign documents to get your severance package," Mr. Javier said. "If they sign a form, there are legal implications."
Ms. Levy said she wasn't worried about the potential consequences of speaking publicly about a former employer.
"Honestly, they should be worried about ramifications from me," she said. "I now know how to get eyes on an issue I feel is super important."

Democrat To Exit Post Representing Rhode Island: [National Desk]

Author: Broadwater, Luke

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Rhode Island Democrat, who is in his seventh term, served as a manager in former President Donald J. Trump's second impeachment trial.
WASHINGTON -- Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and an impeachment manager in the second trial of former President Donald J. Trump, announced Tuesday that he would be leaving Congress in June.
Mr. Cicilline, 61, will become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the state's largest funder of nonprofit organizations.
In a statement, Mr. Cicilline called the job offer "unexpected" but one he felt he could not turn down.
"It is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state," he said. "The same energy and commitment I brought to elected office, I will now bring as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, advancing their mission to ensure all Rhode Islanders can achieve economic security; access quality, affordable health care; and attain the education and training that will set them on a path to prosperity."
In his seventh term in Congress, Mr. Cicilline is a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees. He is also a member of the Democratic leadership.
He will remain in office until June 1, and his staff will continue to assist constituents until a new member is elected to finish the remainder of the two-year term.
In 2019, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Cicilline worked to investigate Mr. Trump during House Democrats' first impeachment effort. He took on a larger role as an impeachment manager in Mr. Trump's second trial after a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021.
"Since his resounding defeat in the presidential election in November, Donald Trump has done everything but concede to the democratic will of the American people," Mr. Cicilline wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times published ahead of the impeachment trial.
He added: "We cannot let this go unanswered. With each day, Mr. Trump grows more and more desperate. We should not allow him to menace the security of our country for a second longer."
Mr. Cicilline also led a subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law. In his work on antitrust law, he oversaw what experts described as among the most serious congressional inquiries into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades, focusing on some of the country's most powerful tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook.
Before joining Congress, Mr. Cicilline worked as a public defender in Washington and served two terms as the mayor of Providence, R.I., where he was the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.
Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called Mr. Cicilline an "effective and thoughtful legislator" and a "close friend."
"David has been a leading advocate for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans in the fight for full equality under the law, and he has led House Democrats in our efforts to get weapons of war off of our streets to end the gun violence epidemic once and for all," he said. "He has been a dedicated defender of our democracy."
Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the progressive group Public Citizen, said in a statement that Mr. Cicilline "will leave behind a substantial and meaningful legacy in Congress -- from reinvigorating antitrust policy, to helping to lead the charge for progressive regulatory policy reform, to spearheading landmark anti-discrimination legislation for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community."
"He will be sorely missed," she added.

Wealthy 'Anti-Woke' Activist and Entrepreneur Joins the 2024 Presidential Race: [National Desk]

Full text: Vivek Ramaswamy, 37, has made a name for himself in right-wing circles by opposing corporate efforts to advance political, social and environmental causes.
Vivek Ramaswamy, a multimillionaire entrepreneur and author, entered the Republican presidential race on Tuesday with an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show and a video centered on opposition to social justice activism.
Mr. Ramaswamy, 37, is a former biotechnology executive and hedge fund partner who has made a name for himself in right-wing circles by opposing corporate efforts to advance political, social and environmental causes. He has particularly denounced environmental, social and governance investing, or E.S.G., a framework under which financial companies consider the long-term societal effects of their investment decisions.
His announcement video signaled that he would focus his campaign on the notion that conservatives are being culturally victimized by a social and political focus on the effects of racism and other forms of bigotry.
"We're in the middle of a national identity crisis," the three-and-a-half-minute video begins. "Faith, patriotism and hard work have disappeared, only to be replaced by new secular religions like Covidism, climatism and gender ideology."
His use of the word "religions" was intentional: He wants to cast diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or D.E.I., as religions, which would prevent companies from forcing employees to abide by them.
If elected, Mr. Ramaswamy said in an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, his first action would be to repeal Executive Order 11246, which has banned discrimination and required affirmative action for federal contractors since 1965.
In the interview, Mr. Ramaswamy defined "Covidism" as a "stop-it-at-all-costs mentality" against the pandemic -- even though state and federal officials are not promoting such an approach, and Mr. Ramaswamy acknowledged that "that ship has mostly passed."
He similarly described "climatism" as "prioritizing the goal of containing climate change at all costs," and suggested that fossil fuel and nuclear-powered advances could be used to adapt to and overcome climate change. (Climate scientists are clear that avoiding the worst effects of climate change requires moving away from fossil fuels.)
And gender ideology -- a term many on the right use to disparage public acceptance of transgender people -- he described as seeking purpose and fulfillment in "artificial sources of identity or skin-deep sources" instead of "the household, the family, the state, the nation, a god." Earlier in the interview, he had put "transgenderism" on his list of "secular religions," suggesting that being transgender was a problem; when asked what he meant, he said he had misspoken and should have said "gender ideology."
He also called for "making political expression a civil right" -- meaning it would be illegal for private companies to discriminate against anyone based on their political views. (The First Amendment protects only against government intervention.)
Mr. Ramaswamy's self-described "anti-woke" message -- he wrote the book "Woke, Inc." -- is common among Republicans, who have cast coronavirus mitigation measures like mask and vaccine mandates as tyranny; pursued hundreds of restrictions on transgender people's medical care, sports participation, bathroom use and more; and accused social media companies like Twitter and Facebook of suppressing conservative voices.
He said what distinguished him from the other Republicans who are running, or are likely to run, was "a vision of national identity that dilutes these other agendas to irrelevance."

Justices Seem To Favor Shield For Tech Giants: [National Desk]

Full text: The case, concerning a law that gives websites immunity for suits based on their users' posts, has the potential to alter the very structure of the internet.
WASHINGTON -- In a case with the potential to alter the very structure of the internet, the Supreme Court did not appear ready on Tuesday to limit a law that protects social media platforms from lawsuits over their users' posts.
In the course of a sprawling argument lasting almost three hours, the justices seemed to view the positions taken by the two sides as too extreme, giving them a choice between exposing search engines and Twitter shares to liability on the one hand and protecting algorithms that promote pro-ISIS content on the other.
At the same time, they expressed doubts about their own competence to find a middle ground.
"You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet," Justice Elena Kagan said of the Supreme Court, to laughter.
Others had practical concerns. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, echoing comments made in briefs, worried that a decision imposing limits on the shield "would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you."
Drawing lines in this area, he said, was a job for Congress. "We are not equipped to account for that," he said.
The federal law at issue in the case, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shields online platforms from lawsuits over what their users post and the platforms' decisions to take content down. Limiting the sweep of the law could expose the platforms to lawsuits claiming they had steered people to posts and videos that promote extremism, advocate violence, harm reputations and cause emotional distress.
The case comes as developments in cutting-edge artificial intelligence products raise profound new questions about whether old laws -- Section 230 was enacted in 1996 -- can keep up with rapidly changing technology.
"This was a pre-algorithm statute," Justice Kagan said, adding that it provided scant guidance "in a post-algorithm world." Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, meanwhile, marveled at advances in A.I. "Artificial intelligence generates poetry," he said. "It generates polemics."
The case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old college student who was killed in a restaurant in Paris during the terrorist attacks in November 2015, which also targeted the Bataclan concert hall. Eric Schnapper, a lawyer for the family, argued that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, bore responsibility because it had used algorithms to push Islamic State videos to interested viewers, using information that the company had collected about them.
"We're focusing on the recommendation function," Mr. Schnapper said.
But Justice Clarence Thomas said that recommendations were vital to making internet platforms useful. "If you're interested in cooking," he said, "you don't want thumbnails on light jazz." He later added, "I see these as suggestions and not really recommendations because they don't really comment on them."
Mr. Schnapper said YouTube should be liable for its algorithm, which he said systematically recommended videos inciting violence and supporting terrorism. The algorithm, he said, was YouTube's speech and distinct from what users had posted.
Justice Kagan pressed Mr. Schnapper on the limits of his argument. Did he also take issue with the algorithms Facebook and Twitter use to generate people's feeds? Or with search engines?
Mr. Schnapper said all of those could lose protection under some circumstances, a response that seemed to surprise Justice Kagan.
"I can imagine a world where you're right that none of this stuff gets protection," she said. "And, you know, every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we're a court. We really don't know about these things."
Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about whether Twitter users could be sued for retweeting ISIS videos. Mr. Schnapper said the law at issue in the case might allow such a suit. "That's content you've created," he said.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he was lost. "I don't know where you're drawing the line," he told Mr. Schnapper. "That's the problem."
Mr. Schnapper tried to clarify his position and in doing so revealed its breadth. "What we're saying is that insofar as they were encouraging people to go look at things," he said, "that's what's outside the protection of the statute."
Section 230 was enacted in the infancy of the internet. It was a reaction to a decision holding an online message board liable for what a user had posted because the service had engaged in some content moderation.
The provision said, "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."
The provision helped enable the rise of social networks like Facebook and Twitter by ensuring that the sites did not assume legal liability for every post.
Malcolm L. Stewart, a lawyer for the Biden administration, largely argued in support of the family's position in the case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333. He said that successful lawsuits based on recommendations would be rare but that the immunity provided by Section 230 was generally unavailable.
Justice Kagan acknowledged that many suits would fail for reasons unrelated to Section 230. "But still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits," she said. Justice Kavanaugh echoed the point.
Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for Google, said the provision gave the company complete protection from suits like the one brought by Ms. Gonzalez's family. YouTube's algorithms are a form of editorial curation, she said. Without the ability to provide content of interest to users, she said, the internet would be a useless jumble.
"All publishing requires organization," she said.
She added: "Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an existential necessity on the internet. Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what's known about users. So does Amazon, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media and dating websites. Exposing websites to liability for implicitly recommending third-party context defies the text and threatens today's internet."
A ruling against Google, she said, would either force sites to take down any content that was remotely problematic or to allow all content no matter how vile. "You have 'The Truman Show' versus a horror show," she said.
Justice Kagan asked Ms. Blatt if Section 230 would protect "a pro-ISIS" algorithm or one that promoted defamatory speech. Ms. Blatt said yes.
Section 230 has faced criticism across the political spectrum. Many liberals say it has shielded tech platforms from responsibility for disinformation, hate speech and violent content. Some conservatives say the provision has allowed the platforms to grow so powerful that they can effectively exclude voices on the right from the national conversation.
The justices will hear arguments in a related case on Wednesday, also arising from a terrorist attack. That case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, was brought by the family of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2017.
The question in that case is whether Twitter, Facebook and Google may be sued under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990, on the theory that they abetted terrorism by permitting the Islamic State to use their platforms. If the justices were to say no, the case against Google argued on Tuesday could be moot.
Whatever happens in the cases argued this week, both involving the interpretation of statutes, the court is very likely to agree to consider a looming First Amendment question arising from laws enacted in Florida and Texas: May states prevent large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express?

Full text: The aesthetics are familiar, but the menus go beyond your standard egg plate.
It's no secret that New York City is running low on old-school diners; they were vanishing even before the pandemic. From 2014 to early 2019, 15 diners were sold, a figure that didn't include the many owners who lost their leases during that period. These closures signal, to some, the end of old New York as we knew it.
But that hasn't stopped a new breed of diner from cropping up, ostensibly for the younger set and usually with decent branding and a social media presence.
Diner Aesthetics With Modern Menus
On a recent evening at Golden Diner in the Two Bridges neighborhood of Manhattan, I followed a chile crisp-spiked vegan wedge salad with two massive pancakes and a chicken katsu club. The bill didn't exactly come out to Waffle House prices, but the energy was similar: simple, uncomplicated, tasty. You can't beat pancakes after dark.
When Golden Diner arrived in 2019, it showed that the diner, is still a form that can be made over and made over well. The chef Sam Yoo did so by bringing his professional chef bona fides and his Asian roots to diner staples.
Baby Blues Luncheonette, in East Williamsburg in Brooklyn, on the other hand, is a Greek diner for the 21st century. (For a decidedly 20th century Greek diner, try Tina's Place at Wilson and Flushing Avenues in Bushwick, Brooklyn.) There's the H.L.T. with grilled halloumi, lettuce and heirloom tomatoes on Pullman bread, with the option to add bacon and avocado. But I think the real play is to order the Plato plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, warm pita, half an avocado and grated halloumi. It'll cost you $ 20 before tax and tip -- not bad for an increasingly expensive corner of Brooklyn.
Out on Staten Island in Bulls Head, there's Sandwich and Pickle, which is more great-aunt's living room than linoleum fever dream (see: floral wallpaper and thrift-store décor). But the deli-as-diner ethos that runs deep throughout the menu has really piqued my interest, especially the pastrami and egg bagels and latkes Benedict. And any restaurant with park adjacency -- in this case, the downright bucolic Willowbrook Park -- deserves a visit. Think of the post-meal walks!
Safeguarding the Diners of Yore
There's also a movement of diner preservation. As I wrote while answering reader questions a few months back, restaurants like Kellogg's Diner in Williamsburg and S & P Lunch (formerly Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop) in the Flatiron district have persisted because new, younger owners stepped in to carry on their legacies. The 78-year-old Three Decker Diner at the corner of Manhattan and Norman Avenues in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is under new management after the previous owners decided to retire. As the Eater journalist Emma Orlow reported, the menu and the prices have remained largely the same, which is to say affordable, though the coffee is now of the third-wave variety.
And even though the year is still quite young, I'm not sure that any preservation project will be met with more enthusiasm than the new, "deluxe" Superiority Burger, which will occupy the East Village space that housed a diner, the Odessa Restaurant, for more than two decades. The food will be decidedly non-Ukrainian, and the restaurant is unlikely to be open for 24 hours as Odessa was. But from what's been shared on Instagram so far, the freshly repainted space looks largely the same, with wide booths and misaligned, newly de-gummed tables. And at least it's not becoming a bank, which we all know is the truest sign of the end.

WASHINGTON — Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., and an impeachment manager in the second trial of former President Donald Trump, announced Tuesday that he would be leaving Congress in June.
Cicilline, 61, will become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the state’s largest funder of nonprofit organizations.
In a statement, Cicilline called the job offer “unexpected” but one he felt he could not turn down.
“It is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state,” he said. “The same energy and commitment I brought to elected office, I will now bring as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, advancing their mission to ensure all Rhode Islanders can achieve economic security; access quality, affordable health care; and attain the education and training that will set them on a path to prosperity.”
In his seventh term in Congress, Cicilline is a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees. He is also a member of the Democratic leadership.
He will remain in office until June 1, and his staff will continue to assist constituents until a new member is elected to finish the remainder of the two-year term.
In 2019, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, Cicilline worked to investigate Trump during House Democrats’ first impeachment effort. He took on a larger role as an impeachment manager in Trump’s second trial after a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021.
“Since his resounding defeat in the presidential election in November, Trump has done everything but concede to the democratic will of the American people,” Cicilline wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times published before the impeachment trial.
He added: “We cannot let this go unanswered. With each day, Mr. Trump grows more and more desperate. We should not allow him to menace the security of our country for a second longer.”
Cicilline also led a subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law. In his work on antitrust law, he oversaw what experts described as among the most serious congressional inquiries into potential anti-competitive corporate behavior in decades, focusing on some of the country’s most powerful tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook.
Before joining Congress, Cicilline worked as a public defender in Washington and served two terms as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, where he was the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the minority leader, called Cicilline an “effective and thoughtful legislator” and a “close friend.”
“David has been a leading advocate for LGBTQ Americans in the fight for full equality under the law, and he has led House Democrats in our efforts to get weapons of war off of our streets to end the gun violence epidemic once and for all,” he said. “He has been a dedicated defender of our democracy.”
Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the progressive group Public Citizen, said in a statement that Cicilline “will leave behind a substantial and meaningful legacy in Congress — from reinvigorating antitrust policy, to helping to lead the charge for progressive regulatory policy reform, to spearheading landmark anti-discrimination legislation for the LGBTQ+ community.”
“He will be sorely missed,” she added. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Supreme Court Frustrated and Wary Over Legal Shield for Tech Companies

WASHINGTON — In a case with the potential to alter the very structure of the internet, the Supreme Court did not appear ready Tuesday to limit a law that protects social media platforms from lawsuits over their users’ posts.
In the course of a sprawling argument lasting almost three hours, the justices seemed to view the positions taken by the two sides as too extreme, giving them a choice between exposing search engines and Twitter shares to liability on the one hand and protecting algorithms that promote pro-Islamic State group content on the other.
At the same time, they expressed doubts about their own competence to find a middle ground.
“You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet,” Justice Elena Kagan said of the Supreme Court, to laughter.
Others had practical concerns. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, echoing comments made in briefs, worried that a decision imposing limits on the shield “would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you.”
Drawing lines in this area, he said, was a job for Congress. “We are not equipped to account for that,” he said.
The federal law at issue in the case, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shields online platforms from lawsuits over what their users post and the platforms’ decisions to take content down. Limiting the sweep of the law could expose the platforms to lawsuits claiming they had steered people to posts and videos that promote extremism, advocate violence, harm reputations and cause emotional distress.
The case comes as developments in cutting-edge artificial intelligence products raise profound new questions about whether old laws — Section 230 was enacted in 1996 — can keep up with rapidly changing technology.
“This was a pre-algorithm statute,” Kagan said, adding that it provided scant guidance “in a post-algorithm world.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, marveled at advances in AI. “Artificial intelligence generates poetry,” he said. “It generates polemics.”
The case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old college student who was killed in a restaurant in Paris during the terrorist attacks in November 2015, which also targeted the Bataclan concert hall. Eric Schnapper, a lawyer for the family, argued that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, bore responsibility because it had used algorithms to push Islamic State group videos to interested viewers, using information that the company had collected about them.
“We’re focusing on the recommendation function,” Schnapper said.
But Justice Clarence Thomas said that recommendations were vital to making internet platforms useful. “If you’re interested in cooking,” he said, “you don’t want thumbnails on light jazz.” He later added, “I see these as suggestions and not really recommendations because they don’t really comment on them.”
Schnapper said YouTube should be liable for its algorithm, which he said systematically recommended videos inciting violence and supporting terrorism. The algorithm, he said, was YouTube’s speech and distinct from what users had posted.
Kagan pressed Schnapper on the limits of his argument. Did he also take issue with the algorithms Facebook and Twitter use to generate people’s feeds? Or with search engines?
Schnapper said all of those could lose protection under some circumstances, a response that seemed to surprise Kagan.
“I can imagine a world where you’re right that none of this stuff gets protection,” she said. “And, you know, every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we’re a court. We really don’t know about these things.”
Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about whether Twitter users could be sued for retweeting ISIS videos, using an alternative name for the Islamic State group. Schnapper said the law at issue in the case might allow such a suit. “That’s content you’ve created,” he said.
Justice Samuel Alito said he was lost. “I don’t know where you’re drawing the line,” he told Schnapper. “That’s the problem.”
Schnapper tried to clarify his position and in doing so revealed its breadth. “What we’re saying is that insofar as they were encouraging people to go look at things,” he said, “that’s what’s outside the protection of the statute.”
Section 230 was enacted in the infancy of the internet. It was a reaction to a decision holding an online message board liable for what a user had posted because the service had engaged in some content moderation.
The provision said, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”
The provision helped enable the rise of social networks like Facebook and Twitter by ensuring that the sites did not assume legal liability for every post.
Malcolm L. Stewart, a lawyer for the Biden administration, largely argued in support of the family’s position in the case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333. He said that successful lawsuits based on recommendations would be rare but that the immunity provided by Section 230 was generally unavailable.
Kagan acknowledged that many suits would fail for reasons unrelated to Section 230. “But still, I mean, you are creating a world of lawsuits,” she said. Kavanaugh echoed the point.
Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for Google, said the provision gave the company complete protection from suits like the one brought by Gonzalez’s family. YouTube’s algorithms are a form of editorial curation, she said. Without the ability to provide content of interest to users, she said, the internet would be a useless jumble.
“All publishing requires organization,” she said.
She added: “Helping users find the proverbial needle in the haystack is an existential necessity on the internet. Search engines thus tailor what users see based on what’s known about users. So does Amazon, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, Yelp, Zillow, and countless video, music, news, job-finding, social media and dating websites. Exposing websites to liability for implicitly recommending third-party context defies the text and threatens today’s internet.”
A ruling against Google, she said, would either force sites to take down any content that was remotely problematic or to allow all content no matter how vile. “You have ‘The Truman Show’ versus a horror show,” she said.
Kagan asked Blatt if Section 230 would protect “a pro-ISIS” algorithm or one that promoted defamatory speech. Blatt said yes.
Section 230 has faced criticism across the political spectrum. Many liberals say it has shielded tech platforms from responsibility for disinformation, hate speech and violent content. Some conservatives say the provision has allowed the platforms to grow so powerful that they can effectively exclude voices on the right from the national conversation.
The justices will hear arguments in a related case Wednesday, also arising from a terrorist attack. That case, Twitter v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, was brought by the family of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in a terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2017.
The question in that case is whether Twitter, Facebook and Google may be sued under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990, on the theory that they abetted terrorism by permitting the Islamic State group to use their platforms. If the justices were to say no, the case against Google argued Tuesday could be moot.
Whatever happens in the cases argued this week, both involving the interpretation of statutes, the court is very likely to agree to consider a looming First Amendment question arising from laws enacted in Florida and Texas: May states prevent large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express?

Supreme Court Case to Focus On Law That Shields Big Tech: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The justices are set to hear a case challenging Section 230, a law that protects Google, Facebook and others from lawsuits over what their users post online.
Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old California college student, was studying abroad in Paris in November 2015 when she was among the 130 people killed in a coordinated series of terrorist attacks throughout the city.
The next year, her father sued Google and other tech companies. He accused the firms of spreading content that radicalized users into becoming terrorists, and said they were therefore legally responsible for the harm inflicted on Ms. Gonzalez's family. Her mother, stepfather and brothers eventually joined the lawsuit, too.
Their claims will be heard in the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday. And their lawsuit, with Google now the exclusive defendant, could have potentially seismic ramifications for the social media platforms that have become conduits of communication, commerce and culture for billions of people.
Their suit takes aim at a federal law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Google's YouTube from lawsuits over content posted by their users or their decisions to take content down. The case gives the Supreme Court's justices the opportunity to narrow how that legal shield is applied or to gut it entirely, potentially opening up the companies to liability for what users post and to lawsuits over libel, discriminatory advertising and extremist propaganda.
A day after hearing the Gonzalez v. Google case, the court is scheduled to hear a second tech lawsuit, Twitter v. Taamneh, over whether Twitter has contributed to terrorism.
What the Supreme Court ultimately decides on the cases will add to a pitched battle around the world over how to regulate online speech. Many governments say that social networks have become fertile ground for hate speech and misinformation. Some have required the platforms to take down those posts. But in the United States, the First Amendment makes it difficult for Congress to do the same.
Critics of Section 230 say that it lets the tech companies avoid responsibility for harms facilitated on their watch. But supporters counter that without the legal shield, the companies will take down more content than ever to avoid lawsuits, stifling free expression.
The Supreme Court case "can have an impact on how those companies do business and how we interact with the internet, too," said Hany Farid, a professor at the school of information at the University of California, Berkeley. He filed a brief with the Supreme Court supporting the Gonzalez family members who are suing Google.
Ms. Gonzalez, a first-generation college student who was studying design at California State University, Long Beach, was killed while out with friends during the Paris attacks in 2015. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility. She was the only American killed.
Her father, Reynaldo Gonzalez, sued Google, Facebook and Twitter in 2016, arguing the platforms were spreading extremist content. That included propaganda, messages from the Islamic State's leaders and videos of graphic violence, he said. Citing media reports, the lawsuit mentioned specific videos that showed footage of Islamic State fighters in the field and updates from a media outlet affiliated with the group. The online platforms didn't do enough to keep the terrorist group off their sites, the lawsuit said.
YouTube and other platforms say they screen for such videos and take down many of them. But in 2018, research that was based on a tool developed by Mr. Farid found that some Islamic State videos stayed up for hours, including one that encouraged violent attacks in Western nations.
Facebook and Twitter were removed as defendants in the lawsuit in 2017, the same year Ms. Gonzalez's mother, stepfather and siblings joined plaintiffs. Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Google did not have to face the Gonzalez family members' claims because the company was protected by Section 230.
In May, lawyers for Ms. Gonzalez's family asked the Supreme Court to step in. By using algorithms to recommend content to users, the lawyers argued, YouTube was essentially engaging in its own form of speech, which was not protected by Section 230.
Ms. Gonzalez's father and the plaintiffs in the Twitter case declined to comment through their lawyer, Keith Altman. Mr. Altman said that courts had "pushed the limits" of the Section 230 legal shield to the point that it was "unrecognizable." A lawyer for Ms. Gonzalez's other family members did not respond to a request for comment. The lawyer who will argue both cases before the Supreme Court, Eric Schnapper, also declined to comment.
Google has denied the Gonzalez family's arguments about Section 230. It has said that the family's claims that Google supported terrorism are based on "threadbare assertions" and "speculative" arguments.
In Congress, efforts to reform Section 230 have stalled. Republicans, spurred by accusations that internet companies are more likely to take down conservative posts, proposed tweaking the law. Democrats said the platforms should take more content down when it spreads misinformation or hate speech.
Instead, courts started exploring the limits to how the law should be applied.
In one case in 2021, a federal appeals court in California ruled that Snap, the parent of Snapchat, could not use Section 230 to dodge a lawsuit involving three people who died in a car crash after using a Snapchat filter that displayed a user's speed.
Last year, a federal judge in California said that Apple, Google and Meta, Facebook's parent, could not use the legal shield to avoid some claims from consumers who said they were harmed by casino apps. A federal judge in Oregon also ruled that the statute didn't shield Omegle, the chat site that connects users at random, from a lawsuit that said an 11-year-old girl met a predator through its service.
Tech companies say it will be devastating if the Supreme Court undercuts Section 230. Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google's general counsel, said in an interview in December that the protections had been "crucial to allowing not just Google but the internet to flourish in its infancy, to actually become a major part of the broader U.S. economy."
"It's critically important that it stands as it is," she said.
A spokesman for Meta pointed to a blog post where the company's top lawyer said the case "could make it much harder for millions of online companies like Meta to provide the type of services that people enjoy using every day."
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
Activists have raised concerns that changes to the law could cause the platforms to crack down on content posted by vulnerable people. In 2018, a new law ended the protections of Section 230 when platforms knowingly facilitated sex trafficking. The activists say that caused sites to take down content from adult sex workers and posts about L.G.B.T.Q. people.
The Gonzalez case has also attracted interest from the Justice Department. In a December brief, the agency told the Supreme Court it believed that Section 230 "does not bar claims based on YouTube's alleged targeted recommendations of ISIS content." The White House has said the legal shield should be removed.
Mr. Farid acknowledged it was possible the court could gut the Section 230 protections, leading to unintended consequences. But he noted that the social networks already comply with laws governing how they treat certain types of content, like German restrictions on digital hate speech. He said they could navigate narrow changes to the legal shield, too.
"The companies figured it out," he said.

Full text: A reader who overheard a neighbor shouting cruelties at her young son wonders whether, and how, to intervene.
I live in a small apartment building where you can easily hear what's going on in other people's apartments from the hallway. I was leaving recently and heard my neighbor yelling at her 8-year-old son about his homework. She was shouting things like "You're worthless!" and "You're an awful child!" I was heartbroken for the boy. If I had heard his mother abusing him physically, I would have called the police. But what should I do about verbal abuse behind closed doors? I know this neighbor pretty well. I see her in the hallway all the time; she's friendly and nice.
NEIGHBOR
The language you overheard was brutal. There's no doubt about that. Still, it's important to separate what we actually know here from what we don't. You heard only one part of one interaction between a mother and her child. What we don't know dwarfs that: What happened before and after the shouting? Was this an isolated incident, or is it a regular occurrence? Was the mother under tremendous stress that day?
I think it's helpful that you have a friendly relationship with your neighbor. Talk to her when you see her, or knock on her door if you hear raised voices again (if you feel comfortable doing so). Be compassionate; we've all done miserable things. Tell her you overheard a rough exchange with her son and let her know you're available if she wants to talk or if she needs someone to watch him for an hour so she can take a walk -- again, if you can manage that.
In the meantime, keep your eyes and ears open. This is a complicated situation: We know just enough to be worried, but not much more. If you want to discuss this episode further or talk through other options, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline. It can be a great resource.
The Limits of Bridal Prerogative
I am part of a longtime foursome of friends: my fiancé, two close friends of ours and me. For months, we have discussed having our wedding in the lovely backyard of one of the friends. We even asked him to officiate. Recently, this became a big problem for our other friend. She has had (unexpressed) romantic feelings for the wedding officiant for years and confronted him after he started seeing someone else. The conversation went poorly, and she has now decided she never wants to see him again. We asked her if she could put aside her feelings for the wedding, but she refused. What do we do now? Ask her to reconsider? It would mean so much to have both of them there.
BRIDE
Forgive the tautology, but our friends can do only what they can do. You have already asked your friend to set aside her distress for the sake of your wedding, and she has told you she can't do that now. From a distance, this may seem overdramatic, but we don't know what happened between your friends or how it makes her feel.
Respect her boundaries and proceed with your wedding. I understand this is not your preferred result, but sadly, brides do not have subpoena power. Try not to resent her, either. Years of friendship -- with more to come, I hope -- strike me as more valuable than being present on a single (big) day.
Not the Usual Lie About High Breeding
A guy I know -- a friend, I think -- often lies about where he got his dog. At the dog park, he claims frequently to strangers that he rescued it. But he told me he bought it from a breeder. He even gave me the breeder's contact information. Sometimes, I want to call him out when I hear him lying. It seems like he's virtue-signaling to people he doesn't even know. Would that be terrible?
FRIEND
Here's a distinction I would make between "a guy I know" and "a friend": I may have little compunction about calling out a guy I know publicly in a lie. (It might even be fun.) With a friend, though, I would be more interested in understanding why he was telling the lie. And I wouldn't want to embarrass him, either.
You're right: It is odd for him to be so concerned about his image with strangers, but I'm glad he was truthful with you. Have you considered asking him about this privately? If there's any chance that he's a friend of yours, I would go that route -- and then take it from there.
The Sweet Side of the Surveillance State
I happened to check my Ring camera and saw my neighbor walking up my driveway to fix the cover on my car. It had blown off in the wind. He was unaware that he was being watched. He was just being a good neighbor. Should I thank him for his good deed, or will it offend him that he was under surveillance?
M.
I don't think many people would be shocked to learn that neighbors use video technology as a security measure. And as you point out, being seen wasn't what motivated the nice guy next door. He was just being neighborly, and you witnessed him by chance. Thank him for his kindness!

Now Hiring: Savvy Interns Who Can Make TikTok Hits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: When Mary Clare Lacke, a 20-year-old student at the University of Missouri, interned at Claire's last summer, one of her tasks was to help the teen accessories company with its nascent TikTok account. It didn't take long for her to produce a hit -- though it wasn't one that the retailer saw coming.
In an 11-second video, Ms. Lacke riffed off a pranking trend inspired by Kris Jenner to promote a style of the retailer's earrings.
"My team was just like, 'We're not 100 percent sure what this is, but go for it,"' Ms. Lacke said. "And then it became the most successful video that the account has seen." The video generated 1.5 million views and 20,000 new followers for the company's TikTok account.
Now, Ms. Lacke is one of four new TikTok "college creators" working as interns for the brand during the school year, churning out fresh videos every week that they often star in themselves. Claire's is keen to hire even more student creators.
Making TikTok content for brands is the hot new gig. As the social media platform continues to explode in popularity, brands are hiring college students and other young people -- sometimes with pay and sometimes with college credits -- to help them navigate the app, which can confuse newcomers with its trending voice snippets and song clips, unique vernacular and endless videos. Job sites have recently been peppered with listings for "TikTok content creator interns," who are being asked to make and appear in videos promoting tropical ice cream, sunflower seeds, bubble tea, malls and more.
The hope is to connect with young people and even what some marketers call "Generation Zalpha" -- combining the generations born after the mid-90s with those born in 2010 and beyond -- and ultimately drive sales.
Whole Foods and the luggage company Travel Pro recently posted job ads for interns to help them build their presence on TikTok. A marketing agency in Dallas has been seeking a student to be its "chief TikTok officer" during the summer to help its clients with the app. And the Rosedale Center, a mall in Roseville, Minn., just hired two TikTok creator interns after successfully introducing the role last year.
Kristin Patrick, Claire's chief marketing officer, who popularized the term "Generation Zalpha" to describe the retailer's target audience, said the success of Ms. Lacke's video had prompted its creator program.
"It really helped us realize the importance of having college students engaged with the Claire's brand and sort of be the face of the brand, especially on TikTok," she said. "They're the ones really using the app every day and really understanding what resonates."
Marketers have long turned to young people to help them navigate new social platforms. But their efforts around TikTok are unique partly because interns are becoming the face of those brands. The companies are keen to figure out an app that has beaten Instagram and Snapchat to become the most frequently used social media channel by 12- to 17-year-olds, according to a Forrester Research survey last year. And in the past couple of years, some brands like Duolingo and Hasbro's Nerf have hired people in Generation Z as full-time employees to take charge of their TikTok accounts, but they are not the norm.
"If you think about the number of brands with a really strong TikTok presence, it's less than a handful, compared to brands with a strong Instagram presence, which is literally everyone," said Mae Karwowski, chief executive of the influencer firm Obviously. "Video is so much harder for brands to do, and then the direct face nature of TikTok doesn't fit into their current models."
"It makes a lot of sense to hire people that are young and get it," she added.
And the younger generation appears interested. Frutero, a tropical fruit ice cream brand founded in May 2020, said it had been inundated with more than 250 applications after advertising its TikTok creator internship. (Desired skills included "humor and meme-making abilities.") Although Frutero has only three full-time employees, it was considering hiring three or four interns to make TikTok videos based on so much interest in the job, said Vedant Saboo, a co-founder.
Ice cream consumers, Mr. Saboo said, are mostly children, Gen Z-ers and people over the age of 50. And even as the company's ads on Facebook and Instagram reached millennial and older consumers, he said, the brand hit a wall with younger people. Frutero raised enough money to hire a marketing agency, he continued, but, ultimately, he wasn't enthusiastic about "professional content creation."
"I don't know why, but it is just not the raw feel that is there on TikTok," Mr. Saboo, 31, said. "I have found that most of these agencies who employ millennials, they do not understand the rawness of TikTok as well as young people."
He added, "The best way to do it is just to hire college interns."
He was optimistic that an intern -- or interns -- could make compelling TikTok content to help Frutero promote its work with farmers in Colombia and popularize ideas like pairing its ice cream with churros. College students are also more likely to know what's popular and even achieve the holy grail of a viral trend, Mr. Saboo said, speaking admiringly about the moment last year when a pasta recipe was shared so widely on TikTok that it prompted feta cheese to temporarily sell out at some grocers.
"That's content which you do not see going on Facebook or Instagram," he said.
Another brand, Smackin' Sunflower Seeds, founded in 2019, has also looked for a TikTok intern to help expand its channel, which already has more than 160,000 followers. Its founders consider the position, which drew more than 100 applicants, as the addition of a "cast member," underscoring the visibility of interns in these positions.
"We view our TikTok channel as a TV show," said Cole Schaefer, a co-founder of the brand. Its account, he said, has attracted followers by sharing the founders' story of trying to build a snack brand for Genn Z-ers. "We wanted to bring in other characters and other personalities," he said.
Mr. Schaefer, 24, said that he was inspired by the bit characters that appeared in videos from the YouTube megastar Mr. Beast and Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur, and that the intern would play a similar role for him and his co-founder.
"They're going to show their face in the videos once in a while," Mr. Schaefer said, but mostly they will be capturing "what the brand is and produce content around that."
The Rosedale Center, the mall in Minnesota, recently received more than 50 applicants for its TikTok creator internship program, which has produced content showing students promoting Auntie Anne's pretzels and new stores. Few malls have seized on TikTok, so "it was a great way to set us apart and fish where the fish are," said Molly King, Rosedale's marketing manager.
Ms. King, 53, said that she believed people all of ages could make popular TikTok content, but that it was useful to work with students because the mall, which has about 5,700 followers on the app, was trying to attract Generation Z shoppers.
Last year, an intern's TikTok post about the mall's new Lululemon store showed how influential content on the app could be, after it attracted 100,000-plus views and drove crowds to the opening. "It was like, oh, my gosh, this really works," Ms. King said. It wasn't just younger people, she said, but "younger people and their mothers with the credit card."
Ms. Lacke, the student working with Claire's, said she understood why brands wanted college students to help with their TikTok posts, adding that young people tend to know what is funny and relevant on the app.
"It does have a very unique way of posting, and I could see how maybe it would be confusing to upper-level managers who may not be on TikTok," she said. "But for college students and Gen Z in general, it kind of comes naturally."

New Zealand Faces Painful Recovery After Storm: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Five people were dead and thousands were still unaccounted for after Cyclone Gabrielle lashed the North Island.
In Hawke's Bay, cows swam for their lives. In Northland, unremitting winds toppled electricity poles like matchsticks. And throughout New Zealand's sodden North Island, people who had lost homes and livelihoods looked anxiously ahead to a slow, painful and expensive cleanup.
As of Friday morning, at least six people had died and more than 3,500 were still unaccounted for days after Cyclone Gabrielle lashed the northern half of New Zealand, devastating vast swaths of land and displacing more than 10,000 people.
With communications still out in multiple New Zealand regions, the full extent of the damage from the storm -- the worst in the country's record -- was unknown. The possibility of more bad weather loomed; the national weather agency, MetService, was warning of severe thunderstorms with possible hail in the North Island later Thursday night.
At least one economist has estimated that the recovery will cost billions, and Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said New Zealand would accept international aid. "This is a traumatic event," Mr. Hipkins said at a news conference. "It's a very big challenge to restore infrastructure as fast as we can, but we have to acknowledge that we are in for a bumpy ride." Australia has offered to help.
On Tuesday, as the storm arrived, a national state of emergency was declared for only the third time in New Zealand's history. That allowed Mr. Hipkins's government to deploy more resources to move people out of harm's way or send clean water and other supplies, including helicopters, two large ships and a C-130 Hercules transport plane.
Hawke's Bay, on the east coast of the North Island -- a region known as the "fruit bowl" of New Zealand -- was among the areas hardest hit. Four of the five known deaths happened there; crops were ruined, and villages were covered in silt, according to reports in the local news media.
As floodwaters entered their homes, people fled to higher ground and evacuation centers in schools and marae, the meeting houses used by Maori, New Zealand's Indigenous people.
In Te Karaka, a small town near the east coast, 500 people were forced to evacuate early Tuesday morning. "Everything happened so quickly," one resident told a local TV station. "We all went up the hill, and then we just watched it unfold in front of us, and watched our town basically get downed."
The Gisborne Herald, a local newspaper with a circulation of about 10,000, said on Twitter that its editorial staff had been "without any communications" until early Wednesday afternoon, before satellite internet became available and they were able to put an edition together. Some 22,000 issues were hand-delivered to residents so they would be informed about dwindling water supplies, Gisborne's mayor, Rehette Stoltz, told Radio New Zealand.
Some New Zealanders took to social media to ask for updates from loved ones who had not been heard from. In one new Facebook group, which had thousands of new members, people shared updates and photographs, offered to do safety checks and volunteered spare bedrooms to those in need.
One viral video, posted to social media by a veterinarian clinic in Waipukurau, showed a herd of 23 cows swimming to safety across the Waipawa River after the floodwaters rose to the top of their necks. Kylie McIntyre, a dairy farmer, called to her cows from the riverbank: "Come on girls, come here."
At the northernmost tip of the country, known as Northland, large areas were still underwater, said Jason Smith, a farmer and the former mayor of Kaipara, a rural area of about 27,000 people.
"There is still standing water, acres and acres of standing water now, kind of three days later, and you go, 'Well, we've never had that before,"' he said. "The power poles and lines were basically ripped out of the ground by the force of the wind," disconnecting the region from the national grid, he added.
Farmers in the region have especially struggled. Without power, dairy farmers were taking turns with emergency generators to milk their cows and avoid an animal health crisis. In Dargaville, where roughly 95 percent of all kumara, a New Zealand yam that is a staple of many diets, is grown, the flooding will have wiped out most of the crop for the year, Mr. Smith said.
"We are facing potentially a yield of 5 percent of what it normally is," he added.
Mr. Hipkins said on Thursday that climate change would bring more such storms, and that New Zealand would have to ensure that its transportation, energy and communications systems were "as robust as possible."
"We are going to see more of these types of events, and making sure that we are prepared for them is going to require a significant amount of time, energy and investment," he said.
Earlier this week, in the first days of the storm, James Shaw, the co-leader of New Zealand's Green Party, furiously chided other lawmakers for years of inaction on climate change, the effects of which he said were now becoming clear. "We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding," he said. "We must act now."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dr. Mills will become the first woman to head New York University, one of the largest private universities in the country.
New York University announced Wednesday that its new president would be Linda G. Mills, a professor and administrator at the university for more than 20 years.
The selection of Dr. Mills, the first woman to head the institution, based in Manhattan and one of the country's largest private universities, follows the recent appointments of women to lead other top schools, like Columbia, Harvard, M.I.T., George Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania.
She will succeed Andrew Hamilton, who has said he will step down in June after eight years as president.
Dr. Mills, who is now a vice chancellor and senior vice provost at the university, is known in the academic world primarily for her scholarship in social work, notably research in the field of domestic partner abuse and treatment.
Her career has been remarkably broad, including a large portfolio at N.Y.U., where she seems to oversee a vast sphere of influence, with an array of leadership titles and roles.
She serves as executive director of the university's Center on Violence and Recovery, which conducts research on abuse and trauma. She is senior vice provost for the university's study-abroad and university life programs. She is a former associate vice chancellor for admissions and financial support for the university's branch in Abu Dhabi.
Dr. Mills is the director of N.Y.U.'s Production Lab, which fosters student filmmaking, and she has directed and produced a number of documentary films herself, including "Of Many," a collaboration with Chelsea Clinton documenting the friendship between N.Y.U.'s chaplains, Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna. Another film, "Auf Wiedersehen," explored her mother's forced exile from Europe during the Holocaust as a source of intergenerational trauma. The film's cast includes her husband, Peter Goodrich, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, as well as the couple's son, a 2019 N.Y.U. graduate.
In a video posted to N.Y.U.'s Facebook page, William R. Berkley, the chair of N.Y.U.'s board of trustees as well as the committee that selected Dr. Mills, said her career embodied a "real demonstration of the ability to multitask."
Dr. Mills's academic credentials include a Ph.D. from Brandeis and three other degrees, one of them in law, from public universities in California -- U.C. Irvine, U.C. Hastings School of Law and San Francisco State.
Before joining N.Y.U. in 1999, she was a professor at U.C.L.A.
The selection of Dr. Mills, 65, was announced Wednesday morning in a news release, which said she was chosen from among 100 candidates for the post.
"I love N.Y.U.," Dr. Mills was quoted as saying in the release. "I am filled with enthusiasm, emotion, and, most of all, gratitude." She said she wanted to step into the role with "fresh eyes," but did not lay out any specific plans for changes at the university.
She was scheduled to meet separately on Wednesday with groups of students, faculty and administrators.
Dr. Hamilton, who is remaining at N.Y.U. as a professor, was credited with slowing the growth of the university's tuition charges, and with increasing financial aid packages for students. Even so, attending N.Y.U. remains a financial struggle for many students.
Evan Chesler, a Manhattan lawyer who served on the presidential search committee, said Dr. Mills was chosen partly because the committee believed she could be a prolific fund-raiser, though that has not previously been one of her responsibilities.
"We're very tuition-dependent, at a time when many, many American families can't afford tuition for students," said Mr. Chesler, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He said that the university's endowment, relative to the number of students it enrolls, is "a fraction of what our peer schools have."
The university's total published costs for each undergraduate add up to nearly $ 90,000 a year, including tuition, housing, food and other expenses. About half of its students receive some type of financial aid toward those costs.
Among the challenges Dr. Mills must navigate as president will be the sometimes fraught relationship between its ever-expanding Manhattan campus and its neighbors in New York, as well as the geopolitical tensions and other issues affecting its operations in Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv and Shanghai.

In Fight Against Disinformation, The Front Line Is Being Thinned: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the companies have shed jobs recently, many teams assigned to combat false and misleading information have taken a hit.
SAN FRANCISCO -- YouTube, like other social media platforms, spent years expanding its efforts to tackle misinformation after the 2016 election. It hired policy experts and content moderators and invested in more technology to limit the reach of false narratives. Not anymore.
Last month, the company, owned by Google, quietly reduced its small team of policy experts in charge of handling misinformation, according to three people with knowledge of the decision. The cuts, part of the reduction of 12,000 employees by Google's parent company, Alphabet, left only one person in charge of misinformation policy worldwide, one of the people said.
The cuts reflect a trend across the industry that threatens to undo many of the safeguards that social media platforms put in place in recent years to ban or tamp down on disinformation -- like false claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russian war in Ukraine or the integrity of elections around the world. Twitter, under its new owner, Elon Musk, has slashed its staff, while Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has shifted its focus and resources to the immersive world of the metaverse.
Faced with economic headwinds and political and legal pressure, the social media giants have shown signs that fighting false information online is no longer as high a priority, raising fears among experts who track the issue that it will further erode trust online.
"I wouldn't say the war is over, but I think we've lost key battles," said Angelo Carusone, the president of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. After years of efforts, he described a mounting sense of fatigue in the struggle. "I do think we, as a society, have lost the appetite to keep battling. And that means we will lose the war."
The companies maintain that they remain diligent, but the efforts to combat false and misleading information online -- which arguably peaked during the Covid pandemic and the 2020 presidential election -- have waned at a time when the problem of misinformation remains as pernicious as ever with a proliferation of alternative sites competing for users.
Meta restored the accounts of former President Donald J. Trump on Facebook and Instagram on Thursday, barely two years after suspending him for inciting violence ahead of the storming of the Capitol. It did so even though his posts on his own platform, Truth Social, are rife with extremist content, like the conspiracy theories spread by the QAnon movement that Facebook has previously declared unacceptable. (Mr. Trump has not yet posted there.)
Mr. Musk has also invited Mr. Trump back to Twitter, one of the many steps he has taken to dismantle many of the platform's previous policies, boasting that he wanted to undo censorious decisions made by its previous owners. The team that oversaw trust and safety issues -- including misinformation -- was among those eliminated under Mr. Musk's leadership.
YouTube's staff reductions in January were not as drastic, but were significant for the small teams assigned to set and refine the platform's policies. YouTube fired two of its five misinformation experts, including the team's manager, leaving behind one person for political misinformation and two for medical misinformation, one of the people with knowledge of the decision said.
It also shed two of its five policy experts, called leads, who work on hate speech and harassment issues, the person said. These experts have played critical roles determining where YouTube's line between acceptable and unacceptable content should be and advised executives on difficult content decisions.
YouTube also made small reductions among teams that enforce its policies and its rapid response team, which is involved in addressing problematic content on the platform. Outside YouTube, Google's trust and safety department shed a team of program managers who assisted policy experts, according to a message about the decision reviewed by The New York Times.
Policy experts working on other issues like extremism, child safety and policies for new products were unaffected by the layoffs.
YouTube said that overall, the layoffs were consistent with the 6 percent job cuts across Alphabet.
"Responsibility remains our top priority," Elena Hernandez, a YouTube spokeswoman, said in a statement. "We'll continue to support the teams, machine learning and policies that protect the YouTube community, and pursue this work with the same focus and rigor moving forward."
Still, critics are concerned that social media companies have put the bottom line above the public good.
"Basically, trust and safety was the first thing to go," said Joel Finkelstein, co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks hate and extremism on social media. "The veneer of civility is expensive."
None of the companies say they are abandoning the fight against misinformation. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Meta, wrote after Mr. Trump's reinstatement on Facebook that it would continue to intervene "where there is a clear risk of real world harm."
"The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box," he wrote in a statement. "But that does not mean that there are no limits to what people can say on our platform."
Meta declined to comment further for this article.
Ms. Hernandez from YouTube said the company tries to show users information from trusted sources. YouTube said it had a dedicated team working on the midterms and removed more than 10,000 videos about the elections.
Researchers at Media Matters found several examples of Covid-19 misinformation being spread on YouTube Shorts, the platform's service for minute-long videos, in the past week. They also found an array of videos that espoused hateful, misogynistic and transphobic views. Some were from well-known creators, such as Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes. Other videos and accounts featured Andrew Tate and Sneako, who were both barred from YouTube last year after violating its content policies.
"YouTube and the other social media platforms are inconsistent in their enforcement of their policies," Kayla Gogarty, the deputy research director for Media Matters, said.
YouTube said it was always working to strike a balance between allowing free expression and protecting online and real-world communities from harm. Nicole Bell, a spokeswoman for the company, said YouTube had removed six videos flagged by Media Matters for violating its policies and had terminated a channel for uploading content from a barred creator. But most of the more than two dozen videos flagged by Media Matters did not break the platform's rules, she said.
Last year, the International Fact-Checking Network, representing more than 80 organizations, warned in a letter addressed to YouTube that the platform was "one of the major conduits of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide," and that it was not addressing the problem.
The consequences of easing up on the fight against misinformation have become clear on Twitter. A new report by two advocacy groups, the Network Contagion Research Institute and the Combat Antisemitism Movement, found a surge in antisemitic content as Mr. Musk took over.
It described an organized campaign by extremists who had previously been barred from the platform. One, Tim Goniet, who used the name Baked Alaska online, was recently convicted and sentenced to 60 days in prison for his part in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Tweeting this month, he pressed what he called a conspiracy theory: "twitter unbanned all of us cuz their engagement was tanking w/o us."
"It is true that the trust and safety efforts we have had to date have been really broken, but at least there were efforts," said Mr. Finkelstein, an author of the report. "And there was some baby in the bath water."
Despite Mr. Musk's avowal to foster unfettered speech on the platform, he has also moved to suspend accounts, like Kanye West's, after a series of antisemitic remarks.
Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at Free Press, an advocacy group for digital rights and accountability, said the experience at Twitter showed that moderating offensive content remained important for the viability of platforms, regardless of economic considerations.
"Content moderation is good for business, and it is good for democracy," she said. "Companies are failing to do that because they seem to think they don't have a big enough role to play, so they're turning their back on it."

After Teenager's Suicide, New Jersey Community Grapples With Bullying: [National Desk]

Full text: Amid grief and outrage over the death of Adriana Kuch, 14, students have mounted protests, and a schools superintendent has resigned.
Fourteen-year-old Adriana Kuch told her father that she could not bear the humiliation after she was attacked by another girl inside her New Jersey high school and a clip of the assault was posted to TikTok.
"She said, 'I don't want to be that girl who gets beat up on video and made fun of,"' Adriana's father, Michael Kuch, recalled his daughter saying as they sat in the kitchen of their home in Bayville.
"Can you imagine walking through the school with her face beat in?" he asked.
The day after the Feb. 1 assault, Adriana retreated to her room at about 10 p.m. and took her own life during the night, he said.
The attack, which her father has accused the school district of mishandling, and Adriana's suicide have reverberated through Ocean County communities near the Jersey Shore and across the state. Public grieving and outrage have led officials to grapple anew with the prevalence of bullying in schools, how it affects children and the response -- or lack of one -- by administrators.
In recent days, students have protested in front of Adriana's high school, the superintendent of the Central Regional School District has resigned and four girls have been criminally charged in connection with the assault.
"There is obviously a great deal of rightful anguish and emotion with Adriana's passing, from her family, friends and within our community at large," said Carmen Amato, the mayor of Berkeley Township, in an email.
School board members did not respond to requests for comment, and the voice mailbox at the superintendent's office was full. In a message on its website, the district said it had contacted the state Education Department and would undergo an independent assessment of its anti-bullying policies to ensure student safety. "We are all praying for the family and loved ones and our entire community," the message said.
It isn't clear what the motive was for the attack, which occurred on a Wednesday just before 11 a.m., but a video recording of the incident shows it apparently had been planned. In the video, Adriana, with long, light brown hair, walks down a school hallway along a bank of lockers, smiling and chatting with a male friend. Another girl comes up from behind and hits Adriana in the face with what appears to be a water bottle.
As Adriana falls to the ground, her friend pushes the attacker away. But another student seems to intervene to hold him back, and the girl continues to pummel Adriana until a staff member rushes over and stops the attack.
Mr. Kuch said Adriana, his youngest child, was part of a large, blended family they had formed when he married his wife, Sarah. He and others said that Adriana had been a happy teenager who loved animals, spent time with the younger triplets of a neighbor across the street and rescued one of them from a pool.
"My daughter is strong," he said. "She loved life. I can't believe they broke her."
Most children who are bullied do not take their own lives. And experts say the factors that lead to suicide are complicated and often cannot be traced to any single cause.
But there is a strong correlation between bullying and suicidal thoughts as well as attempts, several studies have shown.
"Bullying is a violent act, and the person who is bullied is victimized," said Dr. Jeanne Craft, the past president of New Jersey's chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "Some children have the resilience to respond to that with strength, and some need help. And if they don't get help, it can have devastating consequences, including suicide."
A study published in 2022 found that adolescents who experienced cyberbullying were more than four times as likely to report suicidal thoughts and attempts as those who did not. When the researchers adjusted for other factors such as family conflict, racial discrimination, parental monitoring and support at school, the association between cyberbullying and suicidal behavior was not as strong, but still remained significant.
"We need to help kids be able to process and share with others that they are going through that experience," said Michael A. Lindsey, dean of the New York University Silver School of Social Work, who studies child and adolescent mental health. "It can really render someone incredibly vulnerable to self-harm."
According to new data released on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly three in five teenage girls felt persistent sadness in 2021, double the rate of boys, and one in three girls seriously considered attempting suicide. The rates of sadness were the highest reported in a decade.
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults in the United States.
On Monday, two top officials in the administration of Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said in a statement that they remained committed, amid a rise in suicides among 10- to 24-year-olds documented by the C.D.C. from 2018 to 2021, to providing the resources needed to support young people and prevent further loss of life.
Placing more behavioral health professionals in schools, providing adolescents with strategies to cope with relationship challenges, monitoring time spent on social media and teaching children to recognize symptoms of suicidal behavior in themselves and others can help them thrive, the experts said.
In Bayville and the surrounding Jersey Shore communities to the west of Barnegat Bay, Adriana's death has opened the wounds of past bullying incidents and revealed what some parents say is a culture of tolerance among school officials.
In a Facebook post last week, another parent, Racheal O'Dea, said her daughter had been attacked by other girls a year ago at the same high school that Adriana attended, and a video of that incident was posted online by one of the attackers. Even though her daughter reported earlier threats to administrators, Ms. O'Dea said on Facebook and in a lawsuit now pending in state court, they took no action.
"The only thing Central Regional does is label these events as 'hallway disturbances' and give everyone suspensions, so it does not reach the threshold of needing to involve the police and reports aren't made," Ms. O'Dea wrote.
The school district has denied the O'Dea family's complaints of negligence, infliction of emotional distress and other harm.
Mr. Kuch said he is exploring a lawsuit as well. After the attack, he said, the school had not been forthcoming.
"They told me nothing, and then they said they will handle the investigation internally," Mr. Kuch said. "It's not their policy to contact the police and file a report."
He said he took his daughter to the Berkeley Township Police on his own immediately after the attack.
Police referred questions to the Ocean County prosecutor, Bradley Billhimer, who said that the school had told an officer stationed there about the attack and that police had opened an investigation after Mr. Kuch's visit.
In the week that followed, the district superintendent, Triantafillos Parlapanides, angered community members with a series of comments widely perceived as insensitive. Outside a protest against bullying at Adriana's high school, he told News12 New Jersey that it was up to parents to press charges.
"We're not going to double whammy a kid where they're suspended and then police charges as well," Mr. Parlapanides said. He then sent home a letter saying that because the protest interfered with learning and created traffic, no more rallies would be permitted without approval.
And in emails cited in a Daily Mail article, the superintendent appeared to shift blame toward Adriana and her father. A day after the article appeared, he resigned. Mr. Parlapanides could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Billhimer, the Ocean County prosecutor, announced at the end of last week that four students had been charged as juveniles: one with aggravated assault, two with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one with harassment.
On TikTok, where the video of the attack first circulated, other teenagers have posted videos honoring Adriana to a new channel: @justice4age -- Justice for Adriana Kuch.

Cambodia's Leader Orders Closure of News Outlet, Building Power Before Vote: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The leader, Hun Sen, was not satisfied with an apology he received from the outlet after it wrote about his son, a lieutenant general.
Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia on Sunday ordered the shutdown of the Voice of Democracy, one of the country's last independent news outlets, intensifying a long-running crackdown on the news media and political opposition as he consolidates his grip on power.
Mr. Hun Sen said he was angry at a reference to his son and presumed heir, Lt. Gen. Hun Manet, by the outlet, and was not satisfied with the apology he received.
A leading Cambodian human rights organization, Licadho, noted the significance of the action, saying the news outlet, known as VOD, "has become one of the most important independent media outlets in the country in recent years, publishing in Khmer and English."
Voice of Democracy's radio arm was shut down in 2017, and it was one of dozens of frequencies taken off the air in a broad sweep before the country's 2018 elections. Since then it has published online and on Facebook, where it has 1.8 million followers.
In recent months, hundreds of opposition politicians and their supporters have been charged with crimes, imprisoned or forced into exile, in effect clearing the field for Mr. Hun Sen to remain in power. His party now holds all 125 seats in Parliament.
Among those imprisoned was Theary Seng, a Cambodian American lawyer and human rights activist who was sentenced to six years in prison in June and is serving her time in a prison in the remote province of Preah Vihear.
VOD has been an irritant to the prime minister with its aggressive reporting on social and political issues.
It has published dozens of articles documenting oppression in the lead-up to local elections in 2022 and more than 60 other pieces in an exposé about forced labor in cyber-scam operations.
"The shutdown of an independent media outlet is similar to the crackdown on journalists ahead of the last national election in 2018," Licadho said in the statement. A general election is scheduled for July.
In late 2017, the Cambodia Daily, a major English-language publication, was shuttered over an arbitrary tax bill. Among the three dozen reporters who now stand to lose their jobs at VOD were some who had worked at the Cambodia Daily.
VOD was founded in 2003 by the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization promoting and defending media freedom. In an idealistic mission statement, it envisioned "a Cambodian society where everybody is well-informed and empowered to strengthen democratic governance and respect human rights."
VOD is now run by the Cambodian Center for Independent Media, and the shutdown involved the revocation of the center's media license.
That action came after Mr. Hun Sen and his son took issue with a Feb. 9 VOD article, which included a comment from a government representative indicating that General Manet had signed an agreement providing financial assistance to Turkey following the Feb. 6 earthquake there.
Such an action apparently exceeded General Manet's mandate, and Mr. Hun Sen said a letter from the Center for Independent Media was inadequate because it did not include the word "apology." He then rejected a subsequent appeal that did use the word, saying the government "has to maintain its dignity."
Khieu Kanharith, the minister of information, said: "It is a lesson learned for other media institutions."
On Monday, access to VOD's websites appeared to have been blocked by internet and cellular service providers in Cambodia. The reporter who wrote the article that angered Mr. Hun Sen was harassed online, including with misogynistic attacks.
Two dozen media and human rights organizations, in Cambodia and abroad, issued a statement condemning the closing, saying it "signals a serious threat to all independent media and journalists in Cambodia."
The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, said he was alarmed by what appeared to be an arbitrary decision to shut down the news outlet.
"I call on the government of Cambodia to rescind this very troubling decision, to protect the civil and political rights of all, and to ensure an enabling environment for civil society, including independent media outlets," he said in a statement.
The United States Embassy issued a statement saying it was "deeply troubled" by the abrupt decision to revoke VOD's media license.
It emphasized the role a free and independent press plays in a functioning democracy. "For more than 20 years, VOD has provided objective, fact-based reporting on issues that serve the interests of the Cambodian people," the embassy said in the statement.

When Mary Clare Lacke, a 20-year-old student at the University of Missouri, interned at Claire’s in the summer, one of her tasks was to help the teen accessories company with its nascent TikTok account. It didn’t take long for her to produce a hit — though it wasn’t one that the retailer saw coming.
In an 11-second video, Lacke riffed off a pranking trend inspired by Kris Jenner to promote a style of the retailer’s earrings.
“My team was just like, ‘We’re not 100% sure what this is, but go for it,’” Lacke said. “And then it became the most successful video that the account has seen.” The video generated 1.5 million views and 20,000 new followers for the company’s TikTok account.
Now, Lacke is one of four new TikTok “college creators” working as interns for the brand during the school year, churning out fresh videos every week that they often star in themselves. Claire’s is keen to hire even more student creators.
Making TikTok content for brands is the hot new gig. As the social media platform continues to explode in popularity, brands are hiring college students and other young people — sometimes with pay and sometimes with college credits — to help them navigate the app, which can confuse newcomers with its trending voice snippets and song clips, unique vernacular and endless videos. Job sites have recently been peppered with listings for “TikTok content creator interns,” who are being asked to make and appear in videos promoting tropical ice cream, sunflower seeds, bubble tea, malls and more.
The hope is to connect with young people and even what some marketers call “Generation Zalpha” — combining the generations born after the mid-1990s with those born in 2010 and beyond — and ultimately drive sales.
Whole Foods and luggage company Travel Pro recently posted job ads for interns to help them build their presence on TikTok. A marketing agency in Dallas has been seeking a student to be its “chief TikTok officer” during the summer to help its clients with the app. And the Rosedale Center, a mall in Roseville, Minnesota, just hired two TikTok creator interns after successfully introducing the role last year.
Kristin Patrick, Claire’s chief marketing officer, who popularized the term “Generation Zalpha” to describe the retailer’s target audience, said the success of Lacke’s video prompted its creator program.
“It really helped us realize the importance of having college students engaged with the Claire’s brand and sort of be the face of the brand, especially on TikTok,” she said. “They’re the ones really using the app every day and really understanding what resonates.”
Marketers have long turned to young people to help them navigate new social platforms. But their efforts around TikTok are unique partly because interns are becoming the face of those brands. The companies are keen to figure out an app that beat Instagram and Snapchat to become the most frequently used social media channel by 12- to 17-year-olds, according to a Forrester Research survey last year. And in the past couple of years, some brands like Duolingo and Hasbro’s Nerf have hired people in Generation Z as full-time employees to take charge of their TikTok accounts, but they are not the norm.
“If you think about the number of brands with a really strong TikTok presence, it’s less than a handful, compared to brands with a strong Instagram presence, which is literally everyone,” said Mae Karwowski, CEO of influencer firm Obviously. “Video is so much harder for brands to do, and then the direct face nature of TikTok doesn’t fit into their current models.
“It makes a lot of sense to hire people that are young and get it,” she added.
And the younger generation appears interested. Frutero, a tropical fruit ice cream brand founded in May 2020, said it was inundated with more than 250 applications after advertising its TikTok creator internship. (Desired skills included “humor and meme-making abilities.”) Although Frutero has only three full-time employees, it was considering hiring three or four interns to make TikTok videos based on so much interest in the job, said Vedant Saboo, a co-founder.
Ice cream consumers, Saboo said, are mostly children, Gen Zers and people over the age of 50. And even as the company’s ads on Facebook and Instagram have reached millennial and older consumers, Saboo, 31, said the brand hit a wall with younger people. Frutero raised enough money to hire a marketing agency, he continued, but, ultimately, he wasn’t enthusiastic about “professional content creation.”
“I don’t know why, but it is just not the raw feel that is there on TikTok,” he said. “I have found that most of these agencies who employ millennials, they do not understand the rawness of TikTok as well as young people.”
He added, “The best way to do it is just to hire college interns.”
He was optimistic that an intern — or interns — could make compelling TikTok content to help Frutero promote its work with farmers in Colombia and popularize ideas like pairing its ice cream with churros. College student are also more likely to know what’s popular and even achieve the holy grail of a viral trend, Saboo said, speaking admiringly about the moment last year when a pasta recipe was shared so widely on TikTok that it prompted feta cheese to temporarily sell out at some grocers. “That’s content which you do not see going on Facebook or Instagram,” he said.
Another brand called Smackin’ Sunflower Seeds, founded in 2019, has also looked for a TikTok intern to help expand its channel, which already has more than 160,000 followers. Its founders consider the position, which drew more than 100 applicants, as the addition of a “cast member,” underscoring the visibility of interns in these positions.
“We view our TikTok channel as a TV show,” said Cole Schaefer, a co-founder of the brand. Its account, he said, has attracted followers by sharing the founders’ story of trying to build a snack brand for Gen Zers. “We wanted to bring in other characters and other personalities,” he said.
Schaefer, 24, said that he was inspired by the bit characters that appear in videos from YouTube megastar Mr. Beast and Gary Vaynerchuk, the entrepreneur, and that the intern would play a similar role for him and his co-founder. “They’re going to show their face in the videos once in a while,” Schaefer said, but mostly they will be capturing “what the brand is and produce content around that.”
The Rosedale Center, the mall in Minnesota, recently received more than 50 applicants for its TikTok creator internship program, which has produced content showing students promoting Auntie Anne’s pretzels and new stores. Few malls have seized on TikTok, so “it was a great way to set us apart and fish where the fish are,” said Molly King, Rosedale’s marketing manager.
King, 53, said she believed people all of ages could make popular TikTok content, but it was useful to work with students because the mall, which has about 5,700 followers on the app, is trying to attract Gen Z shoppers.
Last year, an intern’s TikTok post about the mall’s new Lululemon store showed how influential content on the app could be, after it attracted 100,000-plus views and drove crowds to the opening. “It was like, Oh, my gosh, this really works,” King said. It wasn’t just younger people, she said, but “younger people and their mothers with the credit card.”
Lacke, the student working with Claire’s, said that she understood why brands wanted college students to help with their TikTok posts, adding that young people tend to know what is funny and relevant on the app.
“It does have a very unique way of posting, and I could see how maybe it would be confusing to upper-level managers who may not be on TikTok,” she said. “But for college students and Gen Z in general, it kind of comes naturally.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Pills, Rants and Odd T-Shirts: Scrolling in an Era of Junk Ads: [National Desk]

Full text: Scrolling past ads has rarely been enjoyable. But in recent months, people say the experience seems so much worse.
Portia Kapraun has always seen unwelcome ads on Twitter, usually from major brands pitching her luxury jewelry or vehicles that she, as a librarian in Indiana, could not afford.
But the mix now is far more annoying: More ads for random gold investments, she said, and also a badly designed ad for what looked like a tabletop foosball set constructed with rubber bands and particle board, which promised its product would be the most fun family game she had ever played.
Ms. Kapraun was not interested. But she soon saw the ad again. And again. And again.
"I don't know who they think I am, but that did not look especially fun," she said of the foosball set. "These feel like bargain basement advertisers. It mostly seemed like things you would see if you were watching late-night television."
In a shaky advertising market in an uncertain economy, ads that few people want to see suddenly seem to be everywhere.
Recent ads on Twitter, as described by users, have made the platform feel like a tabloid magazine or the haunting ground of Ron Popeil, the inventor of wares people didn't know they needed including the Veg-O-Matic, the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator and the Inside-the-Shell Egg Scrambler. There were ads for T-shirts printed with a horse's head superimposed on a heartbeat line, served to someone who does not ride horses nor particularly like them. Also: fraudulent ads for discount drones, spots hawking crude gaming apps and promoted posts from people ranting about "puppet masters" and "the slave mind."
On Instagram, ads from Amazon promote unrecognizable contraptions from obscure merchants, echoing the shopping site Wish, which was notorious for bizarre ads. On YouTube, ads impersonate popular video creators to scam viewers, a phenomenon that has irked Elon Musk and that YouTube says it is addressing.
Advancements in digital advertising technology were meant to improve users' experience. People interested in shoes are intended to get ads for sneakers and loafers, and not repeated pitches for courses teaching seduction techniques. And the technology is supposed to filter out misleading or dangerous pitches.
But lately, on several platforms, the opposite seems to be happening for a variety of reasons, including a slowdown in the overall digital ad market. As numerous deep-pocketed marketers have pulled back, and the softer market has led several digital platforms to lower their ad pricing, opportunities have opened up for less exacting advertisers.
"Anytime you lower the barrier to entry, you're going to get lower-quality entrants," said Jessica Fong, an assistant marketing professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
In the past, buying a newspaper or television ad usually involved calling up a representative who would manually review and place the ad. Now, more than 90 percent of spending on digital display ads happens through automated software.
Social media offers many ad formats -- static text, videos, playable games, messaging, brand takeovers, custom filters -- and most are getting easier to buy. Many advertisers can now go online and set the budget for how much they are willing to bid through a platform's automated auction for a spot that reaches their target audience.
Evidence of a junk-ad epidemic is anecdotal; tech platforms rarely reveal data on who advertises with them and how often. Also, quality is in the eye of the beholder -- plenty of people willingly click on male enhancement ads, and ads are sometimes most successful when they are eye-catchingly terrible.
Social media platforms have said they have established rigorous advertising policies to safeguard standards and continue to attract first-rate ads from blue-chip companies.
But advertising experts agree that crummy ads -- some just irritating, others malicious -- appear to be proliferating. They point to a variety of potential causes: internal turmoil at tech companies, weak content moderation and higher-tier advertisers exploring alternatives. In addition, privacy changes by Apple and other tech companies have affected the availability of users' data and advertisers' ability to track it to better tailor their ads.
Then, there's the economy: A survey of 43 multinational companies representing more than $ 44 billion in advertising spending, conducted last fall by the World Federation of Advertisers, found that nearly 30 percent planned to shrink their marketing budgets this year. Clorox, which budgets hundreds of millions of dollars a year to advertising and promoting products like Burt's Bees lotions, Brita filters and Pine-Sol cleaners, said this month that it was beginning to streamline its marketing, which included cutting back on spending.
Digital ad spending, while still growing overall, "has decelerated precipitously," according to an analysis last month by the research firm Insider Intelligence.
Twitter seems to be faring the worst. The company has struggled to retain top-flight advertisers since Mr. Musk took over as owner in October, amid fears of a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation on the platform. Its 10 largest advertisers last year spent 55 percent less during Mr. Musk's tenure than they did a year earlier, with six of them spending nothing so far in 2023, according to estimates from the research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter has offered buy-one-get-one-free deals, discounts and bonus incentives to lure back advertisers, media buyers said.
But advertising troubles have hit the biggest publicly traded social networks, too. Snapchat's parent company last month posted its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and projected a sales drop for the current quarter. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said ad sales at YouTube slipped nearly 8 percent in the latest quarter.
Last year, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reported its first decline ever in quarterly revenue (it fell again last quarter). Ad prices on Facebook and Instagram fell 24 percent in the last quarter of 2022 from a year earlier, according to the investment bank Piper Sandler.
Shareholder pressure, stoked by years of big profits, continues to push those companies to generate revenue wherever possible -- including, experts said, through selling low-quality ads.
Corey Richardson, vice president at the multicultural ad agency Fluent360 in Chicago, said he was seeing more ads for items in which he had no interest -- Hawaiian shirts featuring "Star Wars" characters, a fountain shaped like hands folded in the prayer position, all mixed in with vaccine misinformation and the occasional video depicting violence.
"They're just taking whatever money comes -- beggars can't be choosers," Mr. Richardson said.
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment. YouTube said it invested "significantly" in ad quality and consumer experience.
Other factors are also contributing to lower ad quality, Mr. Richardson said. Social media advertising, once a niche art practiced by specialist agencies, is now easily available to anyone. Many of them are eschewing targeted ads -- placements intended to reach specific audiences, usually at a higher cost -- in favor of a cheaper spray-and-pray approach online, hoping to catch the attention of gullible or bored shoppers.
Major social media platforms are now "like the mall in your hometown that used to be the good mall," Mr. Richardson said: "But now there's no longer a Macy's there -- it's just a calendar store and a place selling beepers."
The ads are also increasingly inescapable. Twitter recently revoked free access for third-party services like Tweetbot and Twitterific, which helped many users avoid unwanted ads. A project that blocked YouTube ads was forced to shut down in March; months later, YouTube said it concluded a small experiment that tried to reduce ad breaks by moving more ads into fewer interruptions, sometimes showing viewers as many as 10 unskippable ads in a row. In the fall, a survey by Insider Intelligence found that 52 percent of Facebook users reported seeing more ads on the platform, compared with nearly half of YouTube and Instagram users.
Meta allows users to personalize their ad experience, changing their preferences when they see an ad they are uninterested in. The company has also said it does not approve ads about subjects like climate change that its fact-checking partners have categorized as false, and it takes down ads that violate its policies.
In the past year, researchers and journalists on Facebook have discovered ads for dangerous or illegal dietary supplements; dozens of since-removed ads showing photoshopped images of the Australian prime minister that linked to investment scams; and allegedly misleading advertising timed to the COP27 climate summit. After being contacted by The New York Times, Meta took down Instagram ads that ply cancer patients with polished pseudoscience promoting vague but expensive alternative treatments.
YouTube said it prohibited ads that impersonate businesses, swindle users or employ clickbait tactics. The company said it blocked or removed more than 3.4 billion ads and suspended more than 5.6 million advertiser accounts in 2021.
"Though there are always bad actors looking to bypass enforcement systems across all tech platforms, we remain vigilant in trying to identify and remove them as quickly as we can," YouTube said in a statement.
Beyond social platforms, bad ads appear elsewhere on the internet. But streaming services and news websites tend to have stricter advertising guidelines and more limited and expensive ad space, which makes ads easier to regulate. Some publishers, like Bloomberg Media, are starting to avoid third-party brokers and automated auctions of ad space, which deal with enormous volumes and are more likely to miss low-quality ads.
Social media is a far easier target for the small but motivated group of anti-vaccine advertisers studied by David A. Broniatowski, who helps run the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at the George Washington University. Their ads are designed to evade "very brittle" moderation algorithms by spacing out the letters of banned keywords or replacing them with emojis, he said.
"They will use whatever means necessary to get their message out there," he said. "Ads are simply one tool in their toolbox."

Cheating Her Siblings: [Style Desk]

Full text: While dividing up her late mother's belongings, a woman claimed an extremely valuable artwork for herself, purposely hiding its worth from her fellow heirs.
After my wife's mother died, we learned she had divided the value of her home and accounts equally among her three children. She made a few specific bequests of larger items. But for most of her stuff, she directed the kids to take turns choosing things for themselves. Unbeknown to any of them (including my mother-in-law, apparently), she owned an extremely valuable piece of art -- probably worth more than all the specific bequests combined. My wife didn't tell her siblings, though. She waited for her turn to choose an item, chose the picture and brought it home. I think this was terrible behavior, but my wife disagrees: She doesn't believe she had any duty to educate her siblings about the value of anything. What do you think?
HUSBAND
I agree with you. Technically, your wife didn't do anything wrong here. She played her hand in strict compliance with the rules her mother laid out. But it seems clear to me that she violated the spirit of the enterprise: to divide the estate as fairly as possible among the children.
Now, you don't mention the value of the art as a portion of the total estate, but if it's possibly worth more than all the specific bequests combined, it may represent a big piece of the pie. It would have been fairer for your wife to ask for the art in lieu of other money (if she wanted to own the piece) or to add it to the pool of assets that will be sold and whose proceeds will be divided equally among the siblings.
It's not too late to fix this problem. It would require only an appraisal and some accounting to correct the distributions. Encourage your wife to speak up, especially if the money would be material to her siblings. Rectifying this error would also be respectful of her late mother's wishes. If she continues to disagree, beware of ways in which her selfishness may affect your relationship.
My Ex Crossed a Line. Does His Daughter Need to Know?
A few years ago, I dated a man who lives in my neighborhood. After I broke things off, I would bump into him occasionally on my street. I got the impression he was there to bump into me. (It's not a through street.) Months later, when I was at home with my new partner, I caught him spying on us through a back window. I sent him a warning text that I would call the police if I ever saw him on my street again. That was 18 months ago, and I haven't seen him since. But I do see his adult daughter in the neighborhood. Should I tell her what her father did?
EX
Let's break this issue into two pieces. Stalking, which is what your ex seems to have done, is a criminal offense. If you are at all concerned about your safety -- even 18 months later -- call the police to report what happened. They can document the episode and deal with your ex directly.
But telling his daughter about his behavior doesn't protect you or anyone else. It would only shame your ex, and I don't see the benefit in that.
Sharing a Space, but Not a Circle
After a year of sharing a lease on an apartment, my roommate told me -- in the spirit of setting boundaries -- that she doesn't want me to be friends with any of her friends. The problem: Our worlds are already entwined. We met in college -- so, many of our friends are mutual. And my best friend at work is a close friend of hers. What should I do? (Note: We are coming to the end of our lease soon.)
ROOMMATE
Your roommate's inability to recognize the web of connectedness that exists between you already strikes me as oddly self-centered. Also, friends are not personal property. I would ignore her request, but give her space in the apartment, and don't crash her plans. It may also be wise to consider a new roommate (or another apartment) rather than renewing your lease together.
Your Permission to Party Is Not Required
A college friend throws a weekend-long pool party at his parents' house every year. He provides the food and drink, and before the event, sends a bill for the total costs divided by the number of guests -- usually around $ 40. I understood this when we were broke and in college, but we're in our 30s now. His party seems tacky to me. My idea of good hosting is to provide food and drink or to ask my guests to bring things to share. I refuse his invitation, but I feel guilty saying no every year. Should I sit him down and explain why I don't want to attend?
BUDDY
Do you honestly believe that other people are bound -- in any way -- by your idea of good hosting? Your friend hasn't asked for your opinion. If you are bothered by an adult throwing a crowd-funded pool party, I am just as struck by a judgy friend who thinks he's some kind of party czar.
Simply refuse the invitation politely. No need to give a reason or to feel guilty, either. One of the glories of this world is that personal tastes vary more widely than we could ever imagine.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

Full text: Chilling details emerged at an arraignment of Lindsay Clancy, accused of strangling her three children. Her lawyer argued she was mentally ill, but prosecutors outlined methodical planning leading to the deaths.
DUXBURY, Mass. -- Lindsay Clancy lay paralyzed in a hospital bed on Tuesday afternoon, occasionally blinking or shutting her eyes, unable to do anything but listen as lawyers told two narratives about how she had strangled her three children.
The prosecutor said it had been meticulously planned: She had concocted an errand that would keep her husband, Patrick, out of the house for about 25 minutes, just long enough so she could do it.
And she had then strangled each of her children with an exercise band, an act that would require holding each of them down for at least four minutes. Then she leapt from a second-story window, a fall that fractured her spine.
"The defendant stated that after he left the house that night, she killed the kids because she heard a voice, and had, quote unquote, a moment of psychosis," Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Sprague said during a virtual arraignment via Zoom.
"She heard a man's voice, telling her to kill the kids and kill herself because it was her last chance," Ms. Sprague said.
The defense lawyer told a different story. Since the birth of her youngest child, eight months ago, he said, Ms. Clancy had repeatedly sought help for postpartum depression, eventually being prescribed 13 psychiatric medications in a four-month period. But suicidal thoughts kept surfacing, culminating in a break on Jan. 24.
"This is not a situation, your honor, that was planned by any means," said Ms. Clancy's lawyer, Kevin Reddington. "This is a situation that clearly was a product of mental illness."
In the last two weeks, since Mr. Clancy arrived home to a horrific scene, this community has been trying to make sense of it. Ms. Clancy, 32, worked as a labor and delivery nurse. She was known as a generous friend and a doting mother. She had no criminal record, nor any reported history of abusing her children -- Cora, 5; Dawson, 3; and the baby, Callan.
Ms. Clancy has received a good deal of sympathy, much of it from women who have experienced postpartum depression and psychosis. Online supporters have adopted the hashtag LAOL, which stands for Lindsay's Army of Love. Mr. Clancy appealed to the public to "find it deep within yourselves to forgive Lindsay, as I have."
But Tuesday's arraignment made it clear how difficult it would be to untangle Ms. Clancy's mental state from her actions.
The Plymouth County district attorney, Tim Cruz, is prosecuting Ms. Clancy on charges of first-degree murder, which carries the state's maximum penalty, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, as well as three counts of strangulation and three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
Mr. Cruz, a rare Republican prosecutor in Massachusetts, is widely seen as uncompromising. He successfully pushed for two consecutive life sentences for Latarsha Sanders, who fatally stabbed her two sons in Brockton, Mass., despite her family's insistence that she was psychotic and delusional.
The extent of Ms. Clancy's mental illness is only gradually coming into view.
Prosecutors said on Tuesday that she had never reported psychosis to her husband and that a psychiatrist who evaluated her in December had concluded she was not suffering from postpartum depression. On Jan. 5, less than three weeks before the killings, she had been released from a five-day inpatient stay at McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, without any warning that she posed a danger to herself or others.
The case is unfolding at a moment of rising awareness of mental illness and failures in the mental health system.
"If I were the D.A., I would be reticent to charge this as murder -- it feels misaligned with our current understanding of mental health, and misaligned with the public reaction," said Daniel Medwed, a professor of criminal law at Northeastern University.
"Society," he added, "is way ahead of the law here."
More than two dozen countries have laws decreasing penalties and providing psychiatric care for mothers who kill children under the age of 1. In 2018, Illinois was the first U.S. state to pass a law making postpartum illness a mitigating factor in sentencing.
Ms. Clancy posted frequently on social media, leaving behind a trail of family snapshots and updates on her mental health. In one post, last fall, she described an adverse reaction to Zoloft, a commonly prescribed antidepressant, which she wrote had left her with such "extreme insomnia" and lack of appetite that she stopped taking it.
Over the four months preceding the killings, Mr. Reddington said, she had been prescribed 13 psychiatric medications, an assortment of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, mood stabilizers and Ambien, which is used as a sleep aid.
"This continued even up until the week before when her husband went to the doctor and asked her for help and said, 'Please, you're turning her into a zombie,"' he said at a hearing last week. At Tuesday's arraignment, he said she had been suffering from postpartum depression, "as well as a possibility of postpartum psychosis that is pretty much ignored."
Prosecutors, meanwhile, cast the killings as carefully planned.
Using data from Ms. Clancy's phone, Ms. Sprague described at length how Ms. Clancy had spent the afternoon of Jan. 24 -- making a snowman with her children and taking photos that she sent to her mother and husband. Then, at 4:13 p.m., she searched for a restaurant to order takeout, using Apple maps to calculate how long it would take to drive to the restaurant and back.
At 4:53, she texted Mr. Clancy, who was working from a home office in the basement, and asked him to pick up the food -- a Mediterranean power bowl for her, scallop and pork belly risotto for him. They had a 14-second call at 5:34 p.m., which Mr. Clancy described as unremarkable, though "she seemed like she was in the middle of something."
When Mr. Clancy returned to the house, shortly after 6 p.m., he was confused to find it quiet, Ms. Sprague said. Setting down the containers and climbing up to the second floor, he forced open the door of the master bedroom to discover blood on the floor and an open window.
He ran down to the back yard, where his wife was lying, with cuts on her wrists and neck, and asked her where their children were. A recording of a 911 call captured the audio as Mr. Clancy climbed down the stairs to the basement. "At one point, he calls out, 'Guys?"' Ms. Sprague said. "He can then be heard screaming in agony and shock as he found his children."
All three had exercise bands tied around their necks. Cora, 5, and Dawson, 3, were pronounced dead at the hospital. Callan died three days later.

Maternal infanticide frequently takes place in the context of postpartum psychosis, a syndrome that occurs in one or two births per thousand and is characterized by delusions and hallucinations that can come on suddenly.
Courts and juries have responded to these cases in disparate ways. The best known is that of Andrea Yates, a Texas woman who was charged with murder in 2001, after she drowned her five children in a bathtub. She later said she had been following the commands of Satan, who had told her it would save them from hell.
In Ms. Yates's first trial, in 2002, a jury found her guilty after just three and a half hours of deliberation. After that conviction was overturned, the jury in her second trial, in 2006, found her not guilty by reason of insanity.
It's not unusual for doctors and family members to miss signs of postpartum psychosis in high-functioning women, according to Teresa Twomey, a lawyer and author of "Understanding Postpartum Psychosis: A Temporary Madness."
Ms. Twomey, who said she had suffered a psychotic break after the birth of her daughter, remembered repeatedly calling her husband to warn him there were intruders in the house. He would drive home, reassure her there was no one in the house and leave again, figuring, as she put it, "maybe a squirrel got into the attic."
Eventually, she said, she began to vividly visualize acts of violence against her baby, and was so fearful of her own potential actions that she collected the knives and scissors in the house and stowed them in the back of the closet.
In the case of a patient like Ms. Clancy, Ms. Twomey said, "we make the assumption that she would know, and could self-report." But, she added, "if you're high-functioning, and you're paranoid, people are looking for reasons you wouldn't have this illness."
In a sermon last Sunday, the Rev. Robert Deehan, who had baptized the youngest of the Clancy children, asked parishioners to look more closely at their neighbors and family members, to consider, as he put it, "what burden the other person might be carrying."
It had been a difficult week. The morning after the killings, Father Deehan sat with Mr. Clancy for an hour, praying. Later, he visited Ms. Clancy in her hospital room while she was still unconscious and delivered the sacrament of anointing of the sick, which is sometimes known as last rites. On Friday, at a funeral Mass for the children, he read the eulogy Mr. Clancy had written for them.
"Poor Pat kind of went off by himself because he's still grieving, as you would imagine, and wanting to be apart and just alone, having some space," he said. "So we gave him that space."
In Duxbury, a seaside town settled in the 17th century, opinion was split, with some calling for draconian punishment and others, especially women, expressing sympathy.
"The first thing everybody did was look up her Facebook page, and on her Facebook page you can see literally how in love she was with her children," said Julie Catineau, a psychiatric nurse who hosts a podcast, "Psychology Unplugged."
"I believe in my heart that this woman was suffering," she said. "That woman was out of her mind suffering."
Ms. Clancy will remain in the hospital until she is cleared to be moved to a rehabilitation facility. A probable cause hearing in the case is set for May 2. Speaking to reporters last week, Mr. Reddington indicated that he planned to argue that she was not guilty by reason of insanity.
"The legal system is a heartless juggernaut that would not be affected by public opinion," he said. "They will proceed as they deem appropriate. I hope they will temper justice with mercy, as they say. If they don't, then it will be a trial."

Case Will Test Effort to Fight Disinformation: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The outcome of a case in federal court could help decide whether the First Amendment is a barrier to virtually any government efforts to stifle disinformation.
In July 2021, as Covid-19 cases began to surge again, the surgeon general warned that misinformation had led to "avoidable illnesses and death" and urged the nation's social media giants to do more to fight the sources of it.
"We're asking them to operate with greater transparency and accountability," the official, Dr. Vivek Murthy, said at the White House.
Facebook's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, responded days later, sounding aggrieved. "It's not great to be accused of killing people," Mr. Clegg testily wrote in a private text message to Dr. Murthy.
The platform nonetheless announced a series of new policies and took down 17 accounts linked to the "Disinformation Dozen," a disparate group of people who shared an estimated 65 percent of all anti-vaccination content online.
That exchange -- one of dozens between officials and executives at Facebook, Google, Twitter and other social media companies that have spilled into public -- is at the heart of a partisan legal battle that could disrupt the Biden administration's already struggling efforts to combat disinformation.
The attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, both Republicans, have sued the White House and dozens of officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, accusing them of forcing the platforms to stifle the voices of its political critics in violation of the constitutional guarantee of free speech.
The outcome could help decide whether the First Amendment has become, for better or worse, a barrier to virtually any government efforts to stifle a problem that, in the case of a pandemic, threatens public health and, in the case of the integrity of elections, even democracy itself.
Government officials have long urged social media companies to fight illegal or harmful content online, especially when it comes to terrorism or other criminal activity, like child sexual abuse or human trafficking.
The attorneys general, though, accuse the Biden administration of taking the effort too far. Their claims reflect a narrative that has taken root among conservatives that the nation's social media companies have joined with government officials to discriminate against them, despite evidence showing the contrary -- in Twitter's case, for example, from its own study in 2021 of how political accounts were promoted.
"When, in the public forum, there is speech they disagree with and does not align with their political narratives," Andrew Bailey, Missouri's new attorney general, said in an interview, referring to administration officials, "they then collude with and coerce Big Tech's social media to take that speech down."
The case, filed last year in U.S. District Court in Louisiana, has already succeeded in forcing the depositions of administration officials and the disclosure of scores of behind-the-scenes interactions with company executives. The administration's efforts, the plaintiffs say, amounted to "open and explicit censorship programs."
Yet the growing trail of internal communications suggests a more convoluted and tortured struggle between government officials frustrated by the spread of dangerous falsehoods and company officials who resented and often resisted government entreaties. When Mr. Clegg responded to Dr. Murthy about Facebook's efforts, he sounded defensive and also frustrated.
"I imagine you and your team are feeling a little aggrieved -- as is the FB team," he wrote after the company released a report challenging the administration's criticisms.
Paul M. Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business, who has studied the companies' content moderation policies, said there was "no systematic evidence any place of a broad methodical plot" between the government and the platforms to censor.
On the contrary, social media platforms often appear reluctant to block political content, especially from Republicans, even when it appears to violate their own policies of abusiveness.
"It's not that they're going after conservatives," Mr. Barrett said. "They're fearing conservative backlash."
A White House spokeswoman, Robyn M. Patterson, said in a written response that the administration remained focused on ensuring that Americans received "fact-based information" about Covid-19 and reiterated President Biden's call for Congress to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that broadly shields internet companies from liability for what users post on their sites.
"We have also never shied away from the view that social media platforms also have a role to play by enforcing their own policies to address misinformation and disinformation," she wrote.
Big Tech has now become a favorite Republican target of attack, especially after Facebook and Twitter closed numerous accounts linked to the violence on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6, 2021, including former President Donald J. Trump's. (The two services have reactivated Mr. Trump's accounts in recent months.)
Florida and Texas have since enacted laws that would bar platforms from removing content based on political points of view. Their leaders have portrayed themselves as defenders of free speech, even as they have moved in other cases to restrict public discussion in schools, for example, of critical race theory and L.G.B.T.Q. issues.
The new Republican majority in the House has also formed a select subcommittee to investigate what its chairman, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said recently were routine government violations of the First Amendment's protections of assembly, religion and speech.
Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, has sought to make a similar case with the release of internal messages detailing the debates that executives had before he took over last year.
The messages, called the "Twitter Files," have offered a selective and partly redacted view of the company's interaction with government and law enforcement officials to block or restrict prominent accounts. They included revelations about the internal debate at Twitter over blocking links to a New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the president's son, in 2020, during the previous presidential administration.
In a tweet, Mr. Musk said he had purchased "both a social media company and a crime scene."
The "Twitter Files" have a political and, perhaps for Mr. Musk, a commercial agenda. The lawsuit against the Biden administration unfolding in a small town in northern Louisiana could, if successful, have far greater legal consequences.
The case is being heard by Terry A. Doughty, the chief U.S. district judge in the Western District of Louisiana. The court, according to a report late last year by Bloomberg Law, has become a favored venue for conservative attorneys general challenging the Biden administration.
Judge Doughty, appointed by Mr. Trump in 2017, has previously blocked the Biden administration's national vaccination mandate for health care workers and overturned its ban on new federal leases for oil and gas drilling. In this case, he has granted the plaintiffs' request for extensive discovery even before considering their request for a preliminary injunction.
The lawsuit aims at only the government, not the technology companies themselves. It names dozens of officials in 11 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department, the F.B.I. and the Census Bureau.
Among those deposed was Dr. Fauci, who served for 38 years as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. In a full day of questioning in November, he repeatedly said he was not involved in any discussions to censor content online.
"I do not get involved in any way with social media," he said. "I don't have an account. I don't tweet, I don't Facebook, and I don't pay attention to that."
In addition to the States of Missouri and Louisiana, the plaintiffs include two prominent epidemiologists who questioned the government's handling of the pandemic, Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff; Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, a psychiatry professor dismissed by the University of California, Irvine, for refusing to have a Covid vaccination; Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation; and Jim Hoft, the founder of Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site that claims in its promotions that "for 15 years, we've been fighting Big Tech and Leftists who want to shut us down."
Jenin Younes, a lawyer with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, an organization representing the individual plaintiffs, said the government had sought to sidestep free-speech rights by forcing private companies to take action on discourse that is otherwise constitutionally protected.
"It can't use third parties to do what it can't do," she said in an interview in the organization's Washington office.
There is no question the Biden administration has used the bully pulpit on any number of issues, including urging Americans to get vaccinated and calling on the platforms to restrict accounts that sought to dissuade them.
The legal challenge for the plaintiffs is to show that the government used its legal or regulatory power to punish the companies when they did not comply, which they often did not.
"No, this isn't feasible/we don't do this," one Twitter executive wrote, according to one of the Twitter Files, after Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who led the House's Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the company to remove accounts posting information about committee staff members.
As evidence of pressure, the lawsuit cites instances when administration officials publicly suggested that the companies could face greater regulation. For example, they pointed to warnings that the government could revise the liability shield provided under Section 230.
The White House administration could not repeal the law on its own, however, and Congress has shown little appetite for revisiting the issue, despite calls by Mr. Biden and others for greater accountability of social media companies.
Many of the examples cited in the lawsuit also involved official actions taken during the Trump administration, including efforts to fight disinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election and by Mr. Biden's allies at a time when they did not hold power.
Mr. Bailey, the Missouri attorney general, said the social media platforms had become "open public forums" where virtually any debate should be able to thrive.
"We need more speech," he said. "We need free and open speech in those public forums," he said. "When you've got the government targeting specific political speech, to take it off that forum, that becomes the problem."

In addition to the states of Missouri and Louisiana, the plaintiffs include two prominent public health researchers who questioned of the government’s handling of the pandemic, Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff; Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, a psychiatry professor dismissed by the University of California, Irvine, for refusing to have a COVID vaccination; Jill Hines, a director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that has been accused of disinformation; and Jim Hoft, founder of Gateway Pundit, a right-wing news site that claims in its promotions that “for 15 years, we’ve been fighting Big Tech and Leftists who want to shut us down.”
Jenin Younes, a lawyer with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, an organization representing the individual plaintiffs, said the government had sought to sidestep free-speech rights by forcing private companies to take action on discourse that is otherwise constitutionally protected.
“It can’t use third parties to do what it can’t do,” she said in an interview in the organization’s Washington office.
There is no question the Biden administration has used the bully pulpit on any number of issues, including urging Americans to get vaccinated and calling on the platforms to restrict accounts that sought to dissuade them.
The legal challenge for the plaintiffs is to show that the government used its legal or regulatory power to punish the companies when they did not comply, which they often did not.
“No, this isn’t feasible/we don’t do this,” one Twitter executive wrote, according to one of the Twitter Files, after Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the House’s Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the company to remove accounts posting information about committee staff members.
As evidence of pressure, the lawsuit cites instances when administration officials publicly suggested that the companies could face greater regulation. For example, they pointed to warnings that the government could revise the liability shield provided under Section 230.
The White House administration could not repeal the law on its own, however, and Congress has shown little appetite for revisiting the issue, despite calls by Biden and others for greater accountability of social media companies.
Many of the examples cited in the lawsuit also involved official actions taken during the Trump administration, including efforts to fight disinformation before the 2020 presidential election and by Biden’s allies at a time when they did not hold power.
Bailey, the Missouri attorney general, said the social media platforms had become “open public forums” on which virtually any debate should be able to thrive.
“We need more speech,” he said. “We need free and open speech in those public forums,” he said. “When you’ve got the government targeting specific political speech, to take it off that forum, that becomes the problem.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In one video, a news anchor with perfectly combed dark hair and a stubbly beard outlined what he saw as the United States' shameful lack of action against gun violence.
In another video, a female news anchor heralded China's role in geopolitical relations at an international summit meeting.
But something was off. Their voices were stilted and failed to sync with the movement of their mouths. Their faces had a pixelated, video-game quality and their hair appeared unnaturally plastered to the head. The captions were filled with grammatical mistakes.
The two broadcasters, purportedly anchors for a news outlet called Wolf News, are not real people. They are computer-generated avatars created by artificial intelligence software. And late last year, videos of them were distributed by pro-China bot accounts on Facebook and Twitter, in the first known instance of "deepfake" video technology being used to create fictitious people as part of a state-aligned information campaign.
"This is the first time we've seen this in the wild," said Jack Stubbs, the vice president of intelligence at Graphika, a research firm that studies disinformation. Graphika discovered the pro-China campaign, which appeared intended to promote the interests of the Chinese Communist Party and undercut the United States for English-speaking viewers.
"Deepfake" technology, which has progressed steadily for nearly a decade, has the ability to create talking digital puppets. The A.I. software is sometimes used to distort public figures, like a video that circulated on social media last year falsely showing Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, announcing a surrender. But the software can also create characters out of whole cloth, going beyond traditional editing software and expensive special effects tools used by Hollywood, blurring the line between fact and fiction to an extraordinary degree.
With few laws to manage the spread of the technology, disinformation experts have long warned that deepfake videos could further sever people's ability to discern reality from forgeries online, potentially being misused to set off unrest or incept a political scandal. Those predictions have now become reality.
Although the use of deepfakes in the recently discovered pro-China disinformation campaign was ham-handed, it opens a new chapter in information warfare. In recent weeks, another video using similar A.I. technology was uncovered online, showing fictitious people who described themselves as Americans, promoting support for the government of Burkina Faso, which faces scrutiny for links to Russia.
A.I. software, which can easily be purchased online, can create "videos in a matter of minutes and subscriptions start at just a few dollars a month," Mr. Stubbs said. "That makes it easier to produce content at scale."
Graphika linked the two fake Wolf News presenters to technology made by Synthesia, an A.I. company based above a clothing shop in London's Oxford Circus.
The five-year-old start-up makes software for creating deepfake avatars. A customer simply needs to type up a script, which is then read by one of the digital actors made with Synthesia's tools.
A.I. avatars are "digital twins," Synthesia said, that are based on the appearances of hired actors and can be manipulated to speak in 120 languages and accents. It offers more than 85 characters to choose from with different genders, ages, ethnicities, voice tones and fashion choices.
One A.I. character, named George, looks like a veteran business executive with gray hair and wears a blue blazer and a collared shirt. Another, Helia, wears a hijab. Carlo, another avatar, has a hard hat. Samuel wears a white lab coat like the ones worn by doctors. (Customers can also use Synthesia to create their own avatars based on themselves or on others who have granted them permission.)
The company's software is mostly used by customers for human resources and training videos, where an unpolished production quality is sufficient. The software, which costs as little as $ 30 a month, produces videos in minutes that could otherwise take several days and would require hiring a video production crew and human actors.
The entire process is "as easy as writing an email," Synthesia said on its website.
How a character typically appears
Here are examples of an A.I.-generated character from Synthesia being used for a variety of marketing and similar campaigns.
Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia's co-founder and chief executive, said those who used its technology to create the avatars discovered by Graphika had violated its terms of service. Those terms state that the company's technology should not be used for "political, sexual, personal, criminal and discriminatory content." Mr. Riparbelli declined to share information about the people behind the Wolf News videos, but he said their accounts had been suspended.
Mr. Riparbelli added that Synthesia has a four-person team dedicated to preventing its deepfake technology from being used to create illicit content, but said misinformation and other material that did not include outright hate speech, slurs, explicit words and imagery could be hard to detect.
"It's very difficult to ascertain that this is misinformation," he said after being shown one of the Wolf News videos. He said he took "full responsibility for anything that happens on our platform," and called on policymakers to set clearer rules about how the A.I. tools could be used.
Identifying disinformation will become only more difficult, Mr. Riparbelli said. Eventually, he added, deepfake technology will become sophisticated enough to "build a Hollywood film on a laptop without the need for anything else."
Graphika linked Synthesia to the pro-China disinformation campaign by tracing the two Wolf News avatars to other innocuous training videos online featuring the same characters. On its website, Synthesia called the two avatars "Anna" and "Jason."
How the same A.I.-generated avatar appeared in marketing and disinformation campaigns.
The avatars are reading a script that has been typed into Synthesia's software. With the characters' pixelated faces and robotic voices, it does not take long to notice something is off.
"Jason"
"Anna"
In the video supporting Burkina Faso's new government, Anna also made an appearance. "Let us all remain mobilized behind the Burkinabe people in this common struggle." she said in a robotic monotone. "Homeland or death, we shall overcome."
Deepfake videos have proliferated for years. Kendrick Lamar used the technology in a music video last year to morph into Kanye West, Will Smith and Kobe Bryant. Pornography websites have faced criticism for showcasing videos in which the technology had been used to illicitly copy the likenesses of famous actresses.
In China, A.I. companies have been developing deepfake tools for more than five years. In a 2017 publicity stunt at a conference, the Chinese firm iFlytek made deepfake video of the U.S. president at the time, Donald J. Trump, speaking in Mandarin. IFlytek has since been added to a U.S. blacklist that limits the sale of American-made technology for national security reasons.
Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it had deleted at least one account affiliated with the pro-China deepfake videos after being contacted by The New York Times. The company, which declined further comment, does not allow video and other media that is manipulated with the intent to mislead. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.
Graphika said it discovered the deepfake videos while following social media accounts linked to a pro-China misinformation campaign known as "spamouflage." In these campaigns, political spam accounts plant content online and then use other accounts that are part of a network to amplify the material across platforms.
Researchers said the use of deepfake technology was more notable than the actual impact of the videos, which were not seen by many people. The two videos featuring the so-called Wolf News anchors were posted at least five times between Nov. 22 and Nov. 30 by five accounts, according to Graphika. The posts were then re-shared by at least two more accounts, which appeared to be part of a pro-China network.
Mr. Stubbs said disinformation peddlers will continue experimenting with A.I. software to produce increasingly convincing media that is hard to detect and verify.
"What we're seeing today is another sign of things to come," he said.

Vigil Held for Slain Councilwoman as FBI Joins Hunt for Her Killer

SAYREVILLE, N.J. — In the week since a New Jersey councilwoman was shot to death in a car on the street outside her house, the police have interviewed friends and family members and enlisted the help of the State Police and the FBI.
But the county prosecutor, speaking publicly Wednesday for the first time about the case, said that the investigation into Eunice K. Dwumfour’s killing remained unsolved.
Hours later, hundreds of people gathered for a vigil in honor of Dwumfour, a 30-year-old Republican trailblazer, who was the first-ever Black person elected in the small borough of Sayreville.
She was remembered by the town’s Democratic mayor, Victoria Kilpatrick, for her radiant smile and willingness to be a role model to young girls.
Wearing “her signature, sparkling high heels,” Dwumfour “broke through that glass ceiling,” Kilpatrick told mourners.
Earlier in the day, the governor ordered flags to fly at half-staff statewide in Dwumfour’s memory. The state’s lieutenant governor, Sheila Y. Oliver, and the leader of the Assembly, Craig Coughlin, both Democrats, each spoke at the vigil, underscoring the deep sense of loss and shock felt over the mysterious killing.
“Don’t forget what she packed into those 30 years,” Oliver told the large crowd gathered at EPIC, a nondenominational Christian church in Sayreville, adding that she identified with the grit that it took for Dwumfour to enter the often rough-and-tumble world of New Jersey politics as a Black woman.
She asked the community to embrace Dwumfour’s young daughter, Nicole, and “do all that we can do to help stand her up.”
A photo of Dwumfour dressed in festive wedding attire appeared on one of three large screens in the church as soft music played in the background. Ushers passed around boxes of tissues to emotional mourners.
“Hopefully the monster who was responsible for this will be found,” Coughlin said.
Dwumfour’s family is from Ghana. But she was married last year to a leader of her church, Champions Royal Assembly, a congregation based in Nigeria, according to messages she and her husband, Eze Kings, posted on Facebook.
Yolanda Ciccone, the Middlesex County prosecutor, said that investigators do not “at this time” believe that the killing was tied to activities outside the United States.
“This is our No. 1 priority,” Ciccone said in an interview after an unrelated event. “There is no expense being spared. We have all of our detectives working on it.”
When asked by a reporter if the killing might have been a “political assassination,” Ciccone said, “I really don’t want to comment on that.”
The FBI is helping investigators conduct scientific analysis, she said, but declined to elaborate. Ciccone also said that her office had blocked efforts by news organizations to obtain video footage from the night of the shooting out of respect for Dwumfour, who has not yet “been laid to rest.”
Dwumfour was shot at about 7:20 p.m. Feb. 1 outside her apartment in Parlin, an unincorporated section of Sayreville. Her car rolled down the street and crashed into parked cars at the base of a hill.
The sprawling complex of three-story apartment buildings and duplex homes is known as Camelot at La Mer, and it backs up against the southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway. The day after the shooting, investigators were seen searching a wooded hill near the shoulder of the parkway, which is accessible by foot from the neighborhood.
Other officers reached into shrubbery and beneath sewer grates near where Dwumfour was shot, in what appeared to be a search for a weapon.
Ciccone offered no information about a possible suspect, but she did say that there was no “ongoing threat to the community.”
“We will solve the case,” she added.
Many of the mourners Wednesday night said they were congregants from a Pentecostal church where Dwumfour worshipped as a child in Newark and from Champions Royal Assembly.
“She was a good girl,” said Grace Afful, of Hillside, New Jersey, who said she had known Dwumfour since the young woman was a child. “I’m pretty sure that the police will not relax until they find the person who did this horrible thing.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

N.Y.P.D. Officer Dies Days After He Was Shot During an Attempted Robbery in Brooklyn: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Adeed Fayaz, 26, had been shot on Saturday as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn in response to a Facebook Marketplace post.
A New York City police officer died from his injuries on Tuesday after he was shot while off duty during a robbery attempt as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn, police officials said.
The officer, Adeed Fayaz, 26, a five-year veteran of the department, had been hospitalized at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn for three days since the shooting on Saturday night. Mr. Fayaz, an officer in the 66th precinct in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was married and the father of two young children, officials said.
"Police Officer Adeed Fayaz was a father, a husband, a son, and a protector of our great city," the police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said on Twitter in a post announcing his death.
Randy Jones, 38, of East Harlem, was arrested in connection with the shooting on Monday night and charged with murder and attempted robbery on Tuesday evening.
According to the police, the two men had arranged over Facebook Marketplace to meet so that Mr. Fayaz could purchase a Honda Pilot for $ 24,000. After Mr. Fayaz arrived at an address in East New York, Brooklyn, at around 6:50 p.m. on Saturday, along with his brother-in-law, Mr. Jones "jokingly" asked the men if they were carrying guns while walking them down a driveway, James Essig, the New York Police Department's chief of detectives, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Both men said no, Chief Essig said, and Mr. Jones then pulled Mr. Fayaz into a headlock, pointed a gun to his head and demanded money, he said. When Mr. Fayaz said that he didn't have any money, Mr. Jones pointed the gun at Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, Chief Essig said, giving the officer a chance to break free of the headlock.
At that point, the gunman fired and struck Mr. Fayaz in the head, Chief Essig said, and fled while continuing to fire at both men.
The brother-in-law was able to grab a firearm off Mr. Fayaz's hip and fired toward Mr. Jones at least six times as he fled, Chief Essig said.
The incident unfolded in "a matter of seconds," he said.
Using dashcam video from Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, officers were able to connect the 2011 BMW that Mr. Jones drove away in to his mother, Chief Essig said.
With additional video footage, Mr. Jones was located by officers at a Days Inn in Nanuet, N.Y., on Monday night along with his girlfriend and five children, he said.
When he was arrested, Mr. Jones was cuffed using Mr. Fayaz's handcuffs, Chief Essig said, adding, "We wanted him to know what he did to that officer, and that officer's cuffs were on him, and I think it sends a powerful message."
He said the department is looking into "a few other" Facebook Marketplace robberies -- one that happened in January close to where Mr. Fayaz was shot and others in Southeast Queens -- to see if there were any connections to Mr. Jones.

Lamb Ragù? Crab Fried Rice? You've Got Options.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Eating outdoors in the winter? No problem.
I'd like to start this week's newsletter with a very heartfelt thank you to the folks here at The Times who contributed to last week's Valentine's Day dining newsletter. They are some of the busiest people on staff, and I appreciate their taking the time to share such thoughtful recommendations. We will definitely do that again!
Today, it's reader question time: This month, we have visitors wondering where they should dine in Dumbo, Brooklyn; someone looking for regional Italian specialties; and a request for outdoor dining spots in Lower Manhattan. As always, if you have questions or want to offer some polite commentary, email me at wheretoeat@nytimes.com.
Old-School Sicilian on the Waterfront
My friends and I really enjoy Sicilian and Italian specialties that include sarde, bottarga, merluzzo, and interesting pastas with unusual non-red-meat ingredients. Restaurants that focus on this seem far and few between. Any recommendations? -- Marc T.
I hope you don't mind, but let's focus on the Sicilian part of your request. I'm going to point you in the direction of the 119-year-old Ferdinando's Focacceria, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn. It's a homey setup with hexagonal tiled floors, grandma plates and one wall covered with images of famous people who have stopped by -- Christopher Meloni, Martin Scorsese and at least two New York City mayors. Order the softball-size arancini special, covered in red sauce and some of the freshest ricotta I've had in recent memory, and then get that pasta con le sarde you've been craving. It's at turns sweet (thanks to golden raisins) and wonderfully funky (the sardines), with bucatini cooked al dente, of course.
Dining in Dumbo
My husband and I will be staying in the Dumbo area in mid-March to see a concert. We have two days and nights and would love some recommendations for dinner. We like eclectic restaurants and would love to be able to walk rather than Uber or taxi. -- Maureen P.
Dumbo doesn't enter the restaurant conversation enough, which is a shame because there are some nice options! I simply must give a shout-out to the ever-reliable Superfine, on Front Street, where I enjoyed several happy hours as a fresh-off-the-U-Haul-truck 20-something. It's unfussy, with a wide-ranging menu, and if you go on a Wednesday night there's live jazz. For some of the finest coal oven-fired pizza in the city, check out Juliana's. And you know who's still got it after 15 years? Vinegar Hill House, on the edge of the neighborhood. I recently had a lovely lamb ragù there, as well as chicken-liver mousse with crusty bread and piquant mustard. And the real victory? I was able to get a reservation with less than 24 hours' notice.
Winter-Proof Outdoor Dining
Any recommendations in Lower Manhattan with heated outdoor patios for a business lunch? My team meets monthly for lunch as we're still working from home, and one of my colleagues feels uncomfortable eating indoors after the pandemic. -- Hannah M.
I will be tackling dining for the Covid-conscious in the very near future, but for now I have two recommendations. Many restaurants seem to have opted out of winter-proofing their outdoor dining areas, but Fairfax, in the West Village, still has its "yurts," with hefty overhead heaters to keep you and your party warm in isolation with your burgers and Old Bay tots. And the team will love you forever if you treat them to Uncle Boon's khao pat puu (crab fried rice) and red curry rice salad under the heaters at Thai Diner, on Mott Street. That's just science.

NEW YORK — A New York City police officer died from his injuries on Tuesday after he was shot while off duty during a robbery attempt as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn, police officials said.
The officer, Adeed Fayaz, 26, a five-year veteran of the department, had been hospitalized at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn for three days since the shooting on Saturday night. Fayaz, an officer in the 66th precinct in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was married and the father of two young children, officials said.
“Police Officer Adeed Fayaz was a father, a husband, a son, and a protector of our great city,” the police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said on Twitter in a post announcing his death.
Randy Jones, 38, of East Harlem, was arrested in connection with the shooting on Monday night and charged with murder and attempted robbery on Tuesday evening.
According to the police, the two men had arranged over Facebook Marketplace to meet so that Fayaz could purchase a Honda Pilot for $24,000. After Fayaz arrived at an address in East New York, Brooklyn, around 6:50 p.m. on Saturday, along with his brother-in-law, Jones “jokingly” asked the men if they were carrying guns while walking them down a driveway, James Essig, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Both men said no, Essig said, and Jones then pulled Fayaz into a headlock, pointed a gun to his head and demanded money, he said. When Fayaz said that he didn’t have any money, Jones pointed the gun at Fayaz’s brother-in-law, Essig said, giving the officer a chance to break free of the headlock.
At that point, the gunman fired and struck Fayaz in the head, Essig said, and fled while continuing to fire at both men.
The brother-in-law was able to grab a firearm off Fayaz’s hip and fired toward Jones at least six times as he fled, Essig said.
The incident unfolded in “a matter of seconds,” he said.
Using dashcam video from Fayaz’s brother-in-law, officers were able to connect the 2011 BMW that Jones drove away in to his mother, Essig said.
With additional video footage, Jones was located by officers at a Days Inn in Nanuet, New York, on Monday night along with his girlfriend and five children, he said.
When he was arrested, Jones was cuffed using Fayaz’s handcuffs, Essig said, adding, “We wanted him to know what he did to that officer, and that officer’s cuffs were on him, and I think it sends a powerful message.”
He said the department is looking into “a few other” Facebook Marketplace robberies — one that happened in January close to where Fayaz was shot and others in Southeast Queens — to see if there were any connections to Jones. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

St. Andrews Steps Back From Its Plan to Remodel Beloved Old Course Bridge: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Want a patio-like surface by a bridge that's perhaps more than 700 years old? St. Andrews did, but many others most definitely did not.
St. Andrews Links -- the stately sporting refuge in Scotland that has outlasted major champions, monarchs and well-to-do duffers -- caved Monday and abandoned plans for a patio-like surface by the Swilcan Bridge.
Few locales in golf invite quite so many pilgrimages as the stone bridge, which crosses a burn on the Old Course's 18th hole and is the centerpiece of photographs that surface in Scottish pubs, man-caves all over suburban America and Tiger Woods's office in Florida. So, perhaps it was predictable that even some well-intentioned remodeling of the area around it, worn down by the footwear of many thousands of players and visitors, would lead to fury, confusion and more than a few memes.
Golf, you might have heard, is not always keen on change, and the resulting kerfuffle will amount to a brief, if breathtakingly effective, chapter in the very long history -- like, maybe more than 700 years -- of a 30-foot bridge. The whole spat, of course, could have been avoided had the bridge stuck to its long-ago mission of catering to livestock.
But since that did not happen and because many people cannot mimic Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus or Woods on their scorecards, they merely congregate at the bridge, wave like a British Open champion, memorialize the moment for Facebook or Instagram and march on their way, leaving tattered turf behind.
The idea that set off the scorn, course officials said over the weekend, was to replicate a past stone pathway and guard against repeated bouts of "disrepair" after a handful of other strategies, including artificial turf, proved insufficient. They added that they could "categorically state that no works have been undertaken to the bridge itself."
As if that would calm down, say, the denizens of Twitter. By Monday night, the Old Course was seeking another solution, new, old or at least not that one.
"The stonework at the approach and exit of the bridge was identified as one possible long term solution," the course's administrators said in a statement that conceded that "while this installation would have provided some protection, in this instance we believe we are unable to create a look which is in keeping with its iconic setting and have taken the decision to remove it."
The statement noted "feedback from many partners and stakeholders as well as the golfing public," which was a most proper way to characterize social media-fueled disdain and mockery.
"What in the world were those idiots thinking building this?" Hank Haney, who once coached Woods, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Nick Faldo, whose six major tournament titles included the 1990 Open at St. Andrews, was also aghast.
"If you've travelled halfway around the world for your bucket list round at St Andrews, would you rather leave with a bit of historic dirt on your shoes or a few cement mix scraps?" he asked. Perhaps, he mused, the approach was a "strategically placed sundial (for slow play)."
St. Andrews officials said Monday that turf would be restored "in the coming days." Even though the internet never seems to forget, there is plenty of time for recovery between now and the next Open at St. Andrews. This year's tournament will be at Royal Liverpool, the 2024 festivities will be at Royal Troon and 2025 will see the competition return to Royal Portrush.
The R&A, which organizes the Open, has not announced its plans for other years.

A Stolen Boat, an Ocean Rescue and Dead Fish on the Doorstep: 'So Much Mayhem': [Correction]

Full text: The authorities in Oregon said a capsized boat was stolen by a man who had paid a visit to a nearby house made famous in "The Goonies." The twists continued.
When the Coast Guard Station Cape Disappointment received a mayday call from a mariner in distress Friday morning, the agency went into full-rescue mode, deploying a 47-foot lifeboat, calling the aircrew of a Jayhawk helicopter and mobilizing multiple crews of the National Motor Lifeboat School who were conducting training nearby.
It would turn out that the man who needed saving would have some explaining to do if he made it safely to land.
The 35-foot boat was taking on water six miles off the coast of Astoria, Ore., near the mouth of the Columbia River in an area known as the Columbia Bar, which is frequently referred to as the Graveyard of the Pacific and is believed among mariners to be one of the most dangerous crossings in the world.
The Coast Guard reported conditions of 20-foot seas and extremely high wind speeds as a rescue swimmer, a student of the Advanced Helicopter Rescue School, was deployed into the water using a winch cable before swimming toward the sinking boat. Just as the rescuer made his approach, a breaking wave capsized the boat, throwing the mariner overboard. The rescue swimmer reached the mariner in the water, the Coast Guard said in a statement, and both were lifted up to the helicopter and transported to land.
Hours later, the swimmer, John Walton, known as Branch, an Aviation Survival Technician Third Class, graduated from training. It was the first time he saved a life, the Coast Guard said.
The dramatic rescue was all captured on video. But the drama did not stop there.
The rescued mariner, Jericho Labonte, had stolen the boat from a nearby marina in West Mooring Basin in Astoria, according to the police. And a few days before that, he left a dead fish on the steps of the house made famous by the 1985 film "The Goonies," which follows the fantastical adventures of a group of children following an old treasure map.
Mr. Labonte filmed himself dropping the fish off at the house, calling out the movie's signature line of "Hey, you guys!" and posted it to Facebook.
Mr. Labonte was arrested Friday night in Seaside, Ore., about 17 miles south of Astoria, on charges of theft, endangering another person, unauthorized use of a vehicle and criminal mischief, the Astoria police said in a statement. But Mr. Labonte, who is originally from British Columbia, was also wanted by Canadian authorities on charges of mischief, criminal harassment and failure to comply, Chief Stacy Kelly of the Astoria Police Department told The New York Times on Sunday.
Chief Kelly said Mr. Labonte was in the custody of U.S. immigration officials for illegally crossing the border from Canada.
The small, commercial fishing town has never seen anything "this crazy," the chief said. "Not one person causing so much mayhem. That's for sure."
Chief Kelly said it was unclear how long Mr. Labonte had been in the area, which is more than 90 miles northwest of Portland, but said the police received a phone call from a woman in Astoria alerting them to the fish video. The woman was "very concerned" to learn that Mr. Labonte was in town and "scared to death" that he was in the area, and she alerted the police to his previous criminal history.
When the Coast Guard released the video of the harrowing rescue, the head of port security for Astoria, Matt Hansen, recognized the boat and confirmed it was stolen, Chief Kelly said.
"The Columbia Bar is extremely dangerous under the best of conditions," he said. "The fact he made it across the bar is miraculous."
But by the time the video had been released, Mr. Labonte had left an area hospital and was at large. Another community member alerted the police when Mr. Labonte was seen at a warming center in town later that day. He was then arrested.
Chief Kelly attributed Mr. Labonte's arrest to a large community effort.
Among the people who helped was Jeff Keightley, a charter boat captain in Astoria. Mr. Keightley took a man who called himself Philip Livingston out for a charter fishing trip on the morning of Feb. 1.
Mr. Keightley originally welcomed the off-season trip. But the man repeatedly asked Mr. Keightley to take him out to 3,000 feet, about 30 miles offshore where bottom fishing is impossible. He requested a captain's hat and insisted on joining the commercial crabbing fleet, which were far offshore. When the man hooked a 27-inch lingcod, he was ready to go back to shore, which also surprised Mr. Keightley.
"The number of times I've gotten one fish and went back in -- that was a new record," Mr. Keightley said in an interview on Sunday.
When the Coast Guard video was released, Mr. Keightley's girlfriend, Julianna Edmiston, who was a deckhand aboard the charter, recognized the man being rescued.
It was Mr. Labonte.
Mr. Keightley then realized that the gossip about a dead fish on the steps of the house in "The Goonies" was about the one caught on his boat.
"People often ask me about the weirdest thing that ever happened," he said, recalling a time when a man was drunk during a sturgeon competition and jumped overboard. "This is way weirder."

Russia Pushes To Seize Town And Protect Supply Line: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Ukraine has used the strategic town of Vuhledar to launch attacks disrupting transit on a critical rail link between the war's southern and eastern fronts.
KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow is deploying thousands of soldiers to southeastern Ukraine as it renews an assault on a strategically important town that Ukrainian forces have used to harass shipments on a critical Russian supply line that runs from the eastern Donbas region to Crimea.
The town, Vuhledar, has long been in Russia's cross hairs. It sits at the intersection of the eastern front in the Donetsk region and the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region, close to the only rail line linking Crimea with the Donbas region. The Ukrainians have used that proximity to lob artillery shells at the trains, limiting Russia's ability to move men and equipment between the two fronts and, ultimately, to achieve its stated aim of capturing the Donbas, which comprises the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk.
After a major drive in November failed, with reportedly enormous losses, Russian commanders are once again attacking in and around Vuhledar in hopes of securing the rail line.
"This can be done in only one way -- by capturing and occupying Vuhledar, which just 'hangs' over this railway line," said Ivan Yakovina, a prominent Ukrainian journalist and radio host. By capturing the "seemingly small and not very significant town," he said, "Russia would have received a wide logistical artery along the entire front line and, accordingly, the ability to quickly and massively transfer troops from one direction to another."
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine acknowledged in his nightly address on Saturday that the situation was "very difficult," as Russia "throws more and more of its forces to break our defenses."
In addition to taking control of Donbas, Moscow is intent on keeping control over the so-called land bridge, the slice of occupied territory that connects Russia to Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow has occupied since 2014. Kyiv's hold on Vuhledar threatens that as well.
Ukrainian officials said that they had repelled the latest assaults, but warned that Russian forces, bolstered by thousands of newly mobilized soldiers, were trying to encircle the town.
"The Russians are not trying to break through the defenses of Vuhledar, but are trying to surround the city from two sides," the city's deputy mayor, Maksym Verbovsky, told the Ukrainian news outlet Suspline on Friday. "They managed to advance to some nearby villages, but the Ukrainian military pushed them back to their previous positions."
The fighting has left yet another Ukrainian city in ruins.
Vuhledar "was destroyed," Mr. Verbovsky said. "One hundred percent of the buildings were damaged. The entire infrastructure."
Fewer than 500 civilians and just three children remain, he said, in what had until a year ago been a densely packed industrial town of about 15,000.
Vuhledar takes its name, "gift of coal" in Ukrainian, from the mine on its outskirts. Consisting of a cluster of high-rise apartment complexes on an otherwise empty plain, the town's elevation, exposure and tall buildings give defenders a distinct advantage.
The ill-fated November campaign was led by the Russian Pacific Fleet's 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade, with reportedly disastrous results. Mediazona, an independent Russian outlet that tracks Russians killed in battle, published an interview with a Russian marine who said that more than 200 soldiers had been killed in just three days. Reports of the defeat gained enough traction that the Kremlin felt compelled to issue a statement denying them.
On Saturday, fighting continued to rage across the eastern front, and around the embattled city of Bakhmut, which is around 60 miles from Vuhledar, while damage from Russia's strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure continued to be felt. An accident at a critical power station that had been damaged by Russian attacks in the southern city of Odesa resulted in a citywide blackout.
Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Galushchenko, said on Saturday evening that critical infrastructure had been restored, meaning that Odesa would have water and heat. Power had been restored to about one-third of the city's consumers and efforts were underway to get electricity on for the rest, Mr. Galushchenko added in a Facebook post.
Despite the ongoing fighting, Russia and Ukraine said on Saturday that they had carried out another large-scale exchange of prisoners of war.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said that 116 Ukrainians had been released -- including "defenders of Mariupol, Kherson partisans, snipers from Bakhmut vicinities, and other heroes." The bodies of two British volunteers and a former member of the French Foreign Legion also were turned over by the Russians, he added. Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that a "complicated negotiation" had led to the return of 63 Russian troops, including "sensitive category" prisoners whose release was facilitated by the United Arab Emirates.
The United Arab Emirates has tried to facilitate prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine over the course of the war. The government hosted the exchange of the W.N.B.A. star Brittney Griner for a Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout, on the tarmac of an Abu Dhabi airport.
A Russian official reported a Ukrainian attack and subsequent fire Saturday at an industrial facility near the border. Vyacheslav V. Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, wrote on Telegram that "projectiles hit the premises of an industrial plant." In subsequent posts, he said that there were no casualties, as staff members were quickly evacuated.

A House Fire Ignites a Journalist's Curiosity: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: A trail of Facebook posts and interactions with neighbors led the reporter Tracey Tully on a quest to understand, and share, one woman's story.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was a Friday, nine days before Christmas. Stephen Merelman, an editor on the Metro desk at The New York Times, sent me a message about an intriguing tip he had heard about a fire in Maplewood, N.J., a commuter town about 20 miles from Manhattan.
A homeowner there, Eve Morawski, had lost the deed to her home of 60 years after falling behind on taxes. Firefighters responding to the Dec. 7 blaze at the home discovered her inside; she had apparently set the fire herself after being evicted the day before.
Ms. Morawski had been vocal about losing her home on social media. "Do not let these bullies get away with this," she wrote to friends on Facebook a couple of weeks before the fire.
I had a strong hunch there was more to the story, so I began making calls and asking questions. The results, published in a Metro article this week, proved more complicated than I had imagined.
With help from a New York Times researcher, Kirsten Noyes, I spent part of that mid-December weekend poring over a decade's worth of state and federal lawsuits that Ms. Morawski had filed, or that had been filed against her, about the house and other issues. She often represented herself in court, and much of her legal writing read like entries in a diary. I was left with an off-kilter sense of actually knowing someone I had never met.
I learned from a police report that she had stabbed herself in the chest the morning of the fire. I also learned that a friend of hers, concerned about her mental health, had called the police in the days before the fire; she was worried that Ms. Morawski was suicidal, a detail that gave me pause about pursuing the story. My editor, Felice Belman, gave me the nudge I needed to stick with it a little longer.
In December, I headed to Maplewood to find out more about Ms. Morawski and had one of the more unusual experiences of my journalism career: Nearly every neighbor opened the door and nearly everyone wanted to talk -- a lot -- about the woman they had come to know and like and the convoluted run-up to the fire. Ms. Morawski was a fixture in the community, I learned, and the housing laws surrounding the loss of her house raised questions with broad implications.
New Jersey towns are required to sell unpaid tax and sewer bills annually, and it has become big business for investors, who can charge 18-percent interest on the so-called tax certificates. After two years, buyers -- lien holders -- are permitted to foreclose on property and keep the profit.
Ms. Morawski lost her four-bedroom house, worth roughly $ 700,000 before the fire, over an initial debt of $ 12,809 -- three-quarters of her unpaid taxes from 2015. To outbid competitors, the company that now owns the home, Effect Lake LLC, paid the township of Maplewood a $ 92,800 premium, a common practice. The company also continued to pay Ms. Morawski's tax and sewer charges once they became overdue by 10 days, as is permitted by state law.
By the time Effect Lake held the deed in 2020, it had invested roughly $ 175,000 to own a home worth at least three times that much. None of Effect Lake's excess profit will be returned to Ms. Morawski. This is legal in only 12 states, according to the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit, which has argued that the practice violates the Constitution. And it takes advantage of society's most vulnerable, said Christina Martin, a lawyer from the foundation.
After the fire, Ms. Morawski was charged with arson and burglary and was held in jail in Newark. I put $ 11 on her jail telephone account so that she could call me, but we never made contact. I was in court on Jan. 13 when a judge ruled she could be released from jail, pending the outcome of the charges. A few days later, my cellphone rang. I was gratified to finally hear her voice and relieved to learn her account was largely consistent with the documents I had reviewed and the recollections of her friends.
We spoke for the first time for about 90 minutes. One of the questions I asked was why she did not sell the house before forfeiting it altogether. She mainly avoided the question, noting the many lawsuits that had drained her time and resources, her inability to find full-time work and the hope that she would somehow, ultimately, prevail. We continued exchanging emails over the next two weeks.
On Jan. 27, she emailed me a photo a neighbor had taken of a green dumpster piled high with furniture and knickknacks that workers had hauled out of her former home.
"My home and I are being gutted," she wrote.

Value Stocks? Growth Stocks? It's All Topsy-Turvy.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: With the exception of Apple, eight tech giants are no longer "pure growth" stocks, while Exxon and Chevron are, a new study says. Our columnist says: Buyer, beware.
It is impossible even to talk about the long bull market that ended in January 2022 without saying high-growth tech stocks propelled the market higher.
Companies like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla dominated the headlines for years. Tech stocks and growth stocks were virtually synonymous.
But not anymore.
The new growth stocks, in the estimation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, an influential market analysis firm, now include fossil-fuel energy companies.
The world has changed radically in the last year or two, and traditional categories, like growth and value, are topsy-turvy.
S&P Dow Jones Indices handles the plumbing behind the two most famous American stock market indexes -- the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average -- and many other important world market benchmarks.
In an annual review of the S&P 500 index, it has found that the seemingly immutable connections between tech and growth, and between energy and value, in the stock market have weakened, if not snapped entirely.
The Findings
Investors have often viewed growth and value stocks as two essential categories. Basically, growth stocks promise a lot in the future but deliver less right now. Value stocks, on the other hand, aren't usually trendy. They are priced well below what their advocates consider to be their real worth.
But which stocks belong in each category? The answer seemed obvious, until the stock market collapsed in 2022. The prices of tech companies were shriveling, and they pulled the entire market down.
Now, using strictly mathematical measures, S&P Dow Jones Indices has found that Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft are no longer "pure growth" stocks. They have been replaced in the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index by an unlikely group: fossil-fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
These conclusions are a startling sign of how much the world and its financial markets have been battered in the last year or two.
Until the S&P Indices findings, for example, Exxon and Chevron had been almost universally classified as value stocks. In the thinking that prevailed a couple of years ago, an urgent need to address global warming impaired the long-term viability of fossil fuel companies. Even among investors who favored their shares, these firms were presumed to be a good value precisely because they were so unfashionable.
Last year, at least, those assumptions about growth and value stocks were overturned, along with many other presumptions about the world.
The World Changed
Russia's yearlong war in Ukraine set off a series of unanticipated shocks that elevated world oil and gas prices. Energy prices have come down a bit, but still remain high.
Publicly traded energy companies had outsize gains in sales, profits and stock prices. Exxon and Chevron have both reported record profits for last year. The S&P 500 dropped more than 18 percent in 2022, but energy was the only sector to rise, with an eye-popping total return of almost 67 percent, including dividends. The sector's sales, price and earnings momentum transformed its biggest components into growth stocks, at least in the backward-looking lens used by S&P 500 Indices.
At the same time, the eight big tech companies stumbled, for idiosyncratic reasons, as well as systemic ones. Tesla, for example, faces serious competition in the market for electric vehicles, even as the Twitter escapades of its proprietor, Elon Musk, may be turning off some would-be car buyers. Meta reported a continuing decline in sales and earnings on Wednesday, though its stock soared on plans for further share buybacks, amid a broad stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases were abating. Still, the scale of its unprofitable investments in virtual reality have worried many investors. Netflix, which once said it competed only with sleep for the attention of its subscribers, now jousts with a horde of streaming companies.
But, in broad terms, two real-world factors are responsible for their reclassification this year. First, while the initial, lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic generally increased tech firms' sales and profits in 2020 and 2021, it set them up for a sharp decline in their growth rates in 2022 as the economy recovered.
Second, soaring inflation and rising interest rates -- the Fed raised short-term rates again on Wednesday -- hurt the tech companies, too. Why? Basically because tech companies that entice investors with the mere promise of future sales and profits are worth less when the costs of waiting for those promises rise.
In short, the abrupt reversal of the eight big tech companies' momentum last year changed their profiles, according to the S&P Indices algorithms. Now, the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index includes just one: Apple. Despite periodic setbacks like the decline in sales and earnings it announced on Thursday, it has for the most part kept growing.
How are the others classified? The answer isn't simple. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft now reside in both of the two, more inclusive, S&P 500 growth and value indexes: subsets of the S&P 500 that welcome stocks near the middle of the growth-value spectrum. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla are only in the broad growth index, implying that they have retained more growth characteristics than Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.
The shifts are dizzying. They amount to a wholesale transformation of nearly a third of the market weight of the S&P 500 growth and value indexes. "That's the biggest turnover since the start of current measurement methods in 2009," Hamish Preston, director of U.S. Equity for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview.
The Implications
In decision-making, it helps if you know what you're talking about. But when it comes to growth and value stocks, it's not easy to know.
Growth funds based on the S&P 500 indexes now contain fossil-fuel energy stocks, and if you thought that by holding those funds you were owning tech stocks, you may be disappointed. Funds based on other indexes, like the Russell 1000 Growth index, haven't yet rebalanced their holdings this year, and they still look more like traditional growth stock funds. Buyer beware.
Be careful in evaluating the horse races that have gone on for decades. Depending on the index, a stock that had been a growth champion may suddenly be running under the livery of value. These shifting labels raise questions, to say the least, about the enduring worth of such distinctions.
At the level of individual companies, finer distinctions can be made. There is a well-tested, disciplined value-investing approach used in analyzing stocks, one taught by Benjamin Graham at Columbia, and practiced by his star student, Warren Buffett.
But unless you make a living with this method, I'd say that this year's exercise by S&P Indices is invaluable in pointing out the pitfalls of choosing value or growth or any sector in broad bets on the markets. If fossil fuel energy stocks are growth companies in a warming world, what do those words even mean?
As an investor, I try to sidestep such judgments entirely. You can do that, too, by owning a piece of the entire stock and bond markets through broad, low-cost index funds that don't give a greater weight to one style or sector. If you have enough money to pay the bills, just let these investments mature over decades.
With that approach, you can observe the ever-changing spectacle of the markets without worrying about their sometimes tenuous relationship with common sense.
For my own peace of mind, I don't worry about shifting growth and value distinctions. I hold the entire market, and get on with other things.

Daughter's Betrayal: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the course of offering financial advice, a mother shared a personal story about her marriage with her adult daughter, who later forwarded the entire exchange to her father.
I was advising my adult daughter on a great investment in a field we know well. I even offered financial assistance, but she told me she was afraid to proceed. So I shared a very personal story: When her father and I were engaged, he was offered a similar opportunity. I begged him to postpone our wedding and use the money to make the investment. But he didn't; he was afraid, too. I told her that marrying her father, instead of making the investment, had been a poor financial decision I've regretted ever since. I urged her not to make the same mistake. She then forwarded our entire text exchange to my husband (her father)! It didn't cause any trouble between us. But she didn't know that it wouldn't. How do I deal with such a betrayal? I will never trust her again.
MOTHER
My first impression was similar to yours: Your daughter shared a text chain with your husband to put you in hot water. If that's where we stop, though, there's little room for growth or forgiveness. (And you may want that eventually.) Did your daughter think she was protecting her father? Has she complained about you before -- maybe for pressuring her on investments?
Speaking as an adult child of parents who tried their best but didn't always nail it, I can assure you there are many ways to express long-simmering resentments. That may be what your daughter was doing here. It may also be the case that her betrayal hurt you badly enough that you need to take a break from her for now. I get that, too.
Still, I hope one day you will feel ready to explore with her why she behaved the way she did. Talking openly with loved ones is the only way that I know to build back trust and understanding. To do that, though, we have to be able to set aside our own strong feelings (even momentarily) to hear what the other person has to say. I wish that for you and your daughter.
When Risqué Photos Outlast the Relationship
My former partner and I created intimate photographs together when we were a couple. We have since broken up. My ex has now asked me to delete those images. I would prefer not to. I enjoy looking at them, and they are password protected. What's more, my ex has kept copies of these photographs, too. Doesn't that make the request to delete them seem like a double standard and unfair?
EX
The mere existence of intimate photos in the hands of an ex (whether they depict nudity or sexual activity) would make many people feel vulnerable. And even though some may be unsympathetic toward people who willingly created such images -- "What did they think would happen?" -- let's not stop there.
I am not interested in your arguments about double standards or fairness. Be a good person and recognize the distress these images may be causing your former partner. Offer to delete them if your ex will do the same. That's the best result here.
Making the Right Kind of Stink at a Restaurant
How do we tell a dear, old friend that we no longer want to eat in restaurants with her? She is often unkind to waiters -- always looking to find fault and, when she does, she harasses workers until she gets something for free or they reduce her bill. We are uncomfortable with this and embarrassed for the waiters. We mostly avoid restaurants by inviting her to our place for meals, but we can't do that forever.
JOE
Don't be "embarrassed for the waiters" -- defend them! It is wrong to stand by silently while your friend routinely bullies workers who have less power than she does. Next time, speak up: "Please stop treating the waiter disrespectfully." Or tell her directly that's why you choose not to dine out with her.
There are plenty of times when keeping quiet is a fine approach. We are not generally in charge of our friends' behavior. But letting cruelty slide (or inventing white lies to cover your reluctance to meet your friend at restaurants) is not OK in my book.
Craving Intimacy After the Death of a Spouse
My much-loved wife died after a prolonged illness. I am almost 80 and in good health, but I have not had sex with a partner in over a decade. I am still grieving, but I also crave another warm body and confirmation that I still have sexual skills. What would you recommend to someone in my position?
WIDOWER
I am sorry for your loss and sympathetic with your bind. Human touch can be a healing balm. You don't say how long you have been widowed, but I would urge any surviving spouse to move slowly. Grief can be overwhelming, and its pangs strike unexpectedly.
Frankly, you seem pretty focused on sex. I hope your definition includes more than just intercourse. Touching, kissing and other intimate contact can be extremely satisfying. As for finding a partner, check out group activities of interest at your local community or senior center, or explore dating apps that cater to seniors. Be careful to avoid scams online and be honest about your intentions with the women you meet.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

After a Painful Foreclosure, Hope Slips Away: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: MAPLEWOOD, N.J. -- It was dark by the time Eve Morawski managed to break into her home of 60 years.
The locks had been changed by sheriff's deputies enforcing an eviction order. Movers hired by investors who took possession of the house after she fell behind on taxes had been inside most of the day, packing up photos and knickknacks her family had spent a lifetime accumulating.
She was infuriated to find the house in disarray.
Sometime before dawn, a police report shows, she located a book of matches and a knife.
"Jersey Girl Justice will hopefully prevail in the end," Ms. Morawski wrote to friends on Facebook just before fire trucks began roaring down the pretty block in Maplewood, N.J.
"Aloha."
To neighbors, the Dec. 7 fire that burst from second-floor windows and licked at the eaves of Ms. Morawski's former home was a spectacularly sad end to an epic real estate battle that had played out publicly on social media and in state and federal courts. To her only sister, it was a tragic, avoidable coda to a 20-year family feud.
"There's a lingering sense of: Is there something more as a community we could have done to help?" said John Guterman, a friend of Ms. Morawski who lives down the street and shared her love of animals, smoked barbecue and the Mets.
Well known and well liked, Ms. Morawski was a fixture in Maplewood, a commuter town 20 miles from Manhattan. Classmates recalled her as the smart kid in advanced placement classes who went on to earn an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.
Returning home as an adult, she volunteered at area animal shelters and on the board of a preserved 18th-century house dedicated to sharing Maplewood's history.
A longtime member of the local Interfaith Holocaust Remembrance Committee, she accepted a prestigious award in May for her dedication to keeping the lessons of the Holocaust alive. It was a passion fueled largely by devotion to her Polish immigrant parents, Roman Catholics who she has said were imprisoned by the Nazi and Soviet regimes during World War II. They went on to build a life in suburban New Jersey -- a triumph that, to her, was embodied in the four-bedroom house they purchased at 60 Maplewood Avenue.
Privately, she was consumed by a cascade of debt and drawn-out legal battles that had pushed her to the emotional and financial brink.
Two acrimonious divorces. A three-year probate fight with her sister over their parents' estate. A federal discrimination complaint against a former employer. Dueling lawsuits from a romance that ended badly. And, finally, bankruptcy.
Unable to afford a lawyer, she often represented herself. By her own telling, she was always the victim.
A cancer diagnosis in 2021 complicated everything.
By the time she lost the house, Ms. Morawski, 60, had accumulated more than $ 100,000 in unpaid taxes and fees, a burden that was further exacerbated by a state law heavily weighted toward real estate speculators. New Jersey is one of just a dozen states that permit investors to make huge profits on the debt of struggling homeowners, ultimately allowing them to foreclose on the property and keep all the profit.
"This has been an egregious travesty of justice," she wrote in a letter to local officials shortly before the fire. "I need immediate help to stop the steal of my home."
'The house and legacy I need to save!'
Ms. Morawski's childhood home on Maplewood Avenue sits three blocks from a commuter rail station and the quaint storefronts at the center of town, a pedestrian-friendly hub that residents call "the village." Always considered a desirable community, Maplewood drew a flood of new buyers during the pandemic, and recent sales of renovated houses on the street have ranged from $ 755,000 to $ 1.6 million.
Long before the fire, the house was notable for its peeling buckskin-beige paint and tattered roof, outward signs of the difficulty Ms. Morawski had keeping up with repairs and household bills. But she was determined to hold on.
"The house and legacy I need to save!" she wrote on a GoFundMe page a friend created in 2019.
Details of Ms. Morawski's fight to save the house are based on more than two dozen interviews with neighbors, friends, community leaders and lawyers, as well as tax documents, federal, state and county court records and her own social media posts.
After divorcing her first husband, who was in the Navy and stationed in Hawaii, she returned to Maplewood in 2000 to care for her ailing parents. She worked briefly for a management consulting firm and sometimes gave historical walking tours, but had trouble finding full-time work. An assortment of part-time jobs as a swim instructor ended with the onset of the pandemic.
But she had struggled to make ends meet since at least 2010. Desperate for money, she sold her burial plot, patched her leaky roof with tarps and, unable to buy a new hot-water heater, took to showering at a Y.M.C.A.
"I have never said I do not owe back taxes + obscene interest," she wrote to township leaders, "but the global pandemic impacted the intended course of action."
She had been advised to sell the house rather than lose the accrued equity in a property that real estate sites valued at roughly $ 700,000 before the fire, friends, relatives and town officials said. The conversations never went far.
"She just wanted to stay in the home she grew up in," said Andy Golebiowski, host of the Polish American Radio Program, who met Ms. Morawski on Facebook. "Those were her roots."
Ms. Morawski spoke proudly of those roots when she accepted the Holocaust education award.
Her father, Michael (Szeliga) Morawski, earned Poland's highest military honor, the Virtuti Militari. He had been imprisoned, she said, in concentration camps after trying to drive the Germans from the capital during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, a rebellion that lasted 63 days and led to the deaths of more than 180,000 residents.
Wanda Morawski, a nurse born in what was then the Polish city of Borszczow (it is now part of Ukraine), ran field hospitals for the Allied forces during the war after being freed from a prison in Russia, according to her 2002 obituary.
After marrying in England and moving to Brooklyn, the couple spent 10 years "saving every penny" to buy "their American dream," Ms. Morawski wrote.
Over the next four decades, their house in Maplewood was often filled with recent immigrants of various faiths. Her mother "would order, then pick up, kosher in Brooklyn," Ms. Morawski said at the Holocaust remembrance event. "Everyone would speak Polish and feel comfortable for a few hours as they navigated a challenging new world."
Ms. Morawski's parents died within five months of each other, leaving a contested estate that led to a bitter fight between the two sisters for control of the house. In the end, Ms. Morawski was instructed to pay her sister $ 130,000 and was awarded the house. Her sister won title to another residential property that was in their parents' name but was told by the court that she had "no right to enter the premises" at 60 Maplewood Avenue.
Ms. Morawski's sister said she drove by the home each day for 15 years.
Mental health concerns
Ms. Morawski was often spotted on the block walking her dog, Hana, or tending to repairs of her 1992 Dodge Dakota. She was quick with a compliment and eagerly asked about neighbors' children.
"Always seemed to be in the same mood -- pleasant," said Kevin Photiades, who lives down the street.
"She's a wonderful, generous, amazing person," said Kim Brown, a friend who remained close with Ms. Morawski after they worked together in the early 1990s at a consulting firm in Linden, N.J.
"I couldn't imagine, emotionally, what she was going through."
Ms. Morawski wrote about her financial trouble on social media as foreclosure loomed in 2019 and later discussed her battle with blood cancer.
Neighbors said that they had donated to the GoFundMe campaign or lent her money directly. Friends wrote to the township's congresswoman to ask for help and dropped off soup and meals. A member of her historical book club regularly drove her to chemotherapy.
But as the date of her eviction neared in December, close friends grew increasingly worried about her mental health. She appeared to have no future plans other than lashing out publicly against the injustice she believed had caused her to lose the house.
A federal judge assigned to Ms. Morawski's bankruptcy case, who had attended high school with her, was "heartless and biased," she complained to the chief judge of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. "A smart, smug jock, the epitome of a privileged white male."
A state judge who signed the eviction order was "ridiculously obsequious to the opposing attorney, who was mocking and mean to me."
She publicly suggested that she was considering suicide. "I expect this is the last letter I will ever write," she said in a letter to the bankruptcy judge three days before the fire. "Too bad, because I had a LOT left to offer."
That same day, she dropped Hana at Ms. Brown's house. The next night, she left several cherished family mementos on the back porch of her sister's house and emailed a niece to let her know they were there.
A friend called the police and asked officers to conduct a wellness check. They arrived at the house around dinnertime, and Ms. Morawski was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where she spent 25 hours under psychiatric evaluation, according to her lawyer and a message she posted on Facebook.
She was cleared to leave hours after the eviction order became final and the locks to the house were changed.
Tax liens as investments
Many of Ms. Morawski's problems stemmed from the difficulty she had paying taxes on the house at 60 Maplewood, a home her parents purchased in 1962 and had long ago paid off.
New Jersey requires communities to auction off unpaid tax and sewer debts annually. The buyers -- lien holders -- can charge 18 percent interest on debt over $ 1,500 and are entitled to pay any future overdue taxes on the property, expanding their investment and its steep rate of return. Bidding is often aggressive, particularly for desirable properties in affluent or gentrifying towns.
After two years, if the debt is unpaid, investors can foreclose on the property.
Unlike most other states, New Jersey permits the lien holder to keep all resale profit. Former owners get back none of their accrued equity, no matter the size of the original debt.
"When people hear about it, they think, 'This can't be the whole story,"' said Christina Martin, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit that tracks lien sale foreclosures nationwide. "But it is the whole story. Government thinks it can take a windfall at the expense of society's most vulnerable people and either keep it for the public purse or give it away to private investors for their enrichment.
"Either way, it's gross," Ms. Martin said.
Lawyers for the foundation are preparing to argue that the practice -- they call it "home equity theft" -- violates the Constitution in a Minnesota case that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in January to hear.
Between 2014 and 2021, in 31 of New Jersey's largest communities, the owners of 661 residential properties lost homes after a foreclosure that resulted from tax or sewer debt, according to an analysis by the legal foundation. The owners forfeited roughly $ 115 million in equity, the group found.
The lien that led to the loss of Ms. Morawski's house dated to 2016, when Effect Lake LLC, a Virginia-based company run by Peter Chinloy, a former Temple University professor, and his son, was the winning bidder at an October tax-certificate auction.
Three-quarters of Ms. Morawski's unpaid taxes from 2015, $ 12,809, plus penalties, were put up for sale.
Competition was brisk. To win the right to buy the lien, Effect Lake not only agreed to charge zero-percent interest on the initial debt, but it paid Maplewood a $ 92,800 premium to do so -- a routine practice used to outbid competitors.
Within weeks Effect Lake had also written checks for the $ 17,360.04 in taxes Ms. Morawski failed to pay in 2016, debt that would grow by the maximum 18 percent interest rate. The Chinloys' company also paid all the taxes and sewer fees for the next three years.
Ms. Morawski would later say that Effect Lake deliberately mailed crucial legal notices too late for her to respond. "Real estate investors," she wrote, "have aggressively and ruthlessly pursued foreclosure of my property so they can flip it."
Her sister said she offered to pay the roughly $ 110,000 debt in exchange for the deed to the house -- a deal Ms. Morawski found unfair and refused to accept.
In 2019, Effect Lake began foreclosure proceedings.
And on Jan. 30, 2020, after an investment of roughly $ 175,000, it held the deed to a home worth at least three times that much. Soon after, Ms. Morawski filed for bankruptcy, arguing that the property transfer had been fraudulent, a claim the judge rejected.
While fighting to save the house in bankruptcy court, she was also undergoing chemotherapy treatments that she said sapped her energy and left her unable to focus -- conditions she believed should have led the court to slow the process down.
Mr. Chinloy, who earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard and was the director of real estate programs at Temple's business school until 2020, has written extensively about investor real estate strategies and home foreclosures. He declined to comment for this article.
'Over her dead body'
The day of the fire Ms. Morawski lit five matches at strategic points on the first, second and third floors of the house, according to a police report.
Then she walked to the basement, "laid down on a couch and proceeded to stab herself with a knife four times in the chest," a detective wrote.
Neighbors watched as she was taken out on a stretcher and rushed to a hospital.
Three days later, charged with aggravated arson and burglary, she was transferred to a jail in Newark. A not-guilty plea was entered on her behalf for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of more than 10 years in prison.
Her lawyer, Lisa Lopata, a public defender, stressed that Ms. Morawski was "at a very low point," and that she "deeply regrets what happened, especially the idea that anyone could have been put at risk."
A prosecutor, Adam Wells, argued against her release from jail, in part because of her apparent determination to risk it all to make a defiant final point.
"She made a statement and apologized for her own cliché," Mr. Wells told a judge on Jan. 13, "that over her dead body would anyone take the house."
Ten hours later, after more than a month in custody, Ms. Morawski walked out of jail alone wearing borrowed, oversize clothes. She waited in the dark at a nearby New Jersey Transit bus stop and transferred at Newark Penn Station, en route to a friend's apartment in South Orange, N.J., where she remains in home detention.
"These property tax lien holders have gotten away with everything," Ms. Morawski said in an interview.
"If I start crying, I'm just afraid that I won't stop."
Weeks after the blaze, much of the first floor of the house appeared intact, largely untouched by flames. But out front, a haunting reminder of the saga's explosive end remained etched into a sidewalk poured months ago.
"EVE M LIVED HERE 1962-2022," Ms. Morawski had carved into the wet concrete. "LIVE. ALOHA."

MAPLEWOOD, N.J. — It was dark by the time Eve Morawski managed to break into her home of 60 years.
The locks had been changed by sheriff’s deputies enforcing an eviction order. Movers hired by investors who took possession of the house after she fell behind on taxes had been inside most of the day, packing up photos and knickknacks her family had spent a lifetime accumulating.
She was infuriated to find the house in disarray.
Sometime before dawn, a police report shows, she located a book of matches and a knife.
“Jersey Girl Justice will hopefully prevail in the end,” Morawski wrote to friends on Facebook just before fire trucks began roaring down the pretty block in Maplewood, New Jersey.
“Aloha.”
To neighbors, the Dec. 7 fire that burst from second-floor windows and licked at the eaves of Morawski’s former home was a spectacularly sad end to an epic real estate battle that had played out publicly on social media and in state and federal courts. To her only sister, it was a tragic, avoidable coda to a 20-year family feud.
“There’s a lingering sense of: Is there something more as a community we could have done to help?” said John Guterman, a friend of Morawski who lives down the street and shared her love of animals, smoked barbecue and the New York Mets.
Well known and well liked, Morawski was a fixture in Maplewood, a commuter town 20 miles from Manhattan. Classmates recalled her as the smart kid in advanced placement classes who went on to earn an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania.
Returning home as an adult, she volunteered at area animal shelters and on the board of a preserved 18th-century house dedicated to sharing Maplewood’s history.
A longtime member of the local Interfaith Holocaust Remembrance Committee, she accepted a prestigious award in May for her dedication to keeping the lessons of the Holocaust alive. It was a passion fueled largely by devotion to her Polish immigrant parents, Roman Catholics who she has said were imprisoned by the Nazi and Soviet regimes during World War II. They went on to build a life in suburban New Jersey — a triumph that, to her, was embodied in the four-bedroom house they purchased at 60 Maplewood Avenue.
Privately, she was consumed by a cascade of debt and drawn-out legal battles that had pushed her to the emotional and financial brink.
Two acrimonious divorces. A three-year probate fight with her sister over their parents’ estate. A federal discrimination complaint against a former employer. Dueling lawsuits from a romance that ended badly. And, finally, bankruptcy.
Unable to afford a lawyer, she often represented herself. By her own telling, she was always the victim.
A cancer diagnosis in 2021 complicated everything.
By the time she lost the house, Morawski, 60, had accumulated more than $100,000 in unpaid taxes and fees, a burden that was further exacerbated by a state law heavily weighted toward real estate speculators. New Jersey is one of just a dozen states that permit investors to make huge profits on the debt of struggling homeowners, ultimately allowing them to foreclose on the property and keep all the profit.
“This has been an egregious travesty of justice,” she wrote in a letter to local officials shortly before the fire. “I need immediate help to stop the steal of my home.”
‘The house and legacy I need to save!’
Morawski’s childhood home on Maplewood Avenue sits three blocks from a commuter rail station and the quaint storefronts at the center of town, a pedestrian-friendly hub that residents call “the village.” Always considered a desirable community, Maplewood drew a flood of new buyers during the pandemic, and recent sales of renovated houses on the street have ranged from $755,000 to $1.6 million.
Long before the fire, the house was notable for its peeling buckskin-beige paint and tattered roof, outward signs of the difficulty Morawski had keeping up with repairs and household bills. But she was determined to hold on.
“The house and legacy I need to save!” she wrote on a GoFundMe page a friend created in 2019.
Details of Morawski’s fight to save the house are based on more than two dozen interviews with neighbors, friends, community leaders and lawyers, as well as tax documents, federal, state and county court records and her own social media posts.
After divorcing her first husband, who was in the Navy and stationed in Hawaii, she returned to Maplewood in 2000 to care for her ailing parents. She worked briefly for a management consulting firm and sometimes gave historical walking tours, but had trouble finding full-time work. An assortment of part-time jobs as a swim instructor ended with the onset of the pandemic.
But she had struggled to make ends meet since at least 2010. Desperate for money, she sold her burial plot, patched her leaky roof with tarps and, unable to buy a new water heater, took to showering at a YMCA.
“I have never said I do not owe back taxes + obscene interest,” she wrote to township leaders, “but the global pandemic impacted the intended course of action.”
She had been advised to sell the house rather than lose the accrued equity in a property that real estate sites valued at roughly $700,000 before the fire, friends, relatives and town officials said. The conversations never went far.
“She just wanted to stay in the home she grew up in,” said Andy Golebiowski, host of the Polish American Radio Program, who met Morawski on Facebook. “Those were her roots.”
Morawski spoke proudly of those roots when she accepted the Holocaust education award.
Her father, Michael (Szeliga) Morawski, earned Poland’s highest military honor, the Virtuti Militari. He had been imprisoned, she said, in concentration camps after trying to drive the Germans from the capital during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, a rebellion that lasted 63 days and led to the deaths of more than 180,000 residents.
Wanda Morawski, a nurse born in what was then the Polish city of Borszczow (it is now part of Ukraine), ran field hospitals for the Allied forces during the war after being freed from a prison in Russia, according to her 2002 obituary.
After marrying in England and moving to Brooklyn, the couple spent 10 years “saving every penny” to buy “their American dream,” Morawski wrote.
Over the next four decades, their house in Maplewood was often filled with recent immigrants of various faiths. Her mother “would order, then pick up, kosher in Brooklyn,” Morawski said at the Holocaust remembrance event. “Everyone would speak Polish and feel comfortable for a few hours as they navigated a challenging new world.”
Morawski’s parents died within five months of each other, leaving a contested estate that led to a bitter fight between the two sisters for control of the house. In the end, Morawski was instructed to pay her sister $130,000 and was awarded the house. Her sister won title to another residential property that was in their parents’ name but was told by the court that she had “no right to enter the premises” at 60 Maplewood Avenue.
Morawski’s sister said she drove by the home each day for 15 years.
Mental health concerns
Morawski was often spotted on the block walking her dog, Hana, or tending to repairs of her 1992 Dodge Dakota. She was quick with a compliment and eagerly asked about neighbors’ children.
“Always seemed to be in the same mood — pleasant,” said Kevin Photiades, who lives down the street.
“She’s a wonderful, generous, amazing person,” said Kim Brown, a friend who remained close with Morawski after they worked together in the early 1990s at a consulting firm in Linden, New Jersey.
“I couldn’t imagine, emotionally, what she was going through.”
Morawski wrote about her financial trouble on social media as foreclosure loomed in 2019 and later discussed her battle with blood cancer.
Neighbors said that they had donated to the GoFundMe campaign or lent her money directly. Friends wrote to the township’s congresswoman to ask for help and dropped off soup and meals. A member of her historical book club regularly drove her to chemotherapy.
But as the date of her eviction neared in December, close friends grew increasingly worried about her mental health. She appeared to have no future plans other than lashing out publicly against the injustice she believed had caused her to lose the house.
A federal judge assigned to Morawski’s bankruptcy case, who had attended high school with her, was “heartless and biased,” she complained to the chief judge of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. “A smart, smug jock, the epitome of a privileged white male.”
A state judge who signed the eviction order was “ridiculously obsequious to the opposing attorney, who was mocking and mean to me.”
She publicly suggested that she was considering suicide. “I expect this is the last letter I will ever write,” she said in a letter to the bankruptcy judge three days before the fire. “Too bad, because I had a LOT left to offer.”
That same day, she dropped Hana at Brown’s house. The next night, she left several cherished family mementos on the back porch of her sister’s house and emailed a niece to let her know they were there.
A friend called the police and asked officers to conduct a wellness check. They arrived at the house around dinnertime, and Morawski was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where she spent 25 hours under psychiatric evaluation, according to her lawyer and a message she posted on Facebook.
She was cleared to leave hours after the eviction order became final and the locks to the house were changed.
Tax liens as investments
Many of Morawski’s problems stemmed from the difficulty she had paying taxes on the house at 60 Maplewood, a home her parents purchased in 1962 and had long ago paid off.
New Jersey requires communities to auction off unpaid tax and sewer debts annually. The buyers — lien holders — can charge 18% interest on debt over $1,500 and are entitled to pay any future overdue taxes on the property, expanding their investment and its steep rate of return. Bidding is often aggressive, particularly for desirable properties in affluent or gentrifying towns.
After two years, if the debt is unpaid, investors can foreclose on the property.
Unlike most other states, New Jersey permits the lien holder to keep all resale profit. Former owners get back none of their accrued equity, no matter the size of the original debt.
“When people hear about it, they think, ‘This can’t be the whole story,’” said Christina Martin, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit that tracks lien sale foreclosures nationwide. “But it is the whole story. Government thinks it can take a windfall at the expense of society’s most vulnerable people and either keep it for the public purse or give it away to private investors for their enrichment.
“Either way, it’s gross,” Martin said.
Lawyers for the foundation are preparing to argue that the practice — they call it “home equity theft” — violates the Constitution in a Minnesota case that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in January to hear.
Between 2014 and 2021, in 31 of New Jersey’s largest communities, the owners of 661 residential properties lost homes after a foreclosure that resulted from tax or sewer debt, according to an analysis by the legal foundation. The owners forfeited roughly $115 million in equity, the group found.
The lien that led to the loss of Morawski’s house dated to 2016, when Effect Lake LLC, a Virginia-based company run by Peter Chinloy, a former Temple University professor, and his son, was the winning bidder at an October tax-certificate auction.
Three-quarters of Morawski’s unpaid taxes from 2015, $12,809, plus penalties, were put up for sale.
Competition was brisk. To win the right to buy the lien, Effect Lake not only agreed to charge zero-percent interest on the initial debt, but it paid Maplewood a $92,800 premium to do so — a routine practice used to outbid competitors.
Within weeks Effect Lake had also written checks for the $17,360.04 in taxes Morawski failed to pay in 2016, debt that would grow by the maximum 18% interest rate. The Chinloys’ company also paid all the taxes and sewer fees for the next three years.
Morawski would later say that Effect Lake deliberately mailed crucial legal notices too late for her to respond. “Real estate investors,” she wrote, “have aggressively and ruthlessly pursued foreclosure of my property so they can flip it.”
Her sister said she offered to pay the roughly $110,000 debt in exchange for the deed to the house — a deal Morawski found unfair and refused to accept.
In 2019, Effect Lake began foreclosure proceedings.
And on Jan. 30, 2020, after an investment of roughly $175,000, it held the deed to a home worth at least three times that much. Soon after, Morawski filed for bankruptcy, arguing that the property transfer had been fraudulent, a claim the judge rejected.
While fighting to save the house in bankruptcy court, she was also undergoing chemotherapy treatments that she said sapped her energy and left her unable to focus — conditions she believed should have led the court to slow the process down.
Chinloy, who earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard and was the director of real estate programs at Temple’s business school until 2020, has written extensively about investor real estate strategies and home foreclosures. He declined to comment for this article.
‘Over her dead body’
The day of the fire Morawski lit five matches at strategic points on the first, second and third floors of the house, according to a police report.
Then she walked to the basement, “laid down on a couch and proceeded to stab herself with a knife four times in the chest,” a detective wrote.
Neighbors watched as she was taken out on a stretcher and rushed to a hospital.
Three days later, charged with aggravated arson and burglary, she was transferred to a jail in Newark. A not-guilty plea was entered on her behalf for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of more than 10 years in prison.
Her lawyer, Lisa Lopata, a public defender, stressed that Morawski was “at a very low point,” and that she “deeply regrets what happened, especially the idea that anyone could have been put at risk.”
A prosecutor, Adam Wells, argued against her release from jail, in part because of her apparent determination to risk it all to make a defiant final point.
“She made a statement and apologized for her own cliché,” Wells told a judge on Jan. 13, “that over her dead body would anyone take the house.”
Ten hours later, after more than a month in custody, Morawski walked out of jail alone wearing borrowed, oversize clothes. She waited in the dark at a nearby New Jersey Transit bus stop and transferred at Newark Penn Station, en route to a friend’s apartment in South Orange, New Jersey, where she remains in home detention.
“These property tax lien holders have gotten away with everything,” Morawski said in an interview.
“If I start crying, I’m just afraid that I won’t stop.”
Weeks after the blaze, much of the first floor of the house appeared intact, largely untouched by flames. But out front, a haunting reminder of the saga’s explosive end remained etched into a sidewalk poured months ago.
“EVE M LIVED HERE 1962-2022,” Morawski had carved into the wet concrete. “LIVE. ALOHA.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Wall Street's bang to start the year got even bigger Thursday, as tech stocks and a surge for Facebook's parent company led the market higher.
The S&P 500 rallied 1.5 percent a day after hitting its best level since August. The Nasdaq composite soared 3.3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged because it has less of an emphasis on tech. It slipped 39 points, or 0.1 percent.
Meta helped lead the way with a 23.3 percent leap after it reported better revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected and said it expects to spend less this year than earlier forecast. While its latest profit fell short of expectations, Facebook's parent also announced a program to buy back $ 40 billion of its stock.
Stocks had already been on the upswing through the start of the year on hopes that the Federal Reserve may be set to pause soon on its hikes to interest rates. Such increases help stamp out inflation but also hurt the economy and investment prices.
A day earlier, stocks and bonds took off after Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank is finally starting to see progress in its battle against inflation. Markets took that as a cue that a pause may indeed be imminent, and investors even raised bets for cuts to rates late this year. Rate cuts act like steroids for markets, juicing prices and providing support for the economy.
That's despite Mr. Powell saying on Wednesday that more rate hikes will likely be appropriate to get inflation down to the Fed's target. He also said he did not foresee any rate cuts in 2023 and again pledged to "stay the course until the job is done" on beating inflation.
"The market is saying the Fed may have its cake and eat it, too: inflation falling and growth not falling off a cliff so far," said Ella Hoxha, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management.
She said the market seems to be putting a 75 percent probability on the Fed engineering a "soft landing" for the economy, where inflation can drop from its soaring heights without sending the economy into a painful recession.
"We would say at best it's 50 percent, potentially lower," Hoxha said.
She said there's still a risk that the Fed will have to hold a tougher line on rates than markets expect if the U.S. labor market remains tight. That gives her pause as stock and bond prices rally so strongly around the world.
"It does feel like the market wants to pick pennies in front of a steamroller," she said.
Thursday's rally stretched across the Atlantic, where markets rose after central banks for Europe and Britain also raised rates in their efforts to squelch inflation.
The European Central Bank raised its key rate by 0.50 percentage points and said another would arrive next month. The Bank of England also raised its key rate by half a percentage point and said it's seeing signs that inflation has turned the corner, though it also stressed it's too soon to declare victory over inflation.
The next milepost for the U.S. market is Friday morning's jobs report, which economists expect will show a slowdown in hiring. The job market has largely remained resilient in the face of swift rate hikes by the Fed over the last year.
Tech companies have announced high-profile layoffs recently, but a report on Thursday suggested job cuts are not that widespread. Fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, and the number dropped to its lowest level since April.
Treasury yields dipped further Thursday, an indication of expectations for an easier Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.4 percent. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.09 percent.

MAPLEWOOD, N.J. — It was dark by the time Eve Morawski managed to break into her home of 60 years.
The locks had been changed by sheriff’s deputies enforcing an eviction order. Movers hired by investors who took possession of the house after she fell behind on taxes had been inside most of the day, packing up photos and knickknacks her family had spent a lifetime accumulating.
She was infuriated to find the house in disarray.

Morawski’s childhood home on Maplewood Avenue sits three blocks from a commuter rail station and the quaint storefronts at the center of town, a pedestrian-friendly hub that residents call “the village.” Always considered a desirable community, Maplewood drew a flood of new buyers during the pandemic, and recent sales of renovated houses on the street have ranged from $755,000 to $1.6 million.
Long before the fire, the house was notable for its peeling buckskin-beige paint and tattered roof, outward signs of the difficulty Morawski had keeping up with repairs and household bills. But she was determined to hold on.
“The house and legacy I need to save!” she wrote on a GoFundMe page a friend created in 2019.
Details of Morawski’s fight to save the house are based on more than two dozen interviews with neighbors, friends, community leaders and lawyers, as well as tax documents, federal, state and county court records and her own social media posts.
After divorcing her first husband, who was in the Navy and stationed in Hawaii, she returned to Maplewood in 2000 to care for her ailing parents. She worked briefly for a management consulting firm and sometimes gave historical walking tours, but had trouble finding full-time work. An assortment of part-time jobs as a swim instructor ended with the onset of the pandemic.
But she had struggled to make ends meet since at least 2010. Desperate for money, she sold her burial plot, patched her leaky roof with tarps and, unable to buy a new water heater, took to showering at a YMCA.
“I have never said I do not owe back taxes + obscene interest,” she wrote to township leaders, “but the global pandemic impacted the intended course of action.”
She had been advised to sell the house rather than lose the accrued equity in a property that real estate sites valued at roughly $700,000 before the fire, friends, relatives and town officials said. The conversations never went far.
“She just wanted to stay in the home she grew up in,” said Andy Golebiowski, host of the Polish American Radio Program, who met Morawski on Facebook. “Those were her roots.”
Morawski spoke proudly of those roots when she accepted the Holocaust education award.
Her father, Michael (Szeliga) Morawski, earned Poland’s highest military honor, the Virtuti Militari. He had been imprisoned, she said, in concentration camps after trying to drive the Germans from the capital during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, a rebellion that lasted 63 days and led to the deaths of more than 180,000 residents.
Wanda Morawski, a nurse born in what was then the Polish city of Borszczow (it is now part of Ukraine), ran field hospitals for the Allied forces during the war after being freed from a prison in Russia, according to her 2002 obituary.
After marrying in England and moving to Brooklyn, the couple spent 10 years “saving every penny” to buy “their American dream,” Morawski wrote.
Over the next four decades, their house in Maplewood was often filled with recent immigrants of various faiths. Her mother “would order, then pick up, kosher in Brooklyn,” Morawski said at the Holocaust remembrance event. “Everyone would speak Polish and feel comfortable for a few hours as they navigated a challenging new world.”
Morawski’s parents died within five months of each other, leaving a contested estate that led to a bitter fight between the two sisters for control of the house. In the end, Morawski was instructed to pay her sister $130,000 and was awarded the house. Her sister won title to another residential property that was in their parents’ name but was told by the court that she had “no right to enter the premises” at 60 Maplewood Avenue.
Morawski’s sister said she drove by the home each day for 15 years.
Mental health concerns
Morawski was often spotted on the block walking her dog, Hana, or tending to repairs of her 1992 Dodge Dakota. She was quick with a compliment and eagerly asked about neighbors’ children.
“Always seemed to be in the same mood — pleasant,” said Kevin Photiades, who lives down the street.
“She’s a wonderful, generous, amazing person,” said Kim Brown, a friend who remained close with Morawski after they worked together in the early 1990s at a consulting firm in Linden, New Jersey.
“I couldn’t imagine, emotionally, what she was going through.”
Morawski wrote about her financial trouble on social media as foreclosure loomed in 2019 and later discussed her battle with blood cancer.
Neighbors said that they had donated to the GoFundMe campaign or lent her money directly. Friends wrote to the township’s congresswoman to ask for help and dropped off soup and meals. A member of her historical book club regularly drove her to chemotherapy.
But as the date of her eviction neared in December, close friends grew increasingly worried about her mental health. She appeared to have no future plans other than lashing out publicly against the injustice she believed had caused her to lose the house.
A federal judge assigned to Morawski’s bankruptcy case, who had attended high school with her, was “heartless and biased,” she complained to the chief judge of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. “A smart, smug jock, the epitome of a privileged white male.”
A state judge who signed the eviction order was “ridiculously obsequious to the opposing attorney, who was mocking and mean to me.”
She publicly suggested that she was considering suicide. “I expect this is the last letter I will ever write,” she said in a letter to the bankruptcy judge three days before the fire. “Too bad, because I had a LOT left to offer.”
That same day, she dropped Hana at Brown’s house. The next night, she left several cherished family mementos on the back porch of her sister’s house and emailed a niece to let her know they were there.
A friend called the police and asked officers to conduct a wellness check. They arrived at the house around dinnertime, and Morawski was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where she spent 25 hours under psychiatric evaluation, according to her lawyer and a message she posted on Facebook.
She was cleared to leave hours after the eviction order became final and the locks to the house were changed.
Tax liens as investments
Many of Morawski’s problems stemmed from the difficulty she had paying taxes on the house at 60 Maplewood, a home her parents purchased in 1962 and had long ago paid off.
New Jersey requires communities to auction off unpaid tax and sewer debts annually. The buyers — lien holders — can charge 18% interest on debt over $1,500 and are entitled to pay any future overdue taxes on the property, expanding their investment and its steep rate of return. Bidding is often aggressive, particularly for desirable properties in affluent or gentrifying towns.
After two years, if the debt is unpaid, investors can foreclose on the property.
Unlike most other states, New Jersey permits the lien holder to keep all resale profit. Former owners get back none of their accrued equity, no matter the size of the original debt.
“When people hear about it, they think, ‘This can’t be the whole story,’” said Christina Martin, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit that tracks lien sale foreclosures nationwide. “But it is the whole story. Government thinks it can take a windfall at the expense of society’s most vulnerable people and either keep it for the public purse or give it away to private investors for their enrichment.
“Either way, it’s gross,” Martin said.
Lawyers for the foundation are preparing to argue that the practice — they call it “home equity theft” — violates the Constitution in a Minnesota case that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in January to hear.
Between 2014 and 2021, in 31 of New Jersey’s largest communities, the owners of 661 residential properties lost homes after a foreclosure that resulted from tax or sewer debt, according to an analysis by the legal foundation. The owners forfeited roughly $115 million in equity, the group found.
The lien that led to the loss of Morawski’s house dated to 2016, when Effect Lake LLC, a Virginia-based company run by Peter Chinloy, a former Temple University professor, and his son, was the winning bidder at an October tax-certificate auction.
Three-quarters of Morawski’s unpaid taxes from 2015, $12,809, plus penalties, were put up for sale.
Competition was brisk. To win the right to buy the lien, Effect Lake not only agreed to charge zero-percent interest on the initial debt, but it paid Maplewood a $92,800 premium to do so — a routine practice used to outbid competitors.
Within weeks Effect Lake had also written checks for the $17,360.04 in taxes Morawski failed to pay in 2016, debt that would grow by the maximum 18% interest rate. The Chinloys’ company also paid all the taxes and sewer fees for the next three years.
Morawski would later say that Effect Lake deliberately mailed crucial legal notices too late for her to respond. “Real estate investors,” she wrote, “have aggressively and ruthlessly pursued foreclosure of my property so they can flip it.”
Her sister said she offered to pay the roughly $110,000 debt in exchange for the deed to the house — a deal Morawski found unfair and refused to accept.
In 2019, Effect Lake began foreclosure proceedings.
And on Jan. 30, 2020, after an investment of roughly $175,000, it held the deed to a home worth at least three times that much. Soon after, Morawski filed for bankruptcy, arguing that the property transfer had been fraudulent, a claim the judge rejected.
While fighting to save the house in bankruptcy court, she was also undergoing chemotherapy treatments that she said sapped her energy and left her unable to focus — conditions she believed should have led the court to slow the process down.
Chinloy, who earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard and was the director of real estate programs at Temple’s business school until 2020, has written extensively about investor real estate strategies and home foreclosures. He declined to comment for this article.
‘Over her dead body’
The day of the fire Morawski lit five matches at strategic points on the first, second and third floors of the house, according to a police report.
Then she walked to the basement, “laid down on a couch and proceeded to stab herself with a knife four times in the chest,” a detective wrote.
Neighbors watched as she was taken out on a stretcher and rushed to a hospital.
Three days later, charged with aggravated arson and burglary, she was transferred to a jail in Newark. A not-guilty plea was entered on her behalf for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of more than 10 years in prison.
Her lawyer, Lisa Lopata, a public defender, stressed that Morawski was “at a very low point,” and that she “deeply regrets what happened, especially the idea that anyone could have been put at risk.”
A prosecutor, Adam Wells, argued against her release from jail, in part because of her apparent determination to risk it all to make a defiant final point.
“She made a statement and apologized for her own cliché,” Wells told a judge on Jan. 13, “that over her dead body would anyone take the house.”
Ten hours later, after more than a month in custody, Morawski walked out of jail alone wearing borrowed, oversize clothes. She waited in the dark at a nearby New Jersey Transit bus stop and transferred at Newark Penn Station, en route to a friend’s apartment in South Orange, New Jersey, where she remains in home detention.
“These property tax lien holders have gotten away with everything,” Morawski said in an interview.
“If I start crying, I’m just afraid that I won’t stop.”
Weeks after the blaze, much of the first floor of the house appeared intact, largely untouched by flames. But out front, a haunting reminder of the saga’s explosive end remained etched into a sidewalk poured months ago.
“EVE M LIVED HERE 1962-2022,” Morawski had carved into the wet concrete. “LIVE. ALOHA.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Today's Column Was Brought to You With the Help of A.I. Bots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: ChatGPT isn't the only writing assistant that has emerged to replace editors. We tested it alongside two others to assess their strengths and weaknesses.
Plagiarizing essays. Cheating on tests. Spreading misinformation. The advent of new, powerful artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has sparked concerns about the unintended consequences of the technology and debate over the ethical implications of its use.
Despite concerns, A.I. assistants seem here to stay. After ChatGPT's splashy debut late last year, Microsoft invested $ 10 billion in OpenAI, the lab behind the chatbot. The threat from a rival forced Google to regroup. And the media site BuzzFeed recently announced that it would use A.I. to write online quizzes and other content.
Given the growing influence of this technology, it's time to focus on how we can start reaping the benefits in a responsible way. Many A.I. experts and computer scientists agree that these tools can provide a major perk that does no harm: editing our writing.
In this context, we would still be using our skills and brainpower to do the hard work of making sense of information and coming up with new ideas, while turning to A.I. for some light assistance, such as making a sentence sound more conversational, sprinkling in some historical context or even adding a joke.
For several days, I tested Wordtune Spices and Rytr, two A.I. writing assistants released by start-ups in the last two years, and compared them with ChatGPT. I'll go over some examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three tools.
Test 1: Rewriting a Sentence
To use Wordtune Spices, which the Israeli start-up AI21 Labs released last month, you insert text into a box, highlight the sentences you want edited and then click on options to make improvements. Among its best uses during my recent test were quick rewrites of sentences.
For example, I took this sentence from my column last week about email addresses and privacy:
When you browse the web, an increasing number of sites and apps are asking for a piece of basic information that you probably hand over without hesitation: your email address.
Then I clicked the "Rewrite" button. Wordtune Spices shot back a list of options for revisions of the sentence. I liked this one best:
Your email address is one of the most basic pieces of info that is being requested by more and more websites and apps.
My original sentence included a significant detail to me -- that we hand over our email addresses without hesitation -- but the tool trimmed a few words to cut to the chase and summarize the heart of the problem. Not bad.
Test 2: Catching Grammatical Errors
Rytr, an A.I. writing assistant released in 2021 by a company of the same name, was designed to streamline the creation of blog posts and marketing copy. It was proficient at catching grammatical errors (as, similarly, word-processing tools like Microsoft Word have been doing for decades).
In my test, I took this paragraph, which has intentional errors, from an educational website that provides editing exercises:
Facebook, with more then 1 Billion users Is celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launching by Mark Zuckerberg at 4th February 2004. The site was Conceived in a Harvard dorm in a way To connect student and let them build an Identity for himself online.
Then in Rytr, I highlighted the paragraph and clicked "Improve." It gave me this:
Facebook, with more than 1 billion users, celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4th, 2004. The site was conceived in a Harvard dorm as a way to connect students and let them build an identity for themselves online.
The tool automatically rewrote an error-free version of the paragraph. This could be extremely handy as a study tool or for non-native English speakers.
Test 3: Adding Context
Wordtune Spices also excelled at fleshing out paragraphs with additional context. By pressing the + button, you can add color and background information to a piece of text by inserting historical data, a joke and an example to prove your point.
For example, I took this paragraph from my column last week:
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital bread crumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads.
In Wordtune Spices, I clicked the + button to add an example, a historical fact and a joke. (Changes in bold.)
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. For example, by tracking your purchases, companies can recommend products or services that are relevant to you. The first email marketing blast was sent in 1978 by a man named Gary Thuerk who worked for Digital Equipment Corp. And with that, Gary Thuerk was sent down in history as the world's first 'Spam' Lord!
After doing some research, I was impressed to learn that 1978 was indeed when email was first used for marketing. The example of using email receipts to serve targeted ads was also accurate. The joke wasn't very funny, but it lightened things up.
Test 4: Ending This Column
Last, I pasted this entire column into each writing assistant to see if it could come up with a kicker, or a clever conclusion to wrap this all up.
ChatGPT was the only one of the three that was able to read the entire text to generate a plausible conclusion:
With A.I. writing assistants like ChatGPT, Wordtune Spices, and Rytr, we have a powerful tool to enhance our writing - but only if we use it responsibly.
Wordtune Spices produced an unusable takeaway:
With the help of writing assistants, I was able to finish this column with a well-crafted conclusion that ties together all the points I have discussed.
Rytr did, um, something:
Coaches in the National Football League earn an average of $ 2,000,000 annually.
AI21 Labs, the Israeli start-up that developed Wordtune Spices, said current A.I. writing technology required more guidance from the user than the prompt I had given the tools. Rytr said its users could use a feedback tool to train its A.I. in the event that something went wrong. OpenAI declined to comment.
All this shows that artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for improving our work. I was surprised by some of the results -- in particular, that Wordtune Spices could add accurate and relevant background information. I may occasionally use the tool for suggestions on fleshing out paragraphs with some historical data, though I will then check the facts before publishing them.
And in general, the A.I. bots were useful for sharpening prose and cleaning up clunky, ungrammatical sentences.
What the bots couldn't do, however, was the research or reporting to show their strengths and weaknesses. That requires thought.

Judge Says No to Effort To Block Meta V.R. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The ruling is a defeat for the Federal Trade Commission, which used a rare antitrust argument to try to block Meta's acquisition of a small start-up.
A federal judge has rejected the Federal Trade Commission's request to stop Meta, Facebook's parent company, from buying a small virtual reality start-up, two people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling that efforts to rein in the tech giants may struggle in courts.
In a sealed order issued late Tuesday, Judge Edward J. Davila of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined the F.T.C.'s demand for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual reality fitness game called Supernatural, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the orders are sealed.
Judge Davila also issued a restraining order blocking the $ 400 million deal from closing through Tuesday, allowing the F.T.C. time to decide whether it wants to appeal the ruling, one of the people said.
The loss is a stinging defeat for the F.T.C.'s chair, Lina Khan, and her broader efforts to expand the boundaries of antitrust law to better regulate the tech giants. The case was aimed at testing that line with a rarely used legal argument that Meta's deal would hinder future competition in an undeveloped market, as opposed to a more traditional case that would focus on a mature economic area.
Ms. Khan has argued that the F.T.C. should file more novel cases if it wants to properly nurture competition in the modern economy. She has acknowledged that the agency must be willing to lose in some of them.
The ruling is "a blow to the administration's and the F.T.C.'s interest in being stronger in merger enforcement," said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. She added that the agency clearly saw benefits to bringing risky cases to draw attention to what it considered the poor state of antitrust law.
The decision was a vindication for Meta, which had argued in court that it was trying to create a platform that would be welcoming for all virtual reality apps, including those developed independently. The company has invested billions of dollars in becoming a powerhouse of the so-called metaverse, where users work, play and consume content through virtual and augmented reality. It has acquired virtual reality content studios and Oculus, a company that makes the headsets people use to view that content.
Meta, which reported a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge in its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesman for the F.T.C. said the agency was "not able to comment at this time" to respect the court's seal order.
Bloomberg earlier reported Judge Davila's decision.
The F.T.C. sued Meta in July in federal court to temporarily halt the deal, and then asked its in-house court in August to fully block the acquisition. The F.T.C. will have to decide whether to proceed with its in-house challenge despite the ruling.
The lawsuit was the first of the cases developed entirely under Ms. Khan, a legal scholar who rose to prominence after she wrote a critique of Amazon that went viral, to be filed in court. Looking to prevent more "vertical" deals, in which the two companies don't compete directly, the F.T.C. also challenged Microsoft's $ 69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in December. Last month, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites.
William E. Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman, said the sealed ruling in the Meta case would be more problematic for the agency if the judge panned the legal theories underpinning the challenge. But if Judge Davila saw the F.T.C.'s more novel approach as plausible -- even if the agency's factual assertions were weak in this case -- "that's a low-impact defeat" less likely to hurt its future efforts, Mr. Kovacic said.
The case was heard in San Jose, Calif., in December. During the seven-day hearing, Meta's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, testified. The F.T.C. argued that if Meta did not buy Supernatural, it would develop its own virtual reality fitness game.
Meta's case rested on proving that developing or acquiring a fitness app was just a small part of a strategy that would eventually push virtual reality, and by extension the metaverse, into wide popularity.
During the hearing, an F.T.C. lawyer asked Mr. Zuckerberg if it was true that acquiring or developing a fitness app kept him up at night. Fitness apps, Mr. Zuckerberg said, were just one type of app that the company was interested in.
"Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important," he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Mr. Zuckerberg also told Judge Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would "have a chilling effect."
"Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward," Mr. Zuckerberg said. "That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space."

Meta Posts $4.2 Billion Restructuring Charge for the Fourth Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company, which is in the midst of shifting to become a metaverse business, also forecast revenue would beat Wall Street predictions.
Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, has spent months cutting costs at his company to appease investors, fix its flagging stock price and reshape the business. But first, he will have to pay up.
On Wednesday, Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, reported that it was taking a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge for the fourth quarter. The charge included costs for the early termination of some office-space leases, redesigns of some data center projects and severance for employees who were laid off last year. The company expects another $ 1 billion in restructuring costs in 2023.
The charge dragged down Meta's profits, with net income falling 55 percent to $ 4.65 billion in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Meta also continued to spend heavily on Mr. Zuckerberg's shift to the so-called metaverse, with costs rising 22 percent from a year earlier.
Revenue fell 4 percent to $ 32.16 billion from a year earlier, coming in at the higher end of the company's guidance and above Wall Street predictions. Meta also said it planned to rein in capital expenditures, largely by making changes to its data centers -- which undergird its apps and infrastructure -- and cutting back on the real estate required to run them.
The company forecast revenue in the current quarter of $ 26 billion to $ 28.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations. And it authorized a further $ 40 billion in stock buybacks, after repurchasing roughly $ 28 billion of its own shares last year.
"Our management theme for 2023 is the 'Year of Efficiency' and we're focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization," Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement.
Meta's stock surged more than 19 percent in after-hours trading.
The results follow several quarters of slowing growth and a first-ever revenue decline last summer as Meta's woes mounted. Like other tech companies, the social network has been battered by a difficult economic climate, as inflation and interest rates have risen, causing marketers to rein in spending on digital advertising. War in Eastern Europe has also heightened uncertainty in the global economy.
Macroeconomic issues aside, Meta faces acute challenges. After 18-plus years of rocket-ship growth of user and revenue, the company runs the risk of churning through its longtime users as they depart for greener pastures found in newer apps like TikTok, the short-form video app. Mr. Zuckerberg considers TikTok one of his most formidable opponents.
Still, Facebook's new users rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter, surpassing two billion daily active users for the app for the first time.
Meta also continues to feel the squeeze of Apple, which in recent years has put in place a series of privacy changes to its iOS software, hamstringing Facebook and Instagram's ad-targeting abilities and causing the company to hemorrhage cash.
Perhaps Mr. Zuckerberg's largest problem with shareholders is of his own making. He is pursuing his vision of the metaverse, a next-generation version of the internet he believes will connect different worlds, from augmented and virtual reality to different kinds of gaming worlds and other experiences. That work is being done at the company's Reality Labs division, which is run by Mr. Zuckerberg's longtime confidant and Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, better known as Boz.
That was not a problem when Mr. Zuckerberg was putting up steady, reliable growth quarter after quarter. But given the high spending and difficult economic climate, analysts have raised concerns about the viability of Mr. Zuckerberg's grandiose plans -- concerns he has largely ignored.
"I think this is going to be a very important thing, and I think it would be a mistake for us to not focus on any of these areas, which I think are going to be fundamentally important to the future," he said in a call with investors last year.
To make up for the continued spending on the metaverse, the company has spent the past six months trying to trim costs. It has largely cut perks and nonessential travel for employees. It cut 13 percent of its work force in November, eliminating the positions of roughly 11,000 of its employees, especially in the recruiting and business divisions.
Mr. Zuckerberg blamed the global economic slowdown for the layoffs. But he also blamed himself, in part, as he and other tech executives pointed to their overhiring exuberance in the early days of the pandemic. As the world was ordered to shelter in place, the pandemic brought with it a surge of people relying on online products and services more than ever before, which in turn caused tech companies to add new positions at a rapid clip.
Mr. Zuckerberg and others admitted they had been too quick to estimate that a largely digital life was the new reality for many, even as that reality shifted again with the advent of vaccines and as more people ventured back into the physical world more freely.
Mr. Zuckerberg has said Meta's best days remain ahead of it. The company has invested in artificial intelligence in hopes of improving its business over time. Better A.I., he has said, will drive better content recommendations across the company's marquee products -- like Reels, the TikTok-like video feature inside of Instagram and Facebook -- which in turn will result in people spending more time across its family of apps.

A federal judge has rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to stop Meta, Facebook’s parent company, from buying a small virtual-reality startup, two people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling that efforts to rein in the tech giants may struggle in courts.
In a sealed order issued late Tuesday, Judge Edward J. Davila of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined the FTC’s demand for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual-reality fitness game called “Supernatural,” said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the orders are sealed.
Davila also issued a restraining order blocking the $400 million deal from closing through Feb. 7, allowing the FTC time to decide whether it wants to appeal the ruling, one of the people said.
The loss is a stinging defeat for the FTC’s chair, Lina Khan, and her broader efforts to expand the boundaries of antitrust law to better regulate the tech giants. The case was aimed at testing that line with a rarely used legal argument that Meta’s deal would hinder future competition in an undeveloped market, as opposed to a more traditional case that would focus on a mature economic area.
Khan has argued the FTC should file more novel cases if it wants to properly nurture competition in the modern economy. She has acknowledged that the agency must be willing to lose in some of them.
The ruling is “a blow to the administration’s and the FTC’s interest in being stronger in merger enforcement,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. She added that the agency clearly saw benefits to bringing risky cases to draw attention to what it considers the poor state of antitrust law.
The decision was a vindication for Meta, which had argued in court that it was trying to create a platform that would be welcoming for all virtual-reality apps, including those developed independently. The company has invested billions of dollars in becoming a powerhouse of the so-called metaverse, where users work, play and consume content through virtual and augmented reality. It has acquired virtual-reality content studios and Oculus, a company that makes the headsets people use to view that content.
Meta, which reported a $4.2 billion restructuring charge in its quarterly earnings Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the FTC said the agency was “not able to comment at this time” to respect the court’s seal order.
Bloomberg earlier reported Davila’s decision.
The FTC sued Meta in July in federal court to temporarily halt the deal, and then asked its in-house court in August to fully block the acquisition. The FTC will have to decide whether to proceed with its in-house challenge despite the ruling.
The lawsuit was the first of the cases developed entirely under Khan, a legal scholar who rose to prominence after she wrote a critique of Amazon that went viral, to be filed in court. Looking to prevent more “vertical” deals, in which the two companies don’t compete directly, the FTC also challenged Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of video game publisher Activision Blizzard in December. Last month, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites.
William E. Kovacic, a former FTC chair, said the sealed ruling in the Meta case would be more problematic for the agency if the judge panned the legal theories underpinning the challenge. But if Davila saw the FTC’s more novel approach as plausible — even if the agency’s factual assertions were weak in this case — “that’s a low-impact defeat” less likely to hurt its future efforts, Kovacic said.
The case was heard in San Jose, California, in December. During the seven-day hearing, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, testified. The FTC argued that if Meta did not buy “Supernatural,” it would develop its own virtual reality fitness game.
Meta’s case rested on proving that developing or acquiring a fitness app was just a small part of a strategy that would eventually push virtual reality, and by extension the metaverse, into wide popularity.
During the hearing, an FTC lawyer asked Zuckerberg if it was true that acquiring or developing a fitness app kept him up at night. Fitness apps, Zuckerberg said, were just one type of app that the company was interested in.
“Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important,” he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Zuckerberg also told Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would “have a chilling effect.”
“Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward,” Zuckerberg said. “That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

AI Bots Can’t Report This Column. But They Can Improve It.

Plagiarizing essays. Cheating on tests. Spreading misinformation. The advent of new, powerful artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has sparked concerns about the unintended consequences of the technology and debate over the ethical implications of its use.
Despite concerns, AI assistants seem here to stay. After ChatGPT’s splashy debut late last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI, the lab behind the chatbot. The threat from a rival forced Google to regroup. And the media site BuzzFeed recently announced that it would use AI to write online quizzes and other content.
Given the growing influence of this technology, it’s time to focus on how we can start reaping the benefits in a responsible way. Many AI experts and computer scientists agree that these tools can provide a major perk that does no harm: editing our writing.
In this context, we would still be using our skills and brainpower to do the hard work of making sense of information and coming up with new ideas while turning to AI for some light assistance, such as making a sentence sound more conversational, sprinkling in some historical context or even adding a joke.
For several days, I tested Wordtune Spices and Rytr, two AI writing assistants released by startups in the last two years, and compared them with ChatGPT. I’ll go over some examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three tools.
Test 1: Rewriting a Sentence
To use Wordtune Spices, which the Israeli startup AI21 Labs released last month, you insert text into a box, highlight the sentences you want edited and then click on options to make improvements. Among its best uses during my recent test were quick rewrites of sentences.
For example, I took this sentence from my column last week about email addresses and privacy:
When you browse the web, an increasing number of sites and apps are asking for a piece of basic information that you probably hand over without hesitation: your email address.
Then I clicked the “Rewrite” button. Wordtune Spices shot back a list of options for revisions of the sentence. I liked this one best:
Your email address is one of the most basic pieces of info that is being requested by more and more websites and apps.
My original sentence included a significant detail to me — that we hand over our email addresses without hesitation — but the tool trimmed a few words to cut to the chase and summarize the heart of the problem. Not bad.
Test 2: Catching Grammatical Errors
Rytr, an AI writing assistant released in 2021 by a company of the same name, was designed to streamline the creation of blog posts and marketing copy. It was proficient at catching grammatical errors (as, similarly, word-processing tools like Microsoft Word have been doing for decades).
In my test, I took this paragraph, which has intentional errors, from an educational website that provides editing exercises:
Facebook, with more then 1 Billion users Is celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launching by Mark Zuckerberg at 4th February 2004. The site was Conceived in a Harvard dorm in a way To connect student and let them build an Identity for himself online.
Then in Rytr, I highlighted the paragraph and clicked “Improve.” It gave me this:
Facebook, with more than 1 billion users, celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4th, 2004. The site was conceived in a Harvard dorm as a way to connect students and let them build an identity for themselves online.
The tool automatically rewrote an error-free version of the paragraph. This could be extremely handy as a study tool or for nonnative English speakers.
Test 3: Adding Context
Wordtune Spices also excelled at fleshing out paragraphs with additional context. By pressing the + button, you can add color and background information to a piece of text by inserting historical data, a joke and an example to prove your point.
For example, I took this paragraph from my column last week:
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital breadcrumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads.
In Wordtune Spices, I clicked the + button to add an example, a historical fact and a joke. (Changes in bold.)
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. For example, by tracking your purchases, companies can recommend products or services that are relevant to you. The first email marketing blast was sent in 1978 by a man named Gary Thuerk who worked for Digital Equipment Corp. And with that, Gary Thuerk was sent down in history as the world’s first ‘Spam’ Lord!
After doing some research, I was impressed to learn that 1978 was indeed when email was first used for marketing. The example of using email receipts to serve targeted ads was also accurate. The joke wasn’t very funny, but it lightened things up.
Test 4: Ending This Column
Last, I pasted this entire column into each writing assistant to see if it could come up with a kicker, or a clever conclusion to wrap this all up.
ChatGPT was the only one of the three that was able to read the entire text to generate a plausible conclusion:
With AI writing assistants like ChatGPT, Wordtune Spices, and Rytr, we have a powerful tool to enhance our writing - but only if we use it responsibly.
Wordtune Spices produced an unusable takeaway:
With the help of writing assistants, I was able to finish this column with a well-crafted conclusion that ties together all the points I have discussed.
Rytr did, um, something:
Coaches in the National Football League earn an average of $2,000,000 annually.
AI21 Labs, the Israeli startup that developed Wordtune Spices, said current AI writing technology required more guidance from the user than the prompt I had given the tools. Rytr said its users could use a feedback tool to train its AI in the event that something went wrong. OpenAI declined to comment.
All this shows that artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for improving our work. I was surprised by some of the results — in particular, that Wordtune Spices could add accurate and relevant background information. I may occasionally use the tool for suggestions on fleshing out paragraphs with some historical data, though I will then check the facts before publishing them.
And in general, the AI bots were useful for sharpening prose and cleaning up clunky, ungrammatical sentences.
What the bots couldn’t do, however, was the research or reporting to show their strengths and weaknesses. That requires thought. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

“Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important,” he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Zuckerberg also told Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would “have a chilling effect.”
“Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward,” Zuckerberg said. “That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tech Downturn Chips Away at Snap's Revenue Growth: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The maker of Snapchat also swung to a loss in the latest quarter and projected that its sales would decline.
Snap, the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, on Tuesday posted its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and projected that its sales for the current quarter would fall, in another sign of the tech industry's slowdown.
Revenue was $ 1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, up 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The company also swung to a net loss of $ 288 million, as spending increased nearly 20 percent from a year earlier. Snap had reported its first and only quarterly profit as a public company a year ago.
Snap's challenges appear to be mounting. In a letter to investors, the company said revenue so far in the current quarter had declined 7 percent from a year earlier. It added that its internal forecasts for the current quarter assumed that revenue would fall between 2 percent and 10 percent, which would be its first revenue drop as a public company.
In an earnings call, Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive, said that "advertising demand hasn't really improved, but it hasn't gotten significantly worse." He had earlier added in a statement that Snap continued to "face significant headwinds as we look to accelerate revenue growth."
The company's shares plunged more than 14 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Last year, Snap's share price fell more than 80 percent.
The results cap a difficult year for Snap, with little relief ahead. Persistent inflation and high interest rates have made advertisers -- the company's main source of revenue -- reluctant to spend, while privacy changes by Apple have made it more difficult for social media companies to track and target users in their mobile advertising.
TikTok has also stolen advertising business from Snap and other platforms. The Chinese-owned video app, which Snap has called one of its "very large and very sophisticated competitors," has attracted brands with its reach and cultural cachet, particularly among young people.
Digital advertising has slumped along with the global economy. But Snap has struggled more than its rivals because advertisers tend to begin budget cuts with smaller companies, instead of juggernauts like Facebook and Instagram, said Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester. In August, Snap laid off 20 percent of its employees, discontinued at least six products and lost several executives.
"Marketers are nervous about their economic outlook," Ms. Chickering said. "They're moving their budgets into places that are proven to be effective."
One potential bright spot for Snap was its user growth, with daily active users increasing 17 percent, to 375 million in the fourth quarter. Even so, that was slightly less than the 378 million users that Wall Street analysts had predicted.
In the earnings call on Thursday, Derek Andersen, Snap's chief financial officer, said the company could still grow its advertising business through features like its TikTok clone, Spotlight. But, he added, advertisers had to use those features.
"Demand is the lacking portion of things," he said.

Tunisia Vote Shows Slip In Support Of President: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Turnout was meager in two rounds of voting for a Parliament stripped of much of its power, with most political parties barred from the elections.
Tunisia, the only Arab country to emerge from the Arab Spring protests of more than a decade ago with a democracy, has not had a Parliament since its president suspended the assembly and established one-man rule in July 2021.
But when the names of the North African country's newly elected members of Parliament were finally announced on Tuesday, after two rounds of voting, it did not seem like a comeback for democracy. In the end, perhaps what the election results signaled most strongly was fast-fading support for President Kais Saied.
Only 11.4 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the runoff on Sunday, only slightly more than the 11.2 percent in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any global election in decades, according to Max Gallien, a political scientist at Britain's Institute of Development Studies. At least two of the president's loudest supporters lost their bids, though several others won.
"The loss of people who claim to be close to Saied is another indicator of the shallowness of the political project he is advancing: no vision, no strategy, no team," said Youssef Cherif, a political analyst who directs the Columbia Global Centers in Tunis.
Banking on his initial widespread popularity, Mr. Saied rewrote Tunisia's post-Arab Spring Constitution last year, giving himself sweeping authority and demoting Parliament to an advisory body, stripping much of its power. He also issued a new electoral law banning political parties from involvement in the election, so that voters chose individual candidates rather than voting for party lists as they had done in previous elections.
As a result, Parliament was set to be a patchwork of individuals without party affiliations, platforms or agendas to hold them together. The very fact that the winners participated, however, signaled a degree of support for the president: It meant they were willing to at least lend some legitimacy to his new program. Opposition groups boycotted the election.
The parliamentary elections were widely seen as a gauge of what Tunisians thought of his plans, and of whether Mr. Saied was sincere about preserving Tunisian democracy, as he had pledged to do. On both, critics and analysts charged, Mr. Saied fell flat.
In some districts, only one candidate ran, negating the need for any runoff at all. Women won just 25 of the assembly's 161 seats, according to Tunisia's electoral authority, compared with 68 who held seats in 2014. Mr. Saied now controls the elections authority after replacing its formerly independent board.
The election of a new Parliament was supposed to be the next step in Mr. Saied's plan to remake the country's political system, one that he claims will be a truer, more direct democracy. In reality, it has put nearly all power in his hands, unchecked.
Far from saving the country from economic and political crises, as many hoped he would after he seized power, the president has offered few solutions as Tunisia staggers through a downturn that has left shelves bare of basics such as sugar and bottled water, families hard-pressed to feed themselves and the government unable to pay salaries.
Disenchantment with Mr. Saied's handling of the economy appeared to be a major factor in the meager turnout in July's constitutional referendum, where about 30 percent of voters approved the president's new Constitution.
Mr. Saied had called on supporters to vote for the new charter, but after announcing the date of the parliamentary election -- the first round was in December -- Mr. Saied did little to promote the vote.
That, Mr. Cherif said, "confirms that he sees little interest in parliamentary democracy."
Mr. Saied has never been shy about his contempt for Parliament.
"Approximately 90 percent didn't take part in voting because the Parliament, for them, doesn't mean anything anymore," he said in a meeting with his prime minister on Monday, according to a video his office posted on Facebook.
He had a point.
Many Tunisians continue to blame the political parties who dominated Parliament over the last decade for stymying Mr. Saied's reforms, giving him an opening to ban them from the electoral process. Anti-Saied protests remain limited.
Though reliable polling is also scarce, the president's political opponents appear even more unpopular than he is, leaving Tunisians stuck between two unpalatable choices.
Still, growing numbers have expressed fear of Mr. Saied's increasing authoritarianism as the president prosecutes and jails critics. A political activist, Chaima Issa, was questioned last week by a military judge over critical comments she made about Mr. Saied on the radio, while a former prime minister from a major opposition party, Ali Laarayedh, was imprisoned in December.
Yet the outcry over Mr. Saied's rollback of rights and freedoms Tunisians won after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising has remained limited -- apart from members of the opposition, who used the flop of the elections to call for Mr. Saied's resignation and early presidential elections to replace him.
"The results show that 89 percent of Tunisians have ignored this charade," Ahmed Najib Chebbi, a veteran politician who leads the National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition factions, said at a news conference after the runoff vote.

Putting Romance at the Top of the Menu: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: We asked New York Times staffers for their go-to Valentine's plans.
When I worked for New York magazine's Grub Street website, I put together a series called "14 Chefs." I would pick a topic, like the city's most underrated restaurants or its most splurge-worthy, and ask an assortment of respected chefs for their opinions.
The most popular edition, by far, was about the most romantic restaurants, because what makes a restaurant romantic can be so arbitrary and personal. This week, I thought I'd ask for recommendations from my colleagues here at The Times. Some suggestions are surprising, and some are just plain heart-melting, but there's one piece of advice that came up repeatedly: Don't go out on Valentine's Day! Pick a quieter night, free of distractions, and revel in your romance.
Sam Sifton , assistant managing editor
My Valentine's Day advice is not to go out to dinner. All those red roses and chocolates, hints and aspirations -- they're a trap. The night's too freighted by expectation, and invariably you'll end up squabbling, or worse. You want a romantic dinner? Have it on a random February evening, tucked into a seat at Raoul's, in SoHo. Oysters, martinis, steak au poivre. That's the love life.
Priya Krishna , Food reporter
Going out to dinner on Valentine's Day can be extremely stressful, especially if you are making a last-minute plan. But if you must go out, there's a little gem in Park Slope, Brooklyn, called Le Succulent. The restaurant serves West African and French food in a space that feels like a homey ground-floor apartment. The wine list is lovely, the service is warm and every time I eat there I wonder why I don't go more often.
Michael Gold , Metro reporter
The romantic spots tend to be ones that are intimate, where you're willing to linger over a few good bites, glasses of wine and -- hopefully -- engaging conversation. Gottino, in the West Village, is the right level of all those things for me: dark and snug in a way that has always struck me as perfect for a nice date. On the fancier end, I like Frenchette, in TriBeCa. There's a warmth both to the space and the food that I think fosters closeness.
Alex Vadukul , Styles reporter
I'm not a big Valentine's Day person, but that doesn't mean I'm not fond of a few romantic haunts. In the West Village, try catching a jazz set at the Village Vanguard, before walking a couple of blocks east to Bar Six, an old and dimly lit French bistro that's something of an unsung treasure. It has red banquettes, a beautiful bar and a menu distinguished by its Moroccan influences.
Becky Hughes , Food senior staff editor
Achilles Heel in Greenpoint is my platonic ideal for far-from-platonic dinners. The space is cozy, and the drinks are strong, but the food is the clincher. There is a constantly changing menu of small plates, many with sauces to sop up with thick slices of She Wolf bread. Eating with your hands equals romance! Even leaving the restaurant is an experience: Walking out onto silent West Street, where you can feel the breeze blowing in from the East River, is a special moment to share with someone special.
Jodi Kantor , investigative reporter
I fell in love with Ron Lieber over a menu. He took me to Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, Calif. The dessert menus arrived. A worn soundtrack started playing in my head: enough, no, don't, bad.
"I think we should get three," he said.
That was 25 years ago. Since then, we have never gone out on Valentine's Day, because eating out on the most expensive night of the year is against how we spend money. (Ron is, after all, the personal-finance columnist for The Times.) But years ago, he decided that Valentine's Day, though a Hallmark holiday, was his opportunity to provide a chocolate surprise for me and our daughters at each meal of the day. Last Feb. 14, after dinner, he took a white box out of the freezer. Inside was a custom ice cream cake he had somehow procured from Miss Mona, an ice cream company that now operates as a monthly C.S.T. (Community Supported Treats). This was the best dessert I have ever eaten, because it called back to earlier Valentine's surprises and even that night in California.
Don't go out. Just find something small but true. Repeat every year.

Molotov Cocktail Hurled At New Jersey Synagogue: [National Desk]

Full text: Officials said a man in a ski mask early on Sunday lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at Temple Ner Tamid in Bloomfield, N.J. An incident at an Episcopal church in Asbury Park, N.J., was also under investigation for possible bias.
A man wearing a ski mask lit the wick of a Molotov cocktail and hurled it at the front door of a synagogue in Bloomfield, N.J., early on Sunday morning, the latest episode in an uptick of harassment and violence targeting Jews and Jewish institutions, the authorities said.
The Molotov cocktail's bottle broke, and the synagogue, Temple Ner Tamid, was undamaged, the Bloomfield Police Department said in a news release.
Surveillance video footage that the police released on Monday shows a man in a ski mask and dark clothing, including a shirt that appears to have a skull-and-crossbones design on it, approaching the synagogue holding a Molotov cocktail. The man ignites the wick with a lighter and throws it before fleeing on foot. The entire episode lasts less than two minutes.
About six hours after the 3:19 a.m. attack, members of the temple's staff discovered what had happened and notified the police. The synagogue said in a statement that the fire went out on impact and that the door was secure.
All scheduled activities on Sunday were canceled, and the synagogue said it expected an ongoing and heightened police presence in the coming days.
The Police Department said on Monday that it was offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
Marc Katz, the temple's rabbi, said in the statement that the synagogue has and "will continue to do everything in our power to keep our community safe."
"Everything worked as it should," he said. "Our cameras recorded the incident, and our shatter-resistant doors held."
A separate investigation was opened into "a possible bias-motivated incident" at Trinity Episcopal Church in Asbury Park, N.J., the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. The incident, which was not described in detail, took place during an antiracism event on Friday night, the prosecutor's office said. No injuries were reported.
The church did not respond to a request for comment.
The state attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, said in a statement that his office was also made aware of the attack on the church. He did not offer details or say whether the attacks were linked.
"We are cognizant of the fact that these attacks have occurred while violence continues to erupt in Israel, and while our own nation reckons with violence at home," he said.
Michael Venezia, the mayor of Bloomfield, a township about eight miles north of Newark, said on Facebook that "hate and antisemitism will not be tolerated and have no place in our welcoming community."
The Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey said in a joint statement issued with partner organizations that the attempted arson at Temple Ner Tamid came amid a "spike in antisemitic incidents" and recent threats at synagogues in New Jersey.
In November, an 18-year-old man from Middlesex County, N.J., was charged with threatening to attack a synagogue and Jews that month. The episode prompted a rare warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New Jersey of a broad threat to synagogues in the state.
Since a spate of bomb threats starting in 2017, synagogues have fortified their physical infrastructure with shatter-resistant windows, more security cameras and controlled access to buildings, said Bob Wilson, chief security officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest NJ, who oversees training on how to best respond to threats.
"We're just trying to make that security piece an integral part of much of what they do -- not to be scared, but to be prepared," he said.
In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League recorded 370 antisemitic incidents in New Jersey, representing the highest number ever recorded by the organization for the state -- and the second-highest total recorded across the country that year.
Figures from 2022 are not yet available, but they will not show a decrease, said Scott Richman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey.
"Antisemitism is on the rise," Mr. Richman said. "We are not in a vacuum here. Jews are not alone in this. It's not just antisemitism. It's about hate. We are one of the victims."

“We’re just trying to make that security piece an integral part of much of what they do — not to be scared, but to be prepared,” he said.
In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League recorded 370 antisemitic incidents in New Jersey, representing the highest number ever recorded by the organization for the state — and the second-highest total recorded across the country that year.
Figures from 2022 are not yet available, but they will not show a decrease, said Scott Richman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey.
“Antisemitism is on the rise,” Richman said. “We are not in a vacuum here. Jews are not alone in this. It’s not just antisemitism. It’s about hate. We are one of the victims.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech's challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector -- employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts -- but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn -- mass layoffs, for example -- there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent -- many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $ 420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire's). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk's actions led to the wild swings in Tesla's stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was "deliberately reckless" -- investors' words -- when he posted the tweet.
What's Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. "There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase," Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials' intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.
Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 -- though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed's attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country's largest tech companies, this week's quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver ... more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth -- the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $ 10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift's lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts "in the coming weeks."

Full text: A reader is hurt by her stepson's efforts to keep her away from his fiancée's family, including a future in-law who dismissed her as "not blood."
My stepson is getting married this year. His father and I embrace our future daughter-in-law and looked forward to meeting her family. I began corresponding with her mother and expressed our interest in flying out to meet them. My stepson discouraged this; he said they would be visiting our area soon. But we weren't introduced to them when they came. Later, I received a call from his fiancée's mother, who clearly mistook me for my husband's ex-wife. She said she loved meeting me and referred to "the new wife" -- me! -- as "not blood." At Thanksgiving, my stepson and his mother flew to visit his fiancée's family and made lots of wedding plans, including for a rehearsal dinner for which we will pay half. How can we get past all these hurtful exclusions, some affecting our pocketbook? (I note: My husband's relationship with his ex-wife is frosty.)
STEPMOM
I totally understand your bruised feelings. That phone call on which you were mistaken for your husband's ex-wife sounds awful! I suspect the explanation lies largely in that "frosty" relationship between your husband and his former wife. Visits seem to have been organized to keep them apart and to prioritize your stepson's mother. (I get that: I happen to be a mama's boy myself.)
Now, your stepson certainly could have handled introductions more deftly. But ceremonial occasions -- like "meet the parents" -- can be tough for children of divorce if their parents are antagonistic. So, unless I am misreading this situation, try to forgive your stepson and take the long view: Life won't end at the wedding! Getting to know your stepson's in-laws may simply take longer than you expected.
As for splitting the costs of the rehearsal dinner -- which I assume was acceptable until you were treated unkindly -- I would stick with that plan. If my assumption is wrong or if the price exceeds your budget, speak up. But don't make a fuss on principle. Letting the small stuff slide in favor of building better relationships is often a wise strategy. I hope it works for you and your husband.
When the Snipes Are About More Than Mess
My wife is an admitted neat freak. Our children and I try our best to keep things tidy to her standards, but inevitably we fall short. She reacts by saying: "Why doesn't anyone care?" But we absolutely care! And her remarks are hurtful as she rarely acknowledges a job well done. How can I help her understand how hard we're all trying and how upsetting her statement is?
HUSBAND
I'm glad you wrote. This problem seems potentially serious to me. A mother (or spouse) who only knocks family members down, and rarely lifts them up, can really clobber their self-esteem. I interpret the meaning of "Why doesn't anyone care?" as a shorthand for "Why doesn't anyone care about me?" -- a harsh rebuke by a mother to her child.
Have a serious conversation with your wife, alone, about her expectations and her hurtful behavior. If she refuses to work on this (alone or with a counselor), you need to explore ways to protect your children's emotional well-being.
Friendship at Fish Prices? A Steal!
My husband, son and I moved to a new community where we don't know many people. Recently, we invited a new co-worker to our home for dinner with his wife and their child. It was a casual invitation: "Do you want to come over for takeout?" When they accepted, we sent them a menu. They made their selections (including an expensive seafood dish). We called it in, picked it up and paid for it. A fun time was had by all! But when they left, they didn't offer to contribute to the large dinner bill, nor did they mention reciprocating. I find this baffling and rude. My husband wants to give them another chance. What say you?
HOST
You seem to have buried the lead: Congratulations on making new friends in your new town! That's the significant takeaway (for me). And it would be a shame to spoil that for the price of a seafood dish.
Over the years, I have heard from many readers who split the cost of takeout on the spot, as well as from many others who take turns paying in their homes. It doesn't sound as if you mentioned payment, so your guests may have thought they were following your lead. Why not give them some time to reciprocate? You can even be cheeky with your new pals: "So, when is takeout night at your place?"
An Overstep Made to Be Stepped On
I live in a so-so rental building. Some of the neighbors on my floor have ratty doormats. So, to make things nicer, I went out and bought new, matching doormats for everyone -- at my own expense. After I put them down, one of my neighbors threw the new mat away and put her old one back! How should I handle this?
NEIGHBOR
Start with an apology to your neighbors for your domineering behavior. You may have meant well, but to them your actions could be read as entitled and disrespectful of their property. Decisions about common spaces are best made communally.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

When Private Equity Started Playing In the Toddler Gym: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tiffany Cianci spends most of her days in socks, padding around the fitness studio she operates in Frederick, Md., about an hour outside Washington. Her clients are young: kids ranging from 4 months to 12 years old. They come to learn somersaults, try the monkey bars, sing some songs. ("Little Red Caboose," complete with a train whistle accompaniment, is one of her favorites.)
Ms. Cianci, 41, spent the first part of her career as a sommelier, specializing in sake. In 2017, wanting to leave the hospitality industry for something that allowed her to spend more time at home, she and her husband bought their facility as part of a franchise chain called The Little Gym. Its slogan: "Serious fun."
They got what generations of franchise owners have gotten out of similar deals, with brands like McDonald's or Jiffy Lube: a known brand name and detailed business plans in exchange for an initial fee and a cut of the revenue. For Ms. Cianci, it was more than just a business.
"I love it. I really love it," said Ms. Cianci, a mother of three who studied dance. "I love my students, and I love that it lets me make a difference."
In the last year and a half, since The Little Gym was acquired by a private equity-backed firm called Unleashed Brands, her work has felt far less idyllic.
According to legal filings, internal documents, and interviews with more than half a dozen other franchisees -- most of whom requested anonymity so as to avoid retaliation -- Unleashed began to demand higher fees and institute more stringent requirements, which the independent owners thought would threaten their profits. The day after Ms. Cianci organized her fellow franchise owners into an association to push back against the changes, the corporate office told her it was terminating her license on the grounds that she was chronically late in paying her fees. Given the timing, Ms. Cianci maintains in the legal filings that it constituted retaliation.
Along the way, Unleashed Brands surveilled Ms. Cianci's business with undercover shoppers, met with her landlord and disparaged her to fellow franchisees. When she tried to salvage her business under a new name -- it's now called Teeter Tots Music n Motion -- the company sued, accusing her of violating its trademarks and a noncompete clause in her franchise agreement.
The episode has plunged Ms. Cianci about $ 300,000 into debt and enmeshed Unleashed in a nasty court battle not long after it acquired multiple new brands. The outcome will be a test of just how much a franchisor can unilaterally change the rules of a business relationship that has served as an on-ramp to entrepreneurship for hundreds of thousands of people.
The legal fight -- along with two others Unleashed has faced with franchisees at its other brands -- also reveals the challenges of applying the private equity playbook to the unique world of franchises.
Private equity has notched decades of high returns for investors by following a well-worn strategy: acquire distressed or undervalued companies or real estate, increase profits and then sell them. Greatest hits include foreclosed homes, highway rest stops and coal mines bought out of bankruptcy.
Franchising has become one of private equity's targets du jour. According to the research firm FRANdata, the number of franchise brands acquired by private equity firms and other investors rose from 52 in 2019 to 149 in 2021 and was on track to nearly equal that total in 2022.
Private equity firms tout their ability to bring new ideas, technologies and efficiencies, and franchises, financially weakened by the pandemic, appeared ripe for those kinds of changes.
But the reality is not so straightforward. The nation's franchisees -- 237,619, according to FRANdata -- like Ms. Cianci, think of themselves as independent small businesses, who have often sunk their life savings into the enterprise. That's why Little Gym owners are resisting Unleashed's attempts to squeeze their profits to pad its own.
Unlike, say, factory workers, who can be laid off at will, franchisees are supposed to be protected by legal documents that prescribe a certain business model for years at a time. Moreover, Unleashed -- and its investors -- need franchisees to stay motivated so they can keep generating revenue and recruit others to keep expanding the franchise system.
Ms. Cianci, who is now in arbitration with Unleashed Brands, has been working to change state laws to better protect franchisees who might find themselves in her position down the line. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, is reconsidering federal regulations on franchisors, which haven't changed for more than a decade.
Direct inquiries to Michael Browning Jr., Unleashed's chief executive and founder, and other executives were not returned. Instead, a public relations firm answered detailed questions via email, saying the company's changes have improved business across the board. "The financial impact and franchisee benefit of these efforts is undeniable," the spokesman wrote.
Many of the changes, however, are simply not what franchisees say they'd signed up for.
"What this reflects is a conflict between the private equity firm that bought this and what they actually bought," said Francine Lafontaine, an economist at the University of Michigan who specializes in franchise relationships. "In their due diligence, they didn't seem to think too much about who they were going to be working with once they owned this chain."
'Candy Land board of life'
Mr. Browning, the son of a real estate developer with a background in health care investing, viewed The Little Gym as a perfect part of his vision: He was building a conveyor belt of activities for kids.
Mr. Browning spent the 2010s building a franchise called Urban Air, a chain of trampoline parks where parents could spend $ 700 on a birthday party to remember for their seventh grader. The venture was staked by Mr. Browning and his father and eventually Urban Air formed Unleashed.
Private equity was also interested in the Brownings' growing business. While a company spokesman did not clarify the company's relationship with private equity, on the websites of the private equity firms AHR Growth Partners, Mantucket Capital and MPK Equity Partners, Unleashed or its brands are listed among their current or recent investments.
In 2021, Mr. Browning decided to scale up, following a hot new trend in private equity: building "platforms" to consolidate several brands in a similar industry that could then cross-sell a range of services to their customers, as well as sell more franchises to their existing franchisees. Mr. Browning would often mention Neighborly, a roll-up of home services offerings that had been bought by the private equity giant KKR, as his model.
"If I have five home services brands, I can pitch all those services to the same customer," said Ritwik Donde, senior research analyst at FRANdata, which helps investors vet potential acquisitions. "Those complementary systems lower the cost of customer acquisition. "
Mr. Browning's company, Unleashed Brands, began buying other youth enrichment chains. Parents -- always moms, in Mr. Browning's conception -- could then spend money at his companies from the birth of their kids through high school graduation.
Ms. Cianci was immediately skeptical of Mr. Browning's vision for rapidly collecting children's services and integrating their sales, operations and marketing.
"That might be OK when you're cleaning a dryer vent, but it's not when you're throwing around a 4-month-old and you need them to be safe," Ms. Cianci said. "He was moving faster than he would need to get to know the business."
To kick off the new program, Unleashed invited all of its newly acquired franchisees to a conference in Orlando in October 2021, including Little Gym's approximately 175 owners. The company rented out the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and held a fireworks show. And Mr. Browning treated attendees to a speech he called "vision casting," in which he articulated his plans for building a family of children's brands that families could spend money on from birth to age 18.
The "Candy Land board of life," he called it. He promised new tech tools that would make their lives easier. "Auto-magic," he called it.
Changes didn't take long. Within weeks, long-tenured headquarters employees started leaving. In conversations with franchisees across the country, numerous owners expressed frustration that the support they depended on had evaporated; instead of calling a trusted adviser whenever they wanted, they had to file an online ticket. (Unleashed said that it "never sought to cut access" to its staff and that the ticket system was instituted to make sure they were responding in a timely fashion.)
The company tried to impose a new payroll vendor that caused unending headaches. Certain activities, such as karate, were eliminated as Unleashed acquired businesses with similar programming; the company said it trimmed services with low enrollment to "streamline" the offerings. The company also outlined a process by which franchisees could lose their licenses if they failed to meet brand standards, which set a sour tone among some of the operators. To people who'd just made it through a pandemic and operated on thin margins even in good times, the changes felt unnecessary and destabilizing.
In the fall of 2021, the company required all franchisees to sign a new agreement allowing Unleashed to automatically debit their bank accounts. Ms. Cianci noticed that it also contained broad language allowing the company to extract any other fees that might be owed, which she believed went beyond her franchise agreement.
Under the advice of a lawyer, she refused to sign it and started to send her royalty payments via paper check. But she worried that most franchisees would simply accept the new arrangement, along with another requiring them to use -- and pay for -- a shared call center.
To sound the alarm to others, Ms. Cianci held conference calls, often with a lawyer present. As concerns spread, in May a group of Little Gym franchisees formed the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association, which ultimately reached more than 90 percent participation from across the system. Ms. Cianci was elected president. The company started sending warning notices to franchisees who hadn't signed the new agreements.
On May 19, 2022, Happy Handstands' lawyers sent Unleashed a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of the membership. The very next evening, an email popped up saying Ms. Cianci's franchise had been terminated. When she tried to check it, her email account was gone, too. Unleashed said the company didn't know she was the association's president when they decided to terminate her. Ms. Cianci said it was widely known across the system and mentioned in a Facebook group visible to lower-level corporate executives.
To save her business, Ms. Cianci went before an arbitrator and filed for a preliminary injunction decrying the termination as retaliatory; the arbitrator ruled that she hadn't cleared the high legal bar necessary to stop the process. After that, she started tearing down all her Little Gym branding and adapting her curriculum so as not to violate the company's trademarks. She paused when Unleashed's lawyers wanted to discuss a settlement, which she said she rejected over its harsh terms. When they demanded she finish the process of "de-identifying" as a Little Gym immediately, she had difficulty getting started again because she had surgery on a broken foot.
In June and July, the company sent undercover shoppers, including one who was a licensed private investigator, who posed as parents and asked Ms. Cianci's employees what kinds of lessons they offered and whether they overlapped with The Little Gym's programming. In early July, Unleashed, with the help of outside counsel DLA Piper, sued her in the superior court of Arizona for Maricopa County, where The Little Gym is based. The company accused her of failing to eliminate all branding fast enough, offering declarations from the investigators as evidence -- the color scheme looked the same, for example, and a Wi-Fi network was still "TheLittleGym," password "SeriousFun."
Soon after, the company's lawyers also visited her landlord in Frederick, which Unleashed said was "part of a standard process to inquire as to the status of the lease." According to Ms. Cianci's notes from her subsequent conversation with the landlord, the lawyers told him that she was in legal trouble and wouldn't be able to keep paying rent.
Her landlord then sent her a letter, which was filed as evidence in court, declining to renew her lease and demanding more than $ 275,000 in back rent, including real estate taxes, most of which Ms. Cianci thought had been forgiven during the pandemic. Unleashed then exercised its option to take over the lease, although the building remains empty. (Her landlord declined to comment.)
In mid-July, Unleashed Brands' chief legal officer, Stephen Polozola, sent all Little Gym franchisees an email titled "Friendly Reminder on Confidentiality." In it, without naming Ms. Cianci, he warned them not to share any information with a certain former franchisee, who he said had been terminated for not paying royalty fees on time.
Further, he wrote that the company had received reports from "no less than seven" former employees who said that the unnamed franchisee had underpaid them and created a hostile work environment. The email finished with a grainy screenshot of a Facebook post containing a vulgar message that Mr. Polozola said had come from that same franchisee but didn't have her name attached.
Ms. Cianci, who had taken her son to a water park for his birthday, immediately started getting messages from other franchisees. None of it was true, she told them. As she would detail in court documents, the company allowed late payments for nearly all franchisees during the pandemic, and her gym had been closed by local ordinance for longer than most. She had continued to send her royalties in the mail, even after she refused to sign Unleashed's new payment form, she said, and she was current on all her accounts when she was terminated. And the inappropriate Facebook post? She said she hadn't written it.
The allegations by Ms. Cianci's former employees that Mr. Polozola referred to in his "friendly reminder" email sprang from messages that were sent by the workers in April 2021, before the Little Gym changed hands. After an investigation, no action was taken. The Unleashed spokesman said the company had relied on Ms. Cianci's assurance that she would resolve the matter with the Maryland Department of Labor. Ms. Cianci said she made no such assurance.
In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, the Department of Labor provided records showing a total of five complaints against Ms. Cianci for unpaid wages since 2017, two of which she resolved by paying her former employees; two were dropped; and one is still pending.
But the emails from the former employees, which Unleashed supplied to The Times in unredacted form, detail complaints other than unpaid wages -- such as dealing pills and mistreating children -- that would seem to merit more immediate action by corporate headquarters, and which Ms. Cianci strongly denies.
In late summer of 2021, when one of the former employees contacted Unleashed again, Mr. Polozola told Ms. Cianci to ignore it, according to an email exchange she provided -- until he brought the complaints back up to discredit her nearly a year later.
Arguing that such tactics seemed far outside the norms of legal practice, in September Ms. Cianci's team filed a defense of so-called unclean hands, making the case that Unleashed Brands' conduct had so tainted the proceedings that the judge should rule in their favor.
But their motion never went anywhere. Before the judge could rule on it, Unleashed filed to dismiss its own case, arguing that its complaint that Ms. Cianci was essentially operating an unauthorized Little Gym was moot because her landlord had evicted her.
The upshot of all this legal wrangling is that the fight between Ms. Cianci and Unleashed continues in arbitration in Arizona. In arbitration, potential damages are more limited, proceedings are sealed, and no precedent is created for other cases.
Unleashed is fighting to stop Ms. Cianci from running what it says is a competing gym. Ms. Cianci is fighting for the chance to keep her new business and recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars she has now spent on lawyers.
One of them, Peter Lagarias, began his career at the F.T.C., enforcing the agency's then-new franchise rule in the late 1970s, and spent most of his career advocating for franchisees both in the courtroom and the California statehouse. He took her case for a low rate, but arbitrators, whose cost must be split by both parties, can run tens of thousands of dollars, too.
"They don't want money," Ms. Cianci said of Unleashed. "They want to destroy my life."
'You can't treat every business the same'
Bill Walenda, 55, also got into running Little Gyms as a second career. After years as a financial planner, he wanted to buy a franchise -- maybe a McDonald's or a Dunkin' Donuts -- and his wife suggested The Little Gym, since he loved working with children. He opened a gym in New Jersey in 2002 and bought another in Illinois in 2009.
After Ms. Cianci's franchise was terminated, the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association fractured over strategy. Another group of owners started an association with a different approach: working "collaboratively" with the corporate office to provide feedback on changes. Mr. Walenda was elected president, and he has had limited success.
He has been fighting a new point-of-sale system with a credit card processor controlled by Unleashed, which franchisees say is keeping customer payments for more than a week before sending them to gym owners, creating a cash flow crunch for owners. (Unleashed said the system keeps money for only two or three days.)
The company also continues to try to make everyone use its new shared call center, which Mr. Walenda said would "take us out of the equation of dealing with our customers" -- something that might work for a business like Urban Air, which processes thousands of people a week, but not the familial relationships on which The Little Gym operated for decades.
"You can't treat every business the same," Mr. Walenda said. "And that's really what's causing all of this strife."
In November, Unleashed introduced a revised operations manual that lays out new rules and fees. It specifies the hours the businesses must be open, how quickly they must return customer calls, which architect they must use and what company meetings they must attend. Staff salaries were only supposed to make up 30 percent of revenue. The technology fee can rise to $ 399 from $ 119.
The national advertising fee can rise to 5 percent of gross sales from 1 percent; part of that will go to a fund that supports other Unleashed properties. New fees appeared, including a $ 30,000 fee to renew the franchise agreement, and a fee of about $ 15,000 to relocate the facility. For some owners, the changes seem to mean that they can no longer operate profitably and will have to sell rather than renew.
Unleashed said the changes only apply to new franchisees, and Mr. Walenda said his group has been able to negotiate away some of the fees even for them. But other fees remain, including a $ 100,000 payment if the franchise is terminated, and Mr. Walenda said the company continues to try to force everyone to use its call center and point-of-sale system. As much as he believes in the collaborative approach, he's willing to litigate to stop the attempts to extract more money.
"That's all private equity cares about, as far as I'm concerned," Mr. Walenda said. His business is doing well, which he credits to the postpandemic desperation for children's activities; he said Unleashed's new systems have mostly just taken more time for his managers to deal with.
"We're not people, we're not businesses, we're just numbers to them," Mr. Walenda said. "And that's a problem. Because 'Let's just keep squeezing everything we can out of them until we can't squeeze anymore' -- it's a good way of making money. It's not a very good way to run a business."
After a year of owning The Little Gym, Unleashed Brands says that average gym revenue rose 36.8 percent in 2022 over 2019. And its franchisee recruitment has focused on people who want to open multiple units, such as Cody Herndon, whom Unleashed provided as an example of a Little Gym owner with a more positive view of management.
An Urban Air operator who sold one of his two parks to another private equity investor, Mr. Herndon bought the rights to open three Little Gyms in Texas last year. He said he was drawn by the opportunity to have longer-term relationships with families and thought the new systems Unleashed was pushing would work out in the end.
"There are going to be so many massive benefits to any change that's been asked," Mr. Herndon said.
While disclosing few other metrics, the company told Axios in May that it expected to generate $ 160 million in revenue in 2022 and was shopping for a buyer. It appears to have found one.
Unleashed's current private equity investors are selling their stakes in the company imminently, according to a company spokesman. But the company declined to disclose the buyer or the terms of the deal.
Whoever the buyer may be, they've got significant franchisee rancor on their hands -- even beyond the Little Gym.
At Mr. Browning's original chain, Urban Air, a franchisee association representing more than 50 owners tried to bring a lawsuit in 2020 over what it viewed as unfair changes that had revealed the "terms and provisions of the franchise agreements upon which investment decisions were made to be illusory and meaningless." But a Texas court threw the case out on technical grounds, and with individual arbitration the only path forward, the effort fell apart.
In late 2022, Unleashed was also sued by 54 franchisees of its Premier Martial Arts brand who said in legal filings that the franchisor gave them an unrealistic impression of the cost of running a martial arts studio, leaving them with dead-end businesses and debt.
Michelle and Peter Silberman depleted their retirement savings, maxed out their credit cards and took out a home-equity loan to acquire three Premier Martial Arts territories in March 2020, before Unleashed owned the franchisor. The first opened near their home in the Pittsburgh area in May 2022. Mr. Silberman said Premier Martial Arts told them that they could expect profit margins as high as 48 percent, while running the studios as "semi-absentee" owners who had to run the business as little as 10 hours a week.
The couple was charging parents $ 138 a month, which included two classes a week. The Silbermans, who had no experience with martial arts, said they relied on the company's assurances that it would help them manage the business.
But when attendance began to decline and expenses were piling up -- the couple spent $ 370,000 acquiring the territories and operating the one facility -- Mr. Silberman said Premier Martial Arts offered little additional help. Their studio closed this past fall.
Although the trouble began long before Unleashed announced that it had bought Premier Martial Arts in early 2022, the lawsuit states that after the acquisition, "the same false statements were still made and the same bogus model was pitched."
In response, the Unleashed spokesman said the company is "not a party to any contract" with a Premier Martial Arts franchisee.
As for the Silbermans, they have been trying to pay down their debts.
"We are, hopefully, going to avoid bankruptcy by the skin of our teeth," said Mr. Silberman.
New rules for franchises
Ms. Cianci's case is winding its way through arbitration. Her new gym in a suburban mall next to Macy's has only about 74 members, compared with the 275 she had before her termination by Unleashed. She said her husband, a federal trademark attorney, is working long hours to support them.
In the meantime, she's trying to prevent future franchisees from being put in the situation she found herself in.
As the F.T.C. reviews the rules governing franchising, advocates have urged the commission to add stronger protections, such as more disclosure of how the average franchise location performs. The International Franchise Association -- whose board Mr. Browning recently joined -- has lobbied hard to avert those changes.
In Congress, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, has done extensive research on problems with the franchise system and introduced two bills seeking to give franchisees more leverage. But their fate is uncertain.
That's why Ms. Cianci is focused on the states. Specifically Arizona, where The Little Gym headquarters is based. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would protect franchisees' right to form associations, require changes to their agreements to be presented in contractual form, and limit the circumstances under which their licenses could be terminated.
At the very least, she hopes her case will ultimately prove that it's possible to resist a franchisor's efforts to impose its will outside what are supposed to be legally binding agreements, whether it's how many birthday parties to offer or which insurance company to use.
"That's exactly what went wrong here," Ms. Cianci said. "He's buying companies where people had rights."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Tiffany Cianci spends most of her days in socks, padding around the fitness studio she operates in Frederick, Maryland, about an hour outside Washington. Her clients are young: kids ranging from 4 months to 12 years old. They come to learn somersaults, try the monkey bars, sing some songs. (“Little Red Caboose,” complete with a train-whistle accompaniment, is one of her favorites.)
Cianci, 41, spent the first part of her career as a sommelier, specializing in sake. In 2017, wanting to leave the hospitality industry for something that allowed her to spend more time at home, she and her husband bought their facility as part of a franchise chain called The Little Gym. Its slogan: “Serious fun.”
They got what generations of franchise owners have gotten out of similar deals, with brands such as McDonald’s or Jiffy Lube: a known brand name and detailed business plans in exchange for an initial fee and a cut of the revenue. For Cianci, it was more than just a business.
“I love it. I really love it,” said Cianci, a mother of three who studied dance. “I love my students, and I love that it lets me make a difference.”
In the past year and a half, since The Little Gym was acquired by a private equity-backed firm called Unleashed Brands, her work has felt far less idyllic.
According to legal filings, internal documents, and interviews with more than a half-dozen other franchisees — most of whom requested anonymity so as to avoid retaliation — Unleashed began to demand higher fees and institute more stringent requirements, which the independent owners thought would threaten their profits. The day after Cianci organized her fellow franchise owners into an association to push back against the changes, the corporate office told her it was terminating her license on the grounds that she was chronically late in paying her fees. Given the timing, Cianci maintains in the legal filings that it constituted retaliation.
Along the way, Unleashed Brands surveilled Cianci’s business with undercover shoppers, met with her landlord and disparaged her to fellow franchisees. When she tried to salvage her business under a new name — it’s now called Teeter Tots Music n Motion — the company sued, accusing her of violating its trademarks and a noncompete clause in her franchise agreement.
The episode has plunged Cianci about $300,000 into debt and enmeshed Unleashed in a nasty court battle not long after it acquired several new brands. The outcome will be a test of just how much a franchiser can unilaterally change the rules of a business relationship that has served as an on-ramp to entrepreneurship for hundreds of thousands of people.
The legal fight — along with two others Unleashed has faced with franchisees at its other brands — also reveals the challenges of applying the private equity playbook to the unique world of franchises.
Private equity has notched decades of high returns for investors by following a well-worn strategy: acquire distressed or undervalued companies or real estate, increase profits and then sell them. Greatest hits include foreclosed homes, highway rest stops and coal mines bought out of bankruptcy.
Franchising has become one of private equity’s targets du jour. According to the research firm FRANdata, the number of franchise brands acquired by private equity firms and other investors rose from 52 in 2019 to 149 in 2021 and was on track to nearly equal that total in 2022.
Private equity firms tout their ability to bring new ideas, technologies and efficiencies, and franchises, financially weakened by the pandemic, appeared ripe for those kinds of changes.
But the reality is not so straightforward. The nation’s franchisees (237,619, according to FRANdata), like Cianci, think of themselves as independent small businesses, who have often sunk their life savings into the enterprise. That’s why Little Gym owners are resisting Unleashed’s attempts to squeeze their profits to pad its own.
Unlike, say, factory workers, who can be laid off at will, franchisees are supposed to be protected by legal documents that prescribe a certain business model for years at a time. Moreover, Unleashed — and its investors — need franchisees to stay motivated so they can keep generating revenue and recruit others to keep expanding the franchise system.
Cianci, who is now in arbitration with Unleashed Brands, has been working to change state laws to better protect franchisees who might find themselves in her position down the line. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, is reconsidering federal regulations on franchisers, which haven’t changed for more than a decade.
Direct inquiries to Michael Browning Jr., Unleashed’s CEO and founder, and other executives were not returned. Instead, a public relations firm answered detailed questions via email, saying the company’s changes have improved business across the board. “The financial impact and franchisee benefit of these efforts is undeniable,” the spokesperson wrote.
Many of the changes, however, are simply not what franchisees say they had signed up for.
“What this reflects is a conflict between the private equity firm that bought this and what they actually bought,” said Francine Lafontaine, an economist at the University of Michigan who specializes in franchise relationships. “In their due diligence, they didn’t seem to think too much about who they were going to be working with once they owned this chain.”
‘Candy Land Board of Life’
Browning, the son of a real estate developer with a background in health care investing, viewed The Little Gym as a perfect part of his vision: He was building a conveyor belt of activities for kids.
Browning spent the 2010s building a franchise called Urban Air, a chain of trampoline parks where parents could spend $700 on a birthday party to remember for their seventh grader. The venture was staked by Browning and his father, and eventually, Urban Air formed Unleashed. Private equity was also interested in the Brownings’ growing business. Although a company spokesperson did not clarify the company’s relationship with private equity, on the websites of private equity firms AHR Growth Partners, Mantucket Capital and MPK Equity Partners, Unleashed or its brands are listed among their current or recent investments.
In 2021, he decided to scale up, following a hot new trend in private equity: building “platforms” to consolidate several brands in a similar industry that could then cross-sell a variety of services to their customers, as well as sell more franchises to their existing franchisees. Browning would often mention Neighborly, a rollup of home-services offerings that had been bought by private equity giant KKR, as his model.
“If I have five home services brands, I can pitch all those services to the same customer,” said Ritwik Donde, senior research analyst at FRANdata, which helps investors vet potential acquisitions. “Those complementary systems lower the cost of customer acquisition. ”
Browning’s company, Unleashed Brands, began buying other youth-enrichment chains. Parents — always moms, in Browning’s conception — could then spend money at his companies from the birth of their kids through high school graduation.
Cianci was immediately skeptical of Browning’s vision for rapidly collecting children’s services and integrating their sales, operations and marketing.
“That might be OK when you’re cleaning a dryer vent, but it’s not when you’re throwing around a 4-month-old and you need them to be safe,” Cianci said. “He was moving faster than he would need to get to know the business.”
To kick off the new program, Unleashed invited all of its newly acquired franchisees to a conference in Orlando, Florida, in October 2021, including Little Gym’s approximately 175 owners. The company rented out the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and held a fireworks show. And Browning treated attendees to a speech he called “vision casting,” in which he articulated his plans for building a family of children’s brands that families could spend money on from birth to age 18.
The “Candy Land board of life,” he called it. He promised new tech tools that would make their lives easier. “Auto-magic,” he called it.
Changes didn’t take long. Within weeks, long-tenured headquarters employees started leaving. In conversations with franchisees across the country, numerous owners expressed frustration that the support they depended on had evaporated; instead of calling a trusted adviser whenever they wanted, they had to file an online ticket. (Unleashed said that it “never sought to cut access” to its staff and that the ticket system was instituted to make sure they were responding in a timely fashion.)
The company tried to impose a new payroll vendor that caused unending headaches. Certain activities, such as karate, were eliminated as Unleashed acquired businesses with similar programming; the company said it trimmed services with low enrollment to “streamline” the offerings. The company also outlined a process by which franchisees could lose their licenses if they failed to meet brand standards, which set a sour tone among some of the operators. To people who’d just made it through a pandemic and operated on thin margins even in good times, the changes felt unnecessary and destabilizing.
In the fall of 2021, the company required all franchisees to sign a new agreement allowing Unleashed to automatically debit their bank accounts. Cianci noticed that it also contained broad language allowing the company to extract any other fees that might be owed, which she believed went beyond her franchise agreement.
Under the advice of a lawyer, she refused to sign it and started to send her royalty payments via paper check. But she worried that most franchisees would simply accept the new arrangement, along with another requiring them to use — and pay for — a shared call center.
To sound the alarm to others, Cianci held conference calls, often with a lawyer present. As concerns spread, a group of Little Gym franchisees in May formed the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association, which ultimately reached more than 90% participation from across the system. Cianci was elected president. The company started sending warning notices to franchisees who hadn’t signed the new agreements.
On May 19, 2022, Happy Handstands’ lawyers sent Unleashed a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of the membership. The next evening, an email popped up saying Cianci’s franchise had been terminated. When she tried to check it, her email account was gone, too. Unleashed said the company didn’t know she was the association’s president when they decided to terminate her. Cianci said it was widely known across the system and mentioned in a Facebook group visible to lower-level corporate executives.
To save her business, Cianci went before an arbitrator and filed for a preliminary injunction decrying the termination as retaliatory; the arbitrator ruled that she hadn’t cleared the high legal bar necessary to stop the process. After that, she started tearing down all her Little Gym branding and adapting her curriculum so as not to violate the company’s trademarks. She paused when Unleashed’s lawyers wanted to discuss a settlement, which she said she rejected over its harsh terms. When they demanded she finish the process of “de-identifying” as a Little Gym immediately, she had difficulty getting started again because she had surgery on a broken foot.
In June and July, the company sent undercover shoppers — including one who was a licensed private investigator — who posed as parents and asked Cianci’s employees what kinds of lessons they offered and whether they overlapped with The Little Gym’s programming. In early July, Unleashed, with the help of outside counsel DLA Piper, sued her in the superior court of Arizona for Maricopa County, where The Little Gym is based. The company accused her of failing to eliminate all branding fast enough, offering declarations from the investigators as evidence — the color scheme looked the same, for example, and a Wi-Fi network was still “TheLittleGym,” password “SeriousFun.”
Soon after, the company’s lawyers also visited her landlord in Frederick, which Unleashed said was “part of a standard process to inquire as to the status of the lease.” According to Cianci’s notes from her subsequent conversation with the landlord, the lawyers told him that she was in legal trouble and wouldn’t be able to keep paying rent.
Her landlord then sent her a letter, which was filed as evidence in court, declining to renew her lease and demanding more than $275,000 in back rent, including real estate taxes, most of which Cianci thought had been forgiven during the pandemic. Unleashed then exercised its option to take over the lease, although the building remains empty. (Her landlord declined to comment.)
In mid-July, Unleashed Brands’ chief legal officer, Stephen Polozola, sent all Little Gym franchisees an email titled “Friendly Reminder on Confidentiality.” In it, without naming Cianci, he warned them not to share any information with a certain former franchisee, who he said had been terminated for not paying royalty fees on time.
Further, he wrote that the company had received reports from “no less than seven” former employees who said that the unnamed franchisee had underpaid them and created a hostile work environment. The email finished with a grainy screenshot of a Facebook post containing a vulgar message that Polozola said had come from that same franchisee but didn’t have her name attached.
Cianci, who had taken her son to a water park for his birthday, immediately started getting messages from other franchisees. None of it was true, she told them. As she would detail in court documents, the company allowed late payments for nearly all franchisees during the pandemic, and her gym had been closed by local ordinance for longer than most. She had continued to send her royalties in the mail, even after she refused to sign Unleashed’s new payment form, she said, and she was current on all her accounts when she was terminated. And the inappropriate Facebook post? She said she hadn’t written it.
The allegations by Cianci’s former employees that Polozola referred to in his “friendly reminder” email sprang from messages that were sent by the workers in April 2021, before The Little Gym changed hands. After an investigation, no action was taken. The Unleashed spokesperson said the company had relied on Cianci’s assurance that she would resolve the matter with the Maryland Department of Labor. Cianci said she made no such assurance.
In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, the Department of Labor provided records showing a total of five complaints against Cianci for unpaid wages since 2017, two of which she resolved by paying her former employees; two were dropped; and one is pending.
But the emails from the former employees, which Unleashed supplied to the Times in unredacted form, detail complaints other than unpaid wages — such as dealing pills and mistreating children — that would seem to merit more immediate action by corporate headquarters, and which Cianci strongly denies.
In late summer of 2021, when one of the former employees contacted Unleashed again, Polozola told Cianci to ignore it, according to an email exchange she provided — until he brought the complaints back up to discredit her nearly a year later.
Arguing that such tactics seemed far outside the norms of legal practice, Cianci’s team in September filed a defense of so-called unclean hands, making the case that Unleashed Brands’ conduct had so tainted the proceedings that the judge should rule in their favor.
But their motion never went anywhere. Before the judge could rule on it, Unleashed filed to dismiss its own case, arguing that its complaint that Cianci was essentially operating an unauthorized Little Gym was moot because her landlord had evicted her.
The upshot of all this legal wrangling is that the fight between Cianci and Unleashed continues in arbitration in Arizona. In arbitration, potential damages are more limited, proceedings are sealed, and no precedent is created for other cases.
Unleashed is fighting to stop Cianci from running what it says is a competing gym. Cianci is fighting for the chance to keep her new business and recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars she has now spent on lawyers.
One of them, Peter Lagarias, began his career at the FTC, enforcing the agency’s then-new franchise rule in the late 1970s, and spent most of his career advocating for franchisees both in the courtroom and the California statehouse. He took her case for a low rate, but arbitrators, whose cost must be split by both parties, can run tens of thousands of dollars, too.
“They don’t want money,” Cianci said of Unleashed. “They want to destroy my life.”

A Cash-Flow Crunch
Bill Walenda, 55, also got into running Little Gyms as a second career. After years as a financial planner, he wanted to buy a franchise — maybe a McDonald’s or a Dunkin’ Donuts — and his wife suggested The Little Gym, since he loved working with children. He opened a gym in New Jersey in 2002 and bought another in Illinois in 2009.
After Cianci’s franchise was terminated, the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association fractured over strategy. Another group of owners started an association with a different approach: working “collaboratively” with the corporate office to provide feedback on changes. Walenda was elected president, and he has had limited success.
He has been fighting a new point-of-sale system with a credit card processor controlled by Unleashed, which franchisees say is keeping customer payments for more than a week before sending them to gym owners, creating a cash-flow crunch for owners. (Unleashed said the system keeps money for only two or three days.)
The company also continues to try to make everyone use its new shared call center, which Walenda said would “take us out of the equation of dealing with our customers” — something that might work for a business such as Urban Air, which processes thousands of people a week, but not the familial relationships on which The Little Gym operated for decades.
“You can’t treat every business the same,” Walenda said. “And that’s really what’s causing all of this strife.”
In November, Unleashed introduced a revised operations manual that lays out new rules and fees. It specifies the hours the businesses must be open, how quickly they must return customer calls, which architect they must use and what company meetings they must attend. Staff salaries were only supposed to make up 30% of revenue. The technology fee can rise to $399 from $119.
The national advertising fee can rise to 5% of gross sales from 1%; part of that will go to a fund that supports other Unleashed properties. New fees appeared, including a $30,000 fee to renew the franchise agreement, and a fee of about $15,000 to relocate the facility. For some owners, the changes seem to mean that they can no longer operate profitably and will have to sell rather than renew.
Unleashed said the changes apply only to new franchisees, and Walenda said his group has been able to negotiate away some of the fees even for them. But other fees remain, including a $100,000 payment if the franchise is terminated, and Walenda said the company continues to try to force everyone to use its call center and point-of-sale system. As much as he believes in the collaborative approach, he is willing to litigate to stop the attempts to extract more money.
“That’s all private equity cares about, as far as I’m concerned,” Walenda said. His business is doing well, which he credits to the post-pandemic desperation for children’s activities; he said Unleashed’s new systems have mostly just taken more time for his managers to deal with.
“We’re not people, we’re not businesses, we’re just numbers to them,” Walenda said. “And that’s a problem. Because ‘Let’s just keep squeezing everything we can out of them until we can’t squeeze anymore’ — it’s a good way of making money. It’s not a very good way to run a business.”

As for the Silbermans, they have been trying to pay down their debts.
“We are, hopefully, going to avoid bankruptcy by the skin of our teeth,” said Silberman.
New Rules for Franchises
Cianci’s case is winding its way through arbitration. Her new gym in a suburban mall next to Macy’s has only about 74 members, compared with the 275 she had before her termination by Unleashed. She said her husband, a federal trademark attorney, is working long hours to support them.
In the meantime, she’s trying to prevent future franchisees from being put in the situation she found herself in.
As the FTC reviews the rules governing franchising, advocates have urged the commission to add stronger protections, such as more disclosure of how the average franchise location performs. The International Franchise Association — whose board Browning recently joined — has lobbied hard to avert those changes.
In Congress, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has done extensive research on problems with the franchise system and introduced two bills seeking to give franchisees more leverage. But their fate is uncertain.
That’s why Cianci is focused on the states — specifically Arizona, where The Little Gym headquarters is based. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would protect franchisees’ right to form associations, require changes to their agreements to be presented in contractual form and limit the circumstances under which their licenses could be terminated.
At the very least, she hopes her case will ultimately prove that it’s possible to resist a franchiser’s efforts to impose its will outside what are supposed to be legally binding agreements, whether it’s how many birthday parties to offer or which insurance company to use.
“That’s exactly what went wrong here,” Cianci said. “He’s buying companies where people had rights.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Social media posts show that Mr. Nichols harbored a mistrust of prevailing government and economic systems, yet, a friend says, he also considered trying to change policing from the inside.
Before Tyre Nichols moved to Memphis -- before he was brutally beaten on a Saturday night by police officers there -- he lived in California, in the Sacramento area, where he hung out with a crowd of skateboarders.
They were a pack of teenage nonconformists. "Our friend group, we were a bunch of little rebels," said Angelina Paxton, one of Mr. Nichols's closest friends in Sacramento. But Mr. Nichols, she said, tended to be the voice warning them away from confrontation and serious trouble.
"If anything, he was the one in the back saying, 'Come on, guys,"' Ms. Paxton recalled. "He was chill. He was peaceful. He was laid back."
Mr. Nichols, she also said, was wary, as a Black man, of the police. His social media posts show that he identified with the Black Lives Matter movement and harbored a mistrust of prevailing government and economic systems.
And yet recently, Ms. Paxton said, Mr. Nichols had considered becoming a police officer.
"He was talking about how maybe that would be the easiest way to change things in the system -- by becoming the system," she said.
Mr. Nichols, 29, died in a Memphis hospital on Jan. 10, three days after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving. He had fled from the officers on foot, and had apparently been running toward the home of his mother and stepfather, where he had been living.
"All my son was trying to do was get home," his mother, RowVaughn Wells, said at a news conference earlier this week. "He was two minutes from the house when they murdered him."
Mr. Nichols's traumatic death has shocked Memphis, and forced the capital of the old Southern Cotton Belt to reckon with a nightmare scenario that does not fit neatly into most narratives of racist violence: all five of the officers, who have been fired and indicted for crimes including second-degree murder, are Black. So is the Memphis police chief, Cerelyn J. Davis, who this week called the officers' actions "heinous, reckless and inhumane."
Mr. Nichols's life story also cut against old narratives of African American migration patterns. Decades ago, Black people left the former Confederate states in large numbers, headed for places like California in search of opportunity and the hope of greater freedom.
But for Mr. Nichols, it was California, and its high cost of living, that had begun to feel oppressive. In early 2020, Ms. Paxton said, he set out for Tennessee to find a way to make ends meet, becoming part of what scholars have called a "New Great Migration" of Black Americans back to the states of the old Confederacy.
"At least things are affordable here," Mr. Nichols wrote in a 2021 Facebook post. "OK jobs with decent pay. Cheaper registration fees. Cigarettes that aren't $ 10 a pack lol."
Ms. Paxton, 28, met Mr. Nichols when they were teenagers. They were both involved with a California youth ministry called Flipt 180. "They were trying to give teenagers an outlet that wasn't the streets," she said.
She recalled how she first bonded with him in a car as they headed to a church event. She noticed that they were both wearing shocking shades of lime green. She found him to be mellow, but difficult to pin down. When he played D.J. for his friends, he played everything: country music, the rappers Lupe Fiasco and Tupac, reggae.
As they grew closer, Ms. Paxton learned that her friend's situation was complicated. He had been living with his father in Sacramento, but the father was terminally ill, and would die before Mr. Nichols was out of high school. His mother was 1,800 miles away, in Memphis. Skateboarding offered an escape.
"He was going through a lot," Ms. Paxton said. "When he skated, it's like he wasn't worried anymore. It was like nothing mattered more than when he landed that trick, you know?"
Sometime after his father died, Mr. Nichols moved in with the family of a close friend. After high school, Ms. Paxton said, he bounced around from job to job. He had a son with a woman he was in a relationship with for awhile. Pressure to move up the economic ladder was mounting.
At a certain point, Ms. Paxton said, "he spent most of the time trying to figure out what he was going to do with his life."
His move to Memphis in 2020 roughly coincided with the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and its lockdowns. He posted online about missing California, his old friends and his son: on the child's fourth birthday, Mr. Nichols bought cupcakes in his honor, but acknowledged that he would be eating them himself.
Yet on other occasions, he celebrated the fact that he had escaped to Tennessee.
"He felt the presence of the creator out in Memphis more than he ever had," Ms. Paxton said. "I mean, the nature, the people are kind -- it's just a whole different world."
Mr. Nichols was an avid amateur photographer, and his love of his new home was reflected on his Wix page, where he posted images of blues clubs, local landmarks and the sun setting over the Mississippi River. "He liked to go and watch the sunset and take pictures," his mother said at a news conference in Memphis on Friday. "That was his thing."
His embrace of Tennessee was also evident from his Facebook entries. In August 2021, he posted a video of himself in a checkered shirt, ball cap and mirrored sunglasses, dancing against a backdrop of farmland to Jason Aldean's "Girl Like You."
His other posts offered a glimpse into his passions and his politics. He posted about pro football and basketball. He wrote passionately about the plight of Indigenous people and the resilience of African Americans in the face of centuries of oppression. He denounced modern-day racism, political corruption and the power of elites. He embraced conspiracy theories about chemtrails, the John F. Kennedy assassination and the AIDS epidemic.
In June 2020, the month after George Floyd's murder, he posted a drawing based on a famous photo of Malcolm X peering out of a window, armed with a rifle. Beneath it was a caption: "Because I have a Black son," it said, followed by a drawing of a heart. That same month, in a separate post, Mr. Nichols wrote that he had seen "a lot more cops" who had decided to "kneel with all the protesters" and walk alongside them "with no batons and forceful weapons."
"Humanity is SLOWLY being restored!" he wrote.
Eventually his stepfather, Rodney Wells, helped him find a job at FedEx. The company's headquarters are in Memphis, and it has long been viewed as a crucial engine for economic sustenance and mobility for Black residents across the economic spectrum. "Those jobs are like post office jobs back in the day," said State Representative Joe Towns Jr., who represents part of Memphis. "Everybody wants one."
He worked the evening shift, and would come home with his stepfather, who worked the same shift, at around 7 p.m., when his mother had home cooking waiting. Ms. Paxton said that Mr. Nichols had specific goals: to earn enough to buy a car and a house, and to be able to fly his son out to visit him. Weekends, he would skate and take photos.
On the Saturday night when he was beaten, his mother had planned to cook him sesame chicken, a favorite. When the police stopped him, she said, he was driving back from Shelby Farms, a 4,500-acre park in the heart of Memphis, where he had probably taken in the sunset.
According to an initial police statement, the officers stopped him at 8:30 p.m., and a confrontation followed. He fled, but they chased him and caught him. The statement did not mention the beating, but it did note that he complained of shortness of breath. An ambulance came and took him to the hospital in what the police described as "critical condition."
At a news conference on Monday, Ms. Wells acknowledged that it seemed like every mother in her position describes their child as good. "But my son, he actually was a good boy," she said. Ben Crump, a lawyer for the family, noted that Mr. Nichols suffered from Crohn's disease, and as a result was almost impossibly slim: six-foot-three and 145 pounds.
On Tuesday, one of Mr. Nichols's three surviving siblings, Jamal Dupree, posted to Facebook a photo of Mr. Nichols as he lay in a hospital bed with a tube in his mouth, his face swollen and bruised and resting on a bloody pillow.
In a later post, Mr. Dupree addressed his younger brother directly: "I'm sorry I wasn't there to protect you," it said.
It was accompanied by a video shot from above the cloud line, with a blazing sun on the horizon that appeared to be either rising or setting.

When Private Equity Came for The Toddler Gyms

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Tiffany Cianci spends most of her days in socks, padding around the fitness studio she operates in Frederick, Maryland, about an hour outside Washington. Her clients are young: kids ranging from 4 months to 12 years old. They come to learn somersaults, try the monkey bars, sing some songs. (“Little Red Caboose,” complete with a train-whistle accompaniment, is one of her favorites.)
Cianci, 41, spent the first part of her career as a sommelier, specializing in sake. In 2017, wanting to leave the hospitality industry for something that allowed her to spend more time at home, she bought a facility with her husband as part of a franchise chain called The Little Gym. Its slogan: “Serious fun.”
They got what generations of franchise owners have gotten out of similar deals, with brands such as McDonald’s or Jiffy Lube: a known brand name and detailed business plans in exchange for an initial fee and a cut of the revenue. For Cianci, it was more than just a business.
“I love it. I really love it,” said Cianci, a mother of three who studied dance. “I love my students, and I love that it lets me make a difference.”
In the past year and a half, since The Little Gym was acquired by a private equity-backed firm called Unleashed Brands, her work has felt far less idyllic.
According to legal filings, internal documents, and interviews with more than a half-dozen other franchisees — most of whom requested anonymity so as to avoid retaliation — Unleashed began to demand higher fees and institute more stringent requirements, which the independent owners thought would threaten their profits. The day after Cianci organized her fellow franchise owners into an association to push back against the changes, the corporate office told her it was terminating her license on the grounds that she was chronically late in paying her fees. Given the timing, Cianci maintains in the legal filings that the action constituted retaliation.
Along the way, Unleashed Brands surveilled Cianci’s business with undercover shoppers, met with her landlord and disparaged her to fellow franchisees. When she tried to salvage her business under a new name — it’s now called Teeter Tots Music n Motion — the company sued, accusing her of violating its trademarks and a noncompete clause in her franchise agreement.
The episode has plunged Cianci about $300,000 into debt and enmeshed Unleashed in a nasty court battle not long after it acquired several new brands. The outcome will be a test of just how much a franchiser can unilaterally change the rules of a business relationship that has served as an on-ramp to entrepreneurship for hundreds of thousands of people.
The legal fight — along with two others Unleashed has faced with franchisees at its other brands — also reveals the challenges of applying the private equity playbook to the unique world of franchises.
Private equity has notched decades of high returns for investors by following a well-worn strategy: acquire distressed or undervalued companies or real estate, increase profits and then sell them. Greatest hits include foreclosed homes, highway rest stops and coal mines bought out of bankruptcy.
Franchising has become one of private equity’s targets du jour. According to the research firm FRANdata, the number of franchise brands acquired by private equity firms and other investors rose from 52 in 2019 to 149 in 2021 and was on track to nearly equal that total in 2022.
Private equity firms tout their ability to bring new ideas, technologies and efficiencies, and franchises, financially weakened by the pandemic, appeared ripe for those kinds of changes.
But the reality is not so straightforward. The nation’s franchisees (237,619, according to FRANdata), like Cianci, think of themselves as owners of independent small businesses, who have often sunk their life savings into the enterprise. That’s why Little Gym owners are resisting Unleashed’s attempts to squeeze their profits to pad its own.
Unlike, say, factory workers, who can be laid off at will, franchisees are supposed to be protected by legal documents that prescribe a certain business model for years at a time. Moreover, Unleashed — and its investors — need franchisees to stay motivated so they can keep generating revenue and recruit others to keep expanding the franchise system.
Cianci, who is now in arbitration with Unleashed Brands, has been working to change state laws to better protect franchisees who might find themselves in her position down the line. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, is reconsidering federal regulations on franchisers, which haven’t changed for more than a decade.
Direct inquiries to Michael Browning Jr., Unleashed’s CEO and founder, and other executives were not returned. Instead, a public relations firm answered detailed questions via email, saying the company’s changes have improved business across the board. “The financial impact and franchisee benefit of these efforts is undeniable,” the spokesperson wrote.
Many of the changes, however, are simply not what franchisees say they had signed up for.
“What this reflects is a conflict between the private equity firm that bought this and what they actually bought,” said Francine Lafontaine, an economist at the University of Michigan who specializes in franchise relationships. “In their due diligence, they didn’t seem to think too much about who they were going to be working with once they owned this chain.”
‘Candy Land Board of Life’
Browning, the son of a real estate developer with a background in health care investing, viewed The Little Gym as a perfect part of his vision: He was building a conveyor belt of activities for kids.
Browning spent the 2010s building a franchise called Urban Air, a chain of trampoline parks where parents could spend $700 on a birthday party to remember for their seventh grader. The venture was staked by Browning and his father, and eventually, Urban Air formed Unleashed. Private equity was also interested in the Brownings’ growing business. Although a company spokesperson did not clarify the company’s relationship with private equity, on the websites of private equity firms AHR Growth Partners, Mantucket Capital and MPK Equity Partners, Unleashed or its brands are listed among their current or recent investments.
In 2021, he decided to scale up, following a hot new trend in private equity: building “platforms” to consolidate several brands in a similar industry that could then cross-sell a variety of services to their customers, as well as sell more franchises to their existing franchisees. Browning would often mention Neighborly, a rollup of home-services offerings that had been bought by private equity giant KKR, as his model.
Browning’s company, Unleashed Brands, began buying other youth-enrichment chains. Parents — always moms, in Browning’s conception — could then spend money at his companies from the birth of their kids through high school graduation.
Cianci was immediately skeptical of Browning’s vision for rapidly collecting children’s services and integrating their sales, operations and marketing.
“That might be OK when you’re cleaning a dryer vent, but it’s not when you’re throwing around a 4-month-old and you need them to be safe,” Cianci said. “He was moving faster than he would need to get to know the business.”
To kick off the new program, Unleashed invited all of its newly acquired franchisees to a conference in Orlando, Florida, in October 2021, including Little Gym’s approximately 175 owners. The company rented out the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and held a fireworks show. And Browning treated attendees to a speech he called “vision casting,” in which he articulated his plans for building a family of children’s brands that families could spend money on from birth to age 18.
The “Candy Land board of life,” he called it. He promised new tech tools that would make their lives easier. “Auto-magic,” he called it.
Changes didn’t take long. Within weeks, long-tenured headquarters employees started leaving. Numerous franchisees across the country reported frustration that the support they depended on had evaporated; instead of calling a trusted adviser whenever they wanted, they had to file an online ticket. (Unleashed said that it “never sought to cut access” to its staff and that the ticket system was instituted to make sure they were responding in a timely fashion.)
The company tried to impose a new payroll vendor that caused unending headaches. Certain activities, such as karate, were eliminated as Unleashed acquired businesses with similar programming; the company said it trimmed services with low enrollment to “streamline” the offerings. The company also outlined a process by which franchisees could lose their licenses if they failed to meet brand standards, which set a sour tone among some of the operators.
In the fall of 2021, the company required all franchisees to sign a new agreement allowing Unleashed to automatically debit their bank accounts. Cianci noticed that it also contained broad language allowing the company to extract any other fees that might be owed, which she believed went beyond her franchise agreement.
Under the advice of a lawyer, she refused to sign it and started to send her royalty payments via paper check. But she worried that most franchisees would simply accept the new arrangement, along with another requiring them to use — and pay for — a shared call center.
To sound the alarm to others, Cianci held conference calls, often with a lawyer present. As concerns spread, a group of Little Gym franchisees in May formed the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association, which ultimately reached more than 90% participation from across the system. Cianci was elected president. The company started sending warning notices to franchisees who hadn’t signed the new agreements.
On May 19, Happy Handstands’ lawyers sent Unleashed a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of the membership. The next evening, an email popped up saying Cianci’s franchise had been terminated. When she tried to check it, her email account was gone, too. Unleashed said the company didn’t know she was the association’s president when they decided to terminate her. Cianci said it was widely known across the system and mentioned in a Facebook group visible to lower-level corporate executives.
To save her business, Cianci went before an arbitrator and filed for a preliminary injunction decrying the termination as retaliatory; the arbitrator ruled that she hadn’t cleared the high legal bar necessary to stop the process. After that, she started tearing down all her Little Gym branding and adapting her curriculum so as not to violate the company’s trademarks. She paused when Unleashed’s lawyers wanted to discuss a settlement, which she said she rejected over its harsh terms. When they demanded she finish the process of “de-identifying” as a Little Gym immediately, she had difficulty getting started again because she had surgery on a broken foot.
In June and July, the company sent undercover shoppers — including one who was a licensed private investigator — who posed as parents and asked Cianci’s employees what kinds of lessons they offered and whether they overlapped with The Little Gym’s programming. In early July, Unleashed, with the help of outside counsel DLA Piper, sued her in the superior court of Arizona for Maricopa County, where The Little Gym is based. The company accused her of failing to eliminate all branding fast enough, offering declarations from the investigators as evidence — the color scheme looked the same, for example, and a Wi-Fi network was still “TheLittleGym,” with the password “SeriousFun.”
Soon after, the company’s lawyers also visited her landlord in Frederick, which Unleashed said was “part of a standard process to inquire as to the status of the lease.” According to Cianci’s notes from her subsequent conversation with the landlord, the lawyers told him that she was in legal trouble and wouldn’t be able to keep paying rent.
Her landlord then sent her a letter, which was filed as evidence in court, declining to renew her lease and demanding more than $275,000 in back rent, including real estate taxes, most of which Cianci thought had been forgiven during the pandemic. Unleashed then exercised its option to take over the lease, although the building remains empty. (Her landlord declined to comment.)
In mid-July, Unleashed Brands’ chief legal officer, Stephen Polozola, sent all Little Gym franchisees an email titled “Friendly Reminder on Confidentiality.” In it, without naming Cianci, he warned them not to share any information with a certain former franchisee, who he said had been terminated for not paying royalty fees on time.
Further, he wrote that the company had received reports from “no less than seven” former employees who said that the unnamed franchisee had underpaid them and created a hostile work environment. The email finished with a grainy screenshot of a Facebook post containing a vulgar message that Polozola said had come from that same franchisee but didn’t have her name attached.
Cianci, who had taken her son to a water park for his birthday, immediately started getting messages from other franchisees. None of it was true, she told them. As she would detail in court documents, the company allowed late payments for nearly all franchisees during the pandemic, and her gym had been closed by local ordinance for longer than most. She had continued to send her royalties in the mail, even after she refused to sign Unleashed’s new payment form, she said, and she was current on all her accounts when she was terminated. And the inappropriate Facebook post? She said she hadn’t written it.
The allegations by Cianci’s former employees that Polozola referred to in his “friendly reminder” email sprang from messages that were sent by the workers in April 2021, before The Little Gym changed hands. After an investigation, no action was taken. The Unleashed spokesperson said the company had relied on Cianci’s assurance that she would resolve the matter with the Maryland Department of Labor. Cianci said she made no such assurance.
In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, the Department of Labor provided records showing a total of five complaints against Cianci for unpaid wages since 2017, two of which she resolved by paying her former employees; two were dropped; and one is pending.
But the emails from the former employees, which Unleashed supplied to the Times in unredacted form, detail complaints other than unpaid wages — such as dealing pills and mistreating children — that would seem to merit more immediate action by corporate headquarters, and which Cianci strongly denies.
In late summer of 2021, when one of the former employees contacted Unleashed again, Polozola told Cianci to ignore it, according to an email exchange she provided — until he brought the complaints back up to discredit her nearly a year later.
Arguing that such tactics seemed far outside the norms of legal practice, Cianci’s team in September filed a defense of so-called unclean hands, making the case that Unleashed Brands’ conduct had so tainted the proceedings that the judge should rule in their favor.
But their motion never went anywhere. Before the judge could rule on it, Unleashed filed to dismiss its own case, arguing that its complaint that Cianci was essentially operating an unauthorized Little Gym was moot because her landlord had evicted her.
The upshot of all this legal wrangling is that the fight between Cianci and Unleashed continues in arbitration in Arizona. In arbitration, potential damages are more limited, proceedings are sealed, and no precedent is created for other cases.
Unleashed is fighting to stop Cianci from running what it says is a competing gym. Cianci is fighting for the chance to keep her new business and recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars she has now spent on lawyers.
“They don’t want money,” Cianci said. “They want to destroy my life.”
A Cash-Flow Crunch
Bill Walenda, 55, also got into running Little Gyms as a second career. After years as a financial planner, he wanted to buy a franchise — maybe a McDonald’s or a Dunkin’ — and his wife suggested The Little Gym, since he loved working with children. He opened a gym in New Jersey in 2002 and bought another in Illinois in 2009.
After Cianci’s franchise was terminated, the Happy Handstands Franchisee Association fractured over strategy. Another group of owners started an association with a different approach: working “collaboratively” with the corporate office to provide feedback on changes. Walenda was elected president, and he has had limited success.
He has been fighting a new point-of-sale system with a credit card processor controlled by Unleashed, which franchisees say is keeping customer payments for more than a week before sending them to gym owners, creating a cash-flow crunch for owners. (Unleashed said the system keeps money for only two or three days.)
The company also continues to try to make everyone use its new shared call center, which Walenda said would “take us out of the equation of dealing with our customers” — something that might work for a business such as Urban Air, which processes thousands of people a week, but not the familial relationships on which The Little Gym operated for decades.
“You can’t treat every business the same,” Walenda said. “And that’s really what’s causing all of this strife.”
In November, Unleashed introduced a revised operations manual that lays out new rules and fees. It specifies the hours the businesses must be open, how quickly they must return customer calls, which architect they must use and what company meetings they must attend. Staff salaries were supposed to make up only 30% of revenue. The technology fee can rise to $399 from $119.
The national advertising fee can rise to 5% of gross sales from 1%; part of that will go to a fund that supports other Unleashed properties. New fees appeared, including a $30,000 fee to renew the franchise agreement, and a fee of about $15,000 to relocate the facility. For some owners, the changes seem to mean that they can no longer operate profitably and will have to sell rather than renew.
Unleashed said the changes apply only to new franchisees, and Walenda said his group has been able to negotiate away some of the fees even for them. But other fees remain, including a $100,000 payment if the franchise is terminated, and Walenda said the company continues to try to force everyone to use its call center and point-of-sale system. As much as he believes in the collaborative approach, he is willing to litigate to stop the attempts to extract more money.
“That’s all private equity cares about, as far as I’m concerned,” Walenda said. His business is doing well, which he credits to the post-pandemic desperation for children’s activities; he said Unleashed’s new systems have mostly just taken more time for his managers to deal with.
“We’re not people, we’re not businesses, we’re just numbers to them,” Walenda said. “And that’s a problem. Because ‘Let’s just keep squeezing everything we can out of them until we can’t squeeze anymore’ — it’s a good way of making money. It’s not a very good way to run a business.”
After a year of owning The Little Gym, Unleashed Brands says that average gym revenue rose 36.8% in 2022 over 2019. And its franchisee recruitment has focused on people who want to open multiple units, such as Cody Herndon, whom Unleashed provided as an example of a Little Gym owner with a more positive view of management.
An Urban Air operator who sold one of his two parks to another private equity investor, Herndon bought the rights to open three Little Gyms in Texas last year. He said he was drawn by the opportunity to have longer-term relationships with families and thought the new systems that Unleashed was pushing would work out in the end.
“There are going to be so many massive benefits to any change that’s been asked,” Herndon said.
While disclosing few other metrics, the company told Axios in May that it expected to generate $160 million in revenue in 2022 and was shopping for a buyer. It appears to have found one.
Unleashed’s current private equity investors are selling their stakes in the company imminently, according to a company spokesperson. But the company declined to disclose the buyer or the terms of the deal.
Whoever the buyer may be has significant franchisee rancor on its hands — even beyond The Little Gym.
At Browning’s original chain, Urban Air, a franchisee association representing more than 50 owners tried to bring a lawsuit in 2020 over what it viewed as unfair changes that had revealed the “terms and provisions of the franchise agreements upon which investment decisions were made to be illusory and meaningless.” But a Texas court threw out the case on technical grounds, and with individual arbitration the only path forward, the effort fell apart.
In late 2022, Unleashed was also sued by 54 franchisees of its Premier Martial Arts brand who said in legal filings that the franchiser gave them an unrealistic impression of the cost of running a martial arts studio, leaving them with dead-end businesses and debt.
Michelle and Peter Silberman depleted their retirement savings, maxed out their credit cards and took out a home-equity loan to acquire three Premier Martial Arts territories in March 2020, before Unleashed owned the franchiser. The first opened near their home in the Pittsburgh area in May. Peter Silberman said Premier Martial Arts told them that they could expect profit margins as high as 48%, while running the studios as “semi-absentee” owners as little as 10 hours a week.
The couple were charging parents $138 a month, which included two classes a week. The Silbermans, who had no experience with martial arts, said they relied on the company’s assurances that it would help them manage the business.
But when attendance began to decline and expenses were piling up — the couple spent $370,000 acquiring the territories and operating the one facility — Peter Silberman said Premier Martial Arts offered little additional help. Their studio closed in the fall.
Although the trouble began long before Unleashed announced that it had bought Premier Martial Arts in early 2022, the lawsuit states that after the acquisition, “the same false statements were still made and the same bogus model was pitched.”
In response, the Unleashed spokesperson said the company is “not a party to any contract” with a Premier Martial Arts franchisee.
As for the Silbermans, they have been trying to pay down their debts.
“We are, hopefully, going to avoid bankruptcy by the skin of our teeth,” said Silberman.
New Rules for Franchises
Cianci’s case is winding its way through arbitration. Her new gym in a suburban mall next to Macy’s has only about 74 members, compared with the 275 she had before her termination by Unleashed. She said her husband, a federal trademark attorney, is working long hours to support them.
In the meantime, she’s trying to prevent future franchisees from being put in the situation she found herself in.
As the FTC reviews the rules governing franchising, advocates have urged the commission to add stronger protections, such as more disclosure of how the average franchise location performs. The International Franchise Association — whose board Browning recently joined — has lobbied hard to avert those changes.
In Congress, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has done extensive research on problems with the franchise system and introduced two bills seeking to give franchisees more leverage. But their fate is uncertain.
That’s why Cianci is focused on the states — specifically Arizona, where The Little Gym headquarters is based. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would protect franchisees’ right to form associations, require changes to their agreements to be presented in contractual form and limit the circumstances under which their licenses could be terminated.
At the very least, she hopes her case will ultimately prove that it’s possible to resist a franchiser’s efforts to impose its will outside what are supposed to be legally binding agreements, whether it’s how many birthday parties to offer or which insurance company to use.
“That’s exactly what went wrong here,” Cianci said. “He’s buying companies where people had rights.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Before Tyre Nichols moved to Memphis, Tennessee — before he was brutally beaten on a Saturday night by police officers there — he lived in California, in the Sacramento area, where he hung out with a crowd of skateboarders.
They were a pack of teenage nonconformists. “Our friend group, we were a bunch of little rebels,” said Angelina Paxton, one of Nichols’ closest friends in Sacramento. But Nichols, she said, tended to be the voice warning them away from confrontation and serious trouble.
“If anything, he was the one in the back saying, ‘Come on, guys,’” Paxton recalled. “He was chill. He was peaceful. He was laid back.”
Nichols, she also said, was wary, as a Black man, of the police. His social media posts show that he identified with the Black Lives Matter movement and harbored a mistrust of prevailing government and economic systems.
And yet recently, Paxton said, Nichols had considered becoming a police officer.
“He was talking about how maybe that would be the easiest way to change things in the system — by becoming the system,” she said.
Nichols, 29, died in a Memphis hospital on Jan. 10, three days after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving. He had fled from the officers on foot, and had apparently been running toward the home of his mother and stepfather, where he had been living.
“All my son was trying to do was get home,” his mother, RowVaughn Wells, said at a news conference earlier this week. “He was two minutes from the house when they murdered him.”
Nichols’ traumatic death has shocked Memphis, and forced the capital of the old Southern Cotton Belt to reckon with a nightmare scenario that does not fit neatly into most narratives of racist violence: all five of the officers, who have been fired and indicted for crimes including second-degree murder, are Black. So is the Memphis police chief, Cerelyn J. Davis, who this week called the officers’ actions “heinous, reckless and inhumane.”
Nichols’ life story also cut against old narratives of African American migration patterns. Decades ago, Black people left the former Confederate states in large numbers, headed for places like California in search of opportunity and the hope of greater freedom.
But for Nichols, it was California, and its high cost of living, that had begun to feel oppressive. In early 2020, Paxton said, he set out for Tennessee to find a way to make ends meet, becoming part of what scholars have called a “New Great Migration” of Black Americans back to the states of the old Confederacy.
“At least things are affordable here,” Nichols wrote in a 2021 Facebook post. “OK jobs with decent pay. Cheaper registration fees. Cigarettes that aren’t $10 a pack lol.”
Paxton, 28, met Nichols when they were teenagers. They were both involved with a California youth ministry called Flipt 180. “They were trying to give teenagers an outlet that wasn’t the streets,” she said.
She recalled how she first bonded with him in a car as they headed to a church event. She noticed that they were both wearing shocking shades of lime green. She found him to be mellow, but difficult to pin down. When he played DJ for his friends, he played everything: country music, rappers Lupe Fiasco and Tupac, reggae.
As they grew closer, Paxton learned that her friend’s situation was complicated. He had been living with his father in Sacramento, but the father was terminally ill, and would die before Nichols was out of high school. His mother was 1,800 miles away, in Memphis. Skateboarding offered an escape.
“He was going through a lot,” Paxton said. “When he skated, it’s like he wasn’t worried anymore. It was like nothing mattered more than when he landed that trick, you know?”
Sometime after his father died, Nichols moved in with the family of a close friend. After high school, Paxton said, he bounced around from job to job. He had a son with a woman he was in a relationship with for awhile. Pressure to move up the economic ladder was mounting.
At a certain point, Paxton said, “he spent most of the time trying to figure out what he was going to do with his life.”
His move to Memphis in 2020 roughly coincided with the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and its lockdowns. He posted online about missing California, his old friends and his son: on the child’s fourth birthday, Nichols bought cupcakes in his honor, but acknowledged that he would be eating them himself.
Yet on other occasions, he celebrated the fact that he had escaped to Tennessee.
“He felt the presence of the creator out in Memphis more than he ever had,” Paxton said. “I mean, the nature, the people are kind — it’s just a whole different world.”
Nichols was an avid amateur photographer, and his love of his new home was reflected on his Wix page, where he posted images of blues clubs, local landmarks and the sun setting over the Mississippi River. “He liked to go and watch the sunset and take pictures,” his mother said at a news conference in Memphis on Friday. “That was his thing.”
His embrace of Tennessee was also evident from his Facebook entries. In August 2021, he posted a video of himself in a checkered shirt, ball cap and mirrored sunglasses, dancing against a backdrop of farmland to Jason Aldean’s “Girl Like You.”
His other posts offered a glimpse into his passions and his politics. He posted about pro football and basketball. He wrote passionately about the plight of Indigenous people and the resilience of African Americans in the face of centuries of oppression. He denounced modern-day racism, political corruption and the power of elites. He embraced conspiracy theories about chemtrails, the John F. Kennedy assassination and the AIDS epidemic.
In June 2020, the month after George Floyd’s murder, he posted a drawing based on a famous photo of Malcolm X peering out of a window, armed with a rifle. Beneath it was a caption: “Because I have a Black son,” it said, followed by a drawing of a heart. That same month, in a separate post, Nichols wrote that he had seen “a lot more cops” who had decided to “kneel with all the protesters” and walk alongside them “with no batons and forceful weapons.”
“Humanity is SLOWLY being restored!” he wrote.
Eventually his stepfather, Rodney Wells, helped him find a job at FedEx. The company’s headquarters are in Memphis, and it has long been viewed as a crucial engine for economic sustenance and mobility for Black residents across the economic spectrum. “Those jobs are like post office jobs back in the day,” said state Rep. Joe Towns Jr., who represents part of Memphis. “Everybody wants one.”
He worked the evening shift, and would come home with his stepfather, who worked the same shift, around 7 p.m., when his mother had home cooking waiting. Paxton said that Nichols had specific goals: to earn enough to buy a car and a house, and to be able to fly his son out to visit him. Weekends, he would skate and take photos.
On the Saturday night when he was beaten, his mother had planned to cook him sesame chicken, a favorite. When the police stopped him, she said, he was driving back from Shelby Farms, a 4,500-acre park in the heart of Memphis, where he had probably taken in the sunset.
According to an initial police statement, the officers stopped him at 8:30 p.m., and a confrontation followed. He fled, but they chased him and caught him. The statement did not mention the beating, but it did note that he complained of shortness of breath. An ambulance came and took him to the hospital in what police described as “critical condition.”
At a news conference Monday, Wells acknowledged that it seemed like every mother in her position describes their child as good. “But my son, he actually was a good boy,” she said. Ben Crump, a lawyer for the family, noted that Nichols suffered from Crohn’s disease, and as a result was almost impossibly slim: 6-foot-3 and 145 pounds.
On Tuesday, one of Nichols’ three surviving siblings, Jamal Dupree, posted to Facebook a photo of Nichols as he lay in a hospital bed with a tube in his mouth, his face swollen and bruised and resting on a bloody pillow.
In a later post, Dupree addressed his younger brother directly: “I’m sorry I wasn’t there to protect you,” it said.
It was accompanied by a video shot from above the cloud line, with a blazing sun on the horizon that appeared to be either rising or setting. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Russia Bans a Leading Independent News Site in Latest Attack on Free Press: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Russian officials continued their campaign to stifle press freedom on Thursday, labeling the independent news website Meduza an "undesirable organization" and effectively outlawing its content. The move made Meduza the latest journalistic outlet to fall victim to the Kremlin's efforts to suppress criticism.
The Russian prosecutor general's office said that Meduza's activities "pose a threat to the foundations of the Russian Federation's constitutional order and national security," according to the Interfax news agency.
Over the past year Moscow has ramped up its attempts to control coverage of the war in Ukraine. In March, President Vladimir V. Putin signed a law effectively criminalizing any public opposition to or independent reporting about the war.
Announcements about the new law pushed some Russian independent media outlets to shut down even before it was officially enacted. The Russian government has also cut off access to Facebook, the BBC and other news sources.
"Russian authorities are showing that they will do anything to impede the work of one of the leading independent Russian-language media outlets," Gulnoza Said, the Europe and Central Asia coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a press watchdog organization, said in a statement.
Meduza, a popular Latvia-based outlet, which publishes news about Russia in both Russian and English, often reports critically on the war in Ukraine. It posts on its website and to over one million subscribers on Telegram, in Russia and elsewhere.
The website was blocked in Russia last year at the start of the war in Ukraine. But the new "undesirable" designation has even more far-reaching consequences. Now anyone in Russia who accesses the site, "likes" any of its social media content or shares a hyperlink to an article could face fines or jail time.
Meduza's editor in chief, Ivan Kolpakov, called the designation a "very bad event," but said that "nevertheless, we were waiting for this to happen -- and we tried to prepare ourselves."
The site plans to continue to publish, although its future plans weren't clear.
Even before the Ukraine invasion, Moscow had labeled Meduza a "foreign agent," crippling its advertising revenue and forcing it to shift to a crowdfunding model to stay in business. As a foreign agent, Meduza had to add a 24-word disclaimer of its new status to all of its Russian-language content, including social media posts. If it did not, the organization and its journalists could potentially receive fines or jail time.
Meduza wasn't alone. In June, the independent business news site VTimes shut down after Russia's foreign agent designation hurt its business and made it difficult for reporters to do their jobs. And in August, the government added TV Rain, long a top independent outlet, and the news site iStories to the foreign agent list.
Other independent news sources have been feeling pressure from Moscow's efforts to censor their coverage, even as they see a new urgency to provide unfiltered reporting.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a news network originally set up as a C.I.A. operation early in the Cold War, is an example. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February both shook up Radio Free Europe's operations and highlighted its mission's importance.
Within days of the invasion, the organization suspended its operations in Russia. It had faced years of growing pressure from Moscow and had already evacuated most of its staff to Prague and other offices even before the war broke out.
Jamie Fly, the broadcaster's president and chief executive, said his organization has long been in "firefighting mode."
"The challenge we're facing now, and the invasion of Ukraine, is just the latest iteration," Mr. Fly said in an interview late last year. "We are increasingly getting pressure when we're operating in these environments, and in some cases, we're getting pushed out of countries. That's always been a challenge for us."

After a Dig, a Road From Ancient Rome Will Remain a Mystery: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An archaeological dig that began last summer, searching for the long-elusive "first mile" of the Appian Way, has been stymied by ground water.
ROME -- It's a question that has long eluded an answer: where exactly was the beginning of the Appian Way, the ancient Roman thoroughfare so famous that it was known as the "regina viarum," or queen of roads.
Remains of the original Appian Way, named for Appius Claudius, a Roman consul, and begun in 312 B.C., are still visible (and make for a great walk) within Rome. But traces of the so-called first mile remain buried some eight meters, or 26 feet, below the street level of contemporary Rome.
Last July, a team of archaeologists began a hunt for the lost starting point of the Via Appia by excavating a site in front of a row of ancient shops -- still visible -- that were once part of the monumental entrance to the thermal baths that the Emperor Caracalla built in A.D. 211.
Digging down through Rome's millenary history, archaeologists and historians collected plenty of information and data to crunch. They found traces of the farmland and vineyards that occupied this area for more than 1,000 years, until Rome rapidly modernized and expanded after it was named capital of Italy in 1871.
And they unearthed the remains of a 10th-century road, and even older buildings, finds that suggest that from the sixth century A.D. through the high Middle Ages, this was a busy district. Archaeologists think the structures might have been shops serving pilgrims who stopped in the Christian sites that are believed to have sprung up in the area in that time.
"Urban excavations provide vital information to better understand the topography of an area during various eras," said Mirella Serlorenzi, the scientific director of the excavation, which is being carried out by the Special Superintendence of Rome, a branch of the culture ministry, and Roma Tre University.
But the excavation was hampered -- and ultimately stalled -- by a powerful flow of groundwater that even modern pumps couldn't keep up with.
"Unfortunately, because of the groundwater, we can't go any further down," said Ms. Serlorenzi, who is also the director of the Baths of Caracalla. She pointed to a section of excavated earth with a wide gash through which gushed a sizable stream of water. "We risked losing knowledge and information," she said, so the excavations were stopped when archaeologists reached a level about a meter and a half above the Roman-era street level.
"It was an extremely complex excavation," echoed Riccardo Santangeli Valenzani, a professor of Medieval Archaeology at Roma Tre who worked on the site on a daily basis.
The location was selected on the basis of a series of preliminary studies that began in 2018, using European Union funds. And the initial evidence suggests that archaeologists could be on the right track.
Ancient sources report that in the vicinity, Septimius Severus, who was emperor from 193 to 211, had a broader thoroughfare -- 100 Roman feet wide -- built to accommodate the growing Roman population. Known as the Via Nova, the road is marked in the Forma Urbis Romae, the great third-century marble map of Rome. Debate continues among archaeologists over the interconnection between the Via Nova and the Via Appian -- whether they were side by side, whether the Nova was placed directly above the older road, or whether Septimius merely widened the Appia to create the Nova.
The walls of the shops found in the current excavation stand about 30 meters -- or 100 Roman feet -- from the still-visible shops in front of the Baths of Caracalla, meaning that the road that passed in between would correspond with the exact width of the Via Nova. So there are compelling signs that a road existed where the digging took place, "but we still can't say whether this was or wasn't the Appian Way," Ms. Serlorenzi said. New excavations will depend on whether funding can be found.
Artifacts unearthed during the excavation point to many centuries of occupancy, including pottery dating to various epochs, a marble head of a boy dating to the third century, tiny Roman-era bronze coins that archaeologists described as "spare change for minor expenses" and a more precious square coin minted between 690 and 730, at the time that papal power was rising in Rome.
The dig was chronicled on a regular basis for the general public, who could follow developments via a Facebook page. For specialists, more detailed reports were available on a government website.
Professor Santangeli Valenzani noted that the water problem had been known since ancient times, when the area was known as a "public pool." Before Caracalla built his baths here, two other emperors had also built thermal structures in the area. "The water problem just got worse when they stopped maintaining local sewers in the 5th century," he said.
Earlier this month, the Appian Way in its entirety, all 341-odd miles from Rome to Brindisi, a city on Italy's southeastern coast, was pitched as a candidate to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
"This excavation is a good fit for the candidacy, said Daniela Porro, Rome's special superintendent.
It's good for the city, too, experts say.
"One of the merits of this dig is to shine the spotlight on an area where the history of Rome is stratified," said Daniele Manacorda, a retired archaeology professor at Roma Tre who has extensively researched the elusive first mile.

North Korea Locks Down Its Capital for Five Days to Fight Flu and Other Illnesses: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A government notice made no mention of Covid-19, but state media said the authorities were taking measures in the capital to "cope with the daily-worsening world health crisis."
North Korea has imposed a five-day lockdown on its capital city as it battles an increase in "recurrent flu and other respiratory diseases" amid a cold spell, according to the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang.
A North Korean government notice that the embassy posted on its Facebook account on Wednesday said Pyongyang had ordered a "special anti-epidemic period" through Sunday. It advised all foreign diplomatic missions to keep their employees indoors, have their temperatures taken four times a day and report the results to a hospital by phone. There was no mention of a specific plan of action for regular citizens.
Any goods the diplomats need can be ordered and delivered to the embassies, the notice said.
The statement made no mention of the coronavirus, although the North's state media said on Thursday that its health authorities were taking precautionary measures to "cope with the daily-worsening world health crisis." It was also unclear whether the lockdown covered areas beyond Pyongyang.
Although North Korea claimed in August that it had eradicated the coronavirus, it has continued to emphasize anti-pandemic strategies. The country's chronically malnourished people are prone to infectious diseases, according to health experts. Amid a cold snap that has gripped the Korean Peninsula this week, the North's state media reported on Thursday that health authorities were redoubling their efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including influenza.
North Korea has shut its borders during the pandemic and shunned offers of international aid, fearing that outside help might bring in Covid-19. But UNICEF has been able to send supplies for its humanitarian programs there, including vaccines for tuberculosis and other diseases and special food for severely malnourished children.
Sixteen shipping containers of medical supplies, therapeutic milk and other nutritional products arrived in North Korea in early January, said Shima Islam, a UNICEF official in Bangkok. Last week, nine shipping containers arrived there with TB-related supplies and syringes for health facilities. Still, the global relief organization held out hope that North Korea would reopen its border so it can scale up its humanitarian operations there, as a continuing food crisis and resulting belt-tightening afflict the country.
For the first two years of the pandemic, North Korea claimed to have no Covid-19 cases. Then in May last year, it reported an outbreak for the first time, announcing a "maximum emergency" and locking down all of its cities and counties. Three months later, its leader, Kim Jong-un, claimed that the country had brought the outbreak to an end without vaccines.
But outside experts have been skeptical about the North's Covid claims, in part because the isolated, impoverished country does not have enough testing kits or laboratories to accurately track a major outbreak. Although the country has reported 4.7 million cases of high fever during the outbreak, it has never said how many were confirmed Covid-19 infections.
In recent weeks there have been signs that North Korea was mobilizing large crowds to rehearse a major military parade. Feb. 8 marks the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military, and Mr. Kim has often staged military parades during major holidays. But as past "superspreader" events the world over have shown, large gatherings risk broadening the spread of infectious diseases.

Full text: A chatbot comes to its own defense, saying the idea that it is a threat to democracy is "fear-based speculation."
To the Editor:
Re "How ChatGPT Hijacks Democracy," by Nathan E. Sanders and Bruce Schneier (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Jan. 15):
I fed this essay into ChatGPT and asked it to write a rebuttal. ChatGPT read the article and wrote the following in less than a minute:
As a writer and researcher who is familiar with the capabilities of language models like ChatGPT, I was surprised to read the recent New York Times essay that suggested that this technology could be used to "upend" democratic processes through lobbying.
While it is true that ChatGPT can generate text that is often indistinguishable from human writing, it is important to note that this technology is not capable of understanding the nuances and subtleties of political networks and systems.
Additionally, the idea that ChatGPT could be used to "ruthlessly exploit" policymaking vulnerabilities is a gross exaggeration of its capabilities.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the problem of automatically generated comments is not new. For several years, we have struggled with bots that automatically post content. Platforms like Facebook have become better at removing "coordinated inauthentic behavior."
In reality, ChatGPT and similar technologies have the potential to be powerful tools for businesses, researchers and educators. They can be used to automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency and generate new insights. However, the notion that ChatGPT could be used to compromise democratic processes is fear-based speculation that is not rooted in reality.
It is important to approach new technologies with caution and to understand their capabilities and limitations. However, it is also essential not to exaggerate their potential dangers and to consider how they can be used in a positive and responsible manner.

New Year or Not, You Deserve Dessert: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Make a reservation for pastries, try savory gelato at a restaurant from the Roberta's team and more.
I've never subscribed to the idea of "new year, new me." After all, time is a construct! You can start over whenever you'd like, whether it's Jan. 1, June 22 or Nov. 13. This is an especially hard time of year to be a professional eater. Suddenly your friends who were only too happy to tag along for a meal are trying to cook more and indulge less. And dessert, well, that's simply out of the question.
If you're me, however, dessert is never, ever out of the question. Recently, The Times's Priya Krishna wrote about professional chefs' longstanding appreciation for instant pudding mix, inspired by the excellent glazed pistachio Bundt cake at the restaurant Claud in the East Village, and I knew it was high time for another all-dessert edition of this newsletter.
After all, is it even a meal -- or a good day for that matter -- if it doesn't have a sweet ending?
A Worthwhile Reservation for Pastries
I'd been meaning to get over to Lysée in the Flatiron district for months, and I finally made it to this "pastry boutique" from Eunji Lee, a pastry chef born in South Korea. Most weekends, there's a line down the block to buy some combination of the nearly two dozen dessert options, but I highly recommend making a reservation for the full experience in the first-floor cafe.
Start with a coffee or tea, and then go hog-wild. The most popular item by a long shot is the corn mousse cake that looks like a corn emoji (ð½). But my favorites are the lysée, a Korean brown rice cake with pecan sable and praline that tastes like a gussied-up version of a Necco wafer; the petit jardin tart with pineapple-basil marmalade and calamansi pastry cream; and what I'm prepared to call the city's absolute best kouign-amann, a double-decker puff of laminated dough. And do order another kouign-amann to go. I promise that you'll wake up craving it the next morning -- if it lasts until then.
Cookie Boxes and Dreamy Petit Fours
If you follow me on Instagram, you know that I recently gave myself a Lunar New Year cookie box from the Little One, an aptly named dessert shop in Chinatown. It contained scrumptious black sesame chocolate chip cookies, jammy pineapple pinwheels and airy little strawberry meringues. The first day of the Year of the Rabbit came and went this weekend, but the Little One offers charming cookie collections from time to time, particularly around the holidays. The rest of the year it has seasonal kakigori, monaka sandwiches and eye-catching six-inch cakes for any celebrations you might have on the horizon. In this case, the celebration was to thank me for being me.
And what of the dyed-in-the-wool restaurant dessert, the kind that comes after the drinks, the appetizers and the entrees? Well, there was the delightfully savory bay leaf gelato with huckleberry jam that I enjoyed at Foul Witch, a new restaurant in the East Village from the folks behind Roberta's Pizza. Also the way-above-average tiramisù at Macosa Trattoria in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which I split with some "new year, new me"-hating friends. But what I think about when I close my eyes at night is the towering, three-tier mignardise platter at Le Rock in Rockefeller Center, with its selection of nine different petit fours, each of them a tiny adventure. And if you're not being adventurous, what's the point?
In Other News ...
This week, Pete Wells reviewed Masalawala & Sons in Park Slope, Brooklyn, finding the mustard oil-laden dishes -- a signature of Bengali cooking -- to be punchy and exciting.
Openings: Foul Witch, a new fine-dining spot from the Roberta's team, is open in the East Village; Alphabet City is now home to the Office of Mr. Moto, a 21-course omakase with a speakeasy theme; and Caleta is also now open in the East Village for ice cream by day and small plates at night.
Kim Severson reported on how the corporate cafeteria is changing in the wake of the pandemic, with some companies adding oyster-shucking classes and services that aggregate lunch orders from local restaurants.
And in the wake of the news that Noma will close in 2024, Tejal Rao reflects on the pressure to keep pushing the envelope in the fine-dining world and the human cost of that pressure.

Kyiv Leader Fires Deputy Implicated In Bribery: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The Ukrainian leader said the dismissal should serve as notice to officials whose actions "violate the principle of justice."
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has vowed to take action against corruption in the wake of an official's dismissal for embezzlement, stressing that the focus on the war would not detract from tackling an endemic issue in his country.
Corruption plagued Ukraine long before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February. And while fighting Russian aggression has been the primary focus of Mr. Zelensky's government, corruption has remained a priority -- especially as weapons and aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars flood into the country, and the price tag for reconstruction efforts is estimated to be in the billions.
Mr. Zelensky, who came to power in 2019 on a promise of cleaning up corruption, acknowledged in his overnight address Sunday that the government's "main focus is on defense, foreign policy, and war."
"But this does not mean that I do not see or hear what is being said in society at different levels," he said, citing issues with energy and military procurement, and saying his government would "take the necessary powerful steps."
Mr. Zelensky said he hoped the dismissal of a deputy minister on Sunday would send a "signal to all those whose actions or behavior violate the principle of justice."
"I want this to be clear: There will be no return to what used to be in the past," Mr. Zelensky said
On Monday, Mr. Zelensky announced in his nightly address that government officials would now be prohibited from traveling abroad for vacation or any other non-governmental purpose, and that a border-crossing procedure for officials would be developed within days.
While Mr. Zelensky did not name the dismissed official, Ukraine's infrastructure ministry identified him as Vasyl Lozynsky, a deputy minister in the office. His firing came after Ukraine's top anti-corruption agency and the anti-corruption prosecutor's office "exposed and stopped the activities of an organized criminal group involved in the embezzlement of budget funds," according to Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine's infrastructure minister.
The agency, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, said that Mr. Lozynsky was part of that group and had been detained while getting a $ 400,000 bribe for helping with equipment and machinery purchasing contracts. Detectives were working to identify other people involved in the organization, the N.A.B.U. said in a statement.
The contracts were related to restoring critical infrastructure facilities and providing light, heat and water during the winter, the anti-corruption prosecutor's office said in a statement. Over the past several months, Russia has pummeled Ukraine with strikes on infrastructure targets designed to spread misery among civilians.
Even as Russia's war on Ukraine grinds on with no end in sight, Ukraine's allies have been grappling with complicated questions about the country's reconstruction: Who will pay for what, and who should control the process and the funds? What kind of external oversight of the money should be required? Kyiv has said it will need $ 750 billion to rebuild its infrastructure, though a report in September by the Washington-based German Marshall Fund estimated a price tag of $ 100 billion.
The European Union has tied Ukraine's candidate status to overhauls of the rule of law, justice and anti-corruption. In addition to concerns about the risk of corruption tainting post-war reconstruction efforts, some U.S. officials have expressed concerns that American weapons given to Ukraine could be diverted or stolen for resale.
Mr. Kubrakov, the infrastructure minister, said on Sunday that he would instruct his office to review "all active projects" -- including its budget and foreign funding.
"We continue to work," he said in a Facebook post.

Justices Delay Considering Cases in Florida and Texas Curbing Internet Platforms: [National Desk]

Full text: The laws, enacted by Florida and Texas in response to conservative complaints about censorship, have been challenged under the First Amendment.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court asked the Biden administration on Monday for its views on whether the Constitution allows Florida and Texas to prevent large social media companies from removing posts based on the views they express.
The practical effect of the move was to put off a decision on whether to hear two major First Amendment challenges to the states' laws for at least several months. If the court ends up granting review, as seems likely, it will hear arguments no earlier than October and will probably not issue a decision until next year.
The two state laws, which are similar but not identical, were largely the product of conservative frustration. The laws' supporters said the measures were needed to combat what they called Silicon Valley censorship. In particular, they objected to the decisions of some platforms to bar President Donald J. Trump after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
The laws were challenged by two trade groups, NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which said the First Amendment prohibits the government from telling private companies whether and how to disseminate speech.
The Florida law imposes fines on large social media platforms that refuse to transmit the views of politicians who run afoul of their standards.
In a statement issued when he signed the Florida bill, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said the point of the law was to promote conservative viewpoints. "If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable," he said.
The Texas law differs in its details, Judge Andrew S. Oldham wrote in a decision upholding it. "To generalize just a bit," he wrote, the Florida law "prohibits all censorship of some speakers," while the Texas law "prohibits some censorship of all speakers" when based on the views they express.
The Texas law applies to social media platforms with more than 50 million active monthly users, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It does not appear to reach smaller platforms that appeal to conservatives, like Truth Social and Gettr, the law's challengers told the Supreme Court.
The law also does not cover sites that are devoted to news, sports, entertainment and other information that their users do not primarily generate. The covered sites are largely prohibited from removing posts based on the viewpoints they espouse, with exceptions for the sexual exploitation of children, incitement of criminal activity and some threats of violence.
Federal appeals courts reached conflicting conclusions about the constitutionality of the two laws.
In May, a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit largely upheld a preliminary injunction blocking Florida's law.
"Social media platforms exercise editorial judgment that is inherently expressive," Judge Kevin C. Newsom wrote for the panel. "When platforms choose to remove users or posts, deprioritize content in viewers' feeds or search results, or sanction breaches of their community standards, they engage in First Amendment-protected activity."
In September, however, a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed a lower court's order blocking the Texas law.
"We reject the platforms' attempt to extract a freewheeling censorship right from the Constitution's free speech guarantee," Judge Oldham wrote for the majority. "The platforms are not newspapers. Their censorship is not speech."
The Supreme Court has already had an encounter with the Texas law, temporarily blocking it in May while an appeal moved forward. The vote was 5 to 4, with an unusual coalition in dissent.
The court's three most conservative members -- Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch -- filed a dissenting opinion saying that they would have left the law in place and that the issues were so novel and significant that the Supreme Court would have to consider them at some point.
"Social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate with each other and obtain news," Justice Alito wrote in the dissent. "At issue is a groundbreaking Texas law that addresses the power of dominant social media corporations to shape public discussion of the important issues of the day."
Justice Alito added that he was skeptical of the argument that the social media companies have editorial discretion protected by the First Amendment like that enjoyed by newspapers and other traditional publishers.
"It is not at all obvious," he wrote, "how our existing precedents, which predate the age of the internet, should apply to large social media companies."
Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, also said she would have let a judge's injunction against the law stand, though she did not join the dissent and gave no reasons of her own.
The Supreme Court will hear arguments next month in a different case examining what in some ways is the flip side of the question in the ones from Florida and Texas: whether social media platforms may be sued despite a law that shields the companies from legal responsibility for what users post on their sites. The case, brought by the family of a woman killed in a terrorist attack, argues that YouTube's algorithm recommended videos inciting violence.
That case, Gonzalez v. Google, No. 21-1333, concerns Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that helped enable the rise of social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
The court's request for the administration's views in the two new cases -- Moody v. NetChoice, No. 22-277, and NetChoice v. Paxton, No. 22-555 -- probably means that it will rule on the case concerning the 1996 law before it decides whether to hear the new cases.

Layoffs at Tech Giants Reverse Small Part of Pandemic Hiring Spree

For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn’t hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has — and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft — have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. They pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.
AMAZON
1.54 million employees – 18,000 layoffs = 1.2% of workforce “As part of our annual planning process for 2023, leaders across the company have been working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we’ve hired rapidly over the last several years.”

“At the start of COVID, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”

Which Came First, Inflation or the Egg Meme?

The chicken is crossing the road, and she is doing so glamorously, toting a Louis Vuitton bag, rocking a Derby-style bowler hat and avoiding the paparazzi in sunglasses. In the eyes of frustrated grocery shoppers equipped with Photoshop and social media accounts, chickens have become the misers of a valuable asset, eggs.
Across Facebook and Instagram and Reddit and Twitter and TikTok, consumers fed up with soaring egg prices are coping the modern way: They’re making memes.
Some posts compare cartons of eggs to stacks of gold and cold, hard cash. On TikTok, there are more than 14.2 million videos listed under #eggshortage. Among them, there’s a recurring joke: A person, often wearing a fur coat, weighs, inspects and doles out eggs like a drug dealer. Rick Ross’ “Hustlin’” is the soundtrack to really drive home the gag.
But the videos going viral aren’t always staged. One TikTok filmed at a Costco shows a line of people snaking through the store to buy eggs. It’s a scene familiar to those who remember the toilet paper shortage early in the pandemic.
Don Caldwell, the general manager and editor-in-chief of the internet archive site Know Your Meme, traces the origin of several egg price jokes circulating online to a tweet posted on Dec. 23 that suggested chickens had unionized. It quickly inspired jokes about chickens “staging some chicken revolution,” he said.
“We’ve seen similar memes around inflationary market pressures,” Caldwell said, noting the deluge of internet humor in response to the spike in gas prices last spring.
There are several explanations for rising egg prices. A highly contagious bird flu has been going around for almost a year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that at least 57 million chickens have been affected, making it the deadliest bout of avian influenza to date. Another, potentially more impactful factor is inflation. Costs are rising for many components of consumer egg production including fuel, chicken feed, packaging and labor. Other food prices are increasing, too, but the average cost of eggs has nearly doubled.
Eggs are, as New York Times columnist and egg enthusiast Eric Kim elegantly put it, “a blank canvas for flavor and sustenance, in both form and content.”
As “eggs are this cornerstone of so many other foods,” it’s no wonder egg memes are something that not only “chronically online” people are participating in, said Amanda Brennan, the senior director of trends at XX Artists. “When it hits the local suburban Facebook groups, that’s when you know it’s serious.”
Online searches for “egg substitutes” are up by 16,000 compared with last year. Home cooks and influencers are seizing on the opportunity to share recipes for eggless breakfasts and cupcakes. (Next, the eggless omelet?)
This isn’t the first time eggs have been spotlighted on social media. In 2019, the @world_record_egg became a beloved Instagram stunt as the account attempted to make a stock photo of an egg the most-liked picture on the platform. (It was successful, beating out Kylie Jenner’s baby announcement, until it was bested by a Leo Messi post after Argentina won the World Cup last month.)
It’s unclear when, or if, consumers can expect prices to fall. In the meantime, there’s not much to do but post through it.
“When people meme things, they’re not necessarily saying they’re not serious or important,” Caldwell said. “It’s a very social game to play online, to be more connected to people about an issue. It makes people feel less alone.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

List of Mass Shootings Keeps Growing, With 33 So Far This Year: [National Desk]

Full text: The shooting in Monterey Park, Calif., is the deadliest in the United States since the Uvalde massacre last year.
The mass shooting that left at least 10 people dead in Monterey Park, Calif., on Saturday night is the deadliest in the United States since the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, last May, when 19 children and two teachers were killed.
Saturday's shooting is also the second major attack in less than a week in California. Last Monday, gunmen killed six people in Tulare County, Calif., including a 16-year-old and her 10-month-old child, in a shooting that the police said was probably gang-related.
There is no consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of government, nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group, defines a mass shooting as involving at least four people killed or injured.
By that measure, there have been 33 mass shootings so far in 2023, according to the group. It counted 648 mass shootings last year, 21 of which involved five or more fatalities.
Here is a partial list of recent mass shootings in the United States:
Nov. 22: Chesapeake, Va.
A Walmart employee opened fire in a break room as the store was preparing to close for the night, killing six people, the authorities said. The gunman was found dead, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the police.
Nov. 20: Colorado Springs
Five people were killed and 17 wounded by gunfire in a shooting at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub. The gunman was hurt and taken to a hospital.
Nov. 13: Charlottesville, Va.
Three University of Virginia students, all members of the football team, were killed and two were wounded when a gunman, a former player, opened fire in a garage after a field trip to see a play in Washington.
Oct. 13: Raleigh, N.C.
A gunman, described by the authorities only as a "white male juvenile," killed five people, including an off-duty police officer, and wounded two others. The attacks drew a large response from law enforcement agencies to the residential area near the Neuse River Greenway, a popular bike trail for Raleigh residents.
Sept. 7: Memphis, Tenn.
Memphis was effectively closed down during an hourslong manhunt for a 19-year-old gunman who killed four people while streaming some of the violence on Facebook Live. The violence involved several shootings and carjackings over the course of the day.
July 4: Highland Park, Ill.
Seven people were killed and dozens more wounded when a gunman opened fire from the roof of a building in Highland Park, a suburb north of Chicago, during a Fourth of July parade. A 21-year-old was taken into custody several hours later.

Too Soon to Talk Kids?: [Style Desk]

Full text: A reader eager to have a child before she turns 40 doesn't know what to make of a new love interest's silence when conversation turns to the future.
I am a single woman in my late 30s. I am also a neurosurgeon, and my medical training ate up 15 years of my life. I don't regret it. I love my work, but it often meant sacrificing my personal life. The problem: I want to have children, and I am getting a late start. Ten weeks ago, I met an incredible guy online. Our interests overlap, we get along famously and he wants kids, too. But when I talk about the future -- about moving in together or how our relationship is progressing -- he pulls back. I don't have time to waste if I want a kid by the time I'm 40. Is his reticence a red flag?
SARA
I sympathize with your fear that time is running out. But the only red flag I see is that you are rushing your new boyfriend because you want a baby in short order. You've been dating for only 10 weeks! Your boyfriend probably isn't yet sure about your future together. Are you? Is this man your life partner or simply the guy standing in front of you at this moment?
Try to uncouple your worries about fertility from your concerns about the relationship. I will not be the jerk who mansplains the pressure on women to get pregnant. Still, I urge you to see a specialist to assess your current fertility and your options for pregnancy in the future. If it's affordable and viable, consider freezing some eggs now to give yourself some breathing room.
You are wrestling with major decisions: partnership and parenthood. I would hate to see you make a mistake -- marry the wrong guy or scare off the right one -- by rushing. If your boyfriend stays reticent over the coming months, we can talk about red flags then. And remember: There are many ways to create a loving family, including through adoption or by becoming a foster parent.
A Brother Sexts, a Sister Frets
My brother and I went home to celebrate our mother's birthday. While we were there, I saw by accident that my brother was sexting with a woman who is not his fiancée. (She didn't make the trip.) I am so upset. Should I warn his fiancée about his disgusting behavior?
SISTER
Let's put aside questions about the "accident" that caused you to spy on your brother's phone and read a text chain closely enough to determine both its subject and the identity of the other party.
To the extent this is any of your business, which I question, why wouldn't you start by talking to your brother? We don't know the circumstances of this conversation, what came of it or whether your brother has an agreement with his fiancée about online flirting. Unless your aim is to break up his engagement, it's hard to imagine why his fiancée would be your first stop.
It's Not the Flight That Makes a First Hello Special
My husband's father is dying and has only a few weeks to live. We have a newborn, and my husband wants the three of us to fly from New York, where we live, to Paris, where his father lives, so his dad can meet the baby before he passes. We're told that his father is mostly out of it now. I am terrified to fly with our newborn with the current rates of Covid infection, flu and R.S.V. Plus, flying for eight hours with a baby while pumping breast milk feels like too much to me! What should I do?
WIFE
Trust your instincts. Be gentle with your husband, though, when you make your case. Both of you are probably overwhelmed with the new baby, and your husband will soon be grieving a deep loss. I'm sorry that so much is happening at once.
Your husband's impulse to let his dying father hold his grandchild is a loving one, but it's not practical now. Encourage him to make the trip alone. Explain -- with your doctor, if necessary -- that your newborn's immune system is too vulnerable to illness to make long flights sensible. A video introduction to the baby will be fine, but your husband may need your help to see that.
Just Be Glad I'm Not Asking for Interest
Last summer, I bought four tickets to a concert for three friends and me. They each agreed to pay $ 400 before I bought the tickets. We had a great time! Two of my friends repaid me at the concert; one didn't. I reminded her a few weeks later by text. She apologized profusely and promised to pay me right away. Well, now it's four months later, and she still hasn't paid. I want to send another reminder, but I'm afraid to. What if she still doesn't pay me back?
FRIEND
Either your friend is going to pay you, or she is not. It's true, I suppose, that delaying your (second) request lets you avoid the certainty of her being a deadbeat. Still, she has strung you along for months already, and here you are fretting pre-emptively about her next move. Not stellar friend behavior!
Ask her for the money directly. The sooner she acts, the sooner you can start processing your feelings about it. This is not a problem that improves with time.
For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.

Full text: Charles Mudede was at the Post Pike Bar in Seattle in November, nursing a glass of white wine and having a heated discussion about a topic he felt strongly about: the state of new development in the city.
Last year, residential construction in Seattle hit a record high with over 13,000 units built, according to data from Seattle in Progress, an organization that tracks construction. Mr. Mudede, 53, who has lived in the city for 30 years, was expressing his distaste for some of those "architectural abominations."
"What's that new building?" he asked the bartender. "It's an apartment building, but they put some bright blue, splashy thing on its facade."
"The Motorworks building?" the bartender responded, referring to the luxury apartments a few blocks from the bar.
"No, no."
"It's the one with the juice bar on the bottom floor, right?" another person sitting at the bar asked.
"No, not that one."
The guessing game went on for a few more minutes, with other patrons chiming in, until Mr. Mudede, a filmmaker and lecturer at the Cornish College of the Arts, sighed and said, "Nobody can tell because they all look the same."
In 2022, an estimated 420,000 new rental apartments were built in the United States, the highest amount for new multifamily construction in a half-century, according to the latest data from RentCafe, an apartment search platform.
The new developments look startlingly alike, often in the form of boxy, mid-rise buildings with a ground-floor retail space, sans-serif fonts and vivid slabs of bright paneling. The bulky design is conspicuous, jutting out of downtown streets and overpowering its surroundings. Over time, it attracts a certain ecosystem -- the craft breweries, the boutique coffee shops, the out-of-town young professionals.
It's anytown architecture, and it's hard to know where you are from one city to the next.
This is not the first time that a single building style has been widely adopted and derided. Take, for example, the monotony of American suburbs, or trailer parks, which took off in the 20th century as low-income housing but were criticized for their cookie-cutter nature.
Yet advocates for multifamily housing say there are times when design has to take a back seat to necessity, and an affordability crisis, exacerbated by inflation and brutally low housing inventory, is one of those times. The current construction has been "driven by pent-up demand for apartments nationwide, especially as some renters postpone their dream to become homeowners," according to the RentCafe report.
As developers scramble to build, The New York Times visited three places -- Denver, Nashville and Seattle -- in search of the sameness and what it means. Are American cities destined to lose their unique charm? In the current housing crisis, does that matter?
Municipal reviews and cheap materials
In Seattle, most new private development projects must undergo a design review process. The city has eight design review boards, each for a different geographic district, and all are made up of volunteers. The boards are tasked with determining if a proposed project fits city and neighborhood design guidelines, which cover aspects such as outward appearance, vehicular access and landscaping.
The waterfront Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, once a hub for Nordic immigrants, is now a trendy destination with record shops, bars and restaurants. Complexes with roughly five wood-frame stories atop one concrete podium -- known as 5-over-1s -- dominate consecutive blocks.
The design guidelines, adopted by the City Council in 2001 and last revised in 2019, encourage "bold colors and volumes similar to those expressed in the Ballard Library and Greenfire buildings," which house apartments, office space and a restaurant. It's a process that has drawn criticism -- and one that is partially responsible for the homogenization of architecture across a city once known for its Northwest Regional style of architecture defined by unpainted wood, flat roofs and lots of glass.
"The design review process sometimes contributes to some of the things that people don't like," said Newton Breiter, creative director of Lake Union Partners, a real estate development company based in Seattle that has worked on many 5-over-1s.
The review board members "want to see that a project isn't just one big mass, so they say, 'I want you to modulate the building, I want you to make it look different,"' Mr. Breiter said. "So you end up with all these different materials, and it drives the addition of bright colors."
Architects are also often working under budgetary constraints and density requests from developers, who don't want to lose money on their investments. And wood-frame construction, which makes up the bulk of these buildings, is typically less expensive than, say, concrete or steel.
Higher construction costs would require higher rents "in order to make the project financially feasible for an investor and a bank," Mr. Breiter said.
Davi Parker-Garcia, a principal at the Seattle-based architecture firm Weinstein A+U, said there was also "pressure to squeeze as many units as you can." Almost a decade ago, the typical one-bedroom unit that the firm would work on was around 730 square feet. Now the expectation is that it should be in the 600s, she said.
Rather than change the type of building, she said her focus was pushing the boundaries of what could be done within the template, like making the windows bigger. "We are often forced to work with bottom-of-the-barrel materials," Ms. Parker-Garcia said.
'Lego structures'
Colloquially, people have referred to 5-over-1s as "gentrification buildings" or "fast-casual architecture." Not all of them are built the same, however. Some are permanent affordable housing communities, while others hawk luxury urban living. Still, for many people, 5-over-1s have come to symbolize, in tangible form, the most painful aspects of today's housing crisis -- stand-ins for gentrification, corporate landlords and excessively high rents.
That's in part why they're so hated, and why it's acceptable to hate them.
"I think they're terrible," said Zereseni Selemun, 50, a Lyft driver, as he was passing through the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. "It's very ugly. Very ugly. I hate it!"
In 2015, Brad Evans, an artist, created the private Facebook group "Denver FUGLY" to express his frustration over the city's new uninspired development.
The group now has nearly 10,000 members and does not mince words: "Let's get after it at the core of what needs to be exposed and work to stop the stupid, the lazy and the pathetic execution of bad ideas," the page summary reads.
"The people behind these Lego structures don't care, they've never been here, nor will they come here," Mr. Evans, 56, said in an interview.
Driving around the Jefferson Park neighborhood of Denver, Mr. Evans pointed out the missed opportunities for public green space and the random fake-brick facades tacked onto buildings.
One block of Jefferson Park that was designated as a historic district in 2019 remains almost pristinely preserved. Lined with ornate Queen Anne-style and terraced homes, the street feels like a step back in time. That is, until one reaches the end of the block.
Part of the issue, critics say, is that a handful of real estate developers are now managing a disproportionate share of new projects across the country.
In 2021, five of the 25 largest developers were responsible for starting construction on nearly 47,000 units in the United States -- about 40 percent of the output of the whole group, according to data from the National Multifamily Housing Council.
Greystar Real Estate Partners -- which started over 14,000 of those units, the greatest share on the list -- more than quadrupled its output from 2014. The company, which manages over 700,000 units in the country, is based in Charleston, S.C., but owns developments in New York City, Houston and Tampa, among other cities.
Bob Faith, the chief executive of Greystar, echoing the sentiments of other developers, said that for the most part, the style of its buildings was "driven by the planning regulations in any city."
"I don't want to say it's like color-by-numbers, but, in some cities, it's color-by-numbers," Mr. Faith said. He said Greystar made an effort to differentiate its projects by adding "flash" to exteriors with different materials or shapes.
Perhaps what bothers some Denver residents the most is what the new architecture signals: In 2005, more than 80 percent of Jefferson Park residents were Latino and more than 50 percent were foreign-born, according to a city report at the time. In recent years, Denver's growing technology and cannabis industries have drawn many coastal transplants to the region, changing the demographics, and style, of the neighborhood.
"They're like Denny's," Mr. Evans said of the new buildings. "You could be at a Denny's in Iowa or New Mexico or Colorado, and you wouldn't know. You just know that you're at a Denny's."
A cycle of uniformity
Will we one day look back on the current architecture and feel nostalgia for design once mocked? History suggests yes.
Dingbat apartments -- two- to three-story buildings, often painted in pastel colors and emblazoned with catchy names in script fonts, with a ground-level open parking area -- became pervasive throughout the Sun Belt region in the 1950s and '60s, for reasons similar to today's.
"They were initially really maligned as the crystallization of pure real estate rationale with architecture that was just tacked on," said Liz Falletta, an architect and professor of planning and urban design at the University of Southern California. "But we built enough of them so that you could rent them for an affordable price. And now, they're being celebrated for their midcentury modern design, and there's a lot of nostalgia for them."
Brownstones, which now sell for millions in New York City, were also hated in their heyday.
"While they would later be viewed as authentic, contemporaries dismissed brownstones as modern and artificial," wrote Suleiman Osman, a professor of American studies at George Washington University, in his book "The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn."
"When one has seen one house, he has seen them all," one critic, quoted in Mr. Osman's book, wrote about brownstones in the 1800s.
As with brownstones and dingbats, distaste can dissolve with time.
"A lot of people's lives will have been lived in them, 20, 30, 40 years from now. In their role as housing and much-needed housing, people might look back on them more positively," Ms. Falletta said of today's buildings. "They may not be valorized as good design, but people's attitudes will change."
At the end of 2020, the nation was short 3.8 million units of housing, according to Freddie Mac. Multifamily buildings, despite their aesthetic shortcomings, can close that gap far quicker and cheaper than, say, brownstones or bungalows.
Critics agree that more housing is positive, but they also feel that the current construction misses an opportunity.
"Getting housing built is more important than nit-picking over aesthetics," said Kate Wagner, an architecture critic and the creator of the "McMansion Hell" blog, "but there is definitely room within the housing to improve aesthetics."
Mr. Mudede, the Seattle resident, said he wasn't against construction. "But cities should be inspiring," he said. "Living in them can and should feel like a work of art, and that's what's sad for me."
'I feel secure, I feel safe'
At one time, the 12 South neighborhood of Nashville was home to a number of Black churches, modest spaces that were integral to the culture of the neighborhood. But as new development increased and prices rose over the past few years, church members were forced to move out of the area. Many of those churches saw no choice but to leave as well.
"The people we used to serve were uprooted from the neighborhood," said Calvin C. Barlow Jr., a bishop at Second Missionary Baptist Church. In 2021, the church sold its properties, including a garden and a parking lot, to a developer for $ 3.5 million and moved to a new location on the outskirts of the city.
In the neighborhood today, one can find stylish restaurants and boutiques -- including Draper James, the clothing shop founded by the actress Reese Witherspoon -- and those contemporary apartment buildings that many people loathe.
"The city loses when people are pushed out. It loses knowledge, it loses ideas, it loses vision," Bishop Barlow, 72, said. His church used to run a computer lab to teach children technology skills after school. "Those kids don't have that after-school care now," he said.
In north Nashville, some new development serves a different purpose.
In the ZIP code of 37208 -- which has the highest incarceration rate in the country and a high poverty rate, attributed to systemic racism -- there is a new mid-rise apartment development with nearly 150 units. The buildings, which opened to residents in 2017, have green and orange detailing, and one even has a Chase Bank on the ground floor. It's what many people might call a "gentrification building" -- but it's far from that.
The mixed-use complex is run by the nonprofit Urban Housing Solutions. That it looks like new development in wealthier neighborhoods is intentional, said Alan Mazer, the organization's general counsel. "Why should affordable housing look any different from other housing?" he asked.
One of the struggles of getting housing built for households with lower incomes, Mr. Mazer said, is the approval process.
"A building has to have a certain amount of visual appeal in order for us to get into certain neighborhoods," he said. To obtain a building permit, he added, "you have to convince your neighbors that you're not going to bring down the neighborhood."
The easiest route to appeasing those concerns is giving people what they're accustomed to. Today, that often means boxy, mid-rise buildings.
Nearly three years ago, Rosalie Holder, 71, moved into the Urban Housing Solutions development from an adjacent neighborhood, after several close encounters with street violence compelled her to search for a new home.
Ms. Holder was grateful for paying $ 240 a month, far below market rate. She said her neighbors were friendly and the area felt peaceful. The aesthetics of the building were the last thing on her mind, if they were on it at all.
"Here, I feel secure, I feel safe. I don't hear gunshots. I can walk to the store," Ms. Holder said. "I didn't think I could find a place like this."

Charles Mudede was at the Post Pike Bar in Seattle in November, nursing a glass of white wine and having a heated discussion about a topic he felt strongly about: the state of new development in the city.
Last year, residential construction in Seattle hit a record high, with over 13,000 units built, according to data from Seattle in Progress, an organization that tracks construction. Mudede, 53, who has lived in the city for 30 years, was expressing his distaste for some of those “architectural abominations.”
“What’s that new building?” he asked the bartender. “It’s an apartment building, but they put some bright blue, splashy thing on its facade.”
“The Motorworks building?” the bartender responded, referring to the luxury apartments a few blocks from the bar.
“No, no.”
“It’s the one with the juice bar on the bottom floor, right?” another person sitting at the bar asked.
“No, not that one.”
The guessing game went on for a few more minutes, with other patrons chiming in, until Mudede, a filmmaker and lecturer at the Cornish College of the Arts, sighed and said, “Nobody can tell because they all look the same.”
In 2022, an estimated 420,000 new rental apartments were built in the United States, the highest amount for new multifamily construction in a half-century, according to the latest data from RentCafe, an apartment search platform.
The new developments look startlingly alike, often in the form of boxy, midrise buildings with ground-floor retail space, sans-serif fonts and vivid slabs of bright paneling. The bulky design is conspicuous, jutting out of downtown streets and overpowering its surroundings. Over time, it attracts a certain ecosystem: craft breweries, boutique coffee shops, out-of-town young professionals.
It’s anytown architecture, and it’s hard to know where you are from one city to the next.
This is not the first time that a single building style has been widely adopted and derided. Take the monotony of American suburbs, or trailer parks, which took off in the 20th century as low-income housing but were criticized for their cookie-cutter nature.
Yet advocates for multifamily housing say that there are times when design has to take a back seat to necessity, and that an affordability crisis, exacerbated by inflation and brutally low housing inventory, is one of those times. The current construction has been “driven by pent-up demand for apartments nationwide, especially as some renters postpone their dream to become homeowners,” according to the RentCafe report.
As developers scramble to build, The New York Times visited three places — Denver, Seattle and Nashville, Tennessee — in search of sameness and what it means. Are American cities destined to lose their unique charm? In the current housing crisis, does that matter?
Municipal reviews and cheap materials
In Seattle, most new private development projects must undergo a design review process. The city has eight design review boards, each for a different geographic district, and all are made up of volunteers. The boards are tasked with determining if a proposed project fits city and neighborhood design guidelines, which cover aspects such as outward appearance, vehicular access and landscaping.
The waterfront Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, once a hub for Nordic immigrants, is now a trendy destination with record shops, bars and restaurants. Complexes with roughly five wood-frame stories atop one concrete podium — known as 5-over-1s — dominate consecutive blocks.
The design guidelines, adopted by the City Council in 2001 and last revised in 2019, encourage “bold colors and volumes similar to those expressed in the Ballard Library and Greenfire buildings,” which house apartments, office space and a restaurant. It’s a process that has drawn criticism — and one that is partially responsible for the homogenization of architecture across a city once known for its Northwest Regional style of architecture, defined by unpainted wood, flat roofs and lots of glass.
“The design review process sometimes contributes to some of the things that people don’t like,” said Newton Breiter, creative director of Lake Union Partners, a real estate development company based in Seattle that has worked on many 5-over-1s.
The review board members “want to see that a project isn’t just one big mass, so they say, ‘I want you to modulate the building. I want you to make it look different,’” Breiter said. “So you end up with all these different materials, and it drives the addition of bright colors.”
Architects are also often working under budgetary constraints and density requests from developers, who don’t want to lose money on their investments. And wood-frame construction, which makes up the bulk of these buildings, is typically less expensive than concrete or steel.
Higher construction costs would require higher rents “in order to make the project financially feasible for an investor and a bank,” Breiter said.
Davi Parker-Garcia, a principal at Seattle-based architecture firm Weinstein A+U, said there is “pressure to squeeze as many units as you can.” Almost a decade ago, the typical one-bedroom unit that the firm would work on was around 730 square feet. Now the expectation is that it should be in the 600s, she said.
Rather than change the type of building, she said her focus is pushing the boundaries of what can be done within the template, like making the windows bigger.
“We are often forced to work with bottom-of-the-barrel materials,” Parker-Garcia said.
‘Lego structures’
Colloquially, people have referred to 5-over-1s as “gentrification buildings” or “fast-casual architecture.” Not all of them are built the same, however. Some are permanent affordable-housing communities, while others hawk luxury urban living. Still, for many people, 5-over-1s have come to symbolize, in tangible form, the most painful aspects of today’s housing crisis: They are stand-ins for gentrification, corporate landlords and excessively high rents.
That’s in part why they’re so hated.
“I think they’re terrible,” Zereseni Selemun, 50, a Lyft driver, said as he was passing through the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. “It’s very ugly. Very ugly. I hate it!”
In 2015, artist Brad Evans created the private Facebook group “Denver FUGLY” to express his frustration over the city’s new uninspired development.
The group now has nearly 10,000 members and does not mince words: “Let’s get after it at the core of what needs to be exposed and work to stop the stupid, the lazy and the pathetic execution of bad ideas,” the page summary reads.
“The people behind these Lego structures don’t care. They’ve never been here, nor will they come here,” Evans, 56, said in an interview.
Driving around the Jefferson Park neighborhood of Denver, Evans pointed out the missed opportunities for public green space and the random fake-brick facades tacked on to buildings.
One block of Jefferson Park that was designated as a historic district in 2019 remains almost pristinely preserved. Lined with ornate Queen Anne-style and terraced homes, the street feels like a step back in time. That is, until one reaches the end of the block.
Part of the issue, critics say, is that a handful of real estate developers manages a disproportionate share of new projects across the country.
In 2021, five of the 25 largest developers were responsible for starting construction on nearly 47,000 units in the United States — about 40% of the output of the whole group, according to data from the National Multifamily Housing Council.
Greystar Real Estate Partners — which started over 14,000 of those units, the greatest share on the list — more than quadrupled its output from 2014. The company, which manages over 700,000 units in the country, is based in Charleston, South Carolina, but owns developments in New York City; Houston; and Tampa, Florida, among other cities.
Bob Faith, CEO of Greystar, echoing the sentiments of other developers, said that for the most part the style of its buildings is “driven by the planning regulations in any city.”
“I don’t want to say it’s like color-by-numbers, but in some cities, it’s color-by-numbers,” Faith said. He said Greystar makes an effort to differentiate its projects by adding “flash” to exteriors with different materials or shapes.
Perhaps what bothers some Denver residents the most is what the new architecture signals: In 2005, more than 80% of Jefferson Park residents were Latino, and more than 50% were foreign-born, according to a city report at the time. In recent years, Denver’s growing technology and cannabis industries have drawn many coastal transplants to the region, changing the demographics, and style, of the neighborhood.
“They’re like Denny’s,” Evans said of the new buildings. “You could be at a Denny’s in Iowa or New Mexico or Colorado, and you wouldn’t know. You just know that you’re at a Denny’s.”
Dingbats and brownstones once maligned
Will we one day look back on the current architecture and feel nostalgia for design once mocked? History suggests yes.
Dingbat apartments — two- to three-story buildings, often painted in pastel colors and emblazoned with catchy names in script fonts, with a ground-level open parking area — became pervasive throughout the Sun Belt in the 1950s and ’60s, for reasons similar to today’s.
“They were initially really maligned as the crystallization of pure real estate rationale with architecture that was just tacked on,” said Liz Falletta, an architect and professor of planning and urban design at the University of Southern California. “But we built enough of them so that you could rent them for an affordable price.

For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn’t hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has — and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft — have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. They pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.
AMAZON
1.54 million employees – 18,000 layoffs = 1.2% of workforce “As part of our annual planning process for 2023, leaders across the company have been working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we’ve hired rapidly over the last several years.”
— Andy Jassy, CEO,
Jan. 4
ALPHABET
186,779 employees – 12,000 layoffs = 6.4% of workforce
“I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.”
— Sundar Pichai, CEO,
Jan. 20
META
87,314 employees – 11,000 layoffs = 12.6% of workforce
“At the start of COVID, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”
— Mark Zuckerberg, CEO,
Nov. 9
MICROSOFT
221,000 employees – 10,000 layoffs = 4.5% of workforce
“We’re living through times of significant change, and as I meet with customers and partners, a few things are clear. First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less.”
— Satya Nadella, CEO,

Full text: A video showing dozens of vehicles moving in on a pair of big cats in a Kenyan game reserve highlights how "aggressive tourism" can put endangered animals at even greater risk.
The video surfaced online around October. Filmed from a distance, it shows an antelope grazing on the African plain. Suddenly, two cheetahs race toward it and the antelope takes off, running toward the camera. But the cats are too fast. They converge on it and bring it down. They begin to feed.
Almost at that exact moment, a second drama unfolds: The safari vehicles that have been parked in the background begin to move. One dark-colored 4x4 hits the gas and begins driving closer to the animals. Then vehicle after vehicle is on the move -- green, brown, white, in various states of repair. You can hear the voices of the guides within yelling at one another. Some start to honk their horns. The vehicles form a circle, jockeying for position as their passengers hold up cellphones to record the cheetahs and their meal.
A woman's voice can be heard in the background. "Are they stupid?" she asks.
The video was filmed in the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, home to many of the Big Five animals (lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo and rhinoceroses) that safari participants tick off their lists. The identity of the video's creator remains unknown, as does the date it was shot.
It was originally shared by a Twitter account using the name @DrumChronicles and has been viewed more than 175,000 times since it appeared. Guides and conservationists who have seen it said the video underscored a problem many of them have observed since the Kenyan government began lifting most pandemic-related travel restrictions: safari vehicles packed with cellphone-wielding tourists led by guides who are willing to get too close to the animals.
Overcrowding at popular safari spots was a serious issue before the pandemic, but as tourists have returned to Kenya, the problem has come back with alarming speed and "appears to be heightened by pent-up travel demand," said Judy Kepher-Gona, director of the Sustainable Travel and Tourism Agenda, an organization based in Kenya that has called for stricter monitoring in the reserve.
"Sadly, what is seen in this video is the rule and not the exception in Masai Mara reserve," she said.
In February, a Toyota Land Cruiser carrying tourists got so close to a family of cheetahs, the vehicle nearly ran over one of the cubs.
In August, Simon Espley, the chief executive of Africa Geographic, a travel and conservation company, watched in horror as 60 vehicles idled on both sides of the Mara River, which runs through the reserve, mere feet from where hundreds of wildebeests and zebras were slowly amassing at a crossing point during their migration in the Masai Mara.
When the hooves hit the water, there was a "crazy, chaotic rush as hundreds of tons of steel lunged forward with screaming engines" from the 4x4s that maneuvered to get closer to the herds, Mr. Espley said.
"It was surreal and sickening as we all converged on what is only a few hundred meters of riverbank, jostled for position and somehow avoided collisions," he said.
Mr. Espley, whose company had organized the safari trip for a group of photographers, said he felt "regret and unease" about being part of that crowd. "Everyone in our safari vehicle did," he said. The travelers asked their guide, a local Masai, to drive them away immediately.
"He was happy to oblige," Mr. Espley said.
The problem, which conservationists describe as "aggressive tourism," preceded the pandemic, but it appears to have gotten worse, with guests hungry for Instagram moments and tour companies trying to make up for the losses they suffered when the world shut down.
"Personally I won't go into the Mara Reserve ever again in season because of this," said Michael Lorentz, a safari guide based in Cape Town who leads tours in Kenya. "It actually upsets me so much, and it upsets my guests to see how badly animals are being treated."
An urge to get too close
The human desire to get close to animals, however dangerous, is innate, said Prof. Philip Tedeschi, the founder of the Institute for Human-Animal Connection at the University of Denver, who frequently visits Kenya with his students.
"It's part of our DNA to pay special attention to living systems," he said.
Last summer, a small boat in Plymouth, Mass., came so close to a humpback that it almost capsized when the whale leapt out of the water and landed on its bow.
In May, a 25-year-old woman who approached a bison in Yellowstone National Park was gored and tossed 10 feet into the air. She survived, park officials said in a statement that warned visitors to stay at least 25 yards from the animals.
The behavior may be misguided and dangerous, Mr. Tedeschi said, but it is also an attempt to have a "peak experience," a term coined by the psychologist Abraham Maslow that describes a euphoric state of mind that comes from witnessing or participating in a moment so intense it changes the neurochemistry of the brain.
And it can lead us to put a premium on being far too close to animals -- "literally being able to look over the shoulder of the animal as it kills its prey" -- while forgetting that animals are sentient beings whose behavior is altered by our presence, he said.
The consequences for animals can be devastating, Mr. Tedeschi said.
In Kenya, cheetahs -- the fastest of the big cats, but also among the most timid -- can easily be scared off a hard-won kill even if they have gone days without eating. Vehicles that get too close can reveal a cheetah's position to prey or other predators, adding another challenge for animals that are already struggling to find food because of drought and habitat loss.
Large numbers of vehicles and tourists in the roughly 580-square-mile Masai Mara are also threatening the annual journey of mammals known as the Great Migration, when more than one million wildebeests, along with zebras and gazelles, move through the reserve in July and August, the peak travel months for Kenya.
The Great Migration was already being threatened by other types of human behavior, including urban development, new settlements and fencing for farms.
Tourists clamoring for front-row seats are adding pressure on the animals, who could respond by traveling in smaller numbers or deviating from their established routes to avoid the crush of vehicles and tourists, said Benson Gitau, a Kenyan guide.
Searching for a better way
Tourism is critical to many African economies. By 2030, travel to the continent is projected to generate more than $ 260 billion annually. In Kenya, before the pandemic, tourism accounted for nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife.
In 2019, more than two million people visited Kenya, a number that was expected to grow by more than 7 percent in 2020, the tourism ministry said. But then the pandemic hit, forcing hotels and restaurants to close and more than 80 percent of companies in the country's tourism sector to lay off workers. And those who did not lose their jobs often had to cope with pay cuts of up to 70 percent, the ministry said.
During the height of the pandemic, many guides lost their jobs and had to use their vehicles as taxis or to deliver groceries, said Mr. Gitau, the Kenyan guide, who works in the Loisaba Conservancy, a 57,000-acre wildlife reserve north of Nairobi.
Visitors have returned steadily, though in smaller numbers. By the spring of 2022, international tourist arrivals in Africa had more than doubled compared with 2021. In October, Najib Balala, then Kenya's tourism secretary, projected 1.4 million to 1.5 million visitors to the country by the end of 2022, compared with 870,000 in 2021.
But as the country welcomed back visitors, leaders began rethinking how to manage tourism in its reserves and parks.
In May, Mr. Balala's office released a 130-page report that called for a "new tourism strategy." Among its proposals: increasing prices for the Masai Mara in July and August (it currently costs up to $ 80 for nonresident adults to visit the park) and restricting development of new lodging in the country's national parks to 30 beds.
There are dozens of camps and lodges in the reserve and the protected areas that neighbor it, according to Masai Mara Travel, a tour company in Kenya. Some camps and lodges in the reserve have up to 200 beds, Mr. Gitau said.
But conservationists and guides on the ground say few, if any, of the measures proposed by the ministry have been enacted.
The Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, which came under new leadership in October, did not respond to repeated messages for comment. The Kenya Wildlife Service, a state corporation charged with managing and conserving the country's wildlife, declined to comment.
Zebra Plains, one of the tour operators whose vehicles can be seen in the video, did not respond to requests for comment. The video was posted in November on Zebra Plains' Facebook page by a user complaining about the drivers' conduct.
"Whilst our photographic guests usually have off road permits that does not excuse driving between other vehicles and the sighting," the company responded in the comments. "This will be taken up with the guides concerned."
With the Masai Mara increasingly under pressure from tourists, conservationists have been pushing for the "conservancy" model, in which private parcels of land owned by local communities, such as the Masai, are leased to tour companies. They agree to hire community members as guides, camp managers, kitchen staff and housekeepers and to follow rules that include caps on the number of lodges and camps and limits on the number of tourist vehicles. The largest camp in Loisaba Conservancy, for example, fits 20 to 30 tourists, Mr. Gitau said.
Since 2013, when the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association was established, about 350,000 acres of wilderness bordering the Masai Mara reserve have come under this type of private-public partnership.
Research shows wildlife fares better where tourism is more controlled. For example, female cheetahs in the Masai Mara reserve raised far fewer cubs than cheetahs in the conservancies, according to a 2018 report in the scientific journal Ecology and Evolution.
Staying in the conservancies instead of the Masai Mara is more expensive -- at least $ 1,200 a night versus a few hundred, said Ashish Sanghrajka, president of Big Five Tours & Expeditions, a Florida-based tour company that organizes trips in the conservancies.
The answer to limiting the number of tourists in the Masai Mara may lie in raising park prices, he said.
"It should be expensive," said Mr. Sanghrajka, who was born in Kenya. "It's supposed to be a privilege. It's not supposed to be a right."
At the same time, a healthy tourism industry is critical to conservation efforts in a region of the world with some of the most endangered species, including black rhinos. Tourism offers local communities an incentive to protect wildlife, and with few other industries offering well-paying jobs, many Kenyans depend on tourism as a lifeline out of poverty.
The goal should be to improve enforcement and monitoring in the Masai Mara reserve, not to discourage travel, Ms. Kepher-Gona said.
To that end, visitors have tremendous power, she said. They can make sure tour companies have guides licensed by the Kenya Professional Safari Guide Association and ask tour companies for their codes of ethics and if the guides keep their distance from animals to avoid disturbing them.
Mr. Gitau said that as a rule, a trained guide will come no closer than 20 to 30 meters to a hunt. "When you arrive there, you have to switch off your engine, keep quiet and enjoy the scene," he said.
Tourists can also act more responsibly by tempering their expectations, Mr. Gitau said. When he picks up guests, he said, he always asks them what they want to see. Often they say they want to see "a kill."
Mr. Gitau said he tells them he will do his best to give them a memorable experience. But he always adds this reminder: "Nature is full of surprises. Whatever happens, just know that it was meant to happen."

Internet Post Leads to Fine For U.K. Chief: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The police in Lancashire, in northwest England, levied the fine after the British prime minister posted a video on Instagram that showed him riding in a car, unbuckled.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain acknowledged on Friday that he had been fined by the police for not wearing a seatbelt after he posted an Instagram video of himself riding in a car without one.
Mr. Sunak's office said he would pay the penalty, but did not disclose the amount.
"The prime minister fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologized," Mr. Sunak's office said in a statement. "He will of course comply with the fixed penalty."
Under British law, which requires seatbelts with few exceptions, violations can result in fines of up to £500, or about $ 620.
Mr. Sunak's office acknowledged the fine after a video on his Instagram page showed him riding in a car without a seatbelt as he visited Lancashire, in northwest England. In the video, he was promoting his "leveling up" fund, a program intended to invest in local communities and create jobs.
The video drew widespread attention from those who noticed that the prime minister was not buckled up.
The Lancashire police wrote on Facebook on Friday "that a video has been circulating on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt while a passenger in a moving car in Lancashire."
"After looking into this matter," the police wrote that they had "issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of fixed penalty."
It was the second time in the last year that Mr. Sunak had been fined for having violated the law.
In April, Mr. Sunak, then the chancellor of the Exchequer, was fined by the police, along with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for having attended a lockdown party at the prime minister's residence on Downing Street that broke coronavirus laws.
The scandal involved reports of officials gathering and drinking in apparent violation of coronavirus rules. Mr. Sunak said at the time that he had paid his fine and apologized.
The latest penalty provided fresh fodder for opposition leaders to criticize Mr. Sunak, a member of the Conservative Party who took over as prime minister in October after a period of extraordinary tumult in British leadership.
"To be fair, he normally travels by private jet," Darren Jones, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, wrote on Twitter in response to the announcement that Mr. Sunak had been fined. "Maybe there wasn't a seatbelt sign in the car."
Others chided Mr. Sunak, saying his failure to wear a seatbelt was blatantly unsafe.
"Not only is failing to wear a seatbelt against the law but deeply irresponsible," Lilian Greenwood, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, wrote on Twitter. She added, "What is it with Tories and a total disregard for road safety?"
Others expressed satisfaction that the police had acted swiftly in response to the video.
"Whilst they continue to behave as though it's one rule for them and another for everyone else," Daisy Cooper, a leader of the Liberal Democrats, wrote on Twitter, "this fine is a reminder that the Conservatives eventually get their comeuppance."

Meta’s Oversight Board Calls for Overhaul of Nude Photo Standards

Content creators have long criticized Facebook and Instagram for their content moderation policies relating to photos that show partial nudity, arguing that their practices are inconsistent and often biased against women and LGBTQ people.
This week, the oversight board for Meta, the platform’s parent company, strongly recommended that it clarify its guidelines on such photos after Instagram took down two posts depicting nonbinary and transgender people with bare chests.
The posts were quickly reinstated after the couple appealed, and Meta’s oversight board overturned the original decision to remove them. It was the board’s first case directly involving gender-nonconforming users.
“The restrictions and exceptions to the rules on female nipples are extensive and confusing, particularly as they apply to transgender and nonbinary people,” Meta’s Oversight Board said in its case summary on Tuesday. “The lack of clarity inherent in this policy creates uncertainty for users and reviewers, and makes it unworkable in practice.”
The issue arose when a transgender and nonbinary couple posted photos in 2021 and 2022 of their bare chests with their nipples covered. Captions included details about a fundraiser for one member of the couple to have top surgery, a gender-affirming procedure to flatten a person’s chest. Instagram removed the photos after other users reported them, saying their depiction of breasts violated the site’s Sexual Solicitation Community Standard. The couple appealed the decision and the photos were subsequently reinstated.
The couple’s back-and-forth with Instagram underscored criticism that the platform’s guidelines for adult content are unclear. According to its community guidelines, Instagram bars nude photos but makes some exceptions for a range of content types, including mental health awareness posts, depictions of breastfeeding and other “health related situations” — parameters that Meta’s board described as “convoluted and poorly defined” in its summary.
How to decide what depictions of people’s chests should be allowed on social media platforms has long been a source of debate. Scores of artists and activists contend that there is a double standard under which posts of women’s chests are more likely to be deleted than those of men. Such is also the case for transgender and nonbinary people, advocates say.
Meta’s oversight board, a body of 22 academics, journalists and human rights advocates, is funded by Meta but operates independently of the company and makes binding decisions for it. The group recommended that the platforms further clarify the Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity Community Standard, “so that all people are treated in a manner consistent with international human rights standards, without discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.”
It also called for “a comprehensive human rights impact assessment on such a change, engaging diverse stakeholders, and create a plan to address any harms identified.”
Meta has 60 days to review the oversight board’s summary and a spokesperson for the company said they would publicly respond to each of the board’s recommendations by mid-March. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Not Too Young to Sleuth: [Review]

Full text: This thriller, about a teenage girl whose mother disappears, plays out on a computer screen.
The gimmick behind "Missing," a strenuous techno-thriller about a teen girl named June (Storm Reid) who takes to the internet to track down her mother (Nia Long), is that the directors and screenwriters, Will Merrick and Nick Johnson, frame the action on computer screens. All of June's sleuthing is cloistered to apps which she opens in increasing panic. She's a web-weaned child who barely bothered to speak to her mom even before the parent's disappearance. Initially, June celebrates having the house to herself by Googling "How to throw a rager." Her friends dutifully post her drunkenness to Instagram so that we, the viewer, can witness it.
June's mother was last seen headed to Cartagena with her boyfriend (Ken Leung), a dork so drab that even his festive vacation shirts are drained of color. By the end of the first act, June and her best friend (Megan Suri) are scouring the man's Facebook for clues to hack his email password. (Maybe they should try RedH3rring $ .)
From there, the story emboldens itself from relatable online stalking to ludicrous plot twists, both of which Reid parries with confidence. When the film momentarily feigns to look like a film, the image zooms out to reveal that the handsome cinematography is really a true crime docuseries streaming on June's laptop. (In a meta-joke, the show is a glossy re-enactment of the producers' previous film, the 2018 mystery "Searching," which shared a near-identical premise.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Missing" captures the constant distractions of the modern age. Pop-up windows continually tug at June's attention. However, the film's more engaging moments tap into the older cyber nostalgia of text-based adventure games from the 1970s, where problems are solved by typing the right command: Enter cave. Brandish sword. Write "Can I see the security camera?" into on online English-Spanish translator while on the phone with your mother's hotel. It's not exactly riveting to watch June download and install WhatsApp so that she can video call Colombia. Yet, there's some pleasure in a brains-over-brawn quest that flatters us to fancy that we might be clever enough to solve it ourselves, despite giggles that arise when Julian Scherle's score swells so portentously for June's digital breakthroughs that you'd think Conan had smote an army. Even goofier is an emotional scene that builds to June pledging this teary promise to her vanished mother: "I'll stop making fun of you for using Siri for everything."
When June's quest goes viral, the investigation -- along with her role in her own narrative -- nearly slips out of her grasp. Too much connectivity can be a cancer, Merrick and Johnson seem to say, and most of us already agree. Yet, there's an oddly emotional sequence when June breaks into her mother's dating app and, for the first time, learns to see her as a woman with her own desires. Better still is a bit part by the actor Joaquim de Almeida as Javier, a gig worker in Cartagena -- "cleaning, electricity, you know" -- who June hires to do cheap on-location reconnaissance. Javier has only a two-and-a-half star rating, but he's so good that I spent the film hoping June would take a minute to write him a glowing review.

Full text: New Zealand's outgoing prime minister won global fame with youthful charisma and a frank, compassionate leadership style that carried her through crisis.
Jacinda Ardern announced on Thursday that she would step down after five years as New Zealand's prime minister, having led the country through calm and calamity while cementing her reputation as a global progressive icon. Ms. Ardern initially shot to international fame with her youthful charisma, feminist progressive values and a compassionate leadership style she brought to the crises that defined her time in office, like the 2019 terror attack in Christchurch and the coronavirus pandemic.
She was hailed as a counterbalance to the wave of right-wing populism sweeping the United States and other countries, with the news media calling her the "anti-Trump" and "Saint Jacinda." But with her leadership emphasizing personality over policy, her popularity has waned at home in recent months, as the progressive transformation she promised on issues like housing prices, child poverty and carbon emissions failed to materialize.
Here are some highs and lows of her tenure:
Became the leader of New Zealand's center-left Labour Party in August 2017, less than two months before a national election and amid dismal polling numbers for the party. Her youth, charisma and frank political style set off a wave of "Jacindamania," elevating the Labour Party's popularity and enabling it to form a governing coalition with New Zealand First, a minor party. When she became prime minister in October of that year, she was 37 -- the world's youngest female head of government.
Announced her pregnancy in January 2018, just months after her stunning electoral upset, prompting a national conversation about working mothers and an international reckoning about the rarity of pregnant women in leadership roles. (The last leader to deliver a baby while in office before Ms. Ardern was Benazir Bhutto, then prime minister of Pakistan, in 1990.) Ms. Ardern gave birth to a daughter, Neve, in June 2018 and took six weeks of parental leave, leaving deputy prime minister Winston Peters in charge. Her partner, Clarke Gayford, left his job as a TV show host to become a stay-at-home parent.
Brought Neve to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018, making history as the first female world leader to bring an infant to that global meeting in New York.
Was celebrated globally for her response to the March 2019 terrorist attack in Christchurch, when an Australian gunman killed 51 worshipers at two mosques. She was quick to announce measures to significantly strengthen New Zealand's gun control legislation, in stark contrast to the inaction that typically follows mass shootings in the United States. She was also quick to stand with the Muslim victims and condemn the white supremacist shooter. "They are us," she said of the victims. "The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not."
Received praise for her compassionate and levelheaded response to the eruption of the White Island volcano in New Zealand's northeast in December 2019, which killed 22 people, many of them tourists.
Swiftly implemented lockdowns and border controls in response to the pandemic. The measures were so severe that even retrieving a lost cricket ball from a neighbor's yard was prohibited, but she sold the restrictions to the public with frank and unfiltered communication. She took to Facebook Live to talk to her "team of five million," a reference to the nation's population. New Zealand had one of the world's lowest death rates for the first two years of the pandemic.
Led the Labour party to a landslide victory in the October 2020 national election on the back of a wave of support for her response to the pandemic. It was the first time since New Zealand moved to its current electoral system in 1993 that any one political party won an outright majority and did not need to form a coalition.
Encountered divisive reactions to her pandemic measures when a small group of protesters occupied the area outside the nation's Parliament for more than three weeks in March and April 2022 to oppose the country's vaccine mandates. Police clashed with the protesters -- some of whom described Ms. Ardern as a dictator -- resulting in bloody and violent scenes, shocking a country known for its stability and social cohesion.
Saw both her personal popularity and that of the Labour Party sink to its lowest levels since 2017 in the second half of 2022 as the country grappled with rising costs of living and inflation in the wake of the pandemic. Doubts grew about her ability to deliver the "transformational" change she had promised on long-running issues like housing prices, child poverty and carbon emissions.

Microsoft Announces Layoffs To Cut Costs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft on Wednesday became the latest addition to a growing list of big technology companies that have announced plans to lay off employees because of overhiring during the pandemic and worries about the economy.
The company will lay off 10,000 workers, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said, as it looks to trim costs amid economic uncertainty and to refocus on priorities such as artificial intelligence.
Microsoft employed about 221,000 workers as of the end of June, and the cuts amount to less than 5 percent of its global work force.
With the cuts, Microsoft joined a string of other tech giants that have pulled back after several years of frenetic hiring to meet the pandemic-fueled surge in online services and the expansion of cloud computing. The technology industry grew more rapidly than it had in decades, rivaling the expansion of the dot-com boom in the 1990s.
Microsoft and its peers responded to surging customer demand by essentially hoarding technical staff. But the market slowed last year as workers started to return to their offices, inflation squeezed budgets and consumers sought entertainment outside their homes.
"The reality is you can adjust hiring very quickly, and that is what is going on," said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. "I don't think this is symptomatic of a bigger issue."
The industry's deceleration has been particularly hard on smaller tech firms, and companies that specialized in newer concepts like crypto have been significantly affected. But tech's giants have not been spared. Among the industry's big companies, Google's parent company, Alphabet, and Apple are the only firms yet to announce significant layoffs.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Mr. Nadella said that after rapid acceleration during the pandemic, "quite frankly we in the tech industry will also have to get efficient." He added that the industry "will have to show our own productivity gains" using its own technology.
Still, some of the tech industry's biggest companies continue to measure their profits in the tens of billions of dollars. In the quarter ending in September, Microsoft had $ 50 billion in sales that produced $ 17.6 billion in profit. It has also continued to return money to investors through quarterly dividends and a $ 60 billion share buyback program authorized by its board of directors in 2021.
The company's annual revenue grew 58 percent over three years, during which time it hired more than 75,000 people. But rising interest rates and the prospect of a recession have tempered Microsoft's outlook. In the latest quarter, it reported its slowest growth in five years and warned that more tepid results could follow.
Microsoft's stock price closed down nearly 2 percent on Wednesday and is down about 22 percent in the past year, which is better than many of its tech peers. The company is scheduled to report its next quarterly earnings on Tuesday.
Microsoft is going forward with several expensive bets, including potentially putting another $ 10 billion into its investment in OpenAI, which makes the explosively popular ChatGPT artificial intelligence system, and a $ 69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision that is facing challenges globally by antitrust regulators.
Mr. Nadella said in a message to staff that the layoffs "are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn't adapt to platform shifts."
The layoffs, which began on Wednesday and will continue through March, are the company's largest in roughly eight years. Mr. Nadella cut about 25,000 jobs over the course of 2014 and 2015 as Microsoft abandoned its ill-fated acquisition of the mobile phone maker Nokia.
Despite the high-profile layoffs from some of the biggest names in tech -- Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others -- the broader labor market remains generally strong. Cooling wage growth has provided some investors optimism that it will relieve pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, but hiring has slowed only slightly.
The skills of engineers and other technical talent are still in high demand. Those who are laid off will likely find roles directly in industries like banking, retail or health care, which are undergoing the digitization of their operations, rather than at big tech firms themselves, labor analysts and recruiters say.
Customers are seeking "to do more with less," Mr. Nadella wrote to employees. "We're also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one," he added.
The changes, including severance and other restructuring expenses, will cost $ 1.2 billion, Mr. Nadella said. In a regulatory filing, Microsoft said some of the costs would come from consolidating office leases, as well as "changes to our hardware portfolio."
Microsoft makes the Surface line of laptops and tablets, and demand for personal computers has fallen sharply from the pandemic highs, when companies and families purchased laptops to work and study from home. In October, Amy Hood, the company's finance chief, told investors that the slowdown in consumer PC sales that started in September would continue through at least June.
Mr. Nadella said the company would continue to hire in strategic areas, and called advances in artificial intelligence "the next major wave of computing."
Other tech giants have also been reducing costs. Amazon began what is expected to be a huge round of layoffs on Wednesday, as part of its plans to cut its corporate work force by about 18,000 jobs.
"The exit out of Covid this past year was challenging," Doug Herrington, who heads Amazon's retail and operations business, wrote Wednesday morning in a message to staff obtained by The New York Times.
He added that although the company had trimmed expenses, "we've determined that we need to take further steps to improve our cost structure so we can keep investing in the customer experience that attracts customers to Amazon and grows our business."
Mr. Herrington wrote that the company would continue to invest in areas including health care and grocery.
The business software company Salesforce said this month that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced at the end of last year that it was cutting more than 11,000 jobs.

Girl, 11, Is Killed by Stray Bullet on Street in Syracuse: [National Desk]

Full text: The child, who lived near the scene of the shooting in Syracuse, was apparently walking home after going out to buy milk.
The Syracuse police were searching on Tuesday for the assailant in a drive-by shooting that killed an 11-year-old girl who lived nearby as she was apparently walking home after buying milk.
The shooting on Monday night occurred at an intersection in the city's Southside neighborhood just opposite an elementary school named for Martin Luther King Jr., on a holiday named for the slain civil rights leader.
The police said the assailant shot the girl, hitting her in the midsection, and also an unidentified 19-year-old man, who was hit in the leg. He survived.
The girl, identified by the authorities as Brexialee Torres-Ortiz, was transported to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead, the police said. Photographs on local media showed a gallon of milk, spilled on its side, at the location of the murder.
Mayor Ben Walsh expressed anguish at the shooting, which he called "senseless" and "brutal."
"It has shaken this community to the core," Mr. Walsh said, during a Tuesday afternoon news conference. "This young lady did nothing wrong. Her family did nothing wrong."
William Fitzpatrick, the district attorney for Onondaga County, said on Tuesday that the shooting could be gang-related, and that the 19-year-old who was shot was the target of the attack, in what he called a "one-way fusillade" near the young victim's house.
"This poor little angel," Mr. Fitzpatrick said, adding, "She just goes out to get a quart of milk for her family."
But, he added, the 19-year-old victim did not appear to be cooperating with investigators, something that galled Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose office will be responsible for prosecuting the crime.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he was shocked that if the young man was "aware that an 11-year-old took a bullet meant for him," he would still choose not to cooperate.
Like several other upstate New York cities, Syracuse has been confronting an uptick in gun violence, leaving local leaders struggling to reassure residents.
Daren C. Jaime, the pastor at People's A.M.E. Zion Church, said he had been at the hospital with the victim's mother after the girl died.
"We ought to be able to walk the streets in peace," he said, "and a child should be able to go to the store and not have a parent wonder whether or not they're ever going to make it home safe."
Mr. Jamie, who is also the chaplain for the Syracuse Police Department, added that the city had seen an increase "in shots fired and also people being hit."
"We're seeing a national problem on a local level," he said.
Mr. Jaime added that the location and timing of the killing -- on Martin Luther King's Birthday, near a street named for him -- was particularly jarring.
"If anything, Dr. King challenged us to be a voice for the voiceless," he said. "And the community must continue to be a voice for the voiceless and for this family that's been tragically impacted."
During Tuesday's news conference, Chief Joseph Cecile of the Syracuse Police Department said Brexialee had been a fifth grader -- president of her class -- with a stellar reputation in school and an interest in dance. She was shot about 100 yards from her apartment, Chief Cecile said, adding that authorities had "fairly good camera footage" of the scene of the shooting.
The chief also pleaded for assistance from the public, saying "we know there's folks out there right now that very likely know who the shooter was."
"I would like to see some tips come in," Chief Cecile said.
There was an outpouring of grief online, where teachers and friends offered tributes to Brexialee.
"The world we live in is crazy," wrote one woman, India Jenkins, on Facebook. Ms. Jenkins, a teaching assistant who knew the victim from school, said Brexialee was "an amazing student just finding out who she was and how far life could take her."
Ms. Jenkins added that the young girl was "sassy but sweet" and "loved by many."
"She didn't deserve this fate," she wrote. "No one does."

17 Years After Husband's Crash, Pilot Meets Same Fate: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Anju Khatiwada, who died on Sunday in a crash in Pokhara, Nepal, decided to become a pilot after her husband's death in 2006. The family's calamities are part of a deadly pattern of aviation disasters in Nepal.
When her husband, a pilot for a small Nepali airline, died in a 2006 plane crash, Anju Khatiwada made a vow: She would continue his dream.
In the face of family opposition, she gave up her nursing career and pursued years of pilot training in the United States, raising her daughter with the help of her parents. Upon her return to Nepal, she took up flying for the same company, Yeti Airlines, in 2010, rising to the rank of captain after racking up thousands of hours in the air.
On Sunday, she met the same fate as her husband. The twin-engine propeller plane she was co-piloting crashed about a mile from the landing strip at a newly built airport in Pokhara, a Himalayan vacation destination. Of the 72 people on board, the bodies of 69 had been recovered by Monday, making it the country's deadliest air disaster in decades.
"Anju's father had asked her not to choose the pilot profession," said Gopal Regmi, a relative and close friend of her father's. "After her husband's tragic death, she was determined to become a pilot."
The family's twin calamities are part of a deadly pattern in Nepal. The small South Asian nation has suffered a series of crashes and other aviation safety lapses in recent decades, a troubling record attributed to difficult terrain and unpredictable weather, as well as inadequate regulation, aging fleets and lagging technical capacity.
Nepal's government appointed a five-member committee to investigate the latest crash, and the aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered on Monday. The cause of the disaster was unclear; aviation experts cautioned that only an inquiry could establish the exact reason that the plane, built about 15 years ago by the French-Italian manufacturer ATR, went down.
But experts said the possible causes, based on video captured moments before the crash, could range from engine failure to a sudden loss of control by the pilot. The video, taken by eyewitnesses in the residential area around the Pokhara airport, showed one wing of the ATR-72 drop suddenly as the plane descended in clear skies. It then plunged into a gorge and erupted in fire and smoke.
Another video, a livestream on Facebook, was filmed inside the aircraft as it approached the runway and passengers regained phone signals. It was broadcast by an Indian passenger, Sonu Jaiswal, who was traveling to a revered Hindu shrine and seeing sights around Nepal with three friends from the same district, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where they lived.
In the 90-second livestream, Mr. Jaiswal, who worked as a liquor salesman, is shown wearing a yellow sweater. He and his friends can be seen exulting in the landing excitement before the aircraft swings sharply to one side. Cries are briefly heard before flames take over the images.
"Sonu was showing it live on Facebook. His mobile must have been burned when it stopped," said his friend Vishal Kushwaha, who was supposed to have been on the tour but dropped out at the last minute because of a family illness. "They were supposed to come back today."
Mr. Jaiswal's father, Rajendra Prasad Jaiswal, who was on his way to Nepal to identify the body, said he learned of the crash from his son's Facebook page. The younger Mr. Jaiswal leaves behind his wife, a 4-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son.
The passengers on the plane included 53 Nepalis, five Indians, four Russians, two South Koreans and one person each from Australia, Argentina, France and Ireland. There were also four Nepali crew members.
Nepal has had more than 30 deadly air crashes since the early 1990s, according to the Aviation Safety Network. In May 2021, 22 people died in the crash of a plane operated by Tara Air -- a Yeti sister airline -- during a 20-minute flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, a trekking destination. In 2016, the crash of another Tara Air flight from Pokhara to Jomsom killed 23 people.
The crashes have continued even as government officials have reported improvements in aviation standards. In 2009, a U.N. watchdog ranked Nepal's implementation of safety protocols at 47 percent, well below the acceptable benchmark at the time, and Nepali airlines were blacklisted by the European Union. That ranking improved to 70 percent in 2022, when Nepal was last reviewed, the country's civil aviation agency said.
But the audit, according to local news media reports, still expressed concerns over shortcomings in air navigation, investigation of incidents and the organizational structure necessary for implementing safety standards.
Before the pandemic, Nepal had seen a steady expansion of air travel, both domestic and international. Tourism, which brings hundreds of millions of dollars into the country, one of the poorest in the region, has been picking up again after a sharp drop during the pandemic. Experts and officials have long been concerned about airports' ability to meet the expanded demand.
Nepal's difficult terrain, with some of the highest mountain ranges in the world, means that a large share of air travel is carried out on small planes that travel between the country's nearly four dozen small airports. Larger, international flights are mostly limited to Nepal's main airport in the capital, Kathmandu. A third international airport was inaugurated this month in Pokhara, the site of Sunday's crash, after construction funded by a $ 200 million Chinese loan.
Bijender Siwach, a retired military pilot and the director general of Aviation Safety India, a nonprofit that conducts training and accident analysis, said that the videos of the accident suggested that weather and terrain were not factors, because the skies were clear and the aircraft was in close range of the landing strip.
While definitive answers will come only from the investigation, Mr. Siwach said, the cause may have been mechanical failure or a case of human error that put the plane into what is known as a stall. In such a case, the aircraft slows down too much to be able to remain aloft and goes out of control.
"If it had happened at 5,000 or 10,000 feet, the aircraft could have recovered at 2,000 feet if the pilot had responded," Mr. Siwach said. "But because the height was too low, 200 or 300 feet maybe, the pilot had no chance."
Officials from Yeti Airlines rejected earlier reports that the aircraft had lost communication with the air traffic control towers. Sudarshan Bartaula, a spokesman for the airline, said the airport had given clearance to land.
"The incident happened about two kilometers away from the airport, which takes 15 to 20 seconds to land there," he said.
Mr. Bartaula said both the captain and co-pilot had ample experience. Kamal K.C., the 58-year old captain, had 21,900 hours of flying time, while Ms. Khatiwada, 44, had 6,396 hours of flying history.
Ms. Khatiwada's husband, Dipak Pokhrel, was a military helicopter pilot before joining Yeti. The Twin Otter utility aircraft he was co-piloting in 2006 crashed just short of the landing strip in Jumla, killing the nine people on board.
Their daughter, now an adult living in Canada, was just 6 when Mr. Pokhrel died, said the relative, Mr. Regmi.
He recounted the story of what Ms. Khatiwada had said during her interview for the U.S. visa that would allow her to go for pilot training.
"I just want to wear the white uniform like my husband and work as a pilot," she said, according to Mr. Regmi.
On Monday, photos of her in her pilot uniform circulated on social media with condolence messages.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With a few others, she epitomized glamour in the late 1980s and early '90s -- on the runway, in magazines and even in a much-viewed music video.
Tatjana Patitz, one of the supermodels who were omnipresent on fashion runways, magazine covers and television commercials in the late 1980s and '90s, died on Wednesday. She was 56.
Her New York agent, Corinne Nicolas of Model CoOp, announced the death on Facebook. Ms. Nicolas's post did not state when or where Ms. Patitz died, but she told the website Insider that the cause was cancer.
Ms. Patitz (pronounced pah-TEETZ) was a teenager in the early 1980s when she started on the path that eventually led to the pinnacle of the modeling profession.
"I accidentally fell into it," she told Prestige Hong Kong magazine in 2016. "I was discovered when I was 15 by someone who took photos of me and sent them on to modeling competitions. I was one of the finalists in one, third place, and they sent me to Paris. It all started from there."
Still, she said, it took her a while to build a modeling career.
"It wasn't like things just fell into my lap," she said. "Getting introduced to the business was hard."
But by the late 1980s, she was in demand. A 1988 photograph of Ms. Patitz and five others, all wearing white shirts -- taken by the German photographer Peter Lindbergh, whose work was instrumental to her career and those of other supermodels -- was widely admired. Two years later, Mr. Lindbergh's cover for British Vogue showing Ms. Patitz, Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista became a touchstone of the period's glamour photography.
That image led to one of Ms. Patitz's best-known appearances -- not in a magazine or on a runway, but in a music video. The pop star George Michael saw the cover and recruited the five women for the video of his song "Freedom! '90."

It was the height of the MTV era, and the video, with the models lip-syncing the song, received heavy play, which, as the British newspaper The Mail put it in a 1995 article, "scorched the girls onto every pubescent popster's brainpan from Minsk to Montevideo."
Photo shoots took Ms. Patitz all over the world. In 1999 The Sunday Telegraph of Britain wrote about her and her home outside Malibu in California.
"You can virtually trace where my work has taken me just by looking around," she told the newspaper, pointing out bowls and Buddhas from Bali, kilims from Morocco, cushions from India, a wooden suitcase from Montana that she was using as a table. "I don't have a lot of things, but if I see something I really like, I buy it. The house holds a lot of memories."
Ms. Patitz was born on May 25, 1966, in Hamburg, in what was then West Germany. She lived in Sweden from age 7 until her budding modeling career took her to Paris for good, at 17.
Ms. Patitz appeared in numerous major magazines beginning in the 1980s, but she was also known for her work on television commercials, which sometimes used her arresting looks for comic effect.
In one, for Levi's in 1988, a hunky young man wearing an unbuttoned shirt and boxers but no pants walks into a dingy diner on a hot day. She is working the counter. He walks toward her, and there is a moment of sexual chemistry. What he is really after, though, are his jeans, which are in the refrigerator behind her. In Britain, a watchdog group demanded that the ad not be shown when children might be watching.
A 1990 commercial for Stainmaster carpeting featured Ms. Patitz, in evening wear, along with a well-dressed man and a table set with a candlelit dinner; the man is apparently so distracted by her beauty that he knocks the whole table over, the meal spilling onto the stain-resistant carpet. A second advertisement featured the same couple and ended in a food fight. "Wall-to-wall pile never looked so sexy," Entertainment Weekly said in naming it one of 1991's best advertisements.
Her work in commercials and music videos brought Ms. Patitz a handful of film and television roles in the 1990s, most notably in the crime drama "Rising Sun" (1993), which starred Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes and was based on a Michael Crichton novel.
"For Swedish newcomer Tatjana Patitz -- the supermodel-turned-actress who at 26 is a dead ringer for a young Lauren Bacall -- a mostly nude performance as the murder victim in 20th Century Fox's new release 'Rising Sun' wasn't exactly how the ingénue imagined she would break into the business," The Los Angeles Times wrote in 1993. Her character dies during a sadomasochistic sexual encounter.
"I thought, 'Oh my God, I don't want my parents to see it,"' she told the newspaper.
The supermodel era faded in the mid-1990s, but Ms. Patitz continued to work occasionally. An animal lover since childhood, she devoted considerable time to her dogs, cats, horses and birds. Her marriage to Jason Johnson in the 2000s ended in divorce; their son, Jonah, survives her.

Women in Missouri's Legislature Are Now Required to Wear a Blazer: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The updated dress code requires female legislators and staff members in the State House of Representatives to wear a jacket, such as a blazer or a cardigan.
The Missouri State House of Representatives revised its dress code for female legislators and staff members, requiring them to wear a jacket, such as a blazer or a cardigan, and setting off a debate about policing the fashion choices of women.
The updated dress code -- which was adopted on Wednesday by a vote of 105-51 as part of a larger package of rules governing the House -- drew criticism from some Democratic lawmakers, who described the Republican-backed effort as sexist and pointless. Supporters said it was a small tweak that would help ensure professionalism inside the chamber.
The main proponent of the new rule -- State Representative Ann Kelley, a Republican, who introduced it -- said on the House floor that the new rules for women would mirror the dress code language for men, and that it "is essential to always maintain a formal and professional atmosphere" in the House.
"You would think that all you would have to do is say, 'Dress professionally,' and women could handle it," Ms. Kelley said. "You would think elected officials could handle that."
The amendment took up four sentences in a 37-page resolution that established rules governing the State House of Representatives, including how committee meetings are announced and attendance policies for lawmakers. There are 116 men and 43 women in the House. In the State Senate, there is no rule requiring a woman to wear a blazer.
Ms. Kelley, who did not immediately respond to a call and an email seeking comment on Saturday, said on the floor that she sought to establish revised rules because even though new female lawmakers were told that a jacket was required in the chamber, there had been some women who believed that if "you were wearing a skirt or a sweater, you did not have to wear a jacket."
She said on Facebook that the chief clerk of the House, Dana Rademan Miller, had wanted to put such a rule in place "for many years."
"Now, it has been fixed," Ms. Kelley said.
Dress codes for men, who are required to wear a jacket, shirt and tie, were not changed.
Jamie Tomek, the secretary of the Missouri chapter of the National Organization for Women, said on Saturday that she and other organization members were "outraged" that Republicans had wasted time by focusing on a futile, misogynistic issue.
"We have a Republican Legislature, so they think they have time to spend on those kinds of things, as opposed to real issues that citizens of Missouri need dealing with," she said.
Some Democratic representatives objected to the idea that a dress code change was necessary.
"I think we're being quite pedantic here by making rules so petty," State Representative Raychel Proudie, a Democrat, said on Wednesday in the chamber. "And what it will ultimately lead to is the disenfranchisement of folks. For example, they don't make jackets or blazers for women who are pregnant. That can be very uncomfortable."
Other Democratic lawmakers said the rule change underscored how women had historically been subjected to heightened scrutiny and criticism over their fashion choices.
Similar feuds over sexual bias in dress codes have played out across the country, particularly in school settings, other state legislatures and Congress, with students and professionals expressing frustration at unequal guidelines.
In Wyoming, state lawmakers last year voted to loosen one of the strictest dress codes in the nation for legislators by simply requiring them to wear "business attire," The Casper Star-Tribune reported. For example, bolo ties -- a string tie held in place by an ornament that is called a bolo -- had been acceptable, but they had to be "worn tight with the top button of a collared shirt buttoned."
In Montana, Democrats have criticized the dress code in the State House of Representatives, which says that female lawmakers "should be sensitive to skirt lengths and necklines."
In a 2021 report, the National Conference of State Legislatures said that about half of the states had some kind of dress code in place. In Georgia, suit coats for men and "dignified dress" for women were expected. And in Colorado, House members could wear "a suit coat or sport coat."
In Missouri, State Representative Ashley Aune, a Democrat, said on the floor on Wednesday that a "gentleman in this room" had once questioned what she was wearing.
"You know what it feels like to have a bunch of men in this room looking at your top trying to decide whether it's appropriate or not?" she said.
Ms. Aune then debated Ms. Kelley over the purpose of the revised rule. "I mean, this is ridiculous," she said.
Ms. Kelley responded: "Why should we talk about something like this? It is absolutely ridiculous."
"You brought this to the floor, lady," Ms. Aune replied. "You tell me."
Ms. Kelley originally did not include cardigans in her proposed rule, but the sweater was listed as acceptable in a final version of the resolution.
"Proper attire for women shall be business attire, including jackets worn with dresses, skirts, or slacks, and dress shoes or boots," the resolution states. "For the purposes of this rule, 'jacket' shall include blazers, cardigans, and knit blazers."
Representative Brenda Shields, a Republican, expressed support for the amendment on Wednesday, saying that the intention of the change was "just to clarify what we already have."
"We don't want anyone to have to be the clothing police," Ms. Shields said.
After the vote, Ms. Kelley said on Facebook that she received "lots of hateful calls, emails, and messages in regards to this amendment, which is funny because we already have a dress code."
She added that she had not wasted time when introducing the amendment because she had spoken for less than five minutes. At her office this week, Ms. Kelley said, she frequently answered phone calls and got "cussed at."
"How is encouraging professionalism wrong?" she said.

Santos Urged Trans Voters to Leave Democrats: [National Desk]

Author: Gold, Michael

Publication info: Gold, Michael.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A year before George Santos first ran for Congress, he appeared at an L.G.B.T.Q. event using one of his alternate identities.
Months before beginning his first, and unsuccessful, bid for Congress, George Santos appeared at an event that urged members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community to leave the Democratic Party and embrace Republicans and Donald J. Trump, who was president at the time.
"My name is Anthony Devolder," he said, using a version of his full name, George Anthony Devolder Santos. Mr. Santos, who is gay, described himself as a New Yorker who recently formed a group, United for Trump, according to a newly surfaced video clip of the March 2019 event held by the conservative Walk Away foundation.
He then addressed a conservative transgender YouTube star, asking her how she "can help educate other trans people from not having to follow the narrative that the media and the Democrats put forward."
The clip, posted on Twitter on Friday, offers new insight into Mr. Santos's early embrace of Mr. Trump and the right-wing movement that the former president spawned, as Mr. Santos made his first ventures into public political life.
Mr. Santos has attracted the attention of federal, state and local investigators after The New York Times reported last month that he had omitted key details about his business on required candidate financial disclosures, and based his successful run for Congress in New York on a web of fabrications about his real estate holdings, academic degrees and a successful Wall Street career.
Mr. Santos ultimately acknowledged having misled voters about his education and work history, maintaining that, at worst, he was guilty of embellishing his résumé. He was sworn in last weekend, even as colleagues in Congress, including several Republican House members, have called for his resignation.
Former friends, roommates and colleagues of Mr. Santos have previously told The Times that Mr. Santos often used variations of his full name in different contexts. The Times located social media profiles, GoFundMe efforts and business forays, including the company that Mr. Santos said was his prime source of income, the Devolder Organization, that used combinations of his first, middle and last names.
At the time of the Walk Away event, Mr. Santos was apparently using the name George Devolder in professional capacities. He was then working as a vice president at LinkBridge Investors, a company which held conferences to connect potential investors and funds. A solicitation for one such conference, made on March 4, 2019, uses the name George Devolder.
Yet at Republican events, Mr. Santos had been identifying differently. In late March, around the time of the Walk Away event, Mr. Santos attended a dinner held by the Queens Village Republican Club, where a photo that includes him is captioned with "Anthony Devolder." That dinner was also attended by Vickie Paladino, now an outspoken far-right Republican on the New York City Council.
Ms. Paladino, who has attracted attention for staunchly opposing vaccine mandates and for accusing fellow City Council members of supporting "child grooming and sexualization," has repeatedly called Mr. Santos a friend. But in a statement last month, she expressed disappointment with "the lies he told his constituents and his friends."
The keynote speaker at the Queens Village dinner was Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager and political adviser to Mr. Trump. But another guest speaker was Brandon Straka, a former hair stylist who created the Walk Away Foundation, a group that seeks to persuade Democratic voters to leave the party.
In the video of the Walk Away event, Mr. Santos calls Mr. Straka -- who would later plead guilty to charges related to his being at the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and admitted to urging a crowd to take a riot shield away from a police office -- "an idol."
The Walk Away event had already prompted an outcry before Mr. Santos attended. It was initially scheduled to be held at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in Manhattan, but after an uproar and threats of protest, the center canceled. The event was later held elsewhere.
Mr. Santos boasted on the campaign trail of being an openly gay Republican, but he has embraced right-wing policies that many L.G.B.T.Q. activists have decried as discriminatory.
In a video posted to Facebook in April 2022, Mr. Santos voiced support for a Florida law that prohibited teachers from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary school grades, a law that opponents have called the "Don't Say Gay" law.
Mr. Santos, in a caption for the video, accused Democrats of wanting to "groom our kids," repeating a conservative talking point that associates any discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity with children to sexual abuse.
"Hey, everyone," Mr. Santos said at the beginning of the video. "George Santos here."
"As a gay man, I stand proudly behind not teaching our children sex or sexual orientation," Mr. Santos said.

To Keep Your Goals on Track, Run in a Group: [Sports Desk]

Author: Coughlin, Jennie

Full text: Running with other people is not only more fun but can also provide accountability and support as you train. Virtual friends count, too.
My first experiences running were on my high school track team, but as an adult, I've become mostly a solo runner. That's one advantage of running: You don't need a team or a class. But it can help. Strava, an exercise-tracking app, released its Year In Sport report, and one data point caught my eye: Runners who had group activities in January 2022 recorded 78 percent more active time than those who ran solo.
January brings a new year and often new goals. But in the Northern Hemisphere, at least, the month can also bring cold, snow and ice, and daylight is also in short supply. Any of those can make it tougher to get out and run, but Strava's data suggests a possible solution for people struggling to log their miles.
Brad Stulberg, an executive coach and author of books about performance and personal development, said that working out with others had three main benefits: accountability, support and community.
When runners make plans to meet up, they are more likely to show up, Stulberg said.
"Paradoxically, there's also that support," he said, adding, "When you fail, which you inevitably will, there's a safety net, a cushion to help you bounce back."
Running with people also can be more fun and, beyond that, connects runners to wider communities. "It certainly helps give it more meaning," Stulberg said of group running.
How can you find running buddies if you don't already have a crew? Here are some suggestions to keep in mind.
Join a running club
Clubs are one of the easiest ways to find running companions, though they may be harder to find in some less-populated areas of the country.
In New York City, there are dozens, and the two biggest race organizations have lists of clubs to help runners find a good fit. The Road Runners Club of America also maintains a list of clubs around the United States.
If you haven't found a running club yet, ask at a local running store. Employees there may know what organized running groups exist in the area. Many stores also host group runs.
Before joining a group, there are a few things you might also want to ask. How long are the runs? If you use run-walk intervals, can these be accommodated? What qualifies as long runs? If this club is geared toward runners who consider five or six miles a long run and you're expecting to do 16 or 18 for marathon training, you'd want to know before showing up. How does a group handle people running at different paces? As a slower runner, I've encountered running groups that say "all paces welcome," when in reality they mean "all paces 12 minutes per mile or faster welcome."
Look for other runners
Running with people doesn't need to be through an official group. If you have friends who run, see if you can find a time and place to meet up. You can also post in a local Facebook group or Reddit forum for your community to see if others are looking for running buddies.
Or, if you regularly run a certain route, watch for other regulars and groups who are running there.
Raheem Sisson was living in Houston when he started running. At the time, he was looking for new athletic pursuits after his basketball career ended. He saw runners from the local Black Men Run chapter, and he ended up joining them.
"I just wanted to find some brothers who look like me," said Sisson, who now runs with a local Black Men Run chapter in Colorado after moving there.
When I run the loop in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, I often see groups of people and running clubs there. But I also see solo runners I recognize because they're always there around the same time I am. If you find people running at about your pace, you might ask if they would be interested in meeting up to run together sometimes.
The benefits outweigh the costs
Pace is one of two costs of running with people that Stulberg mentioned. In a group, you may be sacrificing a precise pace or workout plan. If your plan calls for eight-minute miles and your group is running miles at 8:15-8:20, you'll still probably benefit more from running with the group than solo, Stulberg said.
As an example, he pointed to Shalane Flanagan and what's been named the Shalane Effect. She trained solo for much of her career, but after she joined the Bowerman Track Club in Oregon, she started achieving more, and so did the women she trained with. And Eliud Kipchoge, the fastest marathoner in the world, also trains with a group and does most of his workouts with them.
Stulberg said that even though joining a group run might take more time and effort than running solo, the benefits of running with others outweigh the lesser convenience.
Find a virtual running group
Still, for people in less populated areas or who have unusual schedules, running with others might be difficult. But technology can help.
In his latest book, "The Practice of Groundedness," Stulberg has a section on "deep community," which he defines as a sense of belonging. "What you're really after is a sense of meaning and belonging, and you can get that virtually," he said.
Stulberg knows a group of people who ran together in high school and now are scattered around the United States. He said they use a group text to support each other and check in with their runs.
My main running club, the Sub-30 Club, is organized through Facebook and has members from all over the world. And though some members meet in person, the group has daily check-in posts for people based loosely on the time of day they run. When I worked an early-morning shift and ran midafternoon, I would reply in the noon crew post. It's not the same as making plans to meet some of those same friends for a run, but the group post does provide the accountability, support and community that Stulberg said were key benefits.
Even if you rely on a virtual community, there are benefits to running with people at least occasionally.
"If you can find the right in-person group, it's better than a virtual group," Stulberg said, but he added that virtual groups can also be great options. "Both can be true."

Full text: Priscilla Presley appeared with her daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, at the Golden Globes on Tuesday, just days before her death.
On Tuesday night, Priscilla Presley and her daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, sat side by side at their table at the Golden Globes and watched with emotion as Austin Butler won an award for his portrayal of Elvis in the Baz Luhrmann film of the same name.
"Thank you for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me," Butler said in his acceptance speech, as mother and daughter looked on. "Lisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever."
Just two days later, Priscilla Presley shared a wrenching message about her daughter on social media, along with a photo of the two of them together. "My beloved daughter Lisa Marie was rushed to the hospital," she wrote on Thursday. "She is now receiving the best care. Please keep her and our family in your prayers. We feel the prayers from around the world, and ask for privacy during this time."
A few hours later came the announcement that Lisa Marie Presley had died at the age of 54. It was another loss for Priscilla, 77, in what has been a lifetime punctuated with extreme highs and lows, almost always playing out in the public spotlight.
Priscilla Beaulieu, who was born in Brooklyn, met Elvis Presley when he was stationed with the Army in West Germany in 1959. He was already an international superstar -- his first No. 1 single on the Billboard Top 100, "Heartbreak Hotel," had been released in 1956. She was barely a teenager, living in several states before her family moved overseas with her stepfather, also a military man.
The move was rough, she wrote in her 1985 autobiography, "Elvis and Me." She had just been voted queen of her junior high in Texas, she said, and the prospect of leaving had left her "crushed": "Germany was on the other side of the world."
She had not been there long before encountering Elvis Presley, who was 10 years her senior. "When we met, I had just turned 14," she wrote. "The first six months I spent with him were filled with tenderness and affection. Blinded by love, I saw none of his faults or weaknesses. He was to become the passion of my life."
Elvis returned to the United States shortly after, but the couple kept in touch; in 1963, she joined him in Memphis, where she would complete her high school education.
In 1966, they got engaged. In 1967, they were married in Las Vegas. In 1968, Lisa Marie was born.
"The nurse brought her into my room and I cradled her in my arms," Priscilla Presley wrote in her autobiography. "I couldn't believe she was mine, that I had borne this child.
"She was so tiny, so beautiful. Elvis came into the room and kissed me, thrilled that we had a perfectly normal, healthy baby. He was already in love with her. He watched me holding her and his eyes misted with happiness. Then he took us both in his arms and held us."
The pair divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died at age 42 of heart failure, but they remained very close. "Elvis was still an essential part of my life," she wrote in her book. "Over the last years, we'd become good friends, admitting the mistakes we'd made in the past and just beginning to laugh at our shortcomings. I could not face the reality that I would never see him alive again. He had always been there for me."
Priscilla would go on to become an actress, appearing as Jenna Wade for several years on the long-running CBS prime-time soap "Dallas" and then opposite Leslie Nielsen in the three "Naked Gun" films, a role which won her praise from critics for her comic touch.
In 1985, she gave birth to her son, Navarone Garibaldi, with her longtime partner, Marco Garibaldi. (They later split.) And she became a grandmother in 1989, with the birth of Lisa Marie's daughter, the actress Riley Keough, and again in 1992 with the birth of Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide at age 27 in 2020.
"These are some of the darkest days of my family's life," Priscilla Presley wrote on Facebook after his death. "The shock of losing Ben has been devastating. Trying to put all the pieces together of all the possible whys has penetrated my soul. Each day I wake up I pray it will get better. Then, I think of my daughter and the pain she is going through as she was a doting mother."
A representative for Priscilla Presley said on Friday that she would not immediately comment after her daughter's death. During a Globes interview with Billy Bush of "Extra," Priscilla had been asked what Elvis, who would have turned 88 last Sunday, said to her that she would never forget: "I love you," she replied.

Death Toll Rises to 9 After Tornadoes Shred Through the South

Rescuers in Alabama were scouring through debris, and in some places going door to door, as they tried on Friday to find people who might have been killed or injured by the powerful storms that unleashed tornadoes and shredding winds across the South.
In Old Kingston, an unincorporated rural community in central Alabama, emergency workers searching the wreckage of a home found a woman who had been killed, raising the death toll from Thursday’s storms in Autauga County to seven, authorities said. Two more people were killed in Georgia, a 5-year-old boy and a state employee responding to the storm, state officials there said.
Yet the full extent of the devastation remained unclear Friday as communities scattered across Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi tried to assess all that had been lost.
“You can’t get down no street in Selma,” Lemarkus A. Snow, who lives in the city, said in a Facebook Live video, describing the chaos and destruction he had seen in Selma, which is roughly 50 miles from Montgomery, the state capital. “You’ve got power lines down all over the city of Selma,” he said. “Every corner, it’s just bad. When I say it’s bad, Selma is in a state of emergency as we’re speaking.”
Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama had indeed declared a state of emergency for six counties, including Dallas County, whose seat is Selma. “We are far too familiar with devastating weather, but our people are resilient,” Ivey said on Twitter.
The storms struck many places that were still clawing their way back from the effects of the bitter winter storm that swept across much of the country last month. The freezing temperatures in December disrupted Selma’s water system, as pipes burst in homes and businesses, pushing the mayor to declare a state of emergency.
Now the city must contend with severe tornado damage. Trees were torn apart, roofs were peeled off houses and businesses, and utility lines were knocked down. The Selma mayor’s office said in a statement that the city had “received significant damage from the tornado.” Officials urged residents to stay off the roads and avoid fallen power lines.
Autauga County, just east of Selma, appeared to have sustained some of the worst damage. Gary Weaver, deputy director of the county’s Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday that there were reports of injuries and damage, including downed power lines, throughout the county.
Enrique Milian, who lives in Autauga County, said in an interview that several of his relatives, including two children, had been injured by an apparent tornado Thursday as they left their mobile home and ran toward a family car.
The two children, his 5-month-old and 1-year-old nephews, were hospitalized with chest injuries and are expected to survive, Milian said as he stood near a dirt road where several mobile homes — including his own and those of his two brothers — had been destroyed.
In Tallapoosa County, a trooper from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency was taken to the hospital with injuries after a falling tree hit his car, crushing it, according to images and a statement posted on Facebook on Thursday.
Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia also declared a state of emergency, and said in a statement that he had “ordered all relevant agencies to respond with an all-hands-on-deck approach.”
“It’s dangerous work and there’s a lot of it to do,” Kemp said Friday at a news conference.
State officials urged residents to stay where they were, because the storm continued to pose perils even after it had passed. They noted that both fatalities in the state were caused by falling debris. The 5-year-old boy was in a car struck by a falling tree in Butts County, roughly an hour’s drive southeast of Atlanta; one of the child’s parents was critically injured, authorities said. The state employee also was killed by a falling tree, authorities said.
“We don’t want to add to that,” James C. Stallings, the director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, said of the death toll in the news conference.
“Stay where you are,” Stallings said. “There are teams still trying to cut through the debris. There are still roads that are inaccessible.”
Crews worked to restore electricity to thousands of people across the region who had lost service.
Meteorologists were tracking 45 reports of tornadoes across the South on Thursday, mostly in Alabama, and many of the reports were likely to be confirmed by the National Weather Service, Bob Oravec, a meteorologist at the agency, said by phone Thursday night. A few had already been confirmed by local weather service offices.
Thunderstorms were forecast for parts of Central and South Florida on Friday, along with some possible snow in northern Alabama. More than 500,000 people living along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina were under a winter storm warning as of 3 a.m. Eastern time.
Even so, Oravec said, “a lot of the worst of the weather, it appears, is over.”
The storms left people stuck and terrified. In Spalding County, Georgia, about 40 miles south of Atlanta, students were stranded on Thursday at four middle schools. School officials worked into the night, trying to get those students back home or reunited with their families. Principals were even using chain saws to clear roads and driveways, school officials said.
In Griffin, the Spalding County seat with a population of about 23,000, violent winds tore apart buildings and felled trees. “You could hear stuff being ripped to pieces and people screaming in fear,” Jessica Diane Pitts, a resident, said in a Facebook message. “I hope I never experience something like this again!”

OLD KINGSTON, Ala. — At least eight people were killed Thursday as severe storms and tornadoes left a trail of damage across the South, officials said.
Seven of the deaths were in Autauga County, Alabama, in the Appalachian foothills, including a woman whose body was found Friday in a destroyed home in Old Kingston, said Buster Barber, the county coroner, in a telephone interview. He said search teams were going house to house.
And in Butts County, Georgia, about 50 miles southeast of Atlanta, a 5-year-old boy was killed when a tree hit the vehicle he was traveling in, a county official said.
By early Friday, the immediate threat of extreme weather across the South had passed, but tens of thousands of customers were still without power in parts of Alabama and Georgia, as power crews worked through the night and early reports of injuries and damages began to surface.
Enrique Milian, who lives in Autauga County, said in an interview that several of his relatives, including two children, had been injured by an apparent tornado Thursday as they left their mobile home and ran toward a family car.
The two children, his 5-month-old and 1-year-old nephews, were hospitalized with chest injuries and are expected to survive, Milian said, standing near a dirt road where several mobile homes — including his own and those of his two brothers — had been destroyed.
Meteorologists were tracking 45 reports of tornadoes across the South on Thursday, mostly in Alabama, and many were likely to be confirmed by the National Weather Service, Bob Oravec, a meteorologist at the agency, said by phone Thursday night. A few had already been confirmed by local weather service offices.
Thunderstorms were forecast for parts of Central and South Florida on Friday, along with some possible snow in northern Alabama. More than 500,000 people living along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina were under a winter storm warning as of 3 a.m. Eastern time.
“A lot of the worst of the weather, it appears, is over,” Oravec said.
More than 6.8 million people across Alabama and Georgia had been under a tornado watch Thursday, and the governors of both states declared states of emergency.
Alabama’s order applied to six counties, including Autauga, which has a population of just under 60,000 people and lies just west of Montgomery. In 2011, it was struck by a punishing storm system that killed three people.
Videos and images from across the South showed felled trees as well as damage to homes and other buildings, but the extent of the injuries and property damage was not immediately clear.
Gary Weaver, deputy director of Autauga County’s Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday that there were reports of injuries and damage, including downed power lines, throughout the county. Weaver said that his office had received reports of some injuries, but that it was not clear how many people had been hurt, or how badly.
In Tallapoosa County, Alabama, a trooper from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency was taken to the hospital with injuries after a tree fell and hit his car, crushing it, according to images and a statement posted on Facebook on Thursday.
Farther west, in Spalding County, Georgia, the sheriff’s office reported that downed trees were blocking roadways, and announced that schools and the county courthouse would be closed Friday.
The storms also left students trapped on Thursday at four Spalding County middle schools. By Friday morning, they had all been reunited with their families, school officials said.
And in the county seat, Griffin, violent winds had torn apart buildings and felled trees, according to Jessica Diane Pitts, a resident. “You could hear stuff being ripped to pieces and people screaming in fear!” Pitts said in a Facebook message. “I hope I never experience something like this again!”
In Mississippi, the state’s emergency management agency shared a video on Twitter that showed a home in Monroe County that had been essentially flattened. Other houses nearby sustained roof damage, with debris littering the area.
“That home is completely destroyed,” Malary White, a spokesperson for the agency, said Thursday.
Several severe thunderstorm warnings were also issued in the Atlanta area, including one for the area around Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where the weather service warned of winds up to 60 mph, quarter-size hail and a possible tornado.
And in Selma, Alabama, videos and images that circulated on social media Thursday showed damaged buildings, fallen trees and vehicles with broken windows. The weather service office in nearby Birmingham, Alabama, said on Twitter that there had been “confirmed damage” in Selma.
The Selma mayor’s office said in a statement that the city had “received significant damage from the tornado.” It urged residents to refrain from driving and to avoid downed power lines.
At a news conference Thursday evening, officials in Selma said they had received no reports of fatalities, but that there had been some injuries. A curfew was to be put in place from dusk to dawn across the city.
A man in Selma, Bobby Green, told an ABC affiliate station that he had survived flying debris by sheltering in his car.
“I thought it was all over for me,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Storms caused damage in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, prompting a series of tornado watches that later expired. More than 50,000 customers had no electricity as of Friday morning.
OLD KINGSTON, Ala. -- At least six people were killed on Thursday in Autauga County, Ala., the local sheriff's office said, as storms and tornadoes left a trail of damage across the American South.
Tens of thousands of customers were still without power in parts of Alabama and Georgia in the predawn hours of Friday morning, as power crews worked through the night and early reports of injuries and damages began to surface.
Enrique Milian, who lives in Autauga County, said in an interview that several of his relatives, including two children, had been injured by an apparent tornado on Thursday as they left their mobile home and ran toward a family car.
The two children, his five-month-old and 1-year-old nephews, were hospitalized with chest injuries and are expected to survive, Mr. Milian said, standing near a dirt road where several mobile homes -- including his own and those of his two brothers -- had been destroyed.
Meteorologists were tracking 45 reports of tornadoes on across the South on Thursday, mostly in Alabama, and many were likely to be confirmed by the National Weather Service, Bob Oravec, a meteorologist at the agency, said by phone that night. A few had already been confirmed by local Weather Service offices.
Thunderstorms were forecast for parts of Central and South Florida on Friday, but there was no longer a threat of extreme weather across the South, Mr. Oravec said, adding that all the tornado watches issued earlier in the day had expired.
"A lot of the worst of the weather, it appears, is over," he said.
More than 6.8 million people across Alabama and Georgia had been under a tornado watch on Thursday, and the governors of both states declared states of emergency.
"We are far too familiar with devastating weather, but our people are resilient," Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama said on Twitter.
Alabama's order applied to six counties, including Autauga, which has a population of just under 60,000 people and lies in the Appalachian foothills. In 2011, it was struck by a punishing storm system that killed three people.
More than 24,000 customers in Alabama and more than 33,000 in Georgia were still without power as of early Friday morning in Atlanta, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. It was unclear whether all those outages were the result of the severe weather.
In Autauga County, Gary Weaver, the deputy director of the Emergency Management Agency, said on Thursday that there were reports of injuries and damage, including felled power lines, throughout the county. Mr. Weaver said that his office had received reports of some injuries, but that it was not clear how many people had been hurt, or how badly.
Utility crews in the county were already working to repair damage on along the storm's path. One from PowerSouth Energy Cooperative was dispatched on Thursday from Andalusia, Ala., to assess damage to downed power lines and a substation.
In Tallapoosa County, Ala., a trooper from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency was taken to the hospital with injuries after a tree fell and hit his car, crushing it, according to images and a statement posted on Facebook Thursday.
In Butts County, Ga., a few dozen miles southeast of Atlanta, the deputy county manager, J. Michael Brewer, said on Twitter early on Friday that the storms had badly damaged mobile homes and toppled some fully grown trees.
Further west in Spalding County, Ga., the sheriff's office reported that downed trees were blocking roadways, and announced that schools and the county courthouse would be closed on Friday.
The storms also left students trapped on Thursday at four Spalding County middle schools. Students from two of the schools later made it home safely, but officials were still working to help a total of 24 children leave the other two schools, the Griffin-Spalding County School System said on its website.
And in the county seat, Griffin, violent winds had torn apart buildings and felled trees, according to Jessica Diane Pitts, a resident. "You could hear stuff being ripped to pieces and people screaming in fear!" Ms. Pitts said in a Facebook message. "I hope I never experience something like this again!"
In Mississippi, the state's emergency management agency shared a video on Twitter that showed a home in Monroe County that had been essentially flattened. Other houses nearby sustained roof damage, with debris littering the area.
"That home is completely destroyed," Malary White, a spokeswoman for the agency, said on Thursday.
Several severe thunderstorm warnings were also issued in the Atlanta area, including one for the area around Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where the Weather Service warned of winds up to 60 miles per hour, quarter-size hail and a possible tornado.
And in Selma, Ala., videos and images that circulated on social media on Thursday showed damaged buildings, fallen trees and vehicles with broken windows. The Weather Service office in nearby Birmingham, Ala., said on Twitter that there had been "confirmed damage" in Selma.
The Selma mayor's office said in a statement that the city had "received significant damage from the tornado." It urged residents to refrain from driving and to avoid downed power lines.
At a news conference on Thursday evening, officials in Selma said they had received no reports of fatalities, but that there had been some injuries. A curfew was to be put in place from dusk to dawn across the city.
A man in Selma, Bobby Green, told an ABC affiliate station that he had survived flying debris by sheltering in his car.
"I thought it was all over for me," he said.

Wall St. Rises Ahead of Inflation Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks rallied Wednesday as investors locked in their final moves ahead of a highly anticipated report on inflation, one that could show whether Wall Street's rising optimism recently has been warranted or overdone.
The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 percent for its second straight gain before Thursday morning's inflation data. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 269 points, or 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.8 percent.
Stocks have started 2023 with gains on hopes that cooling inflation and a slowing economy may get the Federal Reserve to ease off its sharp hikes to interest rates. Such increases can help stamp out high inflation, but they also slow the economy by design and raise the risk of a recession while hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Economists expect Thursday's report to show inflation is continuing to cool from its summertime peak, down to 6.5 percent last month from 7.1 percent in November and from more than 9 percent in June. The hope on Wall Street is that such a trend toward normal could convince the Fed to soon halt its blistering set of rate increases, many of which were at shock-and-awe levels that were triple the usual amount.
Some investors are even betting the Fed will cut interest rates in the second half of this year, to help prop up an economy that's beginning to show pockets of weakness because of past rate hikes. Cuts to rates typically act like steroids for markets, helping prices for stocks and other investments.
"One real thing I think underpinning the market is simply the fact that the market doesn't believe the Fed when they say they're going to keep hiking this year," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.
Of course, that also means investors could be setting themselves up for disappointment. If Thursday's data and other reports don't show inflation is improving as much as expected, it could mean the Fed would have to get tougher on interest rates.
The Fed has already said repeatedly it plans to raise its key overnight interest rate further, past its current perch sitting in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent. That rate began last year at its record low of virtually zero.
The central bank has also insisted it plans to keep rates high for a while to ensure inflation is really beaten down. It does not envision any rate cuts happening this year, and it's even said that any "unwarranted" rallies on Wall Street "driven by a misperception" would only make the mission of returning inflation to normal more complicated.
Recently, though, Wall Street has been looking through such pronouncements.
Treasury yields have been easing off their recent highs, in part on expectations for an easier Fed.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, dipped to 4.22 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, also declined.
If the economy does fall into a modest recession, possible rate cuts could offer some support for stocks. And hope is growing among investors that the economy could successfully walk the tightrope of slowing enough to snuff out high inflation but not so much as to cause a deep recession.
That's helped spark a mini-rebound for some of the stocks that fell the most last year, which plunged in large part because of rising rates. Facebook's parent, Meta, is up 10.4 percent so far in 2023 after slumping 64.2 percent in 2022.
Later this week, companies will also begin reporting how much profit they made during the last three months of 2022. That's key because earnings are one of the main levers that set stock prices, and the reports will offer a window into how companies are managing the squeeze of inflation.

Three-Quarters of Teenagers Have Seen Online Pornography by Age 17

WASHINGTON — The internet has transformed pornography, making it much easier to view and share than in the days of Playboy magazine and late-night cable television.
For teenagers, that’s created a deluge of sexually explicit photos and videos that has invaded their everyday lives, according to a report released Tuesday.
Three-quarters of teenagers have viewed pornography online by the age of 17, with the average age of first exposure at age 12, according to the report by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit child advocacy group. Teenagers are seeing the photos and videos on their smartphones, on their school devices and across social media, pornography sites and streaming sites, it said.
The report underlined how ubiquitous pornography has become, with 41% of teenagers saying they had seen images of nudity or sexual acts online during the school day. Much of the exposure was by accident, with 58% saying they did not seek out the sexually explicit videos and photos, but had come across them while surfing the web, on social media, or through search engines or clicking ads.
Teenagers have increasingly grappled with the role of technology on their mental health and well-being. In recent years, lawmakers have criticized social media platforms like Instagram for exacerbating eating disorders and scrutinized how the sites have been used to sell illegal substances such as fentanyl-laced drugs to adolescents.
The effect of online pornography on teenagers has been less examined, but parents and politicians have been locked in fierce debates over tech safety and whether discussions around pornography should take place in schools or at home. In the fall, sex education courses in Idaho were falsely portrayed in posts and an article as promoting pornography. Tweets linking to the false report provoked outrage online and were mentioned on Fox News. In Louisiana, a new law will require age verification for pornography sites.
“We can’t sweep this topic under the rug just because it’s uncomfortable to talk about,” said Jim Steyer, the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, who plans to present the report this week to officials at the White House and at federal agencies. “Pornography is a huge part of the lives of children who have digital access like never before, and we need to have a national conversation about it.”
Part of the issue is that online pornography is a highly lucrative industry, giving it a firm foothold. While there is little data on the size of the online pornography industry, one estimate from Alec Helmy, founder of the trade publication XBIZ, which surveys payment processors, puts revenues for adult influencers and platforms at at least $15 billion in 2022. He estimated revenues from internet pornography in 2012 were $5 billion.
In recent years, online pornography has evolved into a business in which thousands of people have their own streaming, texting and photo channels that are promoted on sites like Instagram and hosted on platforms like OnlyFans and PornHub, Helmy said.
Common Sense’s report was based on a survey in September of 1,358 Americans ages 13 to 17. More than half said they had viewed pornography of violent acts such as rape, choking or someone in pain. A majority said the pornography portrayed stereotypes of Black, Latino and Asian people. More than half said they felt guilty or ashamed after watching porn.
At the same time, 45% said the pornography provided helpful information about sex. LGBTQ teenagers, in particular, said it helped them discover more about their sexuality.
“We have to be careful about saying all porn is good or bad,” said Emily Rothman, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University. “There is nuance here.”
Schools, parents and political leaders have been at odds on how to handle the topic. David Miyashiro, superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area, said he had held tech and safety workshops and discussions for parents but had not directly addressed pornography in any of those sessions. The Middle Eastern refugee community and conservative Christians have expressed discomfort with the district conducting any sex education, he said.
The devices that students are issued to take home have filtering software, he said, that runs through district servers to block access to pornography sites and to alert school officials of searches for explicit and harmful content.
“Sexual health and sex ed are areas that are very family specific,” Miyashiro said. “A wide-sweeping policy or stance will sometimes isolate people and can create enemies or friends.”
Shelly Viramontez, superintendent of the Campbell Union School District near San Jose, California, said problems also arise with personal phones that children bring to school. Her district has conducted disciplinary action around sexualized behavior that she and counselors believe is linked to more exposure to pornography.
“This generation of parents are dealing with things that no other generation has had to deal with — the amount of access to information in the hands of kids,” Viramontez said.
In the Common Sense survey, teenagers said much of the content they saw was disturbing. Only 1 in 3 said the pornography included someone asking for consent before engaging in sexual activity. Fewer than half said they discussed pornography with a trusted adult. Of those who did, the conversation “encouraged them to think about ways to explore sex or sexuality other than porn,” according to the report.
Teenagers who intentionally sought pornography said their top sources were sites like PornHub and YouPorn. Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit and other social media sites ranked second as sources for pornography.
Instagram, Snap and TikTok ban sexually explicit material. But the sites have been used for promotions that link to pornography sites. They also bar individuals from directing users to pornography on other platforms.
In December, YouTube banned PornHub’s channel for repeatedly violating its policy that forbids links to websites that violate YouTube’s community guidelines, such as pornography. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has a similar ban on outside links and said its algorithms were designed to limit the spread of sexually explicit content.
A YouTube spokesperson said its policy was to “strictly prohibit the posting of explicit content, such as pornography, that is intended to be sexually gratifying on our platform.” Meta said Facebook and Instagram have controls that automatically make it harder for teenagers to search for and find sexually suggestive content.
TikTok said it doesn’t allow sexually suggestive content in its “For You” feeds and that it blocks inappropriate searches and hashtags. “We continue to invest in safe and age-appropriate experiences for teens through robust policies, parental controls and technology to counter this content at scale,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.
Reddit declined to comment on the report but said it did not have a strict ban on mature content. The app is geared more toward older users and has a suggested minimum age rating of 17. Users under the age of 17 who enter group discussions with mature content are barred from the app, according to the company’s policy.
Snap said it banned accounts that promoted sexually explicit content and was “constantly working to improve our efforts to combat it.” Content from creators and publishers is moderated before a large audience can view it, which reduces the spread and discovery of content that violates our policies, Snap said.
PornHub did not respond to a request for comment.
Teachers and parents said they couldn’t rely on the tech companies to block the content.
“You can’t blame the technology and not have these conversations with children,” Viramontez said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Czech Court Clears Ex-Prime Minister Of Fraud Days Before Presidential Vote: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Andrej Babis, a billionaire agriculturalist, had been accused of illegally obtaining farm subsidies for one of his properties.
A Czech court on Monday cleared Andrej Babis, the billionaire former prime minister of the Czech Republic who became a symbol of how the E.U. farm subsidy program enriched the well-connected and powerful, of fraud charges in a case regarding one of his properties.
The court on Monday cleared Mr. Babis of fraudulently obtaining E.U. subsidies for the property, citing lack of evidence, just days before the first round of a presidential election in the Czech Republic in which Mr. Babis is considered a front-runner.
"NOT GUILTY!" Mr. Babis said on Twitter on Monday. "I am very happy that we have an independent judiciary and the court has confirmed what I have argued from the beginning. That I am innocent and have done nothing illegal."
The case revolved around Mr. Babis's use of the E.U. farm subsidy program, a pot of money worth dozens of billions that is handed out every year.
A 2019 New York Times investigation found that politicians used the money to enrich themselves and their political patrons. That did not necessarily mean they broke the law. The investigation found that Mr. Babis's companies received $ 79 million in subsidies.
In the case resolved on Monday, Mr. Babis was accused of fraudulently transferring a company to his wife and children as a way of receiving subsidies.
The case is separate from an audit by the European Commission that found that as prime minister, Mr. Babis breached conflict of interest rules and influenced the allocation of E.U. subsidies to the business conglomerate he built. Mr. Babis has said that the audit was flawed.
For a decade, Mr. Babis was dogged by scandals related to Agrofert, the conglomerate he built out of companies in a range of sectors including food and agriculture. It is one of the country's largest employers.
The case resolved Monday involved a farm in the Czech Republic known as the Stork's Nest, which received about $ 2.2 million in E.U. subsidies after its ownership was transferred from Agrofert to Mr. Babis's wife and children.
The prosecutor had said that in 2007 and 2008 Mr. Babis removed the Stork's Nest from Agrofert to allow it to qualify for E.U. funding as a small- to medium-size business, and accused him of fraud. In 2018 the funds the company received were returned to the European Union.
The judge, Jan Sott, said on Monday that the prosecutor did not provide relevant evidence proving that Mr. Babis held shares of the Stork's Nest. He also said "it was not proved that the acts as described by the prosecutor were criminal." The decision can still be appealed.
In 2017, Mr. Babis placed his businesses into a trust amid accusations of conflicts of interest. The farm is now part of that trust, according to Agrofert's website.
Mr. Babis has also been accused of purchasing a villa and other properties on the French Riviera worth more than $ 20 million through offshore shell companies. According to French media, he is facing an investigation in France into money laundering. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Babis, who was the finance minister between 2014 and 2017 and prime minister between 2017 and 2021, had not entered politics when he bought the French properties.
In 2019, Czechs organized large demonstrations calling for Mr. Babis's resignation. In 2021, he was defeated in parliamentary elections.
In the presidential election set to take place on Friday and Saturday, Mr. Babis is running against Gen. Petr Pavel, a former NATO official, and Danuse Nerudova, a university professor and economist, both of whom are supported by the political coalition of Prime Minister Petr Fiala.
On Monday, Mr. Fiala said on Facebook that the court's verdict needed to be respected.
"The actual political fights in democracy take place during elections," he added. "Let's come to the polls and let's solve our future."

WASHINGTON — The internet has transformed pornography, making it much easier to view and share than in the days of Playboy magazine and late-night cable television.
For teenagers, that’s created a deluge of sexually explicit photos and videos that has invaded their everyday lives, according to a report released Tuesday.
Three-quarters of teenagers have viewed pornography online by the age of 17, with the average age of first exposure at age 12, according to the report by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit child advocacy group. Teenagers are seeing the photos and videos on their smartphones, on their school devices and across social media, pornography sites and streaming sites, it said.
The report underlined how ubiquitous pornography has become, with 41% of teenagers saying they had seen images of nudity or sexual acts online during the school day. Much of the exposure was by accident, with 58% saying they did not seek out the sexually explicit videos and photos, but had come across them while surfing the web, on social media, or through search engines or clicking ads.
Teenagers have increasingly grappled with the role of technology on their mental health and well-being. In recent years, lawmakers have criticized social media like Instagram for exacerbating eating disorders and scrutinized how the sites have been used to sell illegal substances such as drugs to adolescents.
The effect of online pornography on teenagers has been less examined, but parents and politicians have been locked in fierce debates over tech safety and whether discussions around pornography should take place in schools or at home. In the fall, sex education courses in Idaho were falsely portrayed in posts and an article as promoting pornography. Tweets linking to the false report provoked outrage online and were mentioned on Fox News. In Louisiana, a new law will require age verification for pornography sites.
“We can’t sweep this topic under the rug just because it’s uncomfortable to talk about,” said Jim Steyer, president of Common Sense Media, who plans to present the report this week to officials at the White House and at federal agencies. “Pornography is a huge part of the lives of children who have digital access like never before, and we need to have a national conversation about it.”
Part of the issue is that online pornography is a highly lucrative industry, giving it a firm foothold. While there is little data on the size of the online pornography industry, one estimate from Alec Helmy, founder of the trade publication XBIZ, which surveys payment processors, puts revenues for adult influencers and platforms at at least $15 billion in 2022. He estimated revenues from internet pornography in 2012 were $5 billion.
In recent years, online pornography has evolved into a business in which thousands of people have their own streaming, texting and photo channels that are promoted on sites like Instagram and hosted on platforms like OnlyFans and PornHub, Helmy said.
Common Sense’s report was based on a survey in September of 1,358 Americans ages 13 to 17. More than half said they had viewed pornography of violent acts such as rape, choking or someone in pain. A majority said the pornography portrayed stereotypes of Black, Latino and Asian people. More than half said they felt guilty or ashamed after watching porn.
At the same time, 45% said the pornography provided helpful information about sex. LGBTQ teenagers, in particular, said it helped them discover more about their sexuality.
“We have to be careful about saying all porn is good or bad,” said Emily Rothman, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University. “There is nuance here.”
Schools, parents and political leaders have been at odds on how to handle the topic. David Miyashiro, superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area, said he has held tech and safety workshops and discussions for parents but has not directly addressed pornography in any of those sessions. The Middle Eastern refugee community and conservative Christians have expressed discomfort with the district conducting any sex education, he said.
The devices students are issued to take home have filtering software, he said, that runs through district servers to block access to pornography sites and to alert school officials of searches for explicit and harmful content.
“Sexual health and sex ed are areas that are very family specific,” Miyashiro said. “A wide-sweeping policy or stance will sometimes isolate people and can create enemies or friends.”
Shelly Viramontez, superintendent of the Campbell Union School District in the San Jose, California, area, said problems also arise with personal phones that children bring to school. Her district has conducted disciplinary action around sexualized behavior that she and counselors believe is linked to more exposure to pornography.
“This generation of parents are dealing with things that no other generation has had to deal with — the amount of access to information in the hands of kids,” Viramontez said.
In the Common Sense survey, teens said much of the content they saw was disturbing. Only 1 in 3 said the pornography included someone asking for consent before engaging in sexual activity. Fewer than half said they discussed pornography with a trusted adult. Of those who did, the conversation “encouraged them to think about ways to explore sex or sexuality other than porn,” according to the report.
Teenagers who intentionally sought pornography said their top sources were sites like PornHub and YouPorn. Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit and other social media sites ranked second as sources for pornography.
Instagram, Snap and TikTok ban sexually explicit material. But the sites have been used for promotions that link to pornography sites. They also bar individuals from directing users to pornography on other platforms.
In December, YouTube banned PornHub’s channel for repeatedly violating its policy that forbids links to websites that violate YouTube’s community guidelines, such as pornography. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has a similar ban on outside links and said its algorithms are designed to limit the spread of sexually explicit content.
A YouTube spokesperson said its policy was to “strictly prohibit the posting of explicit content, such as pornography, that is intended to be sexually gratifying on our platform.” Meta said Facebook and Instagram have controls that automatically make it harder for teenagers to search for and find sexually suggestive content.
TikTok said it doesn’t allow sexually suggestive content in its “For You” feeds and that it blocks inappropriate searches and hashtags. “We continue to invest in safe and age-appropriate experiences for teens through robust policies, parental controls and technology to counter this content at scale,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.
Reddit declined to comment on the report but said it did not have a strict ban on mature content. The app is geared more toward older users and has a suggested minimum age rating of 17. Users under the age of 17 who enter group discussions with mature content are barred from the app, according to the company’s policy.
Snap said it banned accounts that promoted sexually explicit content and was “constantly working to improve our efforts to combat it.” Content from creators and publishers is moderated before a large audience can view it, which reduces the spread and discovery of content that violates our policies, Snap said.
PornHub did not respond to a request for comment. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Two snowmobilers who were in a recreational area near the town of Winter Park, Colorado, were buried by an avalanche and killed Saturday, local emergency responders said.
The body of a 58-year-old man from northern Colorado was recovered Saturday and pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Emergency responders could not continue looking for the second body Saturday because of weather and safety concerns, the sheriff’s office said.
Area residents, along with dog and helicopter rescue teams, helped in the weekend search.
Recovery efforts continued Sunday, and the body of a second man, 52, was found before 11 a.m. The sheriff’s office said that the avalanche was the second fatal one of the season in the county.
“Those recreating in our backcountry are encouraged to regularly monitor the conditions and follow the advice of our avalanche professionals,” Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said in a statement on Facebook.
The two snowmobilers, whose names had not been released by Sunday night, were riding in the area of Mount Epworth and Pumphouse Lake near the town of Winter Park, which is nearly 70 miles west of Denver. Official causes and manners of death will be released by the county coroner’s office, the sheriff’s office said.
Four people were caught in an avalanche in December, and two of them were buried in the snow. A 44-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other person was rescued by bystanders and family.
The avalanche danger was deemed “considerable” for the area Saturday, according to the forecast from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
“Any steep slope with smooth, bulbous pillows of snow above weak snow at the ground is suspect; a small avalanche can easily trigger a larger more deadly slide,” the information center said. “You may not see any signs of unstable snow like cracking or collapsing before you trigger an avalanche.”
The 2021-22 winter season registered 17 deaths caused by avalanches in Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, down from 37 in the previous season. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Nate Thayer, Bold Journalist Who Interviewed Pol Pot, Dies at 62: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The "mad genius" journalist scored an exclusive interview with the genocidal Cambodian leader and covered his show trial, another worldwide scoop.
Nate Thayer, a risk-taking, publicity-drawing journalist whose career was capped by an exclusive jungle interview in Cambodia with Pol Pot, the leader of one of the worst convulsions of mass killing of the last century, has died at his home in East Falmouth, Mass. He was 62.
His body was found on Tuesday, but it was not clear precisely when he had died, his brother, Robert Thayer, said. He said his brother had long struggled with multiple ailments.
Mr. Thayer interviewed Pol Pot in October 1997 after months of clandestine meetings with Khmer Rouge guerrillas, whom Pol Pot led. After crossing the border from Thailand, Mr. Thayer sat with him in a forest clearing, facing a broken man whose followers had turned against him as his movement collapsed into opposing factions.
During Pol Pot's four years in power, in the late 1970s, two million people -- as much as one-fourth Cambodia's population -- died of execution, torture, starvation or overwork as he attempted by force to create a pure, pre-modern Communist state.
In the interview he offered a bland defense of the carnage.
"I came to carry out the struggle, not to kill people," he told Mr. Thayer, who quoted him for an article published in the Far Eastern Economic Review, an Asian newsmagazine.
"Even now, and you can look at me, am I a savage person?" he asked in the interview, which was videotaped by David McKaige and Marc Laban, whom Mr. Thayer had hired. "My conscience is clear."
He added: "I only made decisions concerning the very important people. I didn't supervise the lower ranks."
Mr. Thayer had competition for the interview from Elizabeth Becker of The New York Times, but when she arrived at the border, he used his connections to block her entry and maintain his exclusive. She had conducted the last American interview with Pol Pot 18 years earlier, for The Washington Post, and had narrowly survived an attack by unidentified gunmen.
Mr. Thayer's interview was his second clandestine trip across the border. Earlier that year, his Khmer Rouge contacts had taken him to witness an outdoor show trial in which Pol Pot, the movement's founder, was denounced by comrades.
"'Crush! Crush! Crush Pol Pot and his clique!' shouted the crowd," Mr. Thayer reported. "There, slumped in a simple wooden chair, grasping a long bamboo cane and a rattan fan, an anguished old man, frail and struggling to maintain his dignity, was watching his vision crumble in utter defeat."
Just under six months later, in April 1998, an ailing Pol Pot died at 73.
The jungle meeting produced a minor drama of its own when Mr. Thayer gave Ted Koppel of the ABC News program "Nightline" the American broadcast rights to his video.
The network immediately distributed both still pictures and the video around the world with credit to ABC, which Mr. Thayer said violated their agreement and scooped his own article. ABC News said it had followed standard practice, paying him for the material, giving him credit but presenting it as its own.
He declined to share a Peabody award with the network and brought suit, winning an out-of-court settlement after years of litigation.
He also won a cluster of awards for his investigative reporting.
Mr. Thayer spent many months writing a book about the Khmer Rouge titled "Sympathy for the Devil: A Journalist's Memoir From Inside Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge," which offered vivid descriptions of the trial and interview. The book was advertised online, but for unclear reasons it was never published, and Mr. Thayer carried the manuscript with him for years afterward.
People who knew him described him as a courageous reporter who was determined to dig for truth while cultivating a rugged, Heart-of-Darkness image and sometimes exaggerating his exploits.
Writing on his Facebook page on Wednesday, Robert Brown, the founder and publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine, said: "Goodbye to one of the most colorful, gutsy, by some standards certifiable mad genius journalists I have ever encountered."
Calling him "a loner who hated being alone," Michael Hayes, founder and former publisher of the newspaper The Phnom Penh Post, said in an email:
"He was fearless, infuriatingly stubborn, uncompromising in his commitment to a free press, extremely generous to those people he loved, unbelievably disorganized in terms of managing even the simplest paperwork, and constantly wrestling unsuccessfully with a whole host of inner demons."
Nathaniel Talbott Thayer was born April 21, 1960, in Washington, the son of Harry E.T. Thayer, a career diplomat who served as ambassador to Singapore from 1980 to 1984, and Joan Pirie Leclerc. In addition to his brother, he is survived by his mother and his sisters, Marian Vito and Margaret P. Thayer.
Nate attended and was expelled from several private schools, Robert Thayer said, then attended the University of Massachusetts in Boston but did not graduate.
"I was a problem child," Mr. Thayer wrote in a Facebook post in August, "And honestly I have always been a problem adult. I don't do well with rules." He added: "Whenever someone tells me what to do, I do the opposite. Even when they are entirely right."
He headed to Southeast Asia in 1984, working for Soldier of Fortune before joining The Associated Press in Bangkok. There he focused on the continuing civil war in Cambodia in which Pol Pot's guerrillas were fighting the Vietnamese-backed government that had driven the Khmer Rouge from power.
Mr. Thayer moved to Cambodia in 1991 and joined the Far Eastern Economic Review (it ceased publication in 2009), for which he continued to cover the war and challenge the government with exposés of corruption.
One story he often recounted involved a foray into a conflict zone in Cambodia during which the truck he was riding in struck an anti-tank mine. He was wounded but survived because he was sitting in front on the gearbox, he said, while the soldiers on either side of him were killed.
In 1999, Mr. Thayer and the photographer Nic Dunlop were the first journalists to interview the fugitive Khmer Rouge prison commandant Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, a scoop that led to Duch's arrest and trial.
After Cambodia, still adventurous, Mr. Thayer traveled to several conflict zones, including Iraq, where he covered the American invasion in 2003.
Slowing down in recent years, Mr. Thayer turned to reporting online, writing analyses of American white supremacy movements and North Korean affairs. He subsisted in large part on the generosity of others, friends said. In his final decade he fell into alcohol and drug abuse and his health declined.
In recent months he recounted his deterioration in rambling postings on Facebook.
"I'm old and crippled now," he wrote in August. "Two strokes, two heart attacks, two bouts with Covid, sepsis infections which went viral and left me with heart and other damage."
He declined doctors' recommendations for treatment. Nearly 200 donors gave a total of $ 34,230 to a GoFundMe campaign late last year to support him.
During this time his companion, and subject of many Facebook posts, was his dog, Lamont, a black half Labrador, half Corgi, whom he called his best friend.

A Neighbor's Cold Cat: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A reader is visited daily by a cat that seems desperate to get out of the cold. The problem? It already has an owner, albeit a neglectful one.
Over the summer, a Bengal cat appeared on our back porch. (Bengals are an expensive breed of domestic cat that resemble tiny leopards.) It was meowing urgently and was much too thin. I could see its ribs. It had no identification, so I fed it a can of salmon because it wasn't clear whether anyone else was feeding it. After that, it started coming by regularly. One day, it stayed into the evening, so we kept it overnight. We were worried about foxes. The next day, the cat appeared wearing a tracking collar, and its owner soon followed. He told us he had another cat and a dog, but he didn't leave any contact information. Now it's winter -- and extremely cold -- and the cat comes every day (without its tracker). We shoo it away at night, but it clearly wants to stay here, napping under the radiator. What should we do? We love the cat, but we don't want to steal someone else's expensive pet. Still, we're not sure it has anywhere to go.
CAT MOM
What a bind! I understand your concern about the optics of pricey pet abduction, but I am more worried about keeping this cat safe. Even outdoor cats require warm, dry shelter when temperatures fall below freezing. (Breaking: It's cold outside!) You have no idea what happens to the cat after you shoo it out the door. And the failure of the owner to put a safe breakaway collar on it with contact information leaves you no humane choice but to keep it inside for now. (Other dangers: cars and predators.)
It's possible that the cat was implanted with a microchip with identification information on it. Check this out with a local vet or animal shelter. (Leave your name and number, too.) Of course, the owner tracked the cat to your home before. It wouldn't take the detective skills of a Hardy Boy to drop by your place again.
Now, on to the emotional component of your rescue operation: You've become attached to the cat. But remember you are only fostering it until you can assure its safety. (Easier said than done, I know, but it is also the price of protecting this animal.) If the owner shows up again, make sure the cat has easy access to shelter before you return it to him. And take his number this time!
When a Salute Feels Like a Slap
On a couple of occasions, clerks have helped me in stores, and at the end of our transactions, they put their hands together in prayer in front of their hearts and bow their heads. I feel this gesture is racist toward Asians. (I am Asian.) So far, I've bitten my tongue. What should I do?
K.T.
Blame yoga. Most of the yoga classes I've taken end with students sitting cross-legged with our hands in prayer as we bow our heads to the teacher and say "namaste" -- Sanskrit for "I bow to you." Now, plucking this gesture from a yoga studio, where classes often explore ancient Hindu traditions, and bringing it thoughtlessly to a retail space seems like cultural appropriation to me -- even without the spoken "namaste."
I'm sorry this happened. I doubt the clerks mean disrespect to you or South Asians. That's no reason to be quiet, though. If you feel comfortable speaking up, say: "You may not know this, but the namaste greeting is not just for yoga classes. South Asians use it even today, and people from that culture may find it hurtful or offensive for you to borrow it."
Too Few Cooks in the Kitchen
My mother-in-law loves cooking and thinks she's a fantastic cook. She dislikes restaurants and takeout. So, when we visit, which we do for a week at a time, we are forced to eat food she cooks at every meal. The problem: I find her cooking awful -- almost inedible! When we visit, I am always hungry and often feel sick and weak from lack of food. My husband agrees about her cooking, but he is terrified of hurting her. What can I do?
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
Color me unimpressed by your ingenuity. If you hate your mother-in-law's cooking, why not help her and make something you enjoy eating? Stop at the shops and buy some delicious cheeses and breads. Bring gifts of fancy nuts and olives. Just because you are staying with a parent doesn't mean you have to act like a child.
There's Out of the Loop, and Then There's This
What is the best way to handle a Christmas card that was addressed to me and included my son, but used the wrong surname for him? He was not adopted by my second husband. Also, my son is no longer alive! My niece obviously hasn't kept up with her family. Help!
LESLIE
My first thought here was to express concern that your niece's card might have triggered fresh grief. If that's the case, I am sorry. But honestly, you seem more interested in scolding your niece, focusing on her use of a wrong surname before even mentioning your son's death. Clearly, she hadn't heard the sad news. I don't regard that as her fault, though. If you want her to know, tell her.

A man is accused of entering an Arkansas church, smashing a hammer through the center of its altar and stealing two boxes containing 1,500-year-old relics.
Jerrid Farnam, 31, was arrested Thursday and faced likely charges of property theft, criminal mischief in the first degree, residential burglary, breaking or entering and public intoxication, the Logan County Sheriff’s Office said. The altar at Subiaco Abbey in Logan County, in northwestern Arkansas, was made of marble imported from Italy, officials said. Two brass-colored boxes inside it contained relics from saints “from over 1,500 years ago.”
On Thursday afternoon, guests of the church alerted officials that there was an apparently intoxicated man damaging artifacts. The abbey called the police, and a college-preparatory school connected to the church went into lockdown as officials investigated. Then, the abbey said, the man came back right after the police left. The police were called again, quickly returned and arrested him.
Farnam’s vehicle was found by the scene, with tools that had marble dust. One of the missing relic boxes was found in his truck and returned to the abbey.
The second box was found later and returned to the church, the sheriff’s office said in a statement posted to Facebook Friday.
“The altar itself had a very large hole in the middle of the slab that went all of the way through the altar, and the altar had large cracks and chips,” the sheriff’s office said. “This is an act of desecration to the altar.”
The abbey said the altar had been damaged with both a hammer and a “sledgehammer/axe.”
Farnam began to remove the cross from the top of the tabernacle after stealing the relic boxes, but the school said he was “interrupted” before damaging it.
Because of the “difficulty in estimating the cost of the items” and determining the appropriate penalty for desecrating an altar, the sheriff’s office said, Farnam’s charges could change. Farnam was being held at Logan County Detention Center, and his bond had not been set. It was unclear whether he had a lawyer.
Subiaco Abbey is a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery founded in 1878, and its origins trace back to Saint Benedict of Norcia, according to its website.
“Throughout this, our monks continued with our regularly communal prayers,” the abbey said. “Now that the gentleman has been caught and justice will proceed, may we also offer a prayer for him.”
The monks will use a portable altar until repairs are made, the abbey said. They will also undertake a prayer intended after desecration of a church. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Bill Miller
Through Jan. 14. dieFirma, 32A Cooper Square, Manhattan; 347-699-1440; diefirmanyc.com.
Once upon a time, linoleum floors conjured the gleaming promise of the modern century: vibrant and new, a marvel of science and convenience. By midcentury, it was de rigueur in American kitchens, synonymous with the country's postwar perception of itself: hard wearing, resilient, never to fade. The sheen, like much of the rest of the American dream proved to be held together by asbestos, has since worn off; Americans pulled up their linoleum floors and tossed them into the dustbin of decorative history.
The artist Bill Miller resuscitates that past, and its attendant ghosts, splicing found linoleum sheets into dense, nearly hallucinatory collages depicting the landscapes and modest domestic interiors of the postindustrial towns he's known. Miller doesn't manipulate the finishes, relying on the factory-made colors and often assaultive patterns for his palette, a self-imposed constriction that becomes expansive freedom. It proves to be a remarkably versatile medium, and an affecting one. Miller salvages much of his material from abandoned homes in and around Pittsburgh, where he lives, and whose collapsed steel industry both allows for and tints the work here.
The conceptual interest could quickly become stale, but Miller's choices avoid gimmickry. His dedication to his material reads as devotional and empathetic, portraying the lives of his blue-collar subjects through the very stuff with which they were furnished. His pictures have a haunted quality; marks of wear remain visible, traces of the linoleum's previous life still present, faded but not forgotten. MAX LAKIN
'El Corazón Aúlla'
Through Jan. 21. The 8th Floor, 17 West 17th Street, Manhattan; 646-839-5908, the8thfloor.org.
Performance art may not be as radical as it was in the 1970s, but the exhibition "El Corazón Aúlla" ("The Heart Howls") reaffirms what a potent vehicle it is for subversive expression. Curated by Alexis Heller and Tatiana Muñoz-Brenes, the show features 14 Latin American female and nonbinary artists calling attention to a crisis of gender-based violence: According to the Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean, at least 12 women per day were victims of femicide in the region in 2021. The artists take different approaches -- performing in public and private, alone or with others -- but are united by their unflinching vulnerability. They put their bodies on the line.
This includes Denise E. Reyes Amaya lying covered in garbage bags in the gutter of a San Salvador street in the video "Colored Bags for Trash" (2014); it's equally harrowing to watch passers-by ignore her and police officers poke her. In the video "Las Nobodies" (2011), the Mexican artist Nayla Altamirano walks meditatively along the border, collecting and donning bras left in the desert by the coyotes who sexually assaulted the women they were smuggling to the United States.
Some artists extend their vulnerability outward, like Elina Chauvet, who, in "My Hair for Your Name" (2014), cut off her locks and tied them with ribbons bearing the names of murdered women. Here, alongside those hanging locks and performance photos, the Mexican artist has set up a station where visitors are invited to do the same, pushing us to consider what we might be willing to risk or give up in sacrifice. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Anton van Dalen
Through Jan. 28. PPOW Gallery, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-647-1044, ppowgallery.com.
Anton van Dalen's training as a graphic artist is immediately apparent in his vivid prints and paintings, as well as his link to the East Village art scene in the 1980s, where graffiti, activist posters and wheat-pasted fliers ruled. The 47 pieces in "Doves: Where They Live and Work" surveys the oeuvre of the artist, who was born in the Netherlands in 1938 and moved to New York in 1966.
Van Dalen's style is mechanically surrealistic, recalling early-20th-century artists like Giorgio de Chirico and Francis Picabia, as well as '80s peers like Keith Haring and Mark Kostabi. Like these artists, his aesthetic world is simultaneously seductive and menacing. "The Horror Show of Science" (1981), a stark mural-size canvas, uses diagram-like images to show what science and technology have wrought, such as the atomic bomb and animal testing. Other paintings and drawings on lined notebook paper feature fighter planes, tanks ("war toys"), the effects of real estate development, the terror and isolation of the pandemic and how corporate giants like Coke, Amazon and Facebook have infiltrated our lives.
Birds also appear frequently here, serving, as the gallery release states, as emblems of "migration, freedom, peace, and community." Since 1971, van Dalen has also raised white pigeons that lived on the roof of his East Village building. It is a remarkable detail: The world is affected by upheavals and migrations, but van Dalen, his work and his activist approach have remained local, stable and consistent. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Activist Faces Prison for Removing Banksy Mural: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The mural, showing a woman in a bathrobe wearing a gas mask and holding a fire extinguisher, was one of seven artworks painted by Banksy on war-ravaged buildings in and around Kyiv.
An activist who removed a mural painted by the reclusive British street artist Banksy from a war-ravaged building in a Kyiv suburb could face up to a dozen years in prison for theft, the Ukrainian authorities said in a statement released on Facebook.
The mural, showing a woman in a bathrobe wearing a gas mask and holding a fire extinguisher, garnered widespread attention when it appeared in the Kyiv suburb of Hostomel in November. It was one of seven artworks painted by Banksy on war-ravaged buildings in and around Kyiv.
On Dec. 2, a group of activists removed the mural, the police said in a statement. The authorities arrested several people in connection with the removal.
The statement, put out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on Monday, said that the mural was valued at more than 9 million Ukrainian hryvnia, the national currency, or about $ 245,000. It said one activist, described as the organizer, could face up to 12 years in prison for removing the mural.
While the police did not identify the individual who could face jail time, one of the activists, Serhiy Dovhyi, had previously said that he was facing a criminal investigation for removing the work. Mr. Dovhyi said in an interview with The New York Times last month that he intended to auction it and donate the proceeds to the Ukrainian Army.
In the interview, he defended his actions, saying the artwork had to be saved because the wall on which it was painted was scheduled to be demolished. He described the act of removing the graffiti, which he documented in videos, as an additional act of performance art that might add to its value.
"Street art, in contrast to a piece of art in the Louvre, doesn't belong to anyone," Mr. Dovhyi told The Times.
The authorities, however, maintained that the mural should have remained on the wall, to be part of a future memorial or building.
It isn't the first time ownership of one of Banksy's works has been in dispute. In 2014, a Banksy painting appeared on a piece of plywood secured to the Broad Plain Boys Club in Bristol, England. The club's owner, Dennis Stinchcombe, planned to auction the painting to raise money for the club, but the city stepped in and claimed it owned the depiction of a couple embracing and staring at their cellphones. In a rare public move, Banksy wrote a letter saying the art should be used to help the club.

Jeremiah Green, 45, Modest Mouse Drummer: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Green was a founder of the group, an indie band that rose to mainstream success. He was also one of its most enduring members.
Jeremiah Green, a drummer who co-founded and then became a stalwart member of Modest Mouse, an indie rock band that rose to mainstream fame, died on Saturday in the small coastal city of Sequim, Wash. He was 45.
His mother, Carol Eckerich-Namatame, said the cause was cancer. She added that Mr. Green had been staying with his stepfather, Brian Namatame, while being treated for cancer at a nearby hospital.
Mr. Green created Modest Mouse with the lead singer and songwriter Isaac Brock, the bassist Eric Judy and the guitarist Dann Gallucci in Issaquah, Wash., outside Seattle, in the 1990s. They played atonal rock, with Mr. Brock singing in an angry falsetto. His lyrics took a brooding, introspective approach to suburban ennui, winning over the sensitive souls of the indie rock community.
But Modest Mouse transformed with the 2004 album "Good News for People Who Love Bad News," and went on to produce multiple hit songs, most notably "Float On," which was among the most popular rock tracks of the 2000s. The band's vocals and guitar lines became more melodic, and Mr. Green's drums drove a sound that listeners could dance to.
"Modest Mouse has built a career out of music that sounds like it's on the brink of falling apart, but importantly, it never collapses into the threatened hodgepodge," Stylus magazine wrote in 2007. "Jeremiah Green's drumming gathers the mess of howling vocals and scrabbling guitars and focuses it into something approaching pop music."
Jeremiah Martin Green was born on March 4, 1977, in Oahu, Hawaii, where his father, Donald, was stationed as a staff sergeant in the Army. His parents divorced when he was young, and he moved with his mother to Washington State. Ms. Eckerich-Namatame worked as an administrator at a trucking company and in the office of a produce wholesaler.
By the time he was 12 or 13 years old, Jeremiah knew he wanted to play punk rock. His mother found him a drum teacher, but Jeremiah found him uninspired and decided to teach the instrument to himself. He attended small rock shows on the Seattle music scene and studied the movements of the drummers he saw, he told Modern Drummer in 2015.
He graduated in 1995 from Best High School, an alternative school in Kirkland, Wash., that gave him time to pursue artistic projects. Modest Mouse's first studio album, "This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About," was released in 1996, shortly after Jeremiah turned 19.
Mr. Green was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and in 2004 he told Spin magazine about his attempts to find appropriate medication and about the difficulties he had communicating with bandmates. There were terrible fights, and Mr. Green briefly found himself in a mental hospital. But he wound up becoming one of Modest Mouse's most enduring members, alongside Mr. Brock.
In 2021, Modest Mouse released "The Golden Casket," its first album in six years. Last month, the radio disc jockey Marco Collins wrote on Facebook that Mr. Green had been forced to pull out of a tour marking the 25th anniversary of Modest Mouse's second studio album, "Lonesome Crowded West."
In 2017, Mr. Green married Lauren Engle. They had a son, Wilder. Mr. Green lived with his family in Port Townsend, Wash.
In addition to his mother, stepfather, wife and son, Mr. Green is survived by a brother, Adam; a half sister, Teri Dean; and a stepsister, Emiko VanWie.
In 2015, now a stable member of a world-famous rock band, Mr. Green looked back wistfully at his youth, when he was unknown and still an amateur on the drums.
"Sometimes, I feel like I was better when I was 18 and didn't know what I was doing," he told Modern Drummer. "I listen to some parts of those records, and they're kind of sloppy, but I think I was maybe more creative because it was all new to me."

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Simonetti, Isabella; Huang, Kalley

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The software company plans to cut around 8,000 jobs as business slows for tech companies. "We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn," Salesforce's chief executive said.
Salesforce, the business software giant, said on Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
"The environment remains challenging, and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions," Marc Benioff, the company's co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce's revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Mr. Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
"We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that," Mr. Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokeswoman said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry's slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry's largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13 percent of its employees in November and said its head count would remain "roughly flat" through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat's parent company, laid off 20 percent of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $ 44 billion in October, has slashed the company's work force by more than half.
Salesforce's sales grew 14 percent in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce's co-chief executive, announced that he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $ 27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city's tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $ 2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Mr. Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made "over the coming weeks," he wrote.
Salesforce's shares rose more than 3 percent in trading on Wednesday. The company's stock price fell nearly 50 percent last year.

Salesforce, the business software giant, said Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
“The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,” Marc Benioff, the company’s co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce’s revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
“We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that,” Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokesperson said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry’s slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry’s largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13% of its employees in November and said its head count would remain “roughly flat” through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, laid off 20% of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, has slashed the company’s workforce by more than half.
Salesforce’s sales grew by 14% in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, such as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce’s co-chief executive, announced he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city’s tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made “over the coming weeks,” he wrote.
Salesforce’s shares rose more than 3% in trading on Wednesday. The company’s stock price fell nearly 50% last year. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Twitter Will Relax Restrictions on Political Ads: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk's social media service said it would begin to permit cause-based advertising to "facilitate public conversation around important topics."
SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter said on Tuesday that it would begin relaxing its longstanding ban on political ads, allowing advocacy groups and elected officials to resume promotions focused on specific causes.
Twitter, which was acquired by Elon Musk in October, had banned some forms of political advertising in 2019. At the time, the company argued that political influence should be earned rather than bought, with politicians gaining audiences by drumming up genuine interest in what they had to say instead of using money to amplify their messages.
Mr. Musk has said one of his goals in taking over Twitter was to loosen its rules about the kinds of content that would be allowed on the platform. The billionaire's approach to content moderation has spooked major brands, some of which have paused their spending on Twitter to keep their ads from appearing alongside controversial tweets. That has caused Twitter's revenue to fall significantly.
Twitter said on Tuesday that it would begin to permit cause-based advertising, which allows marketers to promote content about political issues. The company said it would later expand other forms of political advertising. Under its previous management, Twitter allowed cause-based advertising with some restrictions, including one that prevented advertisers from using microtargeting to reach specific groups of people.
"We believe that cause-based advertising can facilitate public conversation around important topics," the company tweeted. "Moving forward, we will align our advertising policy with that of TV and other media outlets."
The move could open Twitter to more revenue as it tries to lure advertisers back to the platform. National elections are not scheduled in the United States this year.
Twitter's ban on political ads was at odds with policies at Facebook and other major social media companies, which allow elected officials and candidates to purchase ads. The 2019 decision was met with an outcry from conservatives and liberals, who argued that the restrictions would hamper political campaigns and unfairly block some advocacy organizations from spreading their messages.

A Lackluster Start for Markets in 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/lackluster-start-markets-2023/docview/2760400465/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks gave up an early gain and ended lower Tuesday, a lackluster first trading day of 2023 for Wall Street just days after it closed the books on its worst year since 2008.
The S&P 500 shed a 1 percent gain and finished 0.4 percent lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.8 percent. Small-company stocks also lost ground, pulling the Russell 2000 index 0.6 percent lower.
Technology stocks were among the biggest weights on the market. Apple fell 3.7 percent, leaving its market value below $ 2 trillion for the first time since March 8, 2021. Shares in the iPhone maker fell nearly 27 percent in 2022, their first annual decline in four years amid a broad slide in technology sector stocks.
Long-term bond yields fell significantly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, fell to 3.77 percent from 3.88 percent late Friday.
Investors are opening 2023 with the same concerns that weighed on them in 2022, leading the benchmark S&P 500 to plunge nearly 20 percent for the year, just its third annual decline since the financial crisis 14 years ago.
Inflation is easing, but remains hot, which has prompted the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates to slow economic growth. That has left Wall Street bracing for the recession and higher unemployment that could result from those policies.
The Fed will release minutes from its December policy meeting on Wednesday, potentially giving investors more insight into its decision-making process and thoughts heading into 2023. The central bank's next policy decision on interest rates is set for Feb. 1.
The Fed's key lending rate stands at a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent after rocketing from a range of 0 to 0.25 percent at the beginning of 2022. The U.S. central bank forecasts that it will reach a range of 5 to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023, and it currently doesn't call for a rate cut before 2024.
Investors are also looking ahead this week to several updates on the employment market, which has been a strong area of the broader economy. That has helped buffer the economy from a recession, analysts have said, but it also makes the Fed's fight against inflation more difficult and raises that risk that it could go too far and bring on a recession.
The government will release a report Wednesday on job openings for November, followed by a weekly report on unemployment on Thursday. The broader and closely watched monthly report on employment, for December, will be released on Friday.
"If we get a weak report, that would be a boost to the market because it might imply that the Fed will ease back a bit on the rate hikes," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
Wall Street is also waiting on the latest round of corporate earnings reports, which will start flowing heavily around the middle of January. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings for companies in the S&P 500 to broadly slip during the fourth quarter and remain flat for the first half of 2023.
Energy stocks also weighed on the market Tuesday as U.S. oil prices settled 4.1 percent lower. Hess fell 5.1 percent.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3.7 percent to lead a rally in communications services stocks. Gains in big banks and other financial stocks also helped keep the market's losses in check. Wells Fargo rose 1.2 percent.
Tesla plunged 12.2 percent for the biggest decline among S&P 500 stocks after the electric vehicle maker's 2022 sales disappointed investors.
Gold producer Newmont rose 5 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P 500, as prices for the precious metal rose.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 15.36 points to 3,824.14. The Dow slipped 10.88 points to 33,136.37. The Nasdaq slid 79.50 points to 10,386.98. The Russell 2000 fell 10.51 points to 1,750.73.

What Kids Paint In the Midst of War: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An artist from Lviv has brought works by young people affected by the Russian invasion to a museum in Chicago's Ukrainian enclave.
CHICAGO -- On the walls of a modern art museum in Ukrainian Village, a neighborhood and cultural enclave here, hangs a drawing of the fall of Mariupol, one of the bloodiest battles of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Against a bright orange sky, smoke drawn with a felt-tip pen billows from crumbling buildings as Russian planes fly overhead.
The artist? A 9-year-old boy named Roman.
In the same gallery hangs a painting of a blue-green tank by Ilya, 7. Beneath it, an armed Ukrainian soldier that Taras, 10, drew with oil pastels stands guard against a star-filled sky.
The works are part of an exhibition by the children of Ukraine, many of them displaced by the war and invited to paint at hospitals, orphanages and art studios in Lviv, a city in the country's west that has served as refuge from attacks in the east.
Among the pieces packed into two suitcases and flown to Chicago were finger paintings by toddlers and intricate drawings by teenage art students. They now fill a gallery at the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, which was founded in 1971 and has a permanent collection with works by Alexander Archipenko, Jules Olitski and Patrick Caulfield.
Last month, an exhibition on abstraction came down, and works by artists like Roman, Ilya and Taras went up.
"Their sense of artistic expression is what every adult wishes they had," Christina Wyshnytzky, an assistant curator at the museum, said as she walked through the gallery on a recent afternoon.
The work began being created in the early days of the war, through art classes held by Nataliia Pavliuk, 45, an artist who teaches painting at Lviv Polytechnic National University, and her daughter, Yustyna Pavliuk, 21, an architecture and design student there.
"We started thinking about what we can do to help Ukraine win," Nataliia Pavliuk said in Ukrainian, with her daughter as an interpreter. "A lot of people need attention and art therapy, and we know we are good at that."
The Pavliuks have visited hospitals, orphanages and modular homes set up for displaced families with a supply of paints, pastels and paper. Many children chose to depict images of war -- tanks, soldiers, planes -- but those who had experienced the most severe trauma tended to focus on lighter images, they said.
At a children's hospital in Lviv, an 8-year-old girl from eastern Ukraine named Mariia drew an orange-striped cat sitting atop a kitchen table, Yustyna Pavliuk recalled. When Mariia was asked if she had siblings, she said her sister was killed when a bus she was riding in from Kyiv, the capital, came under fire.
In a free class at an art gallery in Lviv, a 10-year-old girl named Veronika painted herself wearing a pink-and-orange dress, standing next to a friend, the Pavliuks said. Behind the figures, Veronika painted a home that she imagined could house all of her friends who had died in the war. She had lost a finger and vision in one eye during Russian shelling, they said. Her family was killed.
"It's hard not to start crying when you work with them," Yustyna Pavliuk said, "but they continue living."
At the art museum in Chicago, the war became central to its work.
Situated next to a Ukrainian bank and across the street from an ornate Ukrainian church, the museum opened one of its galleries to anyone who wanted to make art about the war. It also became a kind of resource center for people looking to help the war effort and refugees who had settled in the area, said Adrienne Kochman, the museum's curator.
The Pavliuks had posted about their work on Facebook, drawing the attention of Marta Farion, a museum board member and a distant relation of the family. She helped them obtain a grant and arrange a trip to the United States, where they are also exhibiting children's work in Ann Arbor, Mich., and an arts academy in Arkansas.
Many of the works in the Chicago exhibition, titled "Children of War," are for sale, with the proceeds going toward continuing their work in Ukraine, the Pavliuks said. It will be up until Feb. 12.
"To some, it's just 'scribbles,"' Nataliia Pavliuk wrote in Ukrainian in a post on Facebook. "To us, these are the most sincere and finest works of art."
Wyshnytzky, the assistant curator, likes to examine the works as she would in an art history class.
A painting of what appears to be a collection of flowers by a 4-year-old girl from Popasna reminds Wyshnytzky of an Ernst Ludwig Kirchner work hanging at the Museum of Modern Art. She also remarked on the "van Gogh-esque" style of a child's still life of sunflowers -- Ukraine's national flower and a symbol of solidarity with the country.
"They're elevated because they're in a museum setting, and I feel like it's a disservice to talk about art in any other way," she said, adding, with a laugh, "You see abstract works like this going at Sotheby's for millions."
The exhibition includes works from clients of Nataliia Pavliuk's art studio in Lviv as well as those who have participated in free lessons at the social services centers.
At the studio, Anna, 10, painted the ghost of a Ukrainian soldier, standing in a field with a blue-and-yellow flag. Glib, 12, the child of a soldier, painted his family withstanding a Russian missile attack.
A 15-year-old art student at the studio, Yaryna Kupybida, said she was drawn to a viral photograph of a pregnant woman who was forced to flee a maternity hospital in Mariupol because of a Russian airstrike. The woman was pictured wrapped in a duvet, with a bloodied face.
Yaryna, who lives in a town outside of Lviv and saw the photo online, painted the woman carrying her newborn baby wrapped in a blanket. "It was hope, for me, that there is a future for this woman," she said.
A couple of days after the attack, The Associated Press reported that the woman's baby had been delivered successfully.

New Options in a Quiet Brooklyn Neighborhood: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New options in the quiet Brooklyn neighborhood are worth checking out.
A few months back I ran into a former co-worker and his partner, and I asked him that age-old question: "What neighborhood do you live in again?" His response: "Well, we're a long-term couple in our mid-30s, so Park Slope."
Park Slope's reputation as one of Brooklyn's premier social retirement communities persists for a reason: It's tree-lined, rich in strollers and almost suburban, and though the neighborhood has long been home to some fantastic restaurants -- Al di la Trattoria, Haenyeo, Miriam, Fonda -- new dining options don't tend to open there as frequently as they do in, say, the East Village or Crown Heights. But little by little, that is changing.
Four Courses for a Bargain
I'd say a transformation began with the cafe and bakery Winner, which opened in March 2020 and quickly became what Pete Wells called his "ideal pandemic restaurant" for serving an ideal pandemic meal: the rotisserie chicken "brushed with smoked honey and rounded out with a pound or so of roasted potatoes, some braised kale and a noticeably fresh sourdough baguette."
Much has been said about that rotisserie chicken, but not so much about Winner's sister restaurant Runner Up, where the menu, which takes some inspiration from fine dining, changes week to week. That means crudos, potato croquettes with trout roe and a strong wine list, but nothing too fancy. A recent change: Through March, the 12-seat restaurant is serving a $ 60, four-course prix-fixe dinner at the bar, which is pretty affordable as far as prix-fixe meals in this city go. That's perfect for a night when you've got a sitter -- or just want a really nice meal.
An Important Restaurant Group Arrives
Another sure sign that your neighborhood's dining reputation might be changing: a major restaurant group setting up shop. Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya's Unapologetic Foods is best known for its popular restaurants in Manhattan, including Semma and Dhamaka. Park Slope has the distinction of being the first Brooklyn neighborhood with a restaurant from the group. The focus at Masalawala & Sons is East Indian home cooking, specifically that of the seaside city Kolkata. (Mr. Mazumdar's father, Satyen, who grew up there, is the restaurant's manager and the older gentleman shown on its menu.)
Like its predecessors, Masalawala & Sons is nearly impossible to get into (though the patio is reserved for walk-ins) but if you manage to snag a table inside, expect seafood like tiger prawns served in a coconut, and biyebarir, fish fried in a rich, buttery batter and smothered in cilantro and chile. (You'll find lamb, chicken and some vegan and vegetarian options as well.) There's also a small Indian grocery in the restaurant if you're looking to do some shopping.
When You Can't Get Into the Hot New Spot
There are other newcomers of note if you can't get into Masalawala & Sons. Alma Negra, on Fourth Avenue, is serving Mexican food in a style not unlike that at nearby Claro. Lore, a fusion-leaning restaurant on Seventh Avenue with dishes like lamb meatballs with aji amarillo and sea bream ssam, also looks promising.
And then there's Bangkok Degree, a spinoff of the beloved Thai restaurant Dek Sen in Elmhurst, Queens (unfortunately now closed). Located down the street from the Park Slope Food Coop, Bangkok Degree has favorites like massaman curry (one version includes some very nontraditional prime rib), pad Thai and drunken noodles available for lunch and dinner. But it's the "traditional grandma dishes" section of the menu that shines. What do Thai grandmothers enjoy? Pork belly with ginger and peanuts, egg noodles in curry chicken broth and a classic tom yum soup, of course. Not such a bad way to spend one's social retirement, right?
In Other News ...
Ignacio Mattos's newest restaurant, Corner Bar, isn't particularly original, writes Pete Wells. But the classics at the chef and restaurateur's bistro inside the boutique hotel Nine Orchard are "virtually flawless."
Openings: Two Staten Island brothers bring Mediterranean flavors to Midtown Manhattan with White Olive; gluten-free and vegan barbecue comes to the Barclays Center by way of Pure Grit BBQ; and another dining option, Essex Pearl, is available to Midnight Theater patrons in the Manhattan West complex.
The Mexican restaurant El Cholo, a Los Angeles mainstay for celebrities and students, turns 100 this year. Its longevity is a testament to the loyal staff and the family behind the its traditions and flavors, writes Kevin McKenna.

CHICAGO — On the walls of a modern art museum in Ukrainian Village, a neighborhood and cultural enclave here, hangs a drawing of the fall of Mariupol, one of the bloodiest battles of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Against a bright orange sky, smoke drawn with a felt-tip pen billows from crumbling buildings as Russian planes fly overhead.
The artist? A 9-year-old boy named Roman.
In the same gallery hangs a painting of a blue-green tank by Ilya, 7. Beneath it, an armed Ukrainian soldier that Taras, 10, drew with oil pastels stands guard against a star-filled sky.
The works are part of an exhibition by the children of Ukraine, many of them displaced by the war and invited to paint at hospitals, orphanages and art studios in Lviv, a city in the country’s west that has served as refuge from attacks in the east.
Among the pieces packed into two suitcases and flown to Chicago were finger paintings by toddlers and intricate drawings by teenage art students. They now fill a gallery at the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, which was founded in 1971 and has a permanent collection with works by Alexander Archipenko, Jules Olitski and Patrick Caulfield.
Last month, an exhibition on abstraction came down, and works by artists like Roman, Ilya and Taras went up.
“Their sense of artistic expression is what every adult wishes they had,” Christina Wyshnytzky, an assistant curator at the museum, said as she walked through the gallery on a recent afternoon.
The work began being created in the early days of the war, through art classes held by Nataliia Pavliuk, 45, an artist who teaches painting at Lviv Polytechnic National University, and her daughter, Yustyna Pavliuk, 21, an architecture and design student there.
“We started thinking about what we can do to help Ukraine win,” Nataliia Pavliuk said in Ukrainian, with her daughter as an interpreter. “A lot of people need attention and art therapy, and we know we are good at that.”
The Pavliuks have visited hospitals, orphanages and modular homes set up for displaced families with a supply of paints, pastels and paper. Many children chose to depict images of war — tanks, soldiers, planes — but those who had experienced the most severe trauma tended to focus on lighter images, they said.
At a children’s hospital in Lviv, an 8-year-old girl from eastern Ukraine named Mariia drew an orange-striped cat sitting atop a kitchen table, Yustyna Pavliuk recalled. When Mariia was asked if she had siblings, she said her sister was killed when a bus she was riding in from Kyiv, the capital, came under fire.
In a free class at an art gallery in Lviv, a 10-year-old girl named Veronika painted herself wearing a pink-and-orange dress, standing next to a friend, the Pavliuks said. Behind the figures, Veronika painted a home that she imagined could house all of her friends who had died in the war. She had lost a finger and vision in one eye during Russian shelling, they said. Her family was killed.
“It’s hard not to start crying when you work with them,” Yustyna Pavliuk said, “but they continue living.”
At the art museum in Chicago, the war became central to its work.
Situated next to a Ukrainian bank and across the street from an ornate Ukrainian church, the museum opened one of its galleries to anyone who wanted to make art about the war. It also became a kind of resource center for people looking to help the war effort and refugees who had settled in the area, said Adrienne Kochman, the museum’s curator.
The Pavliuks had posted about their work on Facebook, drawing the attention of Marta Farion, a museum board member and a distant relation of the family. She helped them obtain a grant and arrange a trip to the United States, where they are also exhibiting children’s work in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and an arts academy in Arkansas.
Many of the works in the Chicago exhibition, titled “Children of War,” are for sale, with the proceeds going toward continuing their work in Ukraine, the Pavliuks said. It will be up until Feb. 12.
“To some, it’s just ‘scribbles,’” Nataliia Pavliuk wrote in Ukrainian in a post on Facebook. “To us, these are the most sincere and finest works of art.”
Wyshnytzky likes to examine the works as she would in an art history class.
A painting of what appears to be a collection of flowers by a 4-year-old girl from Popasna reminds Wyshnytzky of an Ernst Ludwig Kirchner work hanging at the Museum of Modern Art. She also remarked on the “van Gogh-esque” style of a child’s still life of sunflowers — Ukraine’s national flower and a symbol of solidarity with the country.
“They’re elevated because they’re in a museum setting, and I feel like it’s a disservice to talk about art in any other way,” she said, adding, with a laugh, “You see abstract works like this going at Sotheby’s for millions.”
The exhibition includes works from clients of Nataliia Pavliuk’s art studio in Lviv as well as those who have participated in free lessons at the social services centers.
At the studio, Anna, 10, painted the ghost of a Ukrainian soldier, standing in a field with a blue-and-yellow flag. Glib, 12, the child of a soldier, painted his family withstanding a Russian missile attack.
A 15-year-old art student at the studio, Yaryna Kupybida, said she was drawn to a viral photograph of a pregnant woman who was forced to flee a maternity hospital in Mariupol because of a Russian airstrike. The woman was pictured wrapped in a duvet, with a bloodied face.
Yaryna, who lives in a town outside of Lviv and saw the photo online, painted the woman carrying her newborn baby wrapped in a blanket. “It was hope, for me, that there is a future for this woman,” she said.
A couple of days after the attack, The Associated Press reported that the woman’s baby had been delivered successfully. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A remote archipelago and national park off the coast of Key West, Florida, was closed Monday after a group of about 300 migrants arrived by boat on the islands’ shores, park officials said.
The cluster of mostly uninhabited islands, known as the Dry Tortugas National Park, is about 100 miles north of Havana and is known for its crystalline waters and coral reefs. But over the past few days, the islands have become a different kind of refuge.
In addition to the 300 migrants who arrived on the archipelago, more than 160 other migrants have arrived in other parts of the Florida Keys over the past several days, according to the local and federal authorities. Officials did not specify countries of origin but said in a statement that the park and region had recently “seen an increase in people arriving by boat from Cuba.”
The influx of migrants began around New Year’s Eve, authorities said, and come amid a surge in seaborne migration. In the one-year period ending in September, the U. S. Coast Guard apprehended more than 6,000 Cubans, compared with close to 840 migrants the previous year, the authority said in a recent statement.
The archipelago temporarily closed starting at 8 a.m. Monday, so that authorities and medical workers could evaluate, care for and transport the migrants to Key West, park officials said. The park’s own responders would provide food, water and basic medical attention to the migrants until the arrival of the Department of Homeland Security, they added.
“The effort now is to try to get them transferred off the island via boat to mainland Key West and the Florida Keys, so they can then be transferred to federal law enforcement agents,” Lt. Cmdr. John Beal, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard’s 7th District, said of the migrants.
“They’re uninhabited remote islands that don’t have the infrastructure to support them,” he said, adding that local, state and federal authorities were coordinating to get food and water to the archipelago, which is usually staffed by just a few rangers.
Federal authorities said the migrants would be removed from the islands and processed to determine their legal status to remain in the United States or to be repatriated to their country of origin.
The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, which oversees the Florida Keys and its islands, described the influx of migrants over the weekend as a “mass migration crisis.” The office accused federal authorities, who in some cases were expected to arrive only the next day, of a sluggish response. “This federal failure is creating a humanitarian crisis,” the sheriff’s department said in a statement posted to Facebook on Monday.
The park was expected to be closed for several days, officials said, an action that they said was “necessary for the safety of visitors and staff because of the resources and space needed to attend to the migrants.”
Park officials said that all closures would “remain in place until further notice” and that during that time all ferries and seaplanes would be suspended. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

'I Am Ultra-MAGA': Invention of Elise Stefanik: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elise Stefanik had had enough.
In the wake of the 2018 midterms, the young congresswoman was sick of commuting to Washington from upstate New York and weary of dialing for campaign dollars. She was demoralized that Republican primary voters had spurned so many of the women she had helped persuade to run for Congress. She was annoyed that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist who had displaced her that fall as the youngest woman ever elected to the House, had not shown her the respect she felt was her due.
But it was bigger than that. For years, Ms. Stefanik had crafted her brand as a model moderate millennial -- "the future of hopeful, aspirational politics in America," as her mentor, Paul Ryan, would describe her in Time magazine. But as her third term unfolded, according to current or former friends and advisers, it was becoming painfully clear that she was the future of a Republican Party that no longer existed. The party was now firmly controlled by Donald J. Trump, a populist president she didn't like or respect -- a "whack job," as she once described him in a message obtained by The New York Times. Fox hosts attacked her for not supporting Mr. Trump enough. Her friends criticized her for not opposing him more forcefully. You don't understand, she would tell them. You don't get how hard this is. Democrats were back in charge in the House. Mr. Ryan was gone, driven into early retirement. She told friends she was thinking of joining him.
Instead she embarked on one of the most brazen political transformations of the Trump era. With breathtaking speed and alacrity, Ms. Stefanik remade herself into a fervent Trump apologist, adopted his over-torqued style on Twitter and embraced the conspiracy theories that animate his base, amplifying debunked allegations of dead voters casting ballots in Atlanta and unspecified "irregularities" involving voting-machine software in 2020 swing states. The future of hopeful, aspirational politics in America now assails Democrats as "the party of Socialists, illegals, criminals, Communist Truth Ministers & media stenographers." In the process, she has rocketed from the backbench to the party's No. 3 House leadership job, presiding over the conference's overall messaging.
Ms. Stefanik's reinvention has made her a case study in the collapse of the old Republican establishment and its willing absorption into the new, Trump-dominated one. But as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in the coming days, her climb to MAGA stardom may also be a cautionary tale. Mr. Trump's obsession with litigating his own defeat has left him at once the party's most potent force and its greatest liability, blamed by many Republicans for their failure to win the Senate in November and for a House majority that, some fear, may be too narrow to govern effectively. Republican politicians and voters are now agonizing anew over the price of their alliance with Mr. Trump. "It's crystal, crystal, crystal clear," Mr. Ryan told SiriusXM. "We lose with Trump if we stick with Trump. If we dump Trump, we start winning."
For her part, Ms. Stefanik has only doubled down, betting that her alliance with Mr. Trump will carry her further still -- to a job in his cabinet, perhaps, or even a slot as his running mate in 2024. In November, even before Mr. Trump made his bid for re-election official, she became one of the few senior Republicans to endorse him. "Republican voters determine who is the leader of the Republican Party, and it's very clear President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party," she said, putting her loyalty on display in the way that Mr. Trump prizes.
That loyalty has already exacted a steep cost. Within the old-line Republican circles that spent years grooming Ms. Stefanik for a different kind of stardom, charting her turn toward Mr. Trump has become a kind of morose parlor game. Mr. Ryan has told associates he now considers her the biggest disappointment of his political career. One by one, many of her oldest and closest friends have stopped speaking to Ms. Stefanik, leaving a trail of embittered final texts and emails. Over dinners and group chats, they sometimes talk about what happened to the talented woman they once loved and respected. What really made her abandon her old political self? What had they missed?
Ms. Stefanik insists they missed nothing at all. She declined to be interviewed by The Times. But in a statement responding to questions for this article, Alex deGrasse, executive director of her political operation, denied she had ever considered quitting Congress and repeatedly rejected criticism of her as sexist. Mr. deGrasse denounced "anonymous sources who are clearly viciously Anti-Trump, Anti-Elise, and Anti-Republican," who "clearly hate the American people who support Trump." As criticism of her has mounted from former friends and allies, Ms. Stefanik has argued that in embracing Mr. Trump, she is merely serving her older, predominantly white and rural constituency, as she has since first being elected. "I'm the same member of Congress that I've always been," she said after her breakout performance defending Mr. Trump during his first impeachment.
In an important sense, Ms. Stefanik is right. Virtually no one who knows her believes she has any genuine attachment to Trump-style populism -- unlike Mr. Trump's earliest supporters, for example, or media figures like the Fox host Tucker Carlson. Indeed, over dozens of interviews, former aides, advisers and friends going back to Ms. Stefanik's Harvard days struggled to identify any of her deeply held political beliefs at all. Most recalled, instead, her generic loyalty to the Republican Party, her intense competitiveness and her unerring ability to absorb what she thought people around her wanted and to reflect it back at them. Eager to advance, skilled at impressing more powerful figures with her intelligence and work ethic, she has spent years embedding herself wherever the action seems to be at the time. "She knows exactly what she's signed up for," said Kate Yearwood Young, a former friend from Harvard. "There was no radicalization."
'I Am Ultra-MAGA'
One day this past October, Ms. Stefanik stood in front of a dozen gigantic bins of bovine teat cleanser, decrying the war on chocolate milk to a nodding crowd of farmers. Months earlier, New York City's quirkily centrist mayor, Eric Adams, had floated the idea of banning chocolate milk from city schools, then quickly abandoned the idea amid bipartisan criticism. Now, in the closing weeks of the campaign, Ms. Stefanik had come to the Mohawk Valley village of Fultonville, seizing a chance to simultaneously defend local businesses and stoke her constituents' age-old suspicions of big-city liberals. "We are seeing really bad ideas from the progressive left," she warned, adding, "I've been proud to be the leader standing up for chocolate milk."
Like Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik, who is 38, does not merely advocate policies; she casts herself as a warrior against the leftist forces scheming to take away the things that make America great. She speaks MAGA fluently but with a touch of a foreign accent. "No matter what the Far Left says, #NY21 will ALWAYS stand for, salute and honor our flag," she tweeted in 2021, referring to her district. "Check out these beautiful American flags in the North Country!" Like any convert, she makes up in zeal what she lacks in pedigree. When a reporter asked her last May about the new "Ultra-MAGA" label President Biden had begun affixing to her party, she responded almost too eagerly. "I am Ultra-Maga," she said in a tone of utter seriousness. "I'm proud of it."
Ms. Stefanik writes her own tweets and is effectively her own campaign manager -- the first and often last word on messaging, scheduling and strategy. "She was always the smartest strategic mind in the room," said Anthony Pileggi, who worked on her first two campaigns. Somewhat unusually for a high-ranking lawmaker, she personally approves every piece of campaign direct mail, weighing in on the design, photos and creative content and sometimes writing the copy herself. Routine statements from her office or campaign often appear first on Breitbart, the alt-right Bible, which hypes them as "exclusives."
Since throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik has endorsed politicians like Sandy Smith, an unsuccessful House candidate in North Carolina who called for the arrest and execution of those responsible for the "fraud" of Mr. Trump's defeat. In May, she hosted a fund-raiser for George Santos, a pro-Trump Republican recently elected to a district in Queens and Long Island, who fabricated vast swaths of his résumé and biography. (A picture of the two still adorns Mr. Santos's Twitter profile.) The same month, Ms. Stefanik attacked "the White House, House Dems, & usual pedo grifters" for failing to address the nationwide infant-formula shortage, a seeming allusion to the QAnon mythos. In 2021, as a surge of Haitian migrants sought to cross the border into Texas, she ran a series of Facebook ads warning that Mr. Biden would "grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants" to "overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington." The ads echoed a racist conspiracy theory, heavily promoted by Mr. Carlson, about a supposed Democratic plot to replace the native-born electorate with illegal immigrants.
In New York, Ms. Stefanik has allied herself firmly with the Republican Party's clamorous Trump wing. Two weeks after a young white man killed 10 people at a supermarket this past May in a largely Black neighborhood in Buffalo, accusing his victims of seeking to "ethnically replace my own people," Ms. Stefanik endorsed Carl Paladino, a developer and Trump friend running for Congress, who had suggested online that the massacre might have been a false-flag operation meant to help Democrats "revoke the 2nd amendment." (Within days of Ms. Stefanik's endorsement, audio surfaced of Mr. Paladino praising Adolf Hitler as "the kind of leader we need today." The congresswoman told HuffPost that his comment had been taken out of context.)
Last January, she joined the New York Young Republican Club, a longtime redoubt of Rockefeller Republicanism recently taken over by MAGA enthusiasts. In May, the club announced a partnership with the youth wing of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, proclaiming a shared interest in "ending illegal immigration undertaken with the interest of eradicating the traditional people of a land." Guests at the club's annual holiday banquet in December included Peter Brimelow, founder of the nativist website VDare, and Jack Posobiec, a far-right commentator known for promoting the "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory. The club's president, Gavin Wax, views Ms. Stefanik's trajectory as almost inevitable. "She's really transformed," he said in an interview. "There's no point in being a moderate Republican in New York anymore."
From Harvard to the Hill
Like the Ivy-educated Republican senator Josh Hawley or Florida governor Ron DeSantis, Ms. Stefanik has succeeded in the Trump era in part by turning on the kind of people and institutions that made her.
The daughter of a prosperous Albany-area plywood distributor, she arrived at Harvard a year after the Sept. 11 attacks and immediately got involved with the university's Institute of Politics. At the institute's glass-and-brick building near the Charles River, a college freshman might brush elbows with a visiting senator, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, even a former president. "We all wanted to be around power, and we all had to decide what we were going to do with that access," said Naomi Ages, a Harvard contemporary who went on to a career in environmental law.
The institute tried, with mixed success, to weld the students' natural ambition to some notion of the public good. Ms. Stefanik fell in easily with a mostly left-leaning crowd. Four people who knew her at the time said she identified as a supporter of abortion and gay rights, though another college friend, Daniel Dunay, said in an email that "she was pro-life then, just like she is now." Friends recalled her zipping around Cambridge in a sporty BMW, an earnest and fun-loving young woman with an endearingly goofy side. "She was sort of fascinated by the glamour of politics," said Clarke Tucker, now a Democratic state lawmaker in Arkansas. "A lot of people with the I.O.P., myself included, are sort of nerds with a reverence for American institutions. I would have said the same about her, which is the most heartbreaking part of this." He added: "She was running for something from the second she got there."
A few weeks into her freshman year, she was picked to help run a weekly study group for a seminar led by Ted Sorensen, the former Kennedy speechwriter and confidant. "After that, I was hooked," she later told a Harvard newsletter. No other institution in the world, she exulted, could match the institute "in terms of exposure and having a seat at the table."
As a rising junior, she set out to run for the institute's student presidency. Institute elections were hotly contested -- Pete Buttigieg was famous in their circle for his surprise victory two years earlier -- but not particularly ideological. Ms. Stefanik and a friend named David Kaden, the polished son of a politically connected New York lawyer, decided to run together. Ms. Stefanik believed she should be at the top of the ticket, but in the end grudgingly agreed to be Mr. Kaden's vice president, a concession that left her bitter years later. Adopting a quasi-populist platform -- giving all students, not just those in leadership, keys to the I.O.P. student office -- they won overwhelmingly. Later, a friend and Harvard alumna introduced Ms. Stefanik to her boss at the White House, an official who ran President George W. Bush's domestic policy council. The day after graduation, she moved to Washington as his new assistant.
Ms. Stefanik was an adept networker in the way of many successful young Washingtonians. Older people had a tendency to see in her a younger version of themselves, and after Mr. Bush left office and her law school plans fizzled -- none of the schools she applied to accepted her -- she translated her White House connections into a succession of opportunities. With vague ideas about a revival of Mr. Bush's "compassionate conservatism" or an American version of Thatcherism, she persuaded several prominent Bush alumni to join the board of a new web magazine, named American Maggie and dedicated to promoting "new ideas, new voices, and new types of candidates." American Maggie lasted about six months, publishing a mix of syndicated columns and lightly polished essays by young conservative women in Ms. Stefanik's orbit. In 2011, she became policy director for Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor running for president as a Tea Party-friendly lunch-pail conservative. When the party nominated an altogether different candidate, the patrician ex-financier Mitt Romney, her Bush connections helped land her a job with his running mate, Mr. Ryan, an icon of the party's libertarianish wing.
After Mr. Romney lost, Ms. Stefanik was hired by a Republican National Committee task force charged with figuring out what had gone wrong. The project, known as the Republican "autopsy," would call on the party to embrace comprehensive immigration reform -- "amnesty," as it was disparaged on the right. Ms. Stefanik, who served as an editor for the task force, was "a strong advocate of including the immigration language," according to Sally Bradshaw, a task force member. "I can't recall any time where Elise argued against being bold in that document," Ms. Bradshaw said. As she recalled, Ms. Stefanik was most involved in the passages that examined how the party could attract a more diverse electorate. More inclusive messaging would not be enough, the final report argued; the party had to run more women for office. Ms. Stefanik, it turned out, had a specific kind of candidate in mind.
North Country Makeover
Running for Congress would be her first reinvention: from staff member to principal, insider to outsider, Beltway striver to North Country native. As Ms. Stefanik prepared to run in New York's sprawling, largely rural 21st Congressional District, she took a job at her family's company, Premium Plywood Products, and moved to their vacation home in the town of Willsboro, on Lake Champlain. She told friends she would play down her liberal views on abortion rights and gay marriage by casting them as settled matters. She hired Mr. Romney's media consultant, who prepared a rosy-toned introductory ad heralding her "return home to the North Country"; her campaign bio described Ms. Stefanik as "a small businesswoman who works in North Country sales, marketing and management." When one local reporter visited Willsboro for a profile, he couldn't find a single person who had either met or heard of her.
The older, overwhelmingly male political class in the district did not immediately take Ms. Stefanik seriously. The candidate and her aides felt that local news coverage of her was hostile and nitpicky. But she had an instinctive sense of how to craft a sound bite and repeat it relentlessly, embracing the slogan "new ideas and a new generation of leadership." She logged thousands of miles on the road -- she had ditched the BMW for a Ford F-150 pickup -- and boned up on local issues, like broadband internet access and tick control. When the incumbent Democrat announced his retirement in early 2014, Ms. Stefanik's main challenge was defeating his previous opponent, a self-funding businessman, in the Republican primary.
Whatever resistance she may have faced in New York, the party's national establishment, fearful of Democrats' dominance among young voters, embraced her eagerly. Billionaires threw her fund-raisers and put more than $ 1 million into super PACs backing her candidacy. Smaller checks poured in from former White House colleagues and college friends, conservatives and liberals alike. "At the time, she was everything I agreed with," said Heather Grizzle, a friend and fellow Republican from her Harvard days. "I was thrilled to help a friend who looked like she had a shot."
That fall, at the age of 30, Ms. Stefanik became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. The Institute of Politics brought her onto its board, among the ranks of the politicians and leaders she had idolized as a student. In Congress, she joined a new, more diverse crop of young Republicans; senior Republicans began to discuss her as a future House speaker. She was profiled in Glamour magazine and told CBS she had been influenced to run by reading "Lean In," the best-selling book by Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. But she carefully turned down most national interview requests. "I wanted to make sure that my first impression to my colleagues is that I am a workhorse," she would later explain.
In private, Ms. Stefanik already seemed to be thinking ahead. Not long after the 2014 primary, according to records provided by the online forensics company DomainTools, StefanikForPresident.com was registered by Alex Skatell, the co-founder of IMGE, a political consulting firm retained by Ms. Stefanik's campaign. Within days, the records show, the firm had registered or acquired two dozen other Stefanik-themed web addresses, more than half hinting at a future bid for Senate or president. Ownership of the addresses was later hidden behind a proxy service. In 2017, local papers reported that persons unknown had registered StefanikForPresident.com and other Stefanik-related domains. At the time, a spokesman denied it had been Ms. Stefanik or anyone working for her, chalking up the scrutiny to "desperate candidates and their partisan allies."
'Supporting' the Nominee
When the congresswoman appeared in May 2021 on "War Room," Stephen K. Bannon's popular talk show, the onetime Trump consigliere prompted her to tell listeners how she had always stood by Mr. Trump's side. "People in the audience need to understand this," Mr. Bannon said: After the release of the "Access Hollywood" tape in 2016, in which the future president bragged about groping women, "you had every opportunity to run like so many of the Republican establishment did at the time."
Ms. Stefanik, then mounting her first bid for House leadership, wound up for the softball. "I will never forget campaigning in 2016 despite the media's obsessive Trump derangement syndrome," she said. She had felt the energy on the ground, had seen Mr. Trump's win coming, even if others had not. "The media didn't get it; the establishment didn't get it. I was proud to be a part of it. And I was proud to be on that ticket."
In truth, she had loathed Mr. Trump from the start. In August 2015, she told a New York radio station that he was "insulting to women," and that his candidacy would hurt the party's efforts to attract female voters. That December, at a friend's wedding in Australia, she made Mr. Trump the butt of an elaborate rehearsal dinner toast, according to four people who attended. Whipping out a red MAGA hat, she glared at the other guests with mock suspicion, warning them not to post pictures or videos of the speech online, where they might get back to her constituents. Winding up, she placed the hat on the groom, a tech entrepreneur known for his socialist politics and friendly debates with Ms. Stefanik. Everyone laughed. (Her spokesman denied it was a MAGA hat and said the toast did not mock Mr. Trump.)
Like many establishment Republicans, according to her former friends, she thought Mr. Trump was too awful and ridiculous to be taken seriously, then watched with alarm as his campaign soared. She refused to endorse anyone before the New York presidential primary that April, leading Mr. Paladino, her future ally, to denounce her as a "fraud" and "Washington elitist establishment sellout." Around that time, she returned to Cambridge for an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Institute of Politics. Afterward, she and a dozen of her old crowd gathered at a restaurant to catch up. Ms. Stefanik said she planned to vote for John Kasich in the primary and could not possibly vote for Mr. Trump in the general election, according to people who were there, and suggested she might write in someone else's name if he became the nominee. (Her spokesman denied that account of the dinner.)
Ms. Stefanik skipped the Republican convention that summer. When the "Access Hollywood" tape broke, she drafted a statement demanding that he drop out of the race, according to a person familiar with her decision-making process, before settling for a Facebook post calling his statements "inappropriate, offensive" and "just wrong." (Her spokesman said that it was "Never Trump Outside consultants" working on her campaign who had drafted statements calling on Mr. Trump to drop out.) A week later, after a local debate, she told the assembled news media that she was "supporting my party's nominee." Then she dashed to her vehicle as her campaign staff blocked an Albany television reporter from following her. In text messages to friends after Mr. Trump won, she expressed shock and worry, not the exultation she claims today.
Her revisionism still shocks those who have known her the longest and who remember the disdain she expressed for Mr. Trump back then. "I suspect there are a lot of Republican members of Congress who take positions on Trump that they don't hold privately, for their own political security or gain," said Mr. Tucker, the Arkansas lawmaker. "Elise is the only one I know for certain who has."
Woman in the Middle
Over Mr. Trump's first two years in office, Ms. Stefanik fought what amounted to a losing battle against her own ambition. She voted with the president most of the time but against some of his signature initiatives -- his tax cut, for example, and his attempt to free up funding for a border wall by declaring a national emergency. She co-sponsored legislation to provide a path to citizenship for "Dreamers," young immigrants brought to America as children, and registered high-toned disapproval of the president's attacks on "shithole" countries. ("Wrong and contrary to our American ideals," she wrote on Twitter.)
Her friends outside Washington would occasionally text her with praise after a tough vote. "Getting a lot of negative feedback back home," she wrote one after the wall showdown. "But also some positive. So mixed. But I feel strongly it was the right vote." She began participating in a book about millennial politicians by a Time magazine journalist, Charlotte Alter, who cast Ms. Stefanik as a rising star determined to drag her party into the 21st century. "I just think my generation doesn't want to see the extreme partisanship," she told the writer. Mike Conaway, a former Republican lawmaker from Texas who served with Ms. Stefanik on the House Intelligence Committee, described her as a diligent and hard-working member who "would ask really good questions and ask really good follow-up questions."
But according to current and former friends, she felt increasingly frustrated and lost in the House, horrified by the behavior of her harder-right colleagues and unsure of her place. As Mr. Trump's presidency unfolded, it was becoming more difficult to play the middle. Some of the high-profile issues on which she had positioned herself as a bipartisan leader -- climate action, immigration -- had little traction in the Trump era. The president's base wanted revenge, not high-minded ideas; Mr. Trump set policy by tweet, not white paper. As the 2018 midterms approached, Ms. Stefanik's campaign took on a grim, joyless air. According to friends and advisers, she seemed brittle and unhappy. No longer a novice candidate, she dictated a hyperlocal campaign, emphasizing her bipartisanship and focus on regional issues. Though Democrats took the House that fall, Ms. Stefanik won the largest margin of any Republican in New York, a seeming validation of her carefully calibrated approach. But it was bittersweet. She was a promising young lawmaker with a seat at no particular table, respected by her party's fractured establishment but viewed with suspicion by its ascendant Trump wing.
Still, the campaign had given Ms. Stefanik a glimpse of an alternate path. That August, she had appeared with Mr. Trump at Fort Drum, a major military base in her district, to mark the signing of that year's defense bill. With a Democratic wave approaching, Ms. Stefanik had fretted for weeks over whether and how she wanted him to appear, but ultimately lobbied hard for Mr. Trump's visit, according to a former White House official involved in the planning. At Fort Drum, Mr. Trump mispronounced her name -- calling her "STEF-a-nik," not for the last time -- and offered backhanded praise. "She called me so many times" that he had dodged her calls, Mr. Trump told the audience. Ms. Stefanik gave a brief speech from behind the presidential lectern, lit for television as she cited the bill's pay increase for soldiers and provisions she had written providing support for military spouses.
The day made a powerful impression, according to people who know or have worked with her. The cheering crowd was "a taste of being Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows for a day," said the former White House official, referring to two of Mr. Trump's staunchest House allies. More important, she had successfully maneuvered the power of the presidency -- even if it was his presidency -- behind a piece of her own agenda. It was a taste of the influence she had always imagined having.
In the months that followed, many people sensed her impending transformation only as a kind of withdrawal. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat serving with her on the intelligence committee, recalled that in their first years on the panel, they texted often about committee business. "She took the Russia stuff seriously for a long time," Mr. Swalwell said. "And then she just went dark."
Always a happy warrior -- someone who loved a debate and gave as good as she got -- she now seemed cornered and defensive. She felt she was taking risks in criticizing Mr. Trump, even gently. But amid the polarizing fever of the Trump presidency, longtime friends were increasingly impatient with her cautious triangulations.
In the summer of 2019, when Mr. Trump attacked the Baltimore district of a Black lawmaker as a "rat- and rodent-infested mess" and urged four Democratic lawmakers of color to "go back" to where they came from, Ms. Stefanik called his comments "denigrating and wrong" but balked at going further. "I don't believe he's a racist," she told a North Country newspaper. A week later, she received a long email from her old Harvard friend, Ms. Yearwood Young. "I've been wanting to write this email for months, but have been holding out as long as I could, hoping you would redeem yourself at some point," she wrote. "You know he is racist. It honestly disgusts me that for political purposes you will not only refuse to call it out, but to actually state that he is NOT racist."
Ms. Stefanik wrote back that afternoon. "I am so sorry that I have disappointed you," she said. She pointed out that she had among the more bipartisan records in Congress and asked her friend to respect their differences. "I know how divided this country is right now. I hear it, see it, experience it every day. I receive emails like this on a daily basis from people (including some of our college friends!) who shame me for not supporting President Trump enough," Ms. Stefanik wrote. She skirted the question of whether Mr. Trump or the things he said were racist, responding that "supporting President Trump does not make voters or people racist."
Their volley of emails took on a progressively bitter tone. Ms. Stefanik said she had been "called out by name on Fox News and radio repeatedly" after voting for "immigration reform and legal status for undocumented immigrants." She had been subject to violent threats; strangers had followed her while driving. She sounded resigned. "As long as I happen to be a Republican today," she wrote, "that is unacceptable and immoral in your mind." They never spoke again.
That October, after receiving a list of routine fact-checking queries from Ms. Alter, the Time journalist, Ms. Stefanik demanded through an aide to speak to Ms. Alter's publisher. The aide claimed that the queries reflected significant factual errors, according to emails Ms. Alter provided, but when pressed, identified only a handful of minor items, easily fixed before publication. "They were trying to use my good-faith effort to check the facts as a cudgel to stop a book they didn't want to be in anymore," Ms. Alter said. "The book aligned with her earlier image, and she was making a transformation." Just weeks later, Ms. Stefanik made her move.
'She Has Become a Star'
Among those who have known her longest, a question about Ms. Stefanik's ideological journey almost invariably draws a pause, a sigh and a theory. Even now, many former friends and associates believe that she did not, at first, intend to travel quite as far as she did. "I don't think that the plan was to become a MAGA star," Mr. Tucker said.
Indeed, through most of autumn 2019, as the intelligence committee examined allegations that Mr. Trump had threatened to withhold military aid unless Ukraine investigated Mr. Biden, she remained a minor player, attending fewer than half of the private depositions and asking questions at just two. She closely watched the Democratic presidential debates, sometimes offering, through a friend working on his campaign, unsolicited advice for Mr. Buttigieg. Even weeks later, as she publicly defended Mr. Trump, she was mulling other paths for advancement: She asked the friend whether Mr. Buttigieg might consider her for a cabinet job if he won the presidency. The friend, incredulous, told The Times the idea was never sent up the chain.
Yet as public hearings loomed that November, Ms. Stefanik lobbied for a bigger role. Like other Republicans, she felt that Democrats were abusing their power, forcing through one-sided rules for the impeachment battle. Her plan, she told one Republican friend, was to highlight the unfairness of the process. But she would not carry Mr. Trump's water. "I will never defend Trump," she said. (Her spokesman said that the notion that Ms. Stefanik had raised the idea of a cabinet job with anyone on the Buttigieg campaign was "stupid and false," and that she had never expressed reluctance about defending Mr. Trump.)
On the first day of the hearings, she led off Republican efforts to derail the hearing, attacking the panel's chairman, Representative Adam Schiff of California, for blocking Republicans from calling some witnesses. But as the hearing progressed, she did defend Mr. Trump: Addressing herself directly to the television audience, she waved away the president's efforts to pressure the Ukrainians. "For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following," she said. "No. 1, Ukraine received the aid; No. 2, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden." When the committee reconvened two days later, Ms. Stefanik again led the attack. With theatrical interjections, deliberately breaking the Democrats' rules, she lured Mr. Schiff into calling his young female colleague out of order. "What is the interruption for this time?" she demanded.
On the left, Ms. Stefanik became an instant target of hatred. Hollywood celebrities and liberal Twitter influencers attacked her relentlessly, dubbing her "Trashy Stefanik" and circulating a doctored picture of her supposedly giving the finger to a photographer during the hearings. In a clumsily sexist tweet, ABC's Matthew Dowd suggested she had been elected only because she was a woman. But Fox ate up her performance, featuring clips through prime time. Mr. Trump loved it. "I know a lot about stardom," he said on "Fox and Friends" the following week. "This young woman from upstate New York -- she has become a star."
Ms. Stefanik's Republican friend, to whom she had pledged not to carry Mr. Trump's water, was not surprised. He had watched many Republican politicians grapple with the political incentives of Trumpism. All her life, Ms. Stefanik had streamlined herself for success; finally she had found the engine of her ascent. The farther she turned the dial, the more power and influence she would have. "So then the question is, what do you do with that dial?" said the friend. "You can say, 'I can embrace it without going full MAGA."' Ms. Stefanik chose differently. "She just said, 'Wow.' She cranked the dial. I don't think she arrived at this issue set totally disingenuously."
'I've Chosen My Values'
As the positive reviews rolled in, Ms. Stefanik seized the opportunity. On the day of the second impeachment hearing, her team activated a new account on WinRed, the small-donor platform set up by Trump campaign veterans. She raised more in grass-roots contributions in a week than she had over the entire rest of her congressional career, according to a Times analysis of campaign finance records. By the end of the first week of hearings, her team had prepared to unveil a new impeachment-themed fund-raising site, FightSchiff.com, and set out to have her booked on Fox to plug it.
Ms. Stefanik marveled to friends at the flood of money. Contributions from her leadership PAC to other Republicans would quadruple by the end of 2020. With Mr. Trump's blessing, she could tap into a nationwide base of MAGA fans. Out of roughly $ 4 million she raised on WinRed this election cycle through late October 2022, just 4 percent came from her own district, according to a Times analysis of campaign finance records.
Ever her own best adviser, Ms. Stefanik dictated the tactics and message. As she milked the MAGA base for money and visibility, she began articulating a new, almost passive conception of her role as congresswoman, in which her job was to mirror her constituents, not take principled votes they might dislike. In 2014, her defenders have argued, her district wanted a Bush-style Republican; in the Trump era, it wanted a Trump-style Republican. "There's no shift," said Mr. Pileggi, the former campaign aide. Who could say she was wrong if the voters said she was right? The discredited gatekeepers of the mainstream media? The small papers back home that fewer and fewer people read? Asked in a recent interview whether she had chosen her ambition over her values, she simply avoided the question. "I've chosen my values," she said. "And I've chosen my constituents."
She moved quickly into Mr. Trump's circle, readily accepting the compromises it entailed. In spring 2020, she flew with the president on Air Force One to witness the SpaceX rocket launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Aboard the plane, according to a former White House official who was there, the president made a derogatory comment about the sex life of one of his most loyal and senior female aides. Ms. Stefanik had once criticized Mr. Trump's demeaning comments toward women; now she simply plastered a smile on her face. "No one said anything. Neither did I," the former official recalled. "It was a sign that she knew who he was." Ms. Stefanik's spokesman denied the account, saying it "never happened."
In public, however, Ms. Stefanik's new political self was most obvious on Mr. Trump's favorite social media platform, where she began to favor his random capitalizations and conspicuous exclamation points. In the years since his first impeachment hearing, she has attacked political opponents or journalists as "sick" or "sickening" more than three dozen times -- language she had never before used on Twitter. She edited away parts of her old online persona that might grate against the new. As the 2020 elections approached, according to a Times analysis of Twitter data collected by ProPublica, Ms. Stefanik deleted a pair of tweets from that March praising Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the public face of the federal Covid response. "America ❤️s Dr. Fauci!" she had written. In 2021, with Dr. Fauci firmly established as a right-wing punching bag, she expressed a different view. "Fire Fauci," she tweeted. "Save Christmas!"
After Mr. Trump's election defeat, as he fomented a deluge of lies and conspiracy theories about cheating and voter fraud, Ms. Stefanik quickly fell in line. Mr. Trump had made his election lies a litmus test for fellow Republicans, and Ms. Stefanik was unwilling to fail it, even as election officials and judges dismissed or refuted almost every claim made by the president or his legal team. Repeating a string of already debunked assertions, she claimed that local officials had counted the votes of dead people, or tossed out procedures intended to prevent fraud, or illegally counted late-arriving votes. Having lied to her own constituents, fanning their fears of a rigged election, she then claimed their suspicions as a casus belli. "Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities," she said in an open letter to her district on the morning of Jan 6.
That evening, after the Trump-inspired mob was cleared from the Capitol, she joined other Republicans to vote against certifying electors from Pennsylvania. The next day, she got a text from Mr. Tucker, the Arkansas lawmaker and Harvard friend. "I cannot put into words how disappointed I am in you," he wrote. She had squandered a "historic opportunity to fundamentally strengthen our country and democracy," he told her. "You've done this all for, what exactly?" Disgusted, he joined hundreds of other Harvard alumni and students on a petition for Ms. Stefanik's removal from the Institute of Politics board. So did Ms. Grizzle, her fellow Republican, who had lived most of the year in Pennsylvania: One of the ballots Ms. Stefanik had tried to invalidate was her own. "You can't promote democracy if you're throwing out people's votes," Ms. Grizzle said.
A few days later, the dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, which oversees the institute, asked Ms. Stefanik to step aside. When she refused, he announced her removal. She had disqualified herself, the dean said in a statement, through repeated false statements about the election. Ms. Stefanik responded with the kind of bristling performance her former friends had come to expect. Her alma mater had decided to "cave to the woke Left," she said; getting kicked off the board was a "badge of honor."
A Fall and an Ascent
A few weeks after the insurrection, House Republicans met to consider removing Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, then the party's highest-ranking woman in Congress, from her job as conference chair. In the two previous leadership contests, it was Ms. Stefanik herself who had stood before colleagues to nominate Ms. Cheney, once calling her a "huge asset in the role." But Ms. Cheney had now voted for Mr. Trump's second impeachment, infuriating not only Trump allies but a broader range of Republican lawmakers, who complained that she had made their party look divided. Days after the vote, Politico reported that Ms. Stefanik had "privately signaled" her interest in replacing her.
That February, Ms. Cheney's colleagues voted to keep her in the job. But as Ms. Cheney continued to speak out against Mr. Trump, the woman who had remade her principles to fit her ambition set out to depose the one risking career suicide in service of hers. Though Ms. Stefanik had a far more liberal voting record than the woman she wanted to replace, she worked both sides, making clear she would neither embarrass Republicans who had cowered before Mr. Trump's election lies nor anger supporters who insisted on believing them. Her argument, as one Republican member recalled it: "I'm a woman, I'm young, I'm reasonable. I like Liz, but we need to quit focusing on Jan. 6." Mr. Trump's ringing endorsement that May sealed the deal. Ms. Cheney was out, and Ms. Stefanik was in.
It became harder, then, for her to reconcile the identity she said she hadn't abandoned with the power she had finally grasped. She dropped her support for the Equality Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at extending housing and employment anti-discrimination rules to gay, lesbian and transgender people, and pulled her name from another Republican-backed gay-rights bill, known as the Fairness for All Act, saying she now had "serious concerns on how this bill would impact society." (She recently voted in favor of a bipartisan bill mandating federal recognition for same-sex marriages.) Her voting score from the conservative group Heritage Action was a squishy 24 percent at the end of 2018; she currently rates a stalwart 86.
She has repeatedly voted against spending bills championed by Mr. Biden and the Democrats, then taken credit for the money those same bills delivered back home. Last March, her press office alerted upstate reporters that Ms. Stefanik had secured $ 205,000 for job training in Warren County, though a news release from her Washington office, quoting the congresswoman, proclaimed that she could not support "Speaker Pelosi's bill," which was "drafted in the dead of night."
The further Ms. Stefanik traveled into Mr. Trump's world, the deeper she seemed to dig in. She hadn't changed; her former friends had. They were out of touch, driven mad by hatred of Mr. Trump. That spring, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a fellow Harvard graduate and her Democratic colleague on the Armed Services Committee, approached her on the House floor. Both elected in 2014, they often had lunch together at the Capitol, and had mutual friends outside Washington. Speaking carefully, he told her that people were worried about the course she had set herself on, Mr. Moulton recalled. Ms. Stefanik lashed out, demanding to know which of their friends had talked to him. She mocked him, saying that some of the same people had asked her what Mr. Moulton thought he was doing when he ran for president the previous year.
He tried to get up and leave, but she pulled him back down, pressing her case. Her former friends had no idea what real Americans thought, Ms. Stefanik told him. They didn't know anything about the district she represented.
"But these people know you, Elise," Mr. Moulton replied. "And now they feel like they don't even recognize you."
The Price of Loyalty
"What happened to the red wave, congresswoman?"
The day after her party's midterm underperformance, even the normally friendly hosts on "Fox and Friends" had questions for Ms. Stefanik. In the weeks leading to Election Day, she had predicted nothing less than a "red tsunami." But around the country, Mr. Trump's handpicked candidates for the Senate and other offices went down to defeat; those he had endorsed in close House races ran significantly behind Republicans he had not, hampered in part by voters' revulsion at the extreme rhetoric he had normalized in Republican circles. Fewer than a third of the female House candidates Ms. Stefanik had endorsed through her leadership PAC made it through the general election. Republicans will soon take control of the House with one of the slimmest margins in history; the party's House leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has already been forced to cut deals with the most extreme members of his caucus to keep his would-be speakership alive. Like the party more broadly, House Republicans cannot yet afford to banish those most responsible for their quandary.
But as other Republicans questioned how to wean their party off Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik issued her pre-emptive endorsement of his all-but-announced re-election campaign. In some respects, she had little choice: Ms. Stefanik is arguably more dependent on Mr. Trump's patronage than any other Republican leader, and his team soon made clear that he expected such an endorsement from anyone he was supporting for a leadership job. Two weeks after her re-election as conference chair, when Mr. Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago with the rapper Kanye West and the young MAGA commentator Nick Fuentes -- two guests with a history of antisemitic or racist statements -- Ms. Stefanik said nothing. Nor did she have anything to say publicly when Mr. Trump, citing stories about how Twitter had handled moderation decisions during the 2020 election, suggested "termination" of the Constitution might be an appropriate remedy.
When Congress reconvenes, many of the younger, more Trump-critical Republicans who joined the House alongside Ms. Stefanik eight years ago will be gone. So will all but two of the Republicans who voted to impeach him. Some in Congress believe that if Mr. McCarthy cannot corral the votes to make himself speaker, Ms. Stefanik could offer herself up as a compromise candidate.
Yet her position may be more precarious than it appears. Unwilling to acknowledge that her politics have changed, she has never offered MAGA die-hards a persuasive conversion story, leaving behind lingering suspicion. "One thing I've heard consistently from pro-Trump members is that the 180 that she pulled was just so jarring," said one veteran Republican lobbyist who is in touch with a wide array of Republican lawmakers.
Among her fellow Republicans, according to Republican lawmakers, Hill staff and lobbyists, Ms. Stefanik has a reputation for being both diligent in advancing the party's message and unabashedly transactional in amassing chits of support for her own climb up the ladder. But her campaign donations and endorsements have given her support that may be more broad than deep. For much of the spring and summer, while serving as conference chair, she quietly tested the waters for promotion to the next highest-ranking House job, that of Republican whip. As the race grew more crowded, however, Ms. Stefanik found herself without a clear constituency for the position. The party's remaining moderates no longer saw her as one of them, and its right wing preferred a more consistent conservative. Only when another House member announced his interest in succeeding her as conference chair did Ms. Stefanik finally commit to running for another term in her old job.
News stories about the upcoming presidential campaign still mention Ms. Stefanik as a rising star who might join a Trump ticket in 2024 -- a political pole vault that would carry her, finally, to the very top of the Republican Party. But within the president's inner circle, according to two people close to Mr. Trump, stories casting Ms. Stefanik as a potential running mate are regarded as clumsy plants by her own team, and inspire bemusement and mockery. Mr. Trump liked her, they said, and liked watching her defend him. But even he didn't trust her.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A guitarist and singer, he was a quintessential local star, mixing blues, funk and jazz through six decades of club and festival gigs.
Walter "Wolfman" Washington, a New Orleans guitarist and singer who played his mix of funk, blues, soul and jazz in the city's clubs for six decades, died on Dec. 22 in a hospice in New Orleans. He was 79.
The cause was tonsil cancer, said his manager, Adam Shipley.
A quintessential local luminary, Mr. Washington held down long-running weekly residencies at clubs including the Maple Leaf and d.b.a, where he recorded a live album with his band, the Roadmasters, that was released in 2013. He was also a member of a durable trio, with the keyboardist Joe Krown and the drummer Russell Batiste Jr., that released "Live at the Maple Leaf" in 2008.
Between New Orleans gigs, Mr. Washington toured clubs, particularly around the South, and worked an international circuit of blues clubs and festivals.
Mr. Washington's guitar playing was lean, light-fingered and harmonically rich, conveying a relaxed authority as it teased and jabbed. His voice could convey flirtatiousness, amusement, heartache or wily agility, and his syncopated phrasing was as close to jazz as to traditional blues, leaping easily into falsetto or letting loose a vulpine howl.
Edward Joseph Washington Jr., who later began calling himself Walter, was born in New Orleans on Dec. 20, 1943. His father was a baker; his mother, Marie Williams, cleaned houses.
He sang in his church choir and taught himself guitar to accompany the spirituals of the True Love and Gospel Singers, a neighborhood group. "I was born to play the guitar," he told Offbeat magazine in 2018.
He made his first guitar out of a cigar box, a clothes hanger and rubber bands, before an uncle gave him an acoustic guitar. According to "Music Inside Out," a program on the New Orleans radio station WWNO, he called himself Walter after being nicknamed War-War because he kept getting into fights with other children; he got his "Wolfman" moniker as an ambitious young guitarist who challenged better-known players onstage, a tactic known as wolfing.
Mr. Washington became a full-time musician in his teens, backing up leading New Orleans R&B singers including Irma Thomas and Ernie K-Doe, who was his first cousin and, he told Offbeat, gave him his first electric guitar.
He joined the singer Lee Dorsey's band in 1962 and spent the next two years touring with him. From the 1960s into the '80s, he played guitar onstage and in the studio behind the singer Johnny Adams, who encouraged Mr. Washington to return to singing, strengthening his voice and extending it into falsetto.
In 1986, Mr. Washington formed the Roadmasters and released his first nationally distributed album, "Wolf Tracks," on the Rounder label. Jon Cleary, the Roadmasters' first keyboardist, wrote on Facebook that with Mr. Washington's band, "A new musical vocabulary opened up for me" that was "an unusual hybrid of soul, funk and jazz."
Mr. Washington's sets drew on his own songs and on a deep repertoire of current and vintage R&B and standards. One of his most popular songs was his funky remake of Johnny "Guitar" Watson's "You Can Stay but the Noise Must Go."
Through the next three decades of constant touring, Mr. Washington recorded with the Roadmasters for labels including Rounder, Bullseye Blues, Virgin/Point Blank, Zoho and Anti-. His 1999 album, "Blue Moon Risin'," featured horn players who had worked with James Brown.
Mr. Washington married Michelle Bushey in 2021, onstage at the New Orleans club Tipitina's. She survives him. His survivors also include his oldest daughter, Sada Washington, whom his 1991 album, "Sada," was named after; another daughter, Mamadou Washington; and his son, Brian Anderson.
In 2018, a decade after his last studio album, Mr. Washington made a stripped-down, more intimate album, "My Future Is My Past," produced by Ben Ellman of the New Orleans band Galactic, on which he set aside the horn section and sometimes switched from electric to acoustic guitar. One song, "Even Now," was a duet with Irma Thomas, with whom Mr. Washington had worked four decades earlier. Mr. Washington had recently completed another studio album with Mr. Ellman as producer; it is awaiting a label deal for release.
During months of cancer treatment in 2022, Mr. Washington continued to perform, including a set at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, where he had appeared regularly. His last show was at the Bogalusa Blues and Heritage Festival in September.
"Ever since I was a little bitty boy," he said in a 2015 video interview for the online channel Mr. Porter, "I've always wanted to be a pillar of New Orleans and the music. Once you become yourself and understand why you wants to be a musician, you're going to be recognized mostly at home."

Full text: A reader bristles that the burden of bridging a gap with her partner's parents seems to have fallen mostly on her.
My partner's parents complain to him frequently that they don't speak to our children often enough or have a closer connection with me. My partner then asks me to have the kids call them and to make a bigger effort myself. But my in-laws never call or text us! I've explained to him that relationships are two-way streets and it's not reasonable to expect us to initiate all contact. He is unwilling to upset them, though. As background: His parents are generous with us financially (making large loans and taking us on expensive trips). But for many years, I have overheard them speaking unkindly about me when they thought I wasn't around: criticizing me, our home, my interactions with my partner and the way we raise our children. Any advice?
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
The most important relationship here is the one between you and your partner, right? So, let's focus on it. You mention telling him about the unfair burden of initiating all contact with your in-laws. And it seems unlikely that you would have kept quiet (to him, anyway) about their overheard digs at you. So, how does your partner propose dealing with these problems?
I get that he doesn't like to upset his parents, but he can't reasonably expect your relationship with them to flourish or even for you to encourage your children to call people who trash you behind your back -- unless he believes that the emotional labor of dealing with his parents is your job, or that you and your children are bought and paid for by his parents' generosity. Neither position is appealing.
Talk to your partner. There probably can't be meaningful improvement in relations here without all the adults talking about the criticisms you overheard (which may be valid, by the way, but are still unlikely to dispose you kindly toward them). Or you can continue as things are, with your partner's parents carping to him about you and the kids while simultaneously making hefty loans and paying for vacations. You and your partner should chart a course together.
Asking a Friend to Read Between the Bottom Lines
I have a close friend from childhood. We talk on the phone about work, our kids and mutual friends. The problem: My friend frequently mentions how much things cost: how much was spent, how much was saved, etc. She is comfortable financially. I once made it clear that we are not financial equals, hoping she would take the hint. She didn't, and her insensitivity is starting to hurt my feelings. How do I tell her that I love being in touch, but her constant references to money make me uncomfortable?
FRIEND
I would knock off the oblique hints. How was your friend supposed to know that you wanted her to stop talking about money simply because you told her you weren't "financial equals"? I gather this means you have less money than she does. Still, the mere statement of your relative positions in no way conveys your desire.
If you want your "close friend" to stop talking about cash, tell her! Money is a source of anxiety for many people -- even for those who are financially comfortable. It often finds its way into conversations with intimates. So, don't be shy about repeating your needs if necessary.
Just Out of Frame
Is it fair for me to be offended that my boyfriend's mother doesn't include me in the picture on her family's holiday card? Her son and I have been dating for nearly four years; we live together, have a dog together, and we're tracking to be engaged in 2023. Two daughters-in-law are featured prominently, which leads me to believe that I'm being excluded because we haven't exchanged rings. Am I being too sensitive?
GIRLFRIEND
It's not my job to judge your feelings. I'm sorry you feel left out. And I bet you're right: Your boyfriend's mother probably thinks of family as blood relations and their legal spouses. It's not an uncommon view, and it is her holiday card, after all.
I would feel differently if you didn't have the right to marry, or even if you were a committed couple who decided that marriage wasn't for you. But you and your boyfriend seem to be at a different stage: living together but not ready to be engaged. (And I have no idea what "tracking to be engaged" means.) If you disagree, talk to your boyfriend. Maybe the two of you can approach his mother together about next year's card.
You, Me and 2023
My girlfriend, whom I love a lot, wants us to exchange New Year's resolutions. She thinks we stand a better chance of keeping them and holding each other accountable this way. Can I tell her I think New Year's resolutions are stupid?
CHAS
Well, I agree that a lot of New Year's resolutions are short-lived: losing 10 pounds or learning Mandarin. They're often forgotten within the week! But maybe your girlfriend envisions resolutions that are more personal to you and her: cooking dinner at home more often or taking more road trips. If not, steer her in that direction. Creating shared goals for your relationship in the coming year seems clever.

Full text: I have many fears as a mother. My kindergarten-age daughter recently learned a game on the school bus called "Truth or Force." My youngest refuses to eat almost anything but Kraft Mac and Cheese. Added to the list this year, alongside outside influences and health concerns, is the possibility that my daughters could inadvertently lock me out of my digital life.
That's what happened to a mother in Colorado whose 9-year-old son used her old smartphone to stream himself naked on YouTube, and a father in San Francisco whose Google account was disabled and deleted because he took naked photos of his toddler for the doctor.
I reported on their experiences for The New York Times, and as I talked to these parents, who were stunned and bereft at the loss of their emails, photos, videos, contacts and important documents spanning decades, I realized I was similarly at risk.
I am "cloud-complacent," keeping my most important digital information not on a hard drive at home but in the huge digital basement provided via technology companies' servers. Google gives all users 15 gigabytes free, a quarter of what comes standard on an Android phone, and I have not managed to max it out in 18 years of using the company's many services.
I did fill up Apple's free 5 GB, so I now pay $ 9.99 a month for additional iCloud storage space. Meta has no max; like scrolling on Instagram, the allowed space is infinite.
If I were suddenly cut off from any of these services, the data loss would be professionally and personally devastating.
As a child of the 1980s, I used to have physical constraints on how many photos, journals, VHS tapes and notes passed in seventh grade that I could reasonably keep. But the immense expanse and relatively cheap rent of the so-called cloud has made me a data hoarder. Heading into 2023, I set out to excavate everything I was storing on every service, and find somewhere to save it that I had control over. As I grappled with all the gigabytes, my concern morphed from losing it all to figuring out what was actually worth saving.
Data Harvesting
I find nearly 100 photos from one November night 15 years ago, out with my family at a Tampa Bay Lightning game when my sisters and I were home for the holidays. We're tailgating with a mini-keg of Heineken. My dad is posing by the car, making a funny face at the ridiculousness of a parking garage party. Then, we're posing in the stadium with the hockey rink in the background, toasting with a stranger we sat next to. Had we bonded with him during an especially close third period? The metadata in the Google Photos jpg file didn't say.
The photos transported me back to a tremendously fun evening that I had all but forgotten. Yet I wondered how there could be so many photos from just one night. How do I decide which to keep and which to get rid of?
This kind of data explosion is a result of economics, said Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library based in San Francisco that saves copies of websites and digitizes books and television shows. Taking a photo used to be expensive because it involved film that needed to be developed.
"It cost a dollar every time you hit a shutter," Mr. Kahle said. "That's no longer the case so we hit the shutter all the time and keep way, way too much."
I had captured the 2007 evening in Tampa pre-smartphone on a digital Canon camera that had a relatively small memory card that I regularly emptied into Google Photos. I found more than 4,000 other photos there, along with 10 gigabytes of data from Blogger, Gmail, Google Chat and Google Search, when I requested a copy of the data in my account using a Google tool called Takeout.
I just pressed a button and a couple of days later got my data in a three-file chunk, which was great, though some of it, including all my emails, was not human-readable. Instead, it came in a form that needed to be uploaded to another service or Google account.
According to a company spokesman, 50 million people a year use Takeout to download their data from 80 different Google products, with 400 billion files exported in 2021. These people may have had plans to move to a different service, simply wanted their own copy or were preserving what they had on Google before deleting it from the company's servers.
Takeout was created in 2011 by a group of Google engineers who called themselves the Data Liberation Front. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google employee in Chicago who led the team, said he thought it was important that the company's users have an easy "off ramp" to leave Google and take their data elsewhere. But Mr. Fitzpatrick said he worried that when people store their digital belongings on a company's server, they "don't think about it or care about it."
Some of my data landlords were more accommodating than others. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram offered Takeout-like tools, while Apple had a more complicated data transfer process that involved voluminous instructions and a USB cable.
The amount of data I eventually pulled down was staggering, including more than 30,000 photos, 2,000 videos, 22,000 tweets, 57,000 emails, 15,000 pages of old Google chats and 16,000 pages of Google searches going back to 2011.
It was such an overwhelming amount of digital stuff that I wasn't surprised to see that Google had hired Marie Kondo as a spokeswoman for the paid version of its storage service -- starting at $ 1.99 per month for 100 GB. Ms. Kondo suggested better labeling and organization of emails, photos and documents to make it "easy to find the memories that spark joy."
The Missing
The trove of data brought forgotten episodes of my life back in vivid color. A blurry photo of my best friend's husband with a tiny baby strapped to his chest, standing in front of a wall-sized Beetlejuician face, made me recall a long-ago outing to a Tim Burton exhibit at a museum in Los Angeles. I don't remember what I learned about the gothic filmmaker, but I do remember my friends' horror when their weeks-old son, now 11, had a blowout and they had to beg a comically oversized diaper from a stranger.
The granularity of what was in my digital archive accentuated the parts of my life that were missing entirely: emails from college in a university-provided account that I hadn't thought to migrate; photos and videos I took on an Android phone that I backed up to an external hard drive that has since disappeared; and stories I'd written in journalism school for publications that no longer exist. They were as lost to me as the confessional journal I once left in the seatback of a plane. The idea that information, once digitized, will stick around forever is flawed.
"We often say the internet never forgets, but it does," said the web historian Ian Milligan. Companies shut down, as happened to GeoCities, an early, popular place for hosting personal websites, or a service cuts back on the amount of free storage it's offering, as when the new owner of Flickr announced in 2019 that free accounts had a limit of 1,000 photos and anything more would be deleted.
Margot Note, an archivist, said her profession thinks a lot about the accessibility of the medium on which data is stored, given the challenge of recovering videos from older formats such as DVDs, VHS tapes and reel film. Ms. Note asks the kinds of questions most of us don't: Will there be the right software or hardware to open all our digital files many years from now? With something called "bit rot" -- the degradation of a digital file over time -- the files may not be in good shape.
Individuals and institutions think that when they digitize material it will be safe, she said. "But digital files can be more fragile than physical ones."
Where to Put It
Once I assembled my data Frankenstein, I had to decide where to put it. More than a decade ago, pre-cloud complacency, I would regularly back my stuff up to a hard drive that I probably bought at Best Buy. Digital self-storage has gotten more complex as I discovered when I visited the DataHoarder subreddit. Posts there with technical advice for the best home setup were jargon-filled to the point of incomprehension for a newbie. A sample post: "Started with single bay Synology Nas and recently built a 16TB unRAID server on a xeon 1230. Very happy with result."
I felt as if I'd landed on an alien planet so I turned instead to professional archivists and tech-savvy friends. They recommended two $ 299 12-terabyte hard drives, one of which should have ample room for what I have now and what I will create in the future, and another to mirror the first, as well as a $ 249 NAS, or network-attached storage system, to connect to my home router, so I could access the files remotely and monitor the health of the drives.
Archivists regularly cited the "3-2-1 rule": three copies of everything, two copies on different cloud services and one at home. Some also said to keep yet another copy "offsite," i.e. at a relative's house or in a bank lockbox, depending on your level of paranoia. History is awash in tales of lost data, including the burning of invaluable master recordings of famous musicians in a Universal Studios fire. John Markoff, a technology journalist who writes for The Times, mined the extensive personal archives of the internet pioneer Stewart Brand for a biography. He found that even Mr. Brand, who meticulously preserved his communications, was missing several years of early emails because of the loss of back-up tapes and had hundreds of thousands of others on an old Macintosh that were a jumble of data that was largely impossible to read.
Getting all your data and figuring out how to securely store it is cumbersome, complicated and costly. There's a reason most people ignore all their stuff in the cloud.
What to Keep
I noticed a philosophical divide among the archivists I spoke with. Digital archivists were committed to keeping everything with the mentality that you never know what you might want one day, while professional archivists who worked with family and institutional collections said it was important to pare down to make an archive manageable for people who look at it in the future.
"It's often very surprising what turns out to matter," said Jeff Ubois, who is in the first camp and has organized conferences dedicated to personal archiving.
He brought up a historical example. During World War II, the British war office asked people who had taken coastal vacations to send in their postcards and photographs, an intelligence-gathering exercise to map the coastline that led to the selection of Normandy as the best place to land troops.
Mr. Ubois said it's hard to predict the future uses of what we save. Am I socking this away just for me, to reflect on my life as I age? Is it for my descendants? Is it for an artificial intelligence that will act as a memory prosthetic when I'm 90? And if so, does that A.I. really need to remember that I Googled "starbucks ice cream calorie count" one morning in January 2011?
Pre-internet, we pared down our collections to make them manageable. But now, we have metadata and advanced search techniques to sort through our lives: timestamps, geotags, object recognition. When I recently lost a close relative, I used the facial recognition feature in Apple Photos to unearth photos of him I'd forgotten I'd taken. I was glad to have them, but should I keep all the photos, even the unflattering ones?
Bob Clark, the director of archives at the Rockefeller Archive Center, said that the general rule of thumb in his profession is that less than 5 percent of the material in a collection is worth saving. He faulted the technology companies for offering too much storage space, eliminating the need for deliberating over what we keep.
"They've made it so easy that they have turned us into unintentional data hoarders," he said.
The companies try, occasionally, to play the role of memory miner, surfacing moments that they think should be meaningful, probably aiming to increase my engagement with their platform or inspire brand loyalty. But their algorithmic archivists inadvertently highlight the value of human curation.
Recently, my iPhone served me "Waterfalls over the years," which, as promised, featured a slide show with instrumental music and photos of myself and others in front of a random assortment of waterfalls. Like the British war office during World War II, the technology saw the backdrop as the star of the show.
"I don't think we can simply rely on the algorithms to help you decide what's important or not," Mr. Clark said. "There need to be points of human intervention and judgment involved."
Paring It Down
Rather than just keeping a full digital copy of everything, I decided to take the archivists' advice and pare it down somewhat, a process the professionals call appraisal. An easy place to start was the screenshots: the QR codes for flights long ago boarded, privacy agreements I had to click to use an app, emails that were best forwarded to my husband via text and a message from Words With Friends that "nutjob" was not an acceptable word.
There were some clear keepers, a selfie I took in Beijing with the artist Ai Weiwei in April 2015; a video of my eldest daughter's first steps in December 2017; and a shot of me on a camel in front of the Giza Pyramids in 2007, a photo I had purposely staged to recreate one we had on my childhood fridge of my great-grandmother in the same place doing the same thing, but with a disgruntled expression on her face.
Then there's the stuff I'm ambivalent about, like the many photos with long-ago exes, which for now I'll continue to hoard given that I'm still on good terms with them and I'm not going to fill up 12 terabytes any time soon.
There was also a lot of "data exhaust," as the security technologist Matt Mitchell calls it, a polite term for the record of my life rendered in Google searches, from a 2011 query for karaoke bars in Washington, D.C., to a more recent search for the closest Chuck E. Cheese. I will not keep those on my personal hard drive, and I may take the step of deleting them from Google's servers, which the company makes possible, because their embarrassment potential is higher than their archival value. Mr. Mitchell said super hoarders should pare down, not to make memories easier to find, but to eliminate data that could come back to bite them.
"You need to let go because you can't get hacked if there's nothing to hack," said Mr. Mitchell, the founder of CryptoHarlem, a cybersecurity education nonprofit. "It's only when you're storing too much that you run into the worst of these problems."
Inactive Accounts
Right now, it's cheap to hoard all this data in the cloud.
"The cost of storage long term continues to fall," said George Blood, who runs a business outside Philadelphia digitizing information from obsolete media, creating 10 terabytes of data per day, on average. "They may charge you more for the cost of the electricity -- spinning the disk your data is on -- than the storage itself."
Big technology companies don't often prompt people to minimize their data footprints, until, that is, they near the end of their free storage space. That's when companies force them to decide whether to move to the paid plans. There are signs, though, that the companies don't want to hold onto our data forever: Most have policies allowing them to delete accounts that are inactive for a year or more.
Aware of the potential value of data left behind by those who euphemistically go "inactive," Apple recently introduced a legacy contact feature, to designate a person who can access an Apple account after the owner's death. Google has long had a similar tool, prosaically called inactive account manager. Facebook created legacy contacts in 2015 to look after accounts that have been memorialized.
And that really is the ultimate question around personal archives: What becomes of them after we die? By keeping so much, more than we want to sort through, which is almost certainly more than anyone else wants to sort through on our behalf, we may leave behind less than previous generations because our accounts will go inactive and be deleted. Our personal clouds may grow so vast that no one will ever go through them, and all the bits and bytes could end up just blowing away.

In Bucha, a Final Rampage Served as Coda to a Month of Atrocities: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Hours before Russian troops began withdrawing from the suburban town, a Russian soldier left a trail of blood and devastated lives in a last paroxysm of violence.
BUCHA, Ukraine -- On one of the last nights of the Russian occupation of Bucha, a lone Russian soldier, drunk or high, went out looking for wine. He forced a 75-year-old resident at gunpoint along the street and made him bang on the doors of private homes.
What unfolded thereafter was a night of horror for two families that stands as a coda to a month of senseless killings by Russian troops in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. The Russian soldier left a trail of blood and devastated lives in a last paroxysm of violence only hours before Russian troops began withdrawing. His own unit fetched him in the morning, disposed of the bodies, and within hours, it was gone.
Nine months after those events, the dead have mostly been recovered and laid to rest, and people have picked up their lives and returned to work. But the grief of family members remains raw, and the pain inflicted on this small section of one neighborhood by this Russian soldier and his comrades still ripples through the Bucha community.
The soldier's rampage was not an isolated event. Nine soldiers from a unit based in the same wooded neighborhood have been charged in one of the first war crimes cases to reach court in Ukraine. The case centers on their cruel treatment of a civilian, an electrical engineer who was repeatedly detained and beaten in the last days of March.
The engineer, Serhiy Kybka, is losing his sight from injuries suffered in another severe beating he received later, by a Russian soldier who encountered him on the street after his release.
More than 450 people died in Bucha in one month, which was roughly 10 percent of the remaining population, a level that war crimes investigators say could amount to the crime of genocide.
Fifteen of those people died in an area of only a few blocks around Antoniya Mykhailovskoho Street, where the intoxicated soldier went on his rampage. They included six members of a seniors' home who died from cold and lack of medicines, and an 81-year-old woman found hanging in her garden.
Like their neighbors, the two men -- who, according to the mayor of Bucha, neighbors and family members, died at the hands of the lone soldier -- were victims of an undisciplined and brutal occupying army.
It was evening, not long before the 8 o'clock curfew on March 27, when the Russian soldier encountered Oleksandr Kryvenko and ordered him at gunpoint along the street to a large house set behind high walls. Bucha was in the dark, without electricity or internet.
Mr. Kryvenko was a teacher, who was living alone after helping his wife and her disabled daughter evacuate from Bucha. Trained as a pilot, he had spent his life working as an adjuster at Bucha's glass processing factory, acclaimed for his multiple mechanical inventions. Since then, he had run an educational center, sharing with generations of children his love of building model ships and aircraft.
His family said he would have sought to make peace with the Russian soldier. "We never had fights," said his wife, Svitlana Tkachuk, 55. "He was very even-tempered, always trying to come to an agreement."
When he and the soldier reached the house, Mr. Kryvenko banged on the gate and called out to the guard, a Ukrainian named Serhiy, whom he knew.
Serhiy opened the gate and the soldier, pointing his assault rifle, shouted, "I want wine, Boyar!" using an old-fashioned form of address for a Russian nobleman.
Serhiy explained he was just a guard. Russian soldiers had already seized all of the alcohol there was in the house, he told him.
"Then he put the gun to my temple, and asked, 'Do you have any wine?"' Serhiy recounted in an interview, providing only his first name. "I said: 'No.' I thought: 'This is the end."'
Serhiy braced for a bullet, but the Russian suddenly jerked his rifle upward and fired over his head, he said. The soldier ordered the two Ukrainians inside the house to look for alcohol. When he found there was none, he threatened to throw a grenade, but was so intoxicated that he could not manage to pull it from a pocket on the side of his combat pants.
Eventually, the soldier, who Serhiy said was ethnic Russian and looked about 35 years old, went off, taking Mr. Kryvenko with him.
Twenty minutes later, Serhiy said, the soldier's commander came by with a posse of three soldiers looking for the soldier. The commander said the soldier, whom he called Aleksei, was a troubled man, a veteran on his fourth war, and dangerous.
"Go and hide and don't stick your nose out for anything," the commander told him. "He's not in his right mind. He can shoot or throw a grenade."
For all of his dire warnings, the commander did not catch up with Aleksei or his hostage that night.
The two ended up not far away at the large property of a retired Ukrainian politician, Oleksandr Rzhavsky.
A former banker and member of Parliament, Mr. Rzhavsky, 63, was the leader of a small political party, and had run twice as a presidential candidate.
If anyone could handle a belligerent Russian soldier, it was probably Mr. Rzhavsky, who was Russian-speaking and carried himself with a natural authority. His "friends and his opponents agree on one thing -- he was always sincere," his family wrote in a death announcement in April. "The explanation for this is very simple -- his goal has always been peace and tranquillity on Ukrainian land."
Mr. Rzhavsky was perceived by many Ukrainians as pro-Russian, and in his writings before the war, he supported greater political and diplomatic efforts to reach agreement with Russia.
But he expressed great shock at President Vladimir V. Putin's full-scale invasion that began on Feb. 24. "Why now and through open war?" Mr. Rzhavsky asked in a Facebook post on March 2. "The brain frantically searches for various options, but does not find any that would not lead to even greater disaster."
Mr. Rzhavsky apparently let the Russian and his hostage into his house. They sat at the dining table in the main open-plan living area, and Mr. Rzhavsky gave them wine, according to neighbors familiar with events.
Mr. Rzhavsky's family declined to be interviewed for this article, asking for privacy during difficult times. But the two women in the house at the time, Mr. Rzhavsky's wife and his sister, were able to hide and escaped injury, according to Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk.
Something snapped that evening, and the soldier, Aleksei, opened fire on the two men at the table. Mr. Kryvenko was killed in his chair with three bullets to the chest, said his son, Yuriy Kryvenko. Mr. Rzhavsky was shot in the head. The soldier subsequently threw a grenade and injured his own leg in the explosion.
"There followed a night like an American horror movie," said a neighbor, Olga Galunenko. "This dark house, two bodies lying there and this crazy man with a rifle."
She said Mr. Rzhavsky's sister, Zoya, crawled out and hid in a cloakroom. "The wife was hiding in another place," Ms. Galunenko said.
Only in the morning did the soldier's unit come to find him. They took him away in an armored vehicle. They apologized for his actions to the women and even dug a grave and buried Mr. Rzhavsky in the garden. In a final act of cruelty, they dumped Mr. Kryvenko's body in a small copse across the street.
The Kyiv regional prosecutor has opened separate investigations into their deaths, for "violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder," according to the prosecutor's information office. There is an additional charge in the case of Mr. Kryvenko for violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The Rzhavsky family blamed the soldier for the killing of Mr. Rzhavsky in a joint Facebook post in April, saying that he was "drunk with his own impunity." They made no mention of Mr. Kryvenko. When his son came by looking for him at the beginning of April, they confirmed Mr. Kryvenko had been shot but said they did not know what had happened to his body.
"They thought he was some kind of bum, or alcoholic," Yuriy Kryvenko said bitterly, recounting in an interview how he pieced together details of his father's death. He spent the next week and a half searching for his father, desperately hoping that he had somehow survived.
At one point, the family became so desperate that it consulted a clairvoyant, who said that Mr. Kryvenko's body lay only two houses away from his home, but in the forest. As the snow began to melt, with the help of a friend, Mr. Kryvenko's son began to search the copse opposite Mr. Rzhavsky's home. They found a pair of shoes and uncovered his father's body. He was lying on a curtain from the Rzhavsky house.
Mr. Kryvenko was buried beside his mother in his home village outside Bucha.
"For 18 days, he lay on the ground, covered with leaves," Mr. Kryvenko's son said, recounting the pain of confirming his death. "At first, I didn't think it was him. When a person is missing, it is somehow easier."

Statue of Famed Writer Is at Center of France's Race Debate: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a restoration darkened the hue of a statue at the birthplace of the French writer, complaints ensued -- then vandalism.
BESANÇON, France -- The statue of Victor Hugo has loomed outside the city hall of his birthplace, situated on the Esplanade for Human Rights, since 2003, his white beard knotty, his black suit rumpled, his face cast down at his pocket watch.
Over the years, the colored bronze began to fade, turning to brown and green, until the mayor's office recently hired an expert to do a restoration.
And that is when the seemingly unremarkable refurbishment of a statue turned into another controversy in France about race, identity and the importation of American "woke" ideas about racial injustice -- what the French call "le wokisme."
The city hall's Facebook site announced the statue had been restored to reflect the original work by the celebrated Senegalese sculptor Ousmane Sow, who, it said, liked color and was not keen on "simple bronzes." The comments rolled in, some positive, others critical with one focus -- the color of Hugo's skin.
"We've gone from Victor Hugo to Morgan Freeman," wrote one commentator.
Mr. Sow, who was often called the Auguste Rodin of Senegal, died in 2016. A reporter from the Besançon newspaper called Béatrice Soulé, Mr. Sow's widowed partner in Dakar, Senegal's capital.
She agreed that the restoration was flawed, saying that the statue "looks like a Black Victor Hugo, which was never Ousmane's intention."
In a later interview with The New York Times, Ms. Soulé said that perhaps she spoke too freely. "It was a sentence I should never have spoken," she said. "And it let off a powder keg."
After another attempt at restoration, the color of the statue was returned to what Ms. Soulé considered "magnificent" and an "exact replica of the original," which reflected a man of light-brown skin. But what might have been forgiven as part of a complicated restoration process -- and quietly corrected -- was immediately sucked up into an ugly, protracted battle over social media.
Right-wing politicians accused the city's Green party mayor of literally trying to paint her politically correct views onto a French hero.
"Just how far will #wokisme and stupidity go?" Max Brisson, a senator with the center-right party, Les Républicains, wrote on Twitter.
National radio and newspapers picked up the story.
The town hall's switchboard was flooded by so many furious calls it was shut down.
Two nights after the town hall's initial Facebook post, masked men vandalized the statue, repainting Victor Hugo's face "a beautiful white color," as they called it online, adding that it was now "truly French, truly from Besançon." On the photograph they took of their work, they added a Celtic cross and the words "white power."
Two days later, the face of another statue created by Mr. Sow -- this one erected near the war memorial to represent "hope" -- was similarly vandalized with white paint.
"It signifies a sickness, a crisis in our society in relation to themes of immigration and racism," Mayor Anne Vignot said in an interview in her office in the city hall, which faces the Hugo statue. She was not involved in the statue's renovation beyond ordering it, she said, and she was still smarting at how discussion of race and identity had been weaponized in France to dismiss ideals she thinks should be upheld.
"I will always fight against discrimination," she said. "So, for me, if wokism is the fight against discrimination, then I reaffirm, I am woke."
On the other side are those like Xavier-Laurent Salvador, who co-directs the Observatory of Colonialism and Identity Ideologies, set up to challenge the use of critical race and gender theories in France.
He said the real danger was not far-right vigilantes, but attempts by a government to impose its race-centered view on society.
"Instead of removing the statues, we smear them, we repaint them to match something that is more in tune with the times," said Mr. Salvador, an associate professor of modern literature at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord. "It's a symbolic violence."
Mr. Salvador said he believed that the mayor and restorer had been trying to impose a race-centered view on society perverting the country's traditional universalist view where color and race are considered irrelevant, which he said both Mr. Sow and Hugo adhered to.
And the political storm had stopped them.
Unlike in the United States and other Western countries, statues in France were never toppled after George Floyd's murder in 2020 in Minneapolis and the global Black Lives Matter protests that ensued. President Emmanuel Macron of France rejected the idea, stating instead that the country would "look at all of our history together with lucidity."
However, many high-profile intellectuals, academics and members of Mr. Macron's government have viscerally rejected the progressive systemic theories on race, gender and post-colonialism as American imports that undermine French society, which considers itself colorblind.
"We are in denial of our colonial history," said Fabrice Riceputi, a historian in Besançon who specializes on the country's troubled colonial history in Algeria, which ended 60 years ago after a brutal war of independence that left 500,000 dead by French estimates, and 1.5 million by Algerian ones.
"Calling someone woke is a way of outright disqualifying all critical looks at history, all anti-racist actions, and it can degenerate into a witch hunt," he added. "And it legitimizes little minds, like the ones who did this in Besançon, whose actions can be violent."
Many were baffled at how the debate had come to Hugo's birthplace, and had targeted this statue in particular.
There are few writers as celebrated as Hugo in France. The 19th-century author of "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" and "Les Misérables" was born in this city close to the Swiss border. He stayed for only six weeks before his father's military regiment was moved and never returned. Still, Besançon has capitalized on those precious six weeks, naming Victor Hugo schools, a Victor Hugo square, erecting many Victor Hugo busts and statues, and opening a Victor Hugo museum in the stone townhouse where he was born.
There, Hugo is celebrated as a human rights crusader, who was exiled from the country for 19 years during the reign of Napoleon III, and who fought for freedom, liberty and the rights of people who were often excluded at the time, including slaves, prisoners, women and children.
"This political storm was the opposite of the Victor Hugo we show here," said Lise Lézennec, the cultural and scientific manager at the museum. "If the definition of being woke is awaken to discrimination, and combating against it, then we can say he was woke."
What Mr. Sow would make of the debate encircling his work is another question.
He was never a French citizen, but he became the first African to be named to France's prestigious Academy of Fine Arts. Long before that, he grew up in a working-class neighborhood of Dakar, when Senegal was still a French colony. When Mr. Sow first arrived in Paris in his early 20s, he had no money and was offered places to sleep in police stations and breakfast by bakers.
"He knew a France that was a land of welcome. He passionately loved France," Ms. Soulé said from Dakar, where she has established a museum dedicated to his work. The fight over his sculpture "would have bothered him," she added, "but he would have moved onto other things."
The process of adding color to bronze requires heating the metal with a blowtorch while painting on pigmented copper nitrate solution over many stages, explained Carlos Alves Ferreira, a bronze patina and restoration expert who carried out the restoration. It is finicky, and usually done in the privacy of an atelier.
Mr. Ferreira said he had sent Ms. Soulé photographs of his initial work by email and had been waiting for her approval when the political storm erupted. So he went back to do it again.
"I worked with Ousmane Sow for 20 years. Colors were part of his identity," said Mr. Ferreira. "I didn't want to betray him."
A week later, another Hugo statue that Mr. Ferreira had worked on was delivered to the city's Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology. This one featured the town hero completely nude, cast entirely in a traditional black bronze. It was done by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. There was no uproar.
"They didn't attack Rodin, a white French sculptor," Mr. Ferreira said. "He could make Victor Hugo completely nude. But a Senegalese sculptor, who made Victor Hugo look human, they think it's not a sculpture."
The perpetrators who vandalized Mr. Sow's Hugo statue were arrested. The two young men -- students at the local university -- were leaders of the far-right student group Cocarde Étudiante, said the Besançon prosecutor Étienne Manteaux. They face charges for vandalizing public property with racist motivations. While they have admitted to the vandalism, they do not believe what they did was a racist act. "It will be up to the court of Besançon to decide," Mr. Manteaux said.
No one has been arrested for vandalizing the second statue by Mr. Sow.
After the arrests, few of the people who had originally commented about the restoration denounced the racism on social media.
"Let me say now, it's horrible. It's eminently condemnable," Mr. Salvador said in an interview, adding that the men should go to prison.
On a recent sunny afternoon, many people stopped on the Esplanade of Human Rights to admire Hugo in his latest form, and to take photographs before it.
After Mr. Ferreira returned again, his face was a shade lighter, looking down at his pocket watch, as time was passing.
At his feet is engraved a line from one of his famous letters. "I condemn slavery," it begins, "I chase away extreme poverty. I teach ignorance, I treat sickness. I illuminate the night."
It ends with, "I hate hate."
