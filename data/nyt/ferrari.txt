Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the midst of the squabbles about actors and directors, there's always at least one screenplay to debate when Oscar nominations are announced. Last year, in fact, there were two, and I regularly get collared by people wondering: What in the world were "Glass Onion" and "Top Gun: Maverick" doing in the best adapted screenplay bucket? Adapted from what? Was there some secret book about fighter pilots or tech mogul whodunits they'd missed?
Nope. There's also no previous story about a Barbie who starts thinking about death and sets out on an existential journey. But that didn't keep the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the industry organization that gives out the Oscars, from kicking "Barbie" into the adapted category.
Judd Apatow declared the reclassification of "Barbie," the biggest movie of 2023 any way you slice it, "insulting" to its writers, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Moving "Barbie" from the best original screenplay category -- where it was the probable winner over films like "The Holdovers" and "Past Lives" -- to adapted changed its Oscar chances. Now, alongside a slate that includes the juggernaut "Oppenheimer," it's a horse race. I don't know what's going to win.
The academy posts some of its Oscar rules publicly, but not the ones that distinguish original screenplays from adapted ones. The Writers Guild of America, the union to which Hollywood's scripters belong, does. And for the most part, judging from Oscar history, they're in sync. Sequels, remakes and screenplays based on underlying material (including nonfiction, like a biography, that contains a narrative) are considered "nonoriginal," and in awards contexts are usually classed as adaptations. Original screenplays either are not based on material (generally as stipulated in the writer's contract), or they're based on a nonfiction book that doesn't have a narrative, like a study of sailing ships in the 19th century.
Here's the thing: according to the guild, "Barbie" is an original screenplay, but the academy disagreed. The academy also reclassified "Origin," which didn't receive a nomination but is an interesting case in this argument. Ava DuVernay crafted a screenplay that's sort of based on Isabel Wilkerson's nonfiction book "Caste," but is also a movie about Wilkerson (played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) researching and writing "Caste." It's a nesting doll of a screenplay, and the guild deemed it an original, presumably because the screenplay has a narrative the book lacks. The academy begged to differ. (An even more extreme example is Charlie Kaufman's screenplay for "Adaptation," a movie about a man named Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean's book "The Orchid Thief," and which was brain-twistingly categorized as adapted at the 2003 Oscars. It lost, to "The Pianist.")
The reclassification of "Barbie" has gotten more airtime, given its immense popularity. There are compelling arguments on both sides. For instance, there's a lot of "Barbie" already out there: The characters inhabit a world of their own, established through decades of marketing and even direct-to-video movies about them, and some of the film depends on knowing Barbie lore.
But for every example there's a counterexample. Yes, "Barbie" depends a little on your knowledge of what Barbie, Ken, Skipper and Midge stand for. But a lot of people who saw "Barbie" didn't have firsthand experience with the Barbie universe (some of us, ahem, weren't even allowed to play with them), and I doubt they were very confused. Your need to be familiar with Barbie as a concept to understand "Barbie" seems roughly equivalent to your need to know that rich kids drive convertibles to watch any number of teen movies.
Furthermore, do you know what movie once received a best original screenplay nomination? "Toy Story," which had some new characters (like Woody and Buzz Lightyear) but also the Slinky dog and the Potato Head family and the little green army men. It's not equivalent, but it's worth reflecting on the consistency of the academy's choices here.
There are also arguments on the original screenplay side, like the simple fact that the "Barbie" script is so imaginative it's practically a deconstruction of its own concept, and it doesn't take as its jumping-off point any specific existing story about Barbie. Gerwig and Baumbach, in other words, made it all up. What better definition of "original" exists?
Then again, Gerwig's screenplay for "Little Women" was up, correctly, for the adapted statuette (it lost to "Jojo Rabbit"). Those of us who love Louisa May Alcott's novel and know it inside and out are well aware that "Little Women" also deconstructs that novel, considering its cultural context and themes in a light that previous films haven't. But it's still clearly an adaptation. Is "Barbie" any different?
I have been turning all of this over in my head for weeks, arguing about it with my editor and my friends and, one day, my acupuncturist. I tweeted ambivalently about it. I don't have an answer to the "Barbie" question.
But in all the discourse I can't shake the feeling that there's something off about the Oscars' screenplay categories, and it ought to be fixed.
THERE'S A STRANGE AND THORNY LOGIC to the way the academy categorizes movies about real people and real events. Take a look at the list of best original screenplay nominees in the past 20 years, and a weird trend surfaces: A striking number of the nominees and winners are about real people and the events of their lives. The screenwriters, one assumes, had to use existing biographies, histories and memoirs to craft "The Trial of the Chicago 7," "Vice," "Green Book" and "Spotlight." (Those last two even won.) They're all movies for which the characters and basic plots existed before the screenwriters went to work, but according to the academy, they're all original. Indeed, this year, "Maestro" was nominated in the original category, which counted among its hopefuls "Air," "Rustin" and "The Iron Claw" -- all movies about real people, based very much on real events. ("May December," which also landed a nomination, is very loosely based on the Mary Kay LeTourneau case, but it's such a sticky wicket when it comes to these designations. My gut tells me original is where it belongs.)
But wait! Check out the history of the best adapted screenplay category, and it gets weirder. Among recent winners are "Argo," "12 Years a Slave," "The Imitation Game," "The Big Short" and "BlacKkKlansman" -- all screenplays about real people doing things that really happened. And this year, "Oppenheimer" was nominated in this category, triumphing over similar hopefuls like "Killers of the Flower Moon," "Ferrari" and "BlackBerry."
The more I thought about this, the more mystifying it seemed, until I realized what the difference was. It seems the dividing line here, in the academy's eyes, isn't about narrative, the way it is with the Writers Guild rules. It's about intellectual property.
Josh Singer and Bradley Cooper wrote "Maestro," which is about Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre, but since it's not explicitly based on a single book about either of them, the academy deems it original. The credits of "Oppenheimer," on the other hand, list Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin as writers alongside Christopher Nolan, because they penned the J. Robert Oppenheimer biography "American Prometheus." That film and the snubbed "Killers of the Flower Moon" take wildly inventive approaches to their source material, messing with time, structure, and even themes and characters, but with that explicitly named underlying material in their credits, they're considered adapted.
But oddly, stories that are completely fictional can be treated in almost the opposite manner. The rules state that all it takes for a screenplay to count as "adapted" is for some of its characters to have existed previously. That's why both "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Glass Onion" landed in adapted. All sequels are, in the eyes of the academy (and the guild), adapted. No matter that the story was completely invented by the screenwriter.
In a metaphysical sense, Leonard Bernstein "existed" far more than Detective Benoit Blanc. But only one of them triggers the adapted designation. Without diving into some kind of ontological rumination, I think we can agree that this isn't really about "existence." It's about copyrights owned by corporations -- in other words, it's about intellectual properties.
And that makes a measure of sense. Movies, especially in Hollywood, are an uneasy marriage of commerce and art, and commerce tends to be the leading foot. In the United States, nobody owns the character of a public figure (not even the figure), but someone owns the copyright to a biography. So there you are.
There are other goofy matters in the divided screenplay categories. Consider the fate of "Moonlight" (2016), which the director and screenwriter Barry Jenkins based on the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney's unpublished, unproduced play "In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue." When the film reached awards season, the Writers Guild classified Jenkins's screenplay as original, given that McCraney's play hadn't, in a sense, been entered into the public record before the film appeared. The academy moved it to adapted. And it won.
Or consider "Whiplash" (2014). Its writer-director, Damien Chazelle, reportedly didn't realize the drama had been put in the adapted category until Oscar ballots went out to voters. He'd written the full screenplay years earlier but, like many independent filmmakers, needed to raise the money to make it, and so he shot a slice of it as a proof of concept. The resulting short went to Sundance, where it won awards and got him the money needed to proceed with the full film. That, apparently, was enough to designate it as adapted. (It didn't win, though it nabbed three other Oscars.)
The truth is that like many things in Hollywood, these decisions are made by people with subjective opinions and ideas that can shift depending on who's making the call and when. They're not wholly unlike the legendarily inconsistent movie ratings -- partly based on rules and partly just vibes.
THERE'S NO DIVINE MANDATE to have two writing-focused categories rather than one or 28 or three. (Until 1956, the Oscars gave out three awards, including one for best story; it was eliminated with the demise of the old studio system.) But having two makes sense, if the goal is to "recognize excellence in cinematic achievements." The first celebrates the skillful imagining (literally, making images of that which has not been seen) of a new story, one that hasn't been told before. The second celebrates a reimagining.
Setting aside certain cinephiles' squeamishness about characterizing a screenplay only in terms of its story (I am among these, but that's another tale for another time), this is, I think, about as correct as we're ever going to get. In a perfect world, the voting members would read each script and vote based on its merit as literature, given the many things that audience members never know about -- beautifully crafted description, for instance -- or innovation that sometimes pops up on the page. This year, for instance, Nolan's "Oppenheimer" screenplay is a favorite in the adapted category; it's written in the first person, which makes for a highly unusual reading experience. (Check it out. It's cool.)
The point of these two categories, though, is to signal that overlapping but distinct craft choices must be made in two different kinds of writing. The first involves inventing a story in a nonexistent world. The second involves reshaping and refashioning something existing into something new. That could involve translating between mediums with different formal conventions. Or it could mean finding a new way into the story entirely, illuminating it in a fresh way.
Obviously there's a whole mess of tangly bits to deal with here, and entire fields of academic study, often deeply bound to their time and place, are devoted to hollering about what counts as adaptation. The Oscars will never be the place for snooty cinephiles like myself to exercise our theories and pet squabbles.
But there's some caprice in all of this that might be fixed, a little, if only to help people like me sleep better at night (and filmmakers have a better sense of what they've just made). If the goal of the academy is to reward filmmakers for reaching new heights in their crafts, then pegging the categories to rules that respect their actual work is more in line with the aims than making them about I.P. Turning a true story into a movie requires adaptation, whether there's one biography or a dozen involved. If the powers that be wish to preserve the odious sequel rule, treating individual characters' existence as the litmus test, then fine. Just be consistent, and don't try to tell me that Bayard Rustin was wholly invented by his screenwriter.
Will that mean changing the names of the categories? No, I don't think so. Would that change the designation of "Barbie"? It wouldn't. But it would make it all much cleaner.
There's another way, of course, that would focus the categories more narrowly on the invention or adaptation of story beats. In that world, "Barbie" is original, and so is "Whiplash." But "Maestro" becomes adapted; "Glass Onion" becomes original. And "Oppenheimer" probably stays where it is. The result of this, of course, would be to push all (or nearly all) movies based on true stories to the adapted category, leaving the original category for pure invention.
Would that be bad? I think not. It might remove incentive for the kind of boring soup-to-nuts biopics that used to show up a lot at the Oscars, though they've fallen off lately, and bring more inventive biographical films, like the ones we've been lucky enough to see this year, to the foreground. In other words, it would mean true innovation in the craft would be rewarded in the adapted category. And it might also inspire highly original and inventive sequels.
Who knows? Like everything else in show business, whacking one mole causes three more to pop up. But if the result is focusing the awards more on craft than on big corporate holdings, we'll all be winners.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is a repository for new TV shows. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both recent releases and classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors -- if they know where to look. We're here to help.
'2 Days in New York' (2012)
Julie Delpy, who plays the female lead in Richard Linklater's "Before" trilogy, created a chatty-couple series of her own with her 2007 treat "2 Days in Paris" and this sequel from 2012. In "New York," she crafts an opposites-attract story for her brash, neurotic Frenchwoman Marion and Marion's Brooklynite boyfriend (well played by a slightly restrained Chris Rock). We then watch as their precariously balanced relationship implodes under the stress of a visit from Marion's family. It's both a romantic comedy and a comedy of manners, in which the politeness of familial interactions is capsized by their subtext, and the relationship bends until it nearly breaks. (For more traditional romance, try "The Notebook" or "Crazy Rich Asians.")
'The Sound of Music' (1965)
The director Robert Wise's film adaptation of the Broadway smash by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse is the epitome of its cinematic era: a big, splashy widescreen Technicolor musical extravaganza. It all works, thanks to Wise's unapologetically epic approach and the power of the performances -- namely, Christopher Plummer's distinguished turn as Captain von Trapp and especially Julie Andrews as Maria, a former nun who becomes governess to his seven children, and "goes at it happily and bravely."
'Girl, Interrupted' (1999)
Angelina Jolie won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her scorching turn in this adaptation of the best-selling memoir by Susanna Kaysen. It's the kind of role that is written to steal the show -- a ferocious yet charismatic troublemaker who gets an equal proportion of laugh lines and breakdowns. But there's much more to recommend here: the sensitive and atmospheric direction by James Mangold (whose varied filmography went on to include "Logan," "3:10 to Yuma" and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"); the heartbreaking supporting work by Brittany Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg; and the especially striking lead performance of Winona Ryder as Kaysen's avatar, a suicidal neurotic whose time in a Massachusetts mental hospital is both harrowing and healing. ("Shoplifters" and "Master Gardener" are similarly intense dramas.)
'The King of Comedy' (1983)
Robert De Niro (in what our critic called "one of the best, most complex and most flamboyant performances of his career") stars as Rupert Pupkin, a sweatily desperate would-be stand-up comedian who becomes convinced stardom is in his grasp if he can only secure a late-night talk show spot with the Johnny Carson-style host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) -- and is willing to do anything to get it. Martin Scorsese directs with uncharacteristic modesty, bottling his customary flamboyance to trap his audience with this intensely unlikable and possibly unstable protagonist; in the process, he creates an early iteration of the now-ubiquitous "cringe comedy."
'Pineapple Express' (2008)
The "Freaks and Geeks" stars Seth Rogen and James Franco reunited for this uproariously funny stoner action comedy, penned by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and directed by David Gordon Green, then best known for modest indie dramas like "George Washington." That odd combination of backgrounds and specialties could've made for a real mess, but Rogen and Goldberg's script is witty, Green's direction is sure-handed, and Rogen and Franco are a pitch-perfect team, their opposites-attract chemistry recalling '80s buddy movies like "48 Hrs." and "Midnight Run." Manohla Dargis praised the film's "waves of playful nonsense."
'Grandma' (2015)
Lily Tomlin's first starring role in over a quarter of a century was tailor made for her: the straight-talking, foul-mouthed lesbian poetess academic Elle -- a near-perfect vehicle for her unique screen presence, biting and bracing but never alienating. The narrative surrounding her seems slight, with the central mini-road trip taking place over a single day and the film running barely an hour and 15 minutes (not counting credits). But the writer-director Paul Weitz ("About A Boy") turns this grandmother and granddaughter's monetary mission into a journey through Elle's past, with visits to acquaintances and lovers unearthing unexpected emotions, regrets and laughs along the way. It's "wry and insightful," a tart, character-driven comedy-drama. ("Juno" is a similarly spiky exploration of these themes.)
'Contagion' (2011)
The director Steven Soderbergh brought his multi-thread "Traffic" approach to this 1970s-style disaster movie, telling the story of a deadly pandemic, the researchers and doctors who try to stifle it, and the cynics who try to profit from it. (It became the subject of renewed interest in the spring of 2020, for obvious reasons.) Some filmmakers might have trouble balancing the movie's large cast (which includes Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet) and its wide scope; Soderbergh somehow does the opposite, marshaling the film's large canvas to propel the narrative with an urgency and overwhelming dread. The result is one of his most efficient pictures -- and his scariest. (Damon is also excellent in "Ford vs. Ferrari.")
'Lost' (2004-2010)
One of modern television's most discussed and dissected, analyzed and agonized, loved and loathed programs is this six-season story of a group of plane-crash survivors, trapped on a mysterious and (presumably?) deserted island. This simple setup proved fertile soil for shocking twists and copious fan theories, as well as for an admirably all-rules-are-off sense of storytelling, regularly veering off into extended flashbacks, flash-forwards and even the occasional flash-sideways. Some of its loose ends are frustrating, and some of the answers are unsatisfying. But it's nonetheless a bold experiment in longform storytelling, and one whose "Wait, WHAT?" cliffhangers make for essential binge-watching. (For more mystery, try "Under the Banner of Heaven.")

Comedy
'Darrell Hammond: Cray'
Through Jan. 20 at 7 p.m. at Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Manhattan; audible.com/ep/minettalane.
A master impersonator on "Saturday Night Live," Darrell Hammond embodied more than 100 celebrities in his 14-season run as a cast member -- most famously playing Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Sean Connery. But it took some time for Hammond to learn to love being himself.
Through years of therapy, Hammond has confronted his past as a survivor of child abuse and addiction, and his healing journey has yielded a best-selling 2011 memoir, "God if You're Not Up There, I'm F*cked"; an acclaimed 2019 documentary, "Cracked Up"; and "Darrell Hammond: Cray," a one-hander originally titled "The Darrell Hammond Project" that he has been developing since 2015, around the same time that he returned to "S.N.L." as its announcer.
Now under the direction of Christopher Ashley, who won a Tony Award in 2017 for "Come From Away," "Cray" is getting its New York premiere, with Audible recording the performances for a later release.
Tickets to the show are $ 59 and up at Ticketmaster. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Lizzie No
Jan. 19 at 7 p.m. at Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, Brooklyn; union-pool.com.
The Bronx-born singer, guitarist and harpist Lizzie No cut her teeth in New York, playing as part of the Brooklyn folk outfit Devil and the Deep Blue Sea in the mid-2010s before putting out two albums of her own. Just before releasing her third, "Halfsies," on her own Miss Freedomland label, No has relocated to Nashville -- a move that underscores her ties to country music.
Recorded between No's old hometown and her new one, "Halfsies" channels influences like Patty Griffin and overtly name-checks others like Lucinda Williams. A travelogue of sorts, housing both ethereal folk harmonies and explosive, rock-fueled barn burners, the album is animated by stories of physical and spiritual passage -- of hunting for personal freedom and dreaming of collective liberation.
Lizzie No returns to Brooklyn to mark the release of "Halfsies" on Friday. Tickets for the show are $ 18.54 from dice.fm. OLIVIA HORN
Julia Bullock
Jan. 19 at 7:30 p.m. at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; carnegiehall.org.
With her versatile sound and sensitive approach to new works, the soprano Julia Bullock leads the vanguard of contemporary opera, but she is also a maven of American music across genres. At this recital at Zankel Hall on Friday, she will joined by the pianist Bretton Brown, who frequently collaborates with her, as well as with the composer George Benjamin.
In curating a program that draws connections between modernist music, golden-age musicals and American folk songs, Bullock and Brown show themselves to be masters of juxtaposition: Alban Berg's "Altenberg Lieder" will rub shoulders with new arrangements of songs by Connie Converse and Elizabeth Cotten, while Richard Strauss and Samuel Barber will mingle with Richard Rodgers and Bob Dylan. Those who saw Bullock at the Park Avenue Armory in September will find plenty of new material here; those who didn't may want to seize the chance to catch her in a more intimate setting before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the spring.
Tickets start at $ 85 at Carnegie Hall's website. GABRIELLE FERRARI
Kids
Family Activity Weekends: Ring In the New Year
Through Feb. 4, 11 a.m.-5 p.m., at the South Street Seaport Museum, 12 Fulton Street, Manhattan; southstreetseaportmuseum.org.
Bell ringing has been more than a means to celebrate holidays and special occasions; historically, it also helped ensure smooth sailing.
During Ring In the New Year, a drop-in program on Saturdays and Sundays in the South Street Seaport Museum's introduction galleries, children learn how a ship's bell signaled the beginning and end of crew members' four-hour watches.
Young visitors can try out a hand-held bell and go aboard the 1908 lightship Ambrose, formerly a floating lighthouse, and hear how boats' bells were safety features, too. Museum guides will ring the vintage vessel's original bronze model, which sailors used to communicate with other ships and warn of fog and other hazards.
Prefer a greater immersion in maritime history? The seaport also offers guided visits to the 1885 tall ship Wavertree and separate timed-entry tours of the Ambrose. (Advance registration for the Ambrose tours is strongly advised.)
For the littlest museum visitors, the indoor exhibition "Seaport Discovery: Exploring Our Waters With Eric Carle" highlights this beloved picture-book author's ocean-themed art.
All activities are included in museum admission, which in person is pay-what-you-wish. Online reservations are a $ 1 minimum. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
'One From the Heart: Reprise'
Opening Jan. 19 at IFC Center, 323 Sixth Avenue, Manhattan; ifccenter.com.
Francis Ford Coppola didn't rest on his laurels after his string of masterpieces from "The Godfather" through "Apocalypse Now." He kicked off the 1980s with the musical "One From the Heart," which, like Martin Scorsese's "New York, New York" (1977), fuses the aesthetics of the Freed unit with an ostensibly unvarnished, more "real" romantic story: Frannie (Teri Garr) and Hank (Frederic Forrest), a couple of five years living in Las Vegas, break up, then do the town with potential alternatives, Ray (Raul Julia) and Leila (Nastassja Kinski).
Made at great personal cost to Coppola, the movie is often regarded as an expensive misfire, but that reputation sells it short. Coppola has tweaked it before, but "One From the Heart: Reprise," the version that opens on Friday at IFC Center, reorders early scenes. Frannie and Hank now meet Ray and Leila before they split up. This changes the protagonists' motivations and creates some flagrant continuity errors. But it doesn't alter what is distinctive (and dazzling) about the film: Coppola's choice to shoot it entirely on soundstages, the overlay of songs performed by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle, and the production designer Dean Tavoularis's inventively fantastical Vegas.

Full text: While "Oppenheimer," "Barbie" and "Killers of the Flower Moon" are likely to do well, the directors race is hardly set and other categories are open, too.
When it comes to predicting the Oscars, you ultimately have to go with your gut ... and mine is in a state of agita.
That's what happens when there are simply too many good movies and great performances to all make the cut: Even the hypothetical snubs I'm about to dole out have me tied up in knots.
Which names can you expect to hear on Tuesday, when the Oscar nominations are announced? Here is what I project will be nominated (with my predictions in bold) in the top six Oscar categories, based on industry chatter, key laurels from the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, and the nominations bestowed by the Screen Actors Guild, Producers Guild of America and Directors Guild of America. Well, all of those things, and my poor, tormented gut.
Best Picture
Let's start with the safest bets. "Oppenheimer," "Barbie" and "Killers of the Flower Moon" scored top nominations from the producers, directors and actors guilds last week and I expect each film to earn double-digit Oscar nominations. "The Holdovers" and "Poor Things" are secure, too: Though they didn't make it into SAG's best-ensemble race, both films boast lead actors who've won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award. If this were an old-school race, these would be the five nominees.
But there are five more slots to fill, and I project the next three will go to "Past Lives" and "American Fiction," passion picks with distinct points of view, as well as "Maestro," the sort of ambitious biopic that Oscar voters are typically in the tank for. I'm also betting that the French courtroom drama "Anatomy of a Fall" and the German-language Holocaust drama "The Zone of Interest" find favor with the academy's increasingly international voting body. (Even the Producers Guild, which so often favors big studio movies over global cinema, found room to nominate that pair.)
There are still a few dark horses that hope to push their way into this lineup, like "The Color Purple," "May December," "Society of the Snow" and "Origin." But I suspect these 10 are locked and loaded.
Best Director
For as safely settled as the best picture lineup now appears to be, the best director category is anything but. This voting branch is famous for going its own way, often outright rejecting studio directors like Ben Affleck ("Argo") and Denis Villeneuve ("Dune") in favor of more esoteric picks. Aside from the "Oppenheimer" director Christopher Nolan, the race's presumed front-runner, none of the other contenders should feel secure.
I do think it helps that Martin Scorsese ("Killers of the Flower Moon") and Alexander Payne ("The Holdovers") are the only auteurs in the mix who've earned more than one nomination from this branch in the past: Payne has gotten three, while Scorsese has a whopping nine. A large fan base that consistently turns out for you can be valuable in such a competitive category.
The DGA nominees Greta Gerwig ("Barbie") and Yorgos Lanthimos ("Poor Things") delivered two of the year's most lavish, distinctive movies, but I still fear that one (or even both) could fall victim to a Villeneuve-level snub. There are two surging international directors who may show up instead: Justine Triet, who won the prestigious Palme d'Or for "Anatomy of a Fall," and Jonathan Glazer, who directed "The Zone of Interest." I think the artier members of this branch might peel off from Lanthimos to reward Glazer's challenging vision, but this is a category where anything could happen.
Best Actor
The "Holdovers" star Paul Giamatti has come on strong during the televised portion of awards season, taking the Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical and the Critics Choice award for best actor, period.
His two strongest competitors are likely to be the never-nominated Cillian Murphy, the high-cheekboned face of "Oppenheimer," and the nine-time nominee Bradley Cooper, who has a showy, transformative role in "Maestro." Murphy won the Golden Globe for best actor in a drama, but may be held back by sentiment that the real star of "Oppenheimer" is Nolan, while Cooper's candidacy is hindered by a lack of televised prizes so far. Both men feel like shoo-ins to be nominated, but they'll need to pick up a SAG Award next month to stay neck-and-neck with Giamatti.
I feel good about predicting a nod for the "American Fiction" lead Jeffrey Wright, who earns big cheers at every awards show when his name is read, even if that affection hasn't yet resulted in a win. But the fifth slot is in flux. Though the "Rustin" star Colman Domingo earned a SAG nomination and Andrew Scott ("All of Us Strangers") has a lot of fans, I think Leonardo DiCaprio ultimately gets in: It's true that he was dealt a surprising snub by the actors guild, but "Killers of the Flower Moon" is a bigger contender than the films Domingo and Scott are fronting, and there tends to be a strong correlation between the best actor and best picture categories.
Best Actress
Would any of the other categories kindly consider donating a few nomination slots to the best actress race? There are simply too many formidable candidates to have to whittle these women down to five, and on nomination morning, the snubs here will no doubt be the most painful.
At least Lily Gladstone ("Killers of the Flower Moon") and Emma Stone ("Poor Things") have no reason to worry. Those two Golden Globe winners should be considered the lockiest of locks, and the real race is who gets to keep them company in the category.
Carey Mulligan ("Maestro") ticks off so many boxes that this branch responds to -- real person, unusual accent, prosthetics-aided aging -- and has shown up at every precursor so far. Sandra Hüller ("Anatomy of a Fall") missed a SAG nomination, but international actresses rarely fare well there, and I think the academy will be eager to reward Hüller for a tremendous year that also included her supporting performance in "The Zone of Interest."
Natalie Portman does some of the best work of her career in "May December," but the film simply isn't catching on with the guilds and she now has to be considered a contender on the bubble. Ditto Fantasia Barrino-Taylor, who has some powerhouse moments late in "The Color Purple" but wasn't able to manage a SAG nomination. And though the "Past Lives" star Greta Lee is worthy, her work may be too understated to surpass such flashy competition.
That leaves us with Annette Bening, SAG-nominated for her tough, physical role in "Nyad," and the "Barbie" linchpin Margot Robbie. I give Robbie the edge since her film is such a strong contender across the board, but effervescent comedy is the sort of thing voters often take for granted, and Robbie made her tricky role look as easy as breathing.
Best Supporting Actor
It's "Barbenheimer" redux in this category, where the "Oppenheimer" foe Robert Downey Jr. and the "Barbie" beau Ryan Gosling will probably go head-to-head for the gold. Robert De Niro, so memorably malevolent in "Killers of the Flower Moon," is also in a strong position to be nominated after nods from SAG, Critics Choice and the Golden Globes, plus a mention on the BAFTA longlist.
After those three contenders, things get hazy.
A pair of buzzy young actors could fill the last two spots: Charles Melton ("May December") and Dominic Sessa ("The Holdovers"). But the academy is weirdly resistant to nominating young men -- a problem they don't have at all when it comes to young women -- and neither Melton nor Sessa broke through at SAG. The actors guild did nominate Sterling K. Brown, who plays Wright's brother in "American Fiction" and could certainly score with the academy if the film performs well.
Still, with so many performances to choose from, I think voters may default to two veteran actors from one of the season's strongest films, "Poor Things." Willem Dafoe already managed a SAG nod for playing Emma Stone's cuckoo creator, and though his co-star Mark Ruffalo was dealt a surprising snub by the guild, SAG gave him a similar cold shoulder for "Spotlight" before the Oscar nominations came in with a last-minute save. Dual supporting nods from one film has been a hot trend in recent years, and if there's any race where that's likely to happen, it's this one.
Best Supporting Actress
Is Da'Vine Joy Randolph from "The Holdovers" this year's heir apparent to Ke Huy Quan and Troy Kotsur? Those two supporting actors swamped their competition all season on the way to absolutely assured Oscar wins in recent years, and Randolph has been following suit, bagging critics' awards right and left and taking every televised trophy so far.
Though Randolph is far ahead in this race, three other actresses have showed consistent strength, earning citations on the BAFTA longlist as well as nominations from the actors guild, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards. In other words, save room for Jodie Foster ("Nyad"), Emily Blunt ("Oppenheimer") and Danielle Brooks ("The Color Purple").
If "Barbie" overperforms, America Ferrera could sail in on the strength of her galvanizing monologue, while Taraji P. Henson may be nominated alongside Brooks if "The Color Purple" mounts a comeback. But I have a feeling this category will be filled out by someone who is the lone representative from her movie, like the SAG nominee Penélope Cruz (ferocious in "Ferrari"), Rosamund Pike (delicious in "Saltburn") or my pick, Julianne Moore, who could mount a last stand for "May December" in a category that's prone to curveballs.

Guatemala’s New President Is Sworn In, Despite Efforts to Stop Him

GUATEMALA CITY — Despite staunch resistance from his opponents in the government, anti-corruption crusader Bernardo Arévalo was inaugurated early Monday morning as Guatemala’s president, a turning point in a country where tensions have been simmering over widespread graft and impunity.
His inauguration had been scheduled for Sunday, but members of Congress delayed it, and concerns persisted about whether it would happen at all. But after an international outcry and pressure from protesters, Arévalo was sworn in shortly after midnight, becoming Guatemala’s most progressive head of state since democracy was reestablished in the 1980s.
His rise to power — six months after his victory at the polls delivered a stunning rebuke to Guatemala’s conservative political establishment — amounts to a sea change in Central America’s most populous country. His landslide election reflected broad support for his proposals to curb graft and revive a teetering democracy.
But as Arévalo prepares to govern, he must assert control while facing off against an alliance of conservative prosecutors, members of Congress and other political figures who have gutted Guatemala’s governing institutions in recent years.
“Arévalo has the most thankless job in Guatemala today because he arrives with exceptionally high expectations,” said Edgar Ortíz Romero, an expert on Guatemalan constitutional law. “He’s been given a budget for a Toyota when people want a Ferrari.”
Arévalo’s opponents in Congress moved to rein him in late last year, approving a budget that would severely limit his ability to spend on health care and education, two of his top priorities.
But finding resources to spend is just one of the difficulties confronting Arévalo. More urgently, as his opponents in Congress showed again Sunday, he faces multiple challenges from Guatemala’s entrenched establishment, aimed at quickly crippling his ability to govern.
The power struggle playing out in Guatemala, a nation of 18 million, is being closely followed throughout Central America, a region on edge over the expanding sway of drug cartels, the exodus of migrants and the use of authoritarian tactics in neighboring countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua.
“This is a unique event in the country’s history,” said Javier García, a 31-year-old engineer, who was among the thousands who turned out to celebrate the inauguration in the capital, Guatemala City. “Now I hope those who lost the election understand this once and for all.”
The transition of power was anything but orderly. After he burst onto Guatemala’s political scene last year, Arévalo faced an assassination plot, his party’s suspension and a barrage of legal attacks aimed at preventing him from taking office. His opponent in the presidential race, a former first lady, refused to recognize his victory.
In the capital, speculation swirled in recent days that prosecutors would seek the arrest of Arévalo’s running mate, Karin Herrera, potentially derailing the inauguration because both the president-elect and vice president-elect need to be present for the transfer of power to be legitimate.
Guatemala’s highest court issued an order last week shielding Herrera from arrest, giving her and Arévalo a reprieve. But the same court sowed confusion Sunday when it allowed his conservative opponents to remain in the running to retain control of Congress.
Members of Congress opposed to Arévalo then spent hours trying to consolidate their hold on the chamber, effectively delaying the transfer of power as much of the country remained on tenterhooks. But in a twist Sunday night, Arévalo’s party managed to win leadership of Congress, clearing the way for the swearing-in.
Prosecutors and judges opposed to Arévalo had already gone on a judicial onslaught soon after the national election. Seeking to cast doubt on Arévalo’s victory at the polls, where he won by more than 20 percentage points, prosecutors obtained arrest warrants for four magistrates who served on Guatemala’s top electoral authority, alleging corruption in the acquisition of election software. The four magistrates were all outside the country when the warrants were issued.
On Thursday, the attorney general’s office arrested Napoleón Barrientos, a former interior minister, on the grounds that he had refused to use force to maintain order in October against protesters demanding the attorney general’s resignation.
Such moves have grown common in Guatemala since 2019, when conservative political figures shut down a pioneering United Nations-backed anti-corruption mission. Dozens of prosecutors and judges who had been trying to take on graft fled into exile.
Pushing back, the United States, the European Union and multiple leaders in Latin America threw their support behind Arévalo, a sociologist and former diplomat. That support was visible Sunday as the delays seemed to put the transfer of power in doubt.
“There is no question that Bernardo Arévalo is the president of Guatemala,” said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who led a U.S. delegation to the inauguration. She added, “The world is watching.”
The Biden administration maneuvered for months in support of Arévalo after he shocked many in Guatemala, including members of his party, by squeaking into a runoff election that he went on to resoundingly win.
Washington’s support for reform stands in contrast to the role it played in Guatemala decades ago. The United States backed the Guatemalan military during a long, brutal civil war; one military dictator during the 1980s was later convicted of genocide for trying to exterminate the Ixil, a Mayan Indian people. In 1954, the CIA engineered a coup that toppled a popular, democratically elected president, Jacobo Arbenz.
After that coup, Arévalo’s father, Juan José Arévalo, a former president who is still admired in Guatemala for allowing freedom of speech and creating the social security system, spent years in exile around Latin America.
The younger Arévalo, a soft-spoken sociologist and diplomat, was born in Uruguay during that time and was raised in Venezuela, Mexico and Chile before the family could return to Guatemala.
As efforts intensified last month to prevent Arévalo from taking office, the United States imposed sanctions on Miguel Martínez, one of the closest allies of the departing president, Alejandro Giammattei, over widespread bribery schemes.
And in a pivotal move, the U.S. authorities in December imposed visa restrictions on nearly 300 Guatemalans, including more than 100 members of Congress, accusing them of undermining democracy and the rule of law as they tried to weaken Arévalo and keep him from being inaugurated.
“The pressure from the United States has prevented a coup d’état; without that, we wouldn’t be here,” said Manfredo Marroquín, the head of Citizen Action, an anti-corruption policy group. “The Americans are like insurance: there in times of crisis.”
Still, the U.S. support of Arévalo has revealed fissures in Guatemala. In his last weeks in office, Giammattei, who was barred by law from seeking reelection, grew increasingly vocal in his criticism of the American sanctions and the international support for Arévalo.
Dealing another blow to Arévalo, Giammattei withdrew Guatemala from an anti-drug task force created in 2020 with the United States. That move could weaken Guatemala’s ability to combat drug trafficking groups, which have been expanding their sway around the country.
At the same time, Arévalo’s efforts to forge alliances have revealed how challenging it will be for him to govern. This month, he announced the first Guatemalan Cabinet in which women would account for half of all ministerial posts, but the celebration of that milestone was short-lived.
A member of a major business association was named to the new Cabinet, prompting calls that Arévalo, who has hewed to centrist policies, was drifting to the right. Another Cabinet nominee withdrew after old comments surfaced in which she criticized a prominent Indigenous activist.
Indignation also arose because only one minister in his Cabinet was Indigenous, despite the crucial role that Indigenous groups played in protesting against the efforts to keep Arévalo from taking office. Nearly half of Guatemala’s population is Indigenous.
“There is an expectation that this new government will be different,” said Sandra Xinico, an anthropologist and Indigenous activist. “But we’ve seen once again how Indigenous peoples are excluded from the political process.”

Full text: Lakefront Verbania in Italy's Piedmont seeks to attract flower lovers with its mild climate, spectacular gardens and wild nature.
Even as the group of flower aficionados flitted around a high-ceilinged room admiring just-clipped camellias with fanciful names like "Pink Lassie" and "Paradise Petite," single petals floated lazily to the paneled wood floor, forming colorful mounds.
"You only have to look at a sasanqua and it loses its petals," said Gianmario Motta, the president of the International Camellia Society and one of the world's leading experts on the sasanqua, a camellia species native to Asia that blooms during the winter.
Indeed, these camellias' star turn as the protagonists of the Winter Camellia Exhibition in Verbania, a northern Italian lakefront town not far from the Swiss border, was booked for a mere weekend, a brief moment in the limelight before they withered away.
But if the exhibit, showcased in a 19th-century villa, was necessarily short-lived, Verbania's administrators have more ambitious plans involving a plant that has thrived on the lake since it made its first appearance here almost 200 years ago. In recent decades, the cultivation of camellias, as well as other ornamental plants like azaleas and rhododendrons, has become a mainstay of the local economy, while lush gardens and parks in and around Verbania have attracted legions of those who appreciate nature, particularly plants.
The camellia "is the excellence of Lake Maggiore and of Verbania," the town's mayor, Silvia Marchionini, said in opening the exhibit in late November. "The history and the floriculture in this territory represent a valuable asset to be cherished and also to grow," she added, as officials work to bolster Verbania's tourism season beyond its traditional start with spring blossoms in March.
Mr. Motta chimed in that "2023 was a great year for Verbania and for the camellia." His International Camellia Society, which promotes knowledge, cultivation and development of camellias, held its biannual world congress here last spring, with camellia lovers alternating visits to local gardens with the presentation of papers on petal blight and other plant catastrophes.
Verbania also inaugurated a public camellia park featuring hundreds of varieties in the garden of a villa abutting the town's auditorium on the lake. A room dedicated to books on camellias is expected to open in the villa itself, which is also the town's library. The park was dedicated to Pietro Hillebrand, a local expert known as "the gentleman of the camellias," who died in 2019.
"You do this for passion," said Valeria Sibilia, since 2000 the president of the Verbania Garden Club, which helped establish the park. On an afternoon in November she gently scolded a group of Pakistani cricket players who had set up among some of the nascent plants of the villa. They cheerfully moved away. "It's important to respect the plants," she said.
Lake Maggiore's love affair with this hardy plant took off not too long after camellias first arrived in Italy. Lore has it that camellias were introduced to the Bourbon rulers of Naples around the 1780s by the British naval commander Horatio Nelson (if truth be told, the dates are a bit off, historically).
The provenance of the plants (mostly from Japan) "gave camellias a certain aura" of exoticism, said Daniele Bosi, director for Italy of the International Camellia Society, and they quickly became a favorite of the aristocracy, who collected and gave the plants, which propagated easily, as gifts.
By the mid-19th century, "camellia mania" had trickled down to the bourgeoisie. Its popularity coincided with the Risorgimento, as the unification of Italy is known. Nurseries and breeders dedicated new camellias to the movement's leaders, like Garibaldi (two cultivars are dedicated to him) and King Victor Emmanuel II and his offspring.
Moreover, the dominant colors of camellias -- white and red -- plus the green of the leaves were reminders of the Italian flag. "We think that is one reason the camellia became so popular during the unification," Andrea Corneo, the president of the Italian Camellia Society, explained at the congress last year.
On Lake Maggiore, camellias thrived in the mild microclimate and a soil with an acidity conducive to their growth. Wealthy residents from nearby Milan and Turin filled the landscaped gardens of their summer homes with ornamental varieties, vying to create the richest collections.
It wasn't always rosy. There was a lull in popularity in the early 1900s, before Italian enthusiasts revived interest in the 1960s, and on Lake Maggiore, camellias now flourish not only in private gardens but also in condominium courtyards, roundabouts and many other public areas.
Mr. Corneo said a recent visitor from England had been surprised to find camellias to be such a prominent part of the urban greenery. Where she came from, "they're relegated to botanical gardens and seen as a rarity," he said.
Mr. Corneo and his family own the Villa Anelli, one of the most historic camellia gardens in Italy, with dozens of species, including 50 winter camellias. The founder of the villa's collection, Antonio Sevesi, co-wrote the International Camellia Register, a compilation of varieties that is still in use today. Mr. Corneo provided several of the cultivars planted at the new camellia park in Verbania.
Last spring, camellia enthusiasts from around the world traipsed through the Villa Anelli, as well as other historic gardens, to admire rare specimens.
At the Savioli nursery on a hill overlooking Verbania, the group got lost among some 700 camellia varieties, both ancient and modern. "Who knows what this bee crossed with," said Lara Savioli, the daughter of one of the nursery's owners, pointing at a multicolored camellia where various hues vied for attention. "It's a bit of an anarchic pollination," she said.
Visitors from abroad were impressed.
"It's incredible. They don't bloom like this in America, they don't bloom this profusely," said Mark Crawford of Valdosta, Ga., a plant pathologist. "Our climate's so different."
Mr. Crawford is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on a project to import camellia azaleas from China, and those plants are quarantined for two years in Beltsville, Md., because they can be a host to a citrus pest. So "they're in jail," he said with a laugh. "There are real strict rules."
Another congress attendee, Forrest S. Latta, a lawyer from Mobile, Ala., said that while he grew camellias back home, those in Verbania were bigger, which he attributed to higher elevation, more sunlight and drainage that emulates the mountain slopes of China and Japan, where many varieties originate. "The camellias are in heaven, so we're in heaven," he said. "If one were looking for an Uffizi for camellias, they'd come to a place like this," he added, referring to the famous gallery in Florence.
"There's always been tourism attentive to botany, and it's always been present in Verbania, which for many years lived off plant nurseries and their exports," said Roberto Ferrari, the director of Villa Taranto, a botanical garden in Verbania that is considered one of Italy's finest gardens. It is among Verbania's major tourist attractions, along with the Borromeon Islands, named for the family that still owns two of them, both landscaped with rich botanical gardens. With more than a million visitors a year, the province of Verbania is the second most visited attraction in Piedmont, behind Turin, said Ms. Marchionini, the mayor.
"In recent decades we've invested a lot in tourism because of the excellence of our landscape, nature, beaches, cycling paths and historic hotels," she said in an interview. "It's not just our identity, it's an economic scenario."
"We're a little paradise," she said.

Two Titans of 2023 Lead Screen Actors Guild Nominations: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The summer blockbusters each garnered four nominations. Notable snubs included Leonardo DiCaprio of "Killers of the Flower Moon."
Box office behemoths "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" led this year's nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which were announced Wednesday morning. Each film picked up four nominations, including ones for the guild's top ensemble prize.
In addition to that nomination, "Barbie" earned additional nods for lead actress Margot Robbie and supporting actor Ryan Gosling, as well as for its stunt ensemble. The other three nominations for "Oppenheimer" were for lead actor Cillian Murphy and the supporting performers Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. Both Murphy and Downey prevailed in their categories during Sunday's Golden Globes.
Other nominees for the top award included "American Fiction," "The Color Purple" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Still, the latter movie was dealt one of the morning's biggest snubs when star Leonardo DiCaprio failed to crack the best-actor lineup. "May December" received the coldest shoulder, going zero for three with contenders Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore and Charles Melton.
Rarely do actors win the Oscar without first scoring a nomination from their own guild. Last year, the entire quartet of SAG winners went on to repeat at the Oscars, while the SAG ensemble winner, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," also took the Oscars' best picture prize.
But there is still some wiggle room in each category for a SAG-snubbed actor to earn an Oscar nomination, as the likes of Paul Mescal ("Aftersun"), Michelle Williams ("The Fabelmans"), and Andrea Riseborough ("To Leslie") managed last year. And since the SAG ensemble award favors films with large casts, more intimately scaled movies like "Past Lives" and "The Holdovers" shouldn't be counted out.

VERBANIA, Italy — Even as the group of flower aficionados flitted around a high-ceilinged room admiring just-clipped camellias with fanciful names like “Pink Lassie” and “Paradise Petite,” single petals floated lazily to the paneled wood floor, forming colorful mounds.
“You only have to look at a sasanqua and it loses its petals,” said Gianmario Motta, the president of the International Camellia Society and one of the world’s leading experts on the sasanqua, a camellia species native to Asia that blooms during the winter.

Peruvian Puzzler: The Case of the Doubtful Dinero: [Science Desk]

Full text: Scientists recently analyzed a Peruvian 10-cent piece with an unexplained origin.
A decade ago, a funny money mystery fell into the hands of scientists and students at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.
The university had been acquiring 19th- and 20th-century Peruvian coins from local dealers, and graduate students in the chemistry department were analyzing the pieces for their thesis work. But one coin, a 10-cent piece known as a dinero, stood out.
The dinero was marked "1899." The problem was that official records indicated no coins of that denomination were minted in Peru that year -- according to the people who made the money, the coin never existed.
Most international coin catalogs don't list 1899 dineros, said Luis Ortega, a chemist at the university. And in the rare cases that they do, there is often only a note of "counterfeit" with no further detail, Dr. Ortega said. "No one was able to provide more information about it."
Now Dr. Ortega and Fabiola Bravo Hualpa, a doctoral student, believe they have shed new light on the mystery of the coin that came from nowhere. In a paper published last year in the journal Heritage Science, they described how they subjected one of the two known 1899 dineros to a barrage of scientific analyses, illuminating its possible origins and the role it might have played during an unstable era of South American history.
To the naked eye, the 1899 coin resembles other dineros: It's silver in color and features the same coat of arms and seated woman that represents the goddess of liberty. And it's remarkably similar in size to other dineros minted around the turn of the 20th century -- about the dimensions of a U.S. dime.
But when Dr. Ortega and Ms. Bravo Hualpa bombarded the 1899 coin with X-rays and measured the light it re-emitted, they determined that the dinero was largely made of copper, zinc and nickel. This alloy is known as nickel silver. It's commonly used to make silverware and ornamental objects and has a silvery appearance, but it contains no silver. Genuine dineros produced by the Lima Mint, on the other hand, are roughly 90 percent silver.
Dr. Ortega and Ms. Bravo Hualpa also found that the 1899 dinero contained traces of iron, cobalt and lead. Those impurities imply that the coin was counterfeited long ago, not more recently, the researchers suggest. Such contaminants are characteristic of older alloys because of limitations in technology at the time. "The refining methods were not as good as they are now," Dr. Ortega said.
The presence of impurities, paired with the coin's worn faces, suggests that it was produced in the 19th or 20th centuries, the researchers concluded. But given that nickel silver wasn't widely used for coins or tokens in Peru at that time, it's likely that this coin was created abroad, the researchers suggest. Its producer might have therefore been wholly unaware that no dineros were officially minted in 1899.
"The counterfeiter probably didn't realize that that coin didn't exist," Dr. Ortega said.
He said that an influx of low-value coinage would have been welcomed in Peru at the dawn of the 20th century. The country's economy was reeling from the recent War of the Pacific, and the government was focusing on printing larger-denomination paper bank notes to pay off international loans; in 1899, the Lima Mint produced roughly one-tenth the number of silver coins it produced just five years earlier.
As a result, people in Peru were using coins from neighboring nations or even cutting their own country's coins in half to conduct small transactions. "Counterfeiters found a field of opportunity," Dr. Ortega said.
Dineros were low-denomination coins used by everyday people. Studying this coin, and the economic and political situation that prompted its creation, can therefore be illuminating. "If you want to study our society, you don't want to look at a Ferrari," said Laura Perucchetti, an archaeometallurgist at the British Museum in London, not involved in the research.

Dr. Ortega is not finished studying counterfeit coins and their historical context. He plans to meet with a collector based in Lima who amassed an assortment of coins ostensibly minted from the 1830s through the 1960s. Another 1899 dinero has already surfaced in that collection, and he is on the lookout for more.
"There must be a few around," Dr. Ortega said.

Full text: Erik Messerschmidt worked with the directors Michael Mann and David Fincher to create cohesive worlds that feel nothing alike.
Michael Mann's new drama "Ferrari," about several important weeks in the life of the racecar driver and manufacturer Enzo Ferrari, is many things: biographical drama, thriller, period costume film, and also a story about business rivalries, domestic disputes and personal grief. Adam Driver plays the automotive magnate as a man divided between his obsessive pursuit of professional glory and his straining responsibilities as a husband and father. Accordingly Mann approaches these two worlds with different, even diametrically opposed styles. There are intense, breakneck racing sequences and dark, elegiac domestic scenes, and little in between.
"There's really two distinct aesthetic sensibilities in the film," Erik Messerschmidt, the film's director of photography, said in a recent interview. "Michael wanted the interpersonal drama parts of the film to be more classically made than the racing."
Messerschmidt said that for the heavier moments Mann "wanted to reference Italian Renaissance paintings," with their pronounced shadows and dense compositions; the racing scenes, by contrast, made use of cutting-edge technology and contemporary techniques.
Messerschmidt also served as the cinematographer on "The Killer," David Fincher's recent thriller about a hit man dealing with the fallout of a job gone wrong, now streaming on Netflix. Looking at the two films side by side reveals the marked contrasts in the directors' approach.
"Their use of the camera, in particular, is very different," Messerschmidt said. "Michael is often looking for those spontaneous moments, and I think he's a little more shoot-from-the-hip than David is. Whereas David is a very precise, methodical filmmaker -- he's one of a kind that way."
Here, Messerschmidt explains how the look of "Ferrari" was achieved on and off the track and how it compared with his work on "The Killer."
Vintage Speed
"Ferrari" opens with a brisk montage of grainy black-and-white newsreel footage that shows Enzo in his youth racing for Alfa Romeo. Mann, who had been trying to make "Ferrari" since the early 2000s, spent a lot of time poring over archival footage of motor racing from this era, and he and the crew watched it often to help faithfully capture the look. While shooting an early racing sequence, Mann had the idea to open with Enzo himself on the track, to remind the audience that he used to be a racer.
The scene is "a combination of actual archival footage and visual-effects compositions of Adam driving a period-correct racecar from the '20s," Messerschmidt explained. Driver had to actually get on the track: it's not a sound stage or a green screen but footage of him that's been rotoscoped, which accounts for why this shot looks so realistic.
By contrast, Messerschmidt and Fincher spent a lot of time adjusting images for "The Killer" in postproduction to hone the look of key locations in Paris, the Dominican Republic and Chicago, which they wanted to differentiate aesthetically. "All of those places have a unique look, in terms of architecture, design and how the light falls," the cinematographer said. Paris, for instance, was depicted with "this kind of split-tone color palette of cool shadows and warm highlights."
While each location had its own visual identity, Messerschmidt said he was conscious of "still keeping them within one cohesive world."
"I didn't want it to feel like a ransom note of color palettes," he joked.
Racing Along
The second half of "Ferrari" focuses on his efforts to win the 1957 Mille Miglia, a wildly competitive race that covers almost 1,000 miles on public roads. To capture its blistering intensity, Mann got extremely close to the vehicles, as in this shot of two cars speeding neck and neck on a winding mountain overpass. The camera team, Messerschmidt said, was following just behind in a Porsche Cayenne. "We were driving these cars at the actual speeds," Messerschmidt said. "Michael was not interested in faking it or undercranking the camera."
As in this shot, many of the driving scenes have a rawness that emphasizes just how fast and dangerous the racing is. The style, Messerschmidt said, "has a very vérité feel to it," which adds to the sensation of raw power. "These cars are visceral, they are loud, and the engines shake, and the suspension is stiff. That was something we wanted to show from very beginning."
Night Drive
Part of the Mille Miglia race takes place on an open stretch of road in the dead of night. The only sources of light are the cars' headlights, which illuminate the rain-slick road and reflect off one another. Shooting this sequence without conventional movie lighting, Messerschmidt said, was a matter of necessity, because there was no obvious place to put up lights. "I had a lot of anxiety about that scene," he said. "I didn't really know what I was going to do."
Eventually, he said, he "decided to roll the dice and just do it with the headlights."
"The Killer" makes striking use of nighttime as well, in part because the movie is about a man who "lives and lurks in the shadows," Messerschmidt said. "We wanted to work in this murky world. It felt like an appropriate thing to lean into that in the film."
Up Close and Personal
When "Ferrari" is not on the track, the camera has a tendency to probe the characters closely, sometimes getting right up in their faces. In this sequence on the factory grounds, the lens gets so near Enzo that his features become almost a blur. "When Michael really wants to get the audience into a character and bring you close, he will put you literally close to the actor," Messerschmidt said.
To achieve this "very odd point of view," Messerschmidt employed a "skater scope," which extends the lens about 10 inches from the body of the camera. That extension "means we can get very close to the actor without the Steadicam itself hitting the actor's knees," he explained.
Fincher also wants to use the camera to understand his characters in "The Killer," but "the camera has no personality in the way that Michael's camera does," Messerschmidt explained. "Ferrari" has "a very subjective camera," while Fincher "is working with a conversation between subjectivity and objectivity." The camera "reinforces" the unnamed executioner played by Michael Fassbender.
This is clear in the many precise frames and symmetrical compositions -- an aesthetic that mirrors the hit man's meticulousness. "When the killer is in control and confident, the camera is extremely confident, in terms of how we operate it and how the shots cut together," Messerschmidt said. "When the killer loses control and starts to fall apart, the camera falls apart as well."
Memories at Sunset
A centerpiece of "Ferrari" takes place at an opera, where Enzo has an intense emotional reaction. Mourning the loss of his son, he thinks back to their time together, as the film cuts to brief, gauzy flashbacks, including this one, in which the two are playing in a field. The camera is very low to the ground, and the sun is just setting over the horizon; the delicate style is reminiscent of the work of Terrence Malick.
"I think I get now maybe how Malick works," Messerschmidt said. For this flashback, he and Mann started "working with the actors and the camera, improvising a bit," he said, adding that they just happened to catch this interaction. "It was very spur of the moment. It wasn't previsualized."
Small and Agile
At times during the racing sequences in "Ferrari," the camera is fixed to the body of the car itself, stuck alongside as the vehicle zooms at extraordinary speeds. In this shot, we see the bold Ferrari logo against a whooshing blur of grass and road. Because they were sticking a camera onto a car that was pushing its technical limits, "we had to be very conscious of weight distribution and aerodynamics," Messerschmidt said. Their choice for these shots was a Red Komodo camera, "which is about the size of a Rubik's Cube." As Messerschmidt noted, "This would have been a very challenging film to make with a large, cumbersome motion picture camera."

Sparkling Values for New Year's Eve: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: The holidays require sparkling wine, there's no getting around that. But does it need to be Champagne?
That's a particularly good question this year, as Champagne is more expensive than ever. You may be able to find a bottle for under $ 40 somewhere, but decent bottles now begin around $ 45, and very good nonvintage bottles from producers like Pierre Péters or Louis Roederer are $ 70 to $ 75.
These price increases have occurred for reasons that have affected businesses around the world. Rising interest rates along with pandemic supply-chain disruptions have raised prices of raw materials like grapes, bottles and corks. Labor costs have also gone up.
Champagne is not the only wine region with rising prices. Almost all wines cost more than they did last year, not to mention five years ago. It's just that, among sparkling wines, Champagne started at a higher price. The increases may be similar in percentage terms to other sparkling wines, but it feels worse. Will prices ever come down? I'm not holding my breath.
Fortunately, great sparkling wines are now made everywhere that makes wine. This year I decided to seek out distinctive sparkling wines that provided satisfying alternatives to Champagne. I found 12 that were exceptional, at different price levels, in New York retail shops.
Notice I called them alternatives, not replacements. No other sparkling wine tastes just like a good Champagne, which is the product of its place and culture. But other regions make sparkling wine that can be just as distinctive in myriad ways.
Sekt, the sparkling wine of Germany, and cava, the sparkling wine of Spain, are both undergoing rejuvenations with a growing number of producers putting far more care and effort into making terrific examples of what used to be cheap afterthoughts.
The best producers in these regions use local grapes, like riesling in Germany and xarello, parellada and macabeu in Spain. Sparkling Vouvray and Montlouis are made of chenin blanc. These all can be wonderful, but they don't taste like Champagne.
Other places prefer to use traditional Champagne grapes like chardonnay and pinot noir. These don't taste like Champagne, either, as they come from different terroirs. They are not necessarily better or worse, just different.
I chose only sparklers that are made by the same method as Champagne, in which a finished wine is refermented with a sweet solution and yeast in a sealed bottle. This second fermentation produces carbon dioxide, which, with nowhere to escape, carbonates the wine.
I skipped sparkling wines made by other methods. Pétillant naturels, for example, are made by the ancestral method in which wine is bottled while still fermenting, which creates bubbles. Other popular wines, like almost all Proseccos and cheap sekts, are carbonated in big tanks.
The differences in texture are often discernible. Wines made by the Champagne method tend to be more elegant, and maybe a little more formal, although it's certainly not hard to find harsh, coarse Champagnes.
I'm not at all suggesting you don't drink Champagne for the holidays. Good Champagnes are singular, and I have many producers whom I recommend. But if you are looking for excellent sparklers that mostly won't cost as much as Champagne, here are 12 options, from least to most expensive.
Parés Baltà Cava Brut Nature NV, 11.5 percent, $ 20
This might have been a classic cava, if all cavas were farmed organically and made with as much care. Instead, it stands out. Parés Baltà uses only the traditional grapes, xarello, parellada and macabeu, with the emphasis on xarello. It's fresh, lively and dry. Other good Spanish sparklers to seek out include Gramona, AT Roca, Recaredo and Raventós I Blanc. (U.S.A. Wine Imports, New York)
Ferrari Trento Brut Metodo Classico NV, 12.5 percent, $ 27
I'm not sure any country drinks more sparkling wine than Italy. Ferrari's wines, from the Trentino-Alto Adige region of Italy, are generally superb. This entry-level bottle, made entirely from chardonnay, is sleek and graceful, impeccably balanced and a great value. (Taub Family Selections, Boca Raton, Fla.)
Clotilde Davenne Crémant de Bourgogne Brut Extra NV, 12.5 percent, $ 27
Clotilde Davenne makes small amounts of Chablis and Burgundy as well as Crémant de Bourgogne, the sparkling wine of Burgundy. This bone-dry blend of chardonnay and pinot noir, farmed organically near the town of Chablis, is ultrafresh, lacy and elegant. (Bonhomie Wine Imports, South Orange, N.J.)
Jo Landron Atmosphères Méthode Traditionelle Extra Brut NV, 11.5 percent, $ 28
Jo Landron, a scrupulous biodynamic farmer and careful winemaker, has long been one of my favorite Muscadet producers. He also makes this terrific sparkling wine. It's made roughly of a third chardonnay, a third pinot noir -- two Champagne grapes -- and a third, folle blanche, a local grape known for its high acidity. The combination is certainly lively, but also airy and elegant. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)
Roederer Estate Anderson Valley Brut NV, 12.5 percent, $ 33
Roederer Estate, the Mendocino County outpost of the excellent Champagne house Louis Roederer, has long been not only one of California's biggest sparkling wine producers, but one of the best. This is, not surprisingly, made with Champagne grapes, pinot noir and chardonnay, but grown in Anderson Valley terroir. It doesn't taste like Champagne. It's more herbal, less mineral, but it's got a good Champagne's freshness and elegance.
François Chidaine Montlouis-sur-Loire Brut Nature Méthode Traditionelle 2020, 12 percent, $ 33
Chenin blanc is the most unusual grape. It has the uncanny ability to be graceful and bone dry yet taste sweet, courtesy of its characteristic honeysuckle flavors. That combination works beautifully in this sparkling chenin blanc. It's lacy, light and floral with that gorgeous hint of honey. François Chidaine farms biodynamically and regeneratively, and he also makes excellent still chenin blancs. (Polaner Selections)
Domaine de Montbourgeau Crémant du Jura Brut Zero NV, 12 percent, $ 36
Domaine de Montbourgeau is one of the Jura's most undersung producers. Its wines are almost always precise and expressive. That's especially true of this sparkling wine, made entirely of chardonnay. It's dry, focused, racy and elegant, subtly herbal and deliciously refreshing. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant, New York)
Bénédicte et Stéphane Tissot Crémant du Jura Extra Brut NV, 12.5 percent, $ 38
Unlike Montbourgeau, Domaine Tissot is a celebrated Jura estate. Stéphane Tissot farms biodynamically and is a thoughtful, conscientious winemaker. This Crémant differs considerably from the Montbourgeau. It's half chardonnay, with the remainder mostly pinot noir with some trousseau and poulsard. It's bigger and more voluminous, with pronounced citrus and herbal flavors. If imagining a Crémant du Jura evening, serve the Montbourgeau as an aperitif and the Tissot following. (Camille Rivière Selection/Fruit of the Vines, Long Island City, N.Y.)
Peter Lauer Saar Riesling Brut 2020, 12.5 percent, $ 40
Florian Lauer, the current proprietor of this excellent German estate, makes wonderful sparkling rieslings. They are what the Europeans like to call gastronomic wines, bottles that are best served with food. I've had numerous Lauer sparklers, but this is one of the more unusual bottles. It's profoundly herbal, with an aftertaste of anise. It's also paradoxical, austere yet generous, light yet rich and intense. Altogether, a thrill. (Vom Boden, Brooklyn, N.Y.)
Schramsberg North Coast Blanc de Blancs Brut 2020, 12.6 percent, $ 40
Schramsberg was one of California's modern pioneers of sparkling wine, with 1965 as its first vintage. A lot has changed in California's sparkling wine world since then, with many small producers now making excellent wines. But Schramsberg is still going strong. This blanc de blancs, made entirely from chardonnay, is creamy, toasty, crisp and fresh.
Corte Bianca Franciacorta Essente Dossagio Zero NV, 12 percent, $ 48
Franciacorta in Lombardy has long been an area dominated by big companies making expensive but not particularly interesting sparkling wine. That has changed, with many smaller, distinctive producers like Corte Bianca making outstanding bottles. This is made from chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot blanc and erbamat, a rare local grape, all farmed organically. It's lively yet creamy and elegant, lightly floral and savory. Other Franciacorta producers I especially like include Divella, Arcari e Danesi and Cà del Vént. (Artisanal Cellars, White River Junction, Vt.)
Racines Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay Grand Reserve Sparkling Wine NV, 12.5 percent, $ 82
Racines is a new collaboration between Étienne de Montille and Brian Sieve of Domaine de Montille in Burgundy and Rodolphe Péters of the excellent small Champagne producer Pierre Péters. This is the first bottle I've tried and it's superb. It's yeasty, creamy and supremely elegant, made from organically farmed chardonnay. It's delicious now but will age well for 10 years.

Full text: The director's portrait of the Italian racecar impresario roars to life on the road, but home is a torment. Adam Driver stars with Penélope Cruz and Shailene Woodley.
In "Ferrari," Adam Driver looms like a colossus as Enzo Ferrari. Driver is tall and rangy, but he looks even bigger here -- wider, too -- partly because Enzo wears boxy suits with linebacker shoulders so broad they nearly scrape the edges of the frame. The most famous man in Italy aside from the Pope, Enzo makes blood-red racecars with sexy curves and supercharged engines. The Commendatore, as he's called, looks more like a tank. He seems an ideal vehicle for Michael Mann, a filmmaker with his own line of beautiful obsessions.
Set largely in 1957, the movie "Ferrari" focuses on an especially catastrophic year in Enzo's convoluted life. He makes some of the most coveted cars in the world: There's a king impatiently waiting in Enzo's office not long after the story takes off. (That royal personage, who's short, is anxious that, this time, his feet will reach the pedals easily.) All the world wants something from Ferrari, who in turn seems to care only about his racecars, ravishing red beasts that roar out of his factory near his home in Modena and into the world's fastest, most lethally dangerous races, where records, machines and bodies are routinely broken.
What makes those cars and Ferrari run permeates the movie, which opens with the young Enzo (Driver) behind the wheel, racing and all but flying. The jaunty, propulsive jazz on the soundtrack give the scene inviting charm (you're ready to jump in Enzo's car, too), as does the smile that spreads across his face. It's one of the few times he cracks one. Soon after, the story downshifts to an older Commendatore, now gray and imperial and facing bankruptcy as he struggles both with work and two households with two very different women. One greets him on an especially angry morning by firing a gun at him, which does get his attention.
Death stalks Enzo and this movie, which energetically gathers momentum even as Mann busily juggles the story's numerous parts and warring dualisms. Written by Troy Kennedy Martin, the film is based on Brock Yates's cleareyed 1991 biography "Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine," if only in strategic part. (Martin also wrote the original, car-centric caper film "The Italian Job.") While the book traces its subject (and brand) from cradle to beyond the grave, the movie condenses the auto maker's life into a brief, emblematic period and a series of dramatic oppositions, including two sons, one living and one dead, as well as the road cars that Enzo sells and the racecars that are his life's passion.
The movie is similarly divided between genres, and like Enzo himself, it toggles between the melodrama that defines his domestic life and the thriller that takes off every time one of his racecars does. Mann spends a lot of time on Enzo's bifurcated personal life, which is split between his house in Modena and a pastoral farmhouse outside the city. In Modena, he lives in a gloomy mansion that he shares with Laura (Penélope Cruz), his wife and business partner, and with his mother (a ferocious Daniela Piperno), a gorgon who haunts the other inhabitants like a curse. It's no wonder that he regularly flees to the farmhouse to be with Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley), and their young son, Piero (Giuseppe Festinese).
With these women, Mann expands the usual narrow parameters of the great-man-of-history narrative but only Enzo's relationship with Laura proves of interest. Woodley is serviceable as Lina, a tousled bland homebody who, for the most part, is either in bed or whipping something up in the kitchen. Despite the couple's issues -- Lina wants Enzo to legally recognize their son so that he can carry the Ferrari name -- their relationship is too pedestrian, or maybe simply too happy, to be productive, at least for this director. Mostly, Lina and Piero function as the temperate, tolerant counterpoint to his miserable marriage.
A lot of effort has gone into frumping up Cruz for that marriage; it's a lost cause. Her Laura is no more dowdy than Anna Magnani, the mythic Italian actress who's a clear reference, certainly visually, for the character. Cruz presents an inherently glamorous picture, however much Laura has been dulled by the death of her and Enzo's only son. Cruz lets light into this often unmodulated character, whose emotional palette ranges between bitter resentment and barely contained rage, adding intricate, complicating notes. You see the faded humor in Laura's sardonic bitterness, and maybe something that once approached joy. You also see the toughness and intelligence of the woman who helped build the Ferrari brand and the legend.

Driver lets you into Enzo as far as possible given the material, though the actor's warmth and decency never fully mesh with his character's cool, consuming self-interest. Like a number of Mann's other more memorable protagonists, Enzo is a gravely serious, hard-working closed-fist of a man who often seems ready to strike. That threat can keep you both on edge and fixed on these characters, and is crucial to their violent charisma. If brutality were all there was to them, though, they would be forgettable, nothing more than cheap villains. Part of what makes them mesmerizing is the play between their existential torrent and the titanic willed effort it takes for these characters to hold all of it (whatever that it is) in check.
Enzo is intimidating, at times threatening and, as you're often reminded, driven and divided. Yet partly because he's clinging to an established enterprise rather than building it up his intensity feels fueled more by power than by desire. What come across here is his autocratic mercenariness, disregard for other people's lives and, mostly, his love of cars. In one early morning scene at Lina's, he pushes his car down the driveway so he doesn't wake her or Piero. It's a nice touch, though reads like a bid to humanize Enzo. What's more revealing are the images of him after he drives off, an interlude that Mann analytically breaks down into shots of Enzo's hands working the wheel and gears while his feet dance on the pedals.
Mann seems to have put serious time behind the wheel himself because the racing is flat-out thrilling. Many of the most pleasurable scenes take place when the drivers (played by, among others, Gabriel Leone, Jack O'Connell and Patrick Dempsey) are hard at work and barreling around a track or down an ominously empty country lane, as in a climactic open-road event called the Mille Miglia. Mann shoots this lunatic race from every conceivable angle -- with cameras in and out of cars, bearing down on drivers' faces, agitatedly hovering midair -- creating an immersive, visceral intimacy that, as engines whine and thunderously roar, you feel in your bones. Enzo may have also once felt it, but now he's the boss with the stopwatch.
Outwardly, Enzo has the makings of a natural addition to Mann's stable of troubled and tormented men, anguished souls that he gives voice to with his sublimely expressionistic filmmaking. Yet Enzo remains out of reach. One issue is that Mann needs a character with soul, not just a calling. He keeps searching for one and, to that end, he periodically shows Enzo in a close-up so extreme that the auto maker's face crowds the foreground, dominating your sightlines much as he dominates his life. These images convey Enzo's isolation from much of his world, with all its living and needlessly dead. You're about as deep inside this character's head as imaginable, though given the glimpses you catch of what's inside and all the damage that Enzo does, it is the filmmaker more than the character who holds you rapt.

Full text: To close the show's six-season run, the episodes open in 1997 and depict a heartthrob prince, an offensive party costume, several deaths and a marriage.
After seven years of seamlessly blending royal fact and fiction, the second part of "The Crown" Season 6 brings the lavish Netflix show to a close.
The final six episodes, which arrived on Thursday, open in 1997, and follow several story lines concerning members of the royal family and aspects of Tony Blair's tenure as Britain's prime minister. (Bertie Carvel plays Blair.)
A grieving Prince William (Ed McVey) unexpectedly becomes a worldwide heartthrob and falls in love while studying at the University of St. Andrews. The queen (Imelda Staunton) grapples with her own mortality following the loss of her sister, Princess Margaret (Lesley Manville), and the Queen Mother (Marcia Warren), in a short space of time. In the finale, set in 2005, Prince Charles (Dominic West) finally marries his longtime partner, Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams).
Here is a look at what The Times and other news outlets reported at the time. You can find more in the TimesMachine archive browser. (Warning: This feature contains spoilers for Season 6 of "The Crown.")
Episode 5, 'Willsmania'
In this episode, Prince William returns to school soon after Princess Diana's funeral. He attended Eton College, the prestigious British boarding school known for educating prime ministers, Nobel laureates and, of course, aristocracy.
In April 2017, the British tabloid The Sun reported that William returned to school just four days after the ceremony and received handwritten condolence letters from more than half of his fellow students.
On the show, he is also handed a sack of letters from his fans across the globe, especially adoring young women. It is the beginning of the so-called "Willsmania" of the late '90s, when William became the focus of intense international attention. This new heartthrob status is also made clear when he visits Vancouver with his father and younger brother Harry (Luther Ford), and young women line up to catch a glimpse.
On June 22, 1998, The Times reported that the trip to Vancouver in March of that year "alerted the palace to what a pinup the 6-foot-1-inch prince with the shock of blond hair, blue eyes and downward looking shy smile so reminiscent of his mother has become to teenage girls."
The following year, Christina Ferrari, the managing editor of Teen People, a youth-focused version of People magazine, told The Times that Will was "an international superstar almost on the level of Leonardo DiCaprio."
Episode 6, 'Ruritania'
In Episode 6, Queen Elizabeth seems threatened by the public's positive reception of Blair, the new prime minister. "People really do seem to love him, and see him as a true son of England," she says, "and a unifying national symbol, in a way they used to see me."
In February 1999, Warren Hoge wrote in The Times that Blair was a "youthful, articulate and visionary leader" and "the most popular prime minister in British history."
On the show, we see Blair telling the queen about his attempts to persuade President Bill Clinton to send troops to Kosovo to drive Serb forces out. The queen is concerned to learn that the prime minister has a new nickname: "King Tony." According to a Times report from 1999, he was given that sarcastic nickname by attendees of that year's NATO Summit, because of all the media attention he was getting.
According to that Times report, Blair made a "grand entrance" in Washington before embarking on a "media blitz" to garner American public support for fighting the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. (White House officials said Clinton "did not feel upstaged.")
Episode 7, 'Alma Mater'
Viewers meet an 18-year-old Prince William, who informs journalists that he has met the requirements to attend his chosen college, St. Andrews, where he will go after taking a year off from his studies.
In "The Crown," the prince receives his exam results while with his family, but in reality, he had already left Britain for his year abroad. In video footage by ITN of Prince William at a news conference on Sept. 29, 2000, he told journalists that when he received his results, he was "in the middle of nowhere" in a jungle in Belize.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At St. Andrews, the episode follows Kate Middleton (Meg Bellamy) and William as they adjust to university life. Despite William initially dating a woman named Lola Airdale-Cavendish-Kincaid and Middleton a man named Rupert, there is clear romantic chemistry between the pair.
According to The Times of London, Prince William dated two women before Kate: Olivia Hunt, who they newspaper called "a brainy sort," and Carly Massy-Birch, whom "William had a two-week snog with," according to an anonymous source. Somebody else (also anonymous) told the paper that Kate had apparently dated Rupert Finch, "a handsome Norfolk boy," whom she met when she arrived at college.
Episode 8, 'Ritz'
Flashbacks to the young princesses Margaret (Beau Gadsdon) and Elizabeth (Viola Prettejohn) celebrating the end of World World II on May 8, 1945, or V-E Day, show the pair sneaking out of Buckingham Palace to party among the public on the streets and at the Ritz hotel. An initially shy Elizabeth finds a large group of Americans swing dancing, and she joins in after some initial hesitation.
"You dark horse. Who'd have known you could jive," Margaret says to her older sister on their way back to the palace. "There must have been 50 men chasing you."
In reality, while Margaret and Elizabeth did take to the streets of London to celebrate the war's end, it seems they had their parents' permission. In 1985, the queen gave a televised speech to the British public, in which she "for the first time told her subjects how she and Princess Margaret had slipped into the crowds outside Buckingham Palace to join the V-E Day celebrations and had walked for miles through the city," according to The Times.
"I remember we were terrified of being recognized," Queen Elizabeth is reported to have said.
In May 2020, during another televised address, the queen spoke of the "jubilant scenes" the royal family saw from the balcony of Buckingham Palace earlier on V-E Day. "The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound," she said.
This episode also follows Princess Margaret's declining health, and a series of strokes she suffered between 1998 and 2001. The first was at a party on the Caribbean island of Mustique; in a second, in a bathtub, she suffered severe burns; and one more, in her bedroom, left her hospitalized. Margaret died soon after, in February 2002.
"The Crown" shows the princess smoking and drinking against her doctor's orders, but Margaret's friends have refuted that she lived such a lifestyle. "I have seen far too much suggesting that Margaret was an unashamed hedonist who spent her life partying," a friend told The Guardian after she died. "It truly misunderstands her."
Margaret's obituary in The Times describes her as an "attractive and fun-loving" woman who "earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit."
Episode 9, 'Hope Street'
In a television interview at the start of the ninth episode, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed al-Fayed (Salim Daw) calls the royal family "gangsters" who intentionally killed Princess Diana and his son, Dodi. Al-Fayed claims that when the "dracular British royal family" discovered that Diana was pregnant "with a Muslim child" -- Dodi's -- "they killed her."
In reality, much like the show depicts, al-Fayed gave several interviews over many years in which he accused the royal family of playing a significant role in Princess Diana's death.
In 1998, The Times reported that al-Fayed told the British media that "there was a conspiracy, and I will not rest until I have established exactly what happened"; speaking on "60 Minutes Australia" in 1999, al-Fayed also claimed that MI6, aided by the C.I.A., had been spying on Dodi and Diana; and in a 2007 interview with Al Jazeera English, he called the crash "absolute clear horrendous murder."
The show also shows Operation Paget, a police inquiry that was opened to re-examine the incidents leading up to the car crash that killed the couple. In December 2006, The Times reported that the inquiry took three years, and cost British taxpayers 3.69 million pounds, about $ 7 million at the time. It concluded that Princess Diana "was killed the way the authorities always said she had been killed: in a car accident, along with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul," Sarah Lyall wrote.
While the investigation into Diana's death is ongoing on "The Crown," Prince William continues his studies at St. Andrews, where the recently single Kate Middleton models in a charity fashion show. The show recreates the sheer dress the real-life Kate wore in 2002 for the college show, a piece designed by Charlotte Todd, who was a college student at the time. In 2011, and following the announcement of William and Kate's engagement, Todd sold the dress for £78,000, according to The Daily Telegraph (around $ 125, 000 at the time).
On the show, soon after William attends the fashion show, the pair start formally dating and move in together, along with two friends. According to The Sun, the couple moved into 13A Hope Street with Olivia Bleasdale and a fellow Etonian, Fergus Boyd.
Back at the palace, the queen is dealing with her mother's death and the Golden Jubilee, an international celebration to mark 50 years of her reign. Elizabeth spends most of the episode worried about a lack of public interest, and whether a crowd will gather for her balcony appearance at Buckingham Palace. She is pleasantly surprised by the masses of people who attend.
On June 5, 2002, The Times reported that over one million people cheered outside the gates of the palace for the jubilee. On the same day, The Guardian reported that the event was more successful than both critics and organizers had anticipated.
Episode 10, 'Sleep, Dearie Sleep'
To wrap the show up, the final episode of "The Crown" finds a way to address the queen's death -- she died in 2022 -- while still being set in 2005. We see her planning her own funeral, including choosing the bagpipe lament "Sleep, Dearie Sleep" to play at the funeral.
According to The Times of London, it took 20 years to plan the queen's real funeral, with the task falling to Edward Fitzalan-Howard, the 18th Duke of Norfolk, whose ancestors have been responsible for planning significant royal occasions since 1672. Before the queen's death, "we had annual meetings in the throne room of Buckingham Palace," the duke told the newspaper in 2022. "It started off with 20 people; by April this year, it had reached 280. I have had a lot of help from Buckingham Palace staff."
The queen's personal piper, Paul Burns, did indeed play "Sleep, Dearie Sleep" to close the queen's funeral on Sept. 19, 2022.
Negative press surrounding Prince Harry during his younger years also gets some screen time. The prince is photographed at a "colonials and natives" costume party, wearing a military outfit with a swastika on the arm, which soon makes front-page news. In the aftermath of the scandal, William and Harry argue about the part each had played in the choice of costume, which the show depicts William encouraging when the brothers shop for their costumes.
On Jan. 13, 2005, a photograph of Prince Harry in the outfit, holding a drink and a cigarette, ran on the front page of The Sun. Harry apologized for his unsuitable costume choice in the accompanying article: "I am very sorry if I have caused an offense," he said. "It was a poor choice of costume." In his recent memoir, "Spare," Harry wrote that William and Kate "howled" with laughter when they saw the costume.
"The Crown" also portrays Blair's fall from public grace. He has a new nickname, "Tony Bliar," because many believed he misled the public over the invasion of Iraq in 2003. That year, The Times reported that at least 750,000 antiwar protesters gathered at a demonstration in London, and noted that Blair had lost the British public's approval. "I do not seek unpopularity as a badge of honor," Blair is reported to have said. "But sometimes it is the price of leadership and the cost of conviction."
With the queen's blessing, Charles and Camilla were finally married in a televised civil wedding ceremony. In April 2005, The Times said: "Given all the twists of fate and circumstance that have conspired against it, perhaps the most wondrous thing about the wedding on Saturday between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles is that it took place at all."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2023, Red Bull dominated the field. The other teams hope to change that next year.
Formula 1's 2022 season was one of the most one-sided in history, as Max Verstappen streaked to the world championship with a record number of wins in a single season.
Yet 2023 turned out to be even more emphatic.
"I don't think we will ever be able to repeat the season we've had," said Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull.
Of the year's 22 Grands Prix, Red Bull won 21, with Verstappen winning 19, a record, including a run of 10 successive wins, also a new bench mark.
Red Bull's dominance has been chastening for its proud rivals and anticipated opponents, Mercedes and Ferrari, while McLaren and Aston Martin have both risen as contenders. The big talking point now is whether any of them can challenge Red Bull in 2024.
Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, was ashen-faced after the season opener in Bahrain, when the extent of the deficiencies of the team's car, the W14, was realized.
Mercedes had stuck with a design concept called zeropod -- featuring extremely slender sidepods, which are designed to feed the fast-moving air created by the car's speed more efficiently to its rear-end. The team swiftly accepted that the new approach, introduced at the start of 2022, was flawed, and shook up their staffing. The team restored James Allison as technical director, and moved his successor, Mike Elliott, into the chief technical officer role. (Elliott then left the team in October.)
Mercedes was second in the constructors' championship, but finished the season without a single win and scored 409 points to Red Bull Racing's 860.
For the design of the team's 2024 car, Mercedes will, according to Wolff, "change the concept." He added that the team is "completely moving away from how we laid out the chassis, the weight distribution, the airflow."
"I mean literally there is almost every component that has been changed," he added, "because only by doing that do we have a chance."
George Russell, who delivered Mercedes's only win of this regulatory era in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2022, is aware of the challenge.
"I think the task for everybody is massive," Russell said. "We're all trying to catch up to the most dominant car in F1 history. So that's no short task, and everybody's going to have to come together, really focused, really put everything into it and time will tell. But I think we're going into this winter in a much better place than we were 12 months ago and two years ago. So we hope we're not going to stumble over anything."
Ferrari briefly challenged Red Bull in early 2022 before its title bid unraveled. Its 2023 tilt never got going, with its car initially unpredictable for its drivers, though one of its drivers, Carlos Sainz, delivered the only non-Red Bull win, in Singapore.
"I think we've progressed quite a lot throughout the season, which is positive and makes me confident for the future," said Charles Leclerc of Ferrari. "But there's a big gap to fill" to catch up with Red Bull, he added, "so we'll work hard during the winter break and hopefully we'll come back stronger next year with a car that is capable of winning."
Some teams have also spent the latter stages of 2023 experimenting with updated components, partially sacrificing race prospects, to assess them for 2024.
"We openly said that we would need to try some things for next year, which we did in a couple of races," said Mike Krack, team principal of Aston Martin. His team vaulted from the midfield to become a regular finisher on the podium in 2023, a year in which its new factory opened in Silverstone, England, as part of its long-term title aspirations.
The Renault-owned Alpine team had a mixed season, placing on the podium twice, but falling to a less competitive sixth in the championship. It undertook midseason managerial changes as part of the French manufacturer's desire to return to the front.
"From what I'm seeing inside the team, we're really trying to improve everywhere," said Pierre Gasly of Alpine. "We're really aware of our weaknesses, and our potential, we know the areas where we've got to get stronger, and there's processes put in place to tackle these weaknesses.
"I have no guarantees that next year we'll have a car that will allow me to get the position, or the targets, we set ourselves at the start of the year, but all I can see now is we're trying as hard as we can to get there."
Another factor for the off-season is that new chassis regulations for 2026, which are still being defined, loom on the horizon. Teams want as much carry-over as possible from the 2024 car into the 2025 car, so that finite resources can be diverted to the new 2026 project during the off-season of 2024-25, with work permitted to begin on the 2026 project on Jan. 2, 2025. Any slip-up in the next few months could have long-lasting effects.
The year 2026 "will be a completely new journey for everyone," said Andrea Stella, team principal of McLaren. "I don't think there will be much you can transfer from these cars onto those cars, aside from general methodologies," he said, adding that, most likely, the new cars will be smaller and less aerodynamic.
The problem for the chasers is that Red Bull still has a sizable advantage. Verstappen had little need to truly push in many of his wins this year, taking one win in Hungary by a margin of 33 seconds, and the team is not standing still. The regulations remain relatively static for the next two seasons, and there are less than 100 days until 2024's campaign begins. And in Verstappen it has this generation's standout driver.
"It'd be wrong to just leave it alone as our opposition are getting a bit closer," said Paul Monaghan, chief engineer of Red Bull, when discussing its car in São Paulo in November.
"It perhaps wouldn't surprise you," he said, to learn that the 2024 car will be "an evolution of the current car. It'd be a bit foolish to just throw this concept away, but equally we've got to make some progress and find some lap time, as if our opposition makes a step we'd better have a bigger step. But it carries over a lot of the lessons and benefits of the current car, and come Bahrain next year we'll see if we've done a good enough job."
Verstappen, too, sees room for improvement in 2024.
"We are also working on our car to try and make it better," he said. "I think we know our weaknesses, as well in the car. And that's what we'll of course try to work on, plus, of course, trying to make our strengths even stronger.
"In general, on street circuits, I think we are struggling a bit more. Low speed is definitely not our strongest point in the car; bumps, curbs as well. So that's definitely a big area where we can improve."
Recent Formula 1 history shows championship wins turn into dynasties. Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five successive titles in the early 2000s, Sebastian Vettel won four in a row with Red Bull in the early 2010s, before Lewis Hamilton claimed six from 2014 through 2020 for Mercedes. Verstappen is now on a streak of three straight.
"Red Bull won by 17 seconds and they've not touched the car since August or July," said Hamilton, a winner of 103 Grands Prix, after finishing ninth at the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. "So you can pretty much guess where they're going to be next year."

At a Formula One Race, Speeding Up the Wedding: [Society Desk]

Full text: Laurent Van Hoestenberghe and Dr. Carine Jouffret, both big racecar fans, said their vows before "Elvis" at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Las Vegas.
In mid-November Laurent Charles Catherine C. Van Hoestenberghe took his fiancée, Dr. Carine Isabelle Jouffret, to Las Vegas for the Formula 1 Grand Prix.
They are both big fans, having attended car races in Monaco, close to Aix-en-Provence, in the South of France, where they live, and across Europe. This was their first time seeing a race in the United States, and Mr. Van Hoestenberghe wanted to make it a special experience.
"I reached out to the F1 concierge service that came with our tickets, and I said, 'Can we get some flowers or maybe a photo session with a driver?"' said Mr. Van Hoestenberghe, 50, who works in client relations for the French tennis brand Babolat.
He was shocked when the Formula 1 team came back to him with another idea: They could get married at the racetrack, free of charge.
Las Vegas, which is known as "the wedding capital of the world," already has about 100 chapels in the city that offer easy 15-minute ceremonies. The Las Vegas Grand Prix team also decided to set up a pop-up chapel for race fans, with neon hearts, a racecar that said "just married," and a sign that said "Lights out and together we go." (The phrase is a modification of one David Croft, a Sky Sports commentator, says at the beginning of Formula 1 races.)
The chapel is in the paddock, where cars are kept and worked on throughout the Grand Prix. It is one of the most secure areas on the track and the hardest to get into. "You are in the midst of all the drivers, the stars," Mr. Van Hoestenberghe said. "When I heard about the chapel there I was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, this is amazing. Of course we have to do it."'
Mr. Van Hoestenberghe has a graduate degree in management studies from Open University Business School, north of Central London. Dr. Jouffret received a graduate degree in medicine with a specialization in radiology from Aix-Marseille University in France.
Dr. Jouffret, who is also 50 and a radiologist who co-owns several offices in Aix-en-Provence, said she learned about the wedding chapel just before leaving for Vegas. It made the long flight more fun. "We smiled and laughed all the way," she said, "becoming the favorite passengers for the flight crew."
She and Mr. Van Hoestenberghe had already discussed eloping in Vegas. They even made a reservation at the Graceland Chapel for the Monday after the Grand Prix.
Each had been married before (Mr. Van Hoestenberghe has two sons, 23 and 21, from his first marriage, and Dr. Jouffret has a son and daughter, 21 and 13) and had large weddings. "We didn't want to go through the whole fuss again," he said.
The couple met at a bar at Club Med Yasmina in Morocco on July 20, 2017. "The funny thing is I had just arrived, and it was her last night, but we talked until the morning," he said. He didn't think anything would come of the meeting. "I was living in Belgium, and she was in France, and initially I thought, 'What a fantastic woman, but we have 1,000 kilometers between us," he said.
Dr. Jouffret was skeptical, too. "Although we connected that evening like soul mates, we kind of knew it would probably end up as a nice little holiday memory," she said. "But we kept calling each other everyday, for hours, and we met again right after summer, and it felt very natural, like we knew each other for years."
They stayed in touch, calling each other daily and squeezing in visits when they could. When Covid hit, Mr. Van Hoestenberghe moved in with Dr. Jouffret in her house in Aix-en-Provence. "I got rid of the house in Belgium after that," he said. He proposed last year just before Christmas at home.

They married Nov. 17, five hours before the qualifying race began. They started the day by going to the Clark County Marriage License Bureau to fill out paperwork before shopping for rings. "We found these ones with F1 cars on them," the groom said. For the ceremony Mr. Van Hoestenberghe wore the jersey, jacket, and cap of his favorite team, Red Bull, while Dr. Jouffret, did the same for her team, Ferrari.
Formula 1 officials escorted the couple to the chapel. On the way they got a tour of the pit lane, where the racing teams set up the cars.
The officiant, Brian Mills, the president of the Las Vegas Wedding Chamber who received permission from the Clark County Marriage Bureau to perform the ceremony, was dressed as Elvis. He conducted a brief ceremony, during which time the couple said their vows in French.
Afterward, they drank champagne in the chapel and headed back to their seats in a V.I.P. area known as the Skybox with an open bar and complimentary food like lobster and steak.
"People around us were amazed we just got married, and then we opened even more bottles of champagne," Mr. Van Hoestenberghe said. "Our wedding was already special because we did the Vegas thing, but doing it on a racetrack? How many people could say they have done that?"

Full text: It was a terrific year for film, whether art house or mainstream, even if the main subject the movies wrestled with was deeply pessimistic.

A Thrilling Bounty
I had a terrific movie year -- you? I saw hundreds of new films with a variety of plots and styles made on every imaginable scale and budget. Some were from newcomers like A.V. Rockwell and others from the ever-new Martin Scorsese. Some you've heard of or will, while others scarcely made a ripple. Some were released by independents like A24 and the tiny KimStim; others came from tech companies and still others from what are now often called legacy studios, a vaguely eulogistic term that suggests influence but also obsolescence.
The movies have ostensibly been at death's door at least since the shift to sync sound, which isn't to undersell the industry's business woes. When the year began, it was still recovering from pandemic-forced shutdowns and slowdowns. "As 2023 Begins, Worry and Fear Linger After a Topsy-Turvy Year," The Hollywood Reporter fretted, calling the ups and downs of the 2022 box office "dramatic." Yet some Wall Street analysts were bullish on moviegoing. "We're seeing a resurgence of interest back in the theaters," one analyst told Yahoo in late January. I had just returned from the bounty at the Sundance Film Festival and was feeling bullish, too.
As winter gave way to spring and summer, several of my favorite movies had been released in theaters and I had previewed several others at Cannes, where I had again been buoyed by what I had seen. At the same time, the drumbeat of worrying industry news continued when the Writers Guild went on strike on May 2 and several sure-bet blockbusters failed to charm audiences into theaters. "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" was "cursed," read one headline; "'Mission: Impossible 7' falls short of expectations," ran another. The moaning in the trades gave way to klaxon horns when much of SAG-AFTRA went on strike on July 14. Two days later Barry Diller, who once ran Paramount, warned that the strikes could lead to the industry's "absolute collapse." Five days later, "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" opened.
That phenom dubbed Barbenheimer buoyed the box office, the strikes ended, and here we are. It's tempting to repeat William Goldman's axiom that "nobody knows anything" and leave it at that. Except that this year also reminded us of some things that we have known for a while, including that women directors can make any kind of movie, from the intimately scaled to larger-than-life productions that become monster hits. This year also reminded us that a mass audience will happily get out of the house for movies without superheroes. And, on occasion, it won't show up for movies with them, which was evident after disappointments from both the DC and Marvel studios as "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," "Shazam: Fury of the Gods," "The Flash," "Blue Beetle" and "The Marvels" sputtered in theaters.
Two other words that popped up regularly in the news this year were "superhero fatigue," which should have surprised absolutely no one. Old Hollywood embraced genre films but it also banked on variety, churning out musicals, westerns, dramas, comedies, historical epics, detective and gangster tales and genre hybrids. Some were interchangeable; others had fresh stories, distinctive visual styles and authorial flourishes. Now, though, the big studios are largely in the business of action-adventure franchises and serials; they bank on similarity, not variety. As of Nov. 30, half of this year's top 20 grossing domestic releases fall in the action-adventure category, including a clutch of superhero flicks.
The mass turnout for both "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" has been credited to everything from timing to originality, their meme-ability and people's fear of missing out. Whatever the reasons for their success -- and talent played a part, too -- they proved that those Wall Street analysts bullish on moviegoing were onto something. That's what else this year reminded us, and what I'm reminded of each week: Films can be great! They can embrace genre, play with it, transcend it. Their stories and their telling can be diverse, their quality thrilling, their art transporting. There's more to movies than the industry, its crises and convulsions. In 1951, David O. Selznick, the producer of "Gone With the Wind," rued that "there might have been good movies if there had been no movie industry." The thing is, there have always been good movies despite the industry but, then, I'm a shameless optimist -- I'm a film critic.
Here are my favorite movies of the year, all of which opened (or will open) theatrically in the United States.
1. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' (Martin Scorsese)
In this harrowing epic, Scorsese revisits a murderous crime spree perpetrated by white Americans -- lovers and friends, ranchers and bankers, local lawmen and federally appointed guardians -- against oil-rich members of the Osage Nation. The emotional center is an unspeakably cruel story of love and betrayal, a baroque conspiracy fueled by greed and an unshakable belief in white superiority. Manifest Destiny makes a hell of a gangster movie. (In theaters)
2. 'Oppenheimer' (Christopher Nolan)
With his customary pointillist detail and monumental sweep, Nolan tracks J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, from his tortured youth to later anguished years. Much of the film involves Oppenheimer's role in researching and developing the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, world-defining catastrophes that eventually killed an estimated 100,000 to upward of 200,000 souls and helped usher in our self-annihilating, human-dominated age. (In theaters)
3. 'Menus-Plaisirs -- Les Troisgros' (Frederick Wiseman)
In this deeply pleasurable movie, Wiseman focuses on the Troisgros family, a dynasty of French chefs. Much of the film takes place in their celebrated restaurant-hotel in the Loire where the paterfamilias oversees a team that with love, ingenuity, choreography, sublime technique and a regard for the larger world create one astonishment after another for the delight and delectation of others -- much like the genius behind the camera. (In theaters)
4. 'Occupied City' (Steve McQueen)
In his startling and formally rigorous four-and-a-half-hour documentary, this British director ("Twelve Years a Slave") uses everyday scenes from contemporary Amsterdam to map -- street by street, address by address -- the disastrous fate of the city's Jewish population during World War II. The movie was written by Bianca Stigter, McQueen's wife, and informed by her book "Atlas of an Occupied City: Amsterdam 1940-1945." (Opening Dec. 25 in theaters)
5. 'A Thousand and One' (A.V. Rockwell)
In her knockout feature debut, Rockwell follows a young woman (a wonderful Teyana Taylor) across the years -- it opens in the mid-1990s -- as she raises her son in a rapidly gentrifying New York. Rockwell was born and raised in Queens, and she has a deep feeling for the city and the people who, far from the corridors of power and despite the onslaughts of power's rapacious mercenaries, have always given New York its lifeblood. (Stream it on Prime Video)
6. 'Asteroid City' (Wes Anderson)
In the small fictional Southwest town where much of this movie takes place, worlds collide, a love story (or maybe two) blooms and fades, children outwit adults and an extraterrestrial makes a surprising touchdown. With dexterity and complexity, tenderness and deadpan delivery, meticulous technique and mesmerizing colors, Anderson plays with different media and performing arts for a story about storytelling that's wry, comic and tragic. (Stream it on Peacock)
7. 'May December' (Todd Haynes)
In this unsettling, perverse movie about that performance called life, an actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), visits the inspiration for her next movie. That would be Gracie (Julianne Moore), a homemaker who likes to bake cakes and happens to be an ex-con, having been imprisoned for having sex with an underage boy she later wed. (A terrific Charles Melton plays her tragic husband.) Things get very complicated, and then crushingly sad. (Stream it on Netflix)
8. 'Showing Up' (Kelly Reichardt)
Reichardt's latest follows Lizzy (a delicately restrained and revelatory Michelle Williams), a sculptor in Portland, Ore., as she prepares a new gallery show while contending with friends, family, her very bad cat and a wounded pigeon. For Lizzy, making art is an act of self-creation and a way of being, which I suspect means that this lovely, modestly scaled movie is also somewhat of a directorial self-portrait. (Available for rent on most major platforms)
9. 'Orlando: My Political Biography' (Paul B. Preciado)
In this essayistic documentary, Preciado -- a Spanish-born transgender philosopher and activist making his directing debut -- uses Virginia Woolf's novel "Orlando: A Biography" as a springboard to explore the complexities and many cages of identity. Drawing on a wide range of sources and aided by 20 trans and nonbinary performers, Preciado has made a movie that's playful, urgent and as intellectually inspiring as it is emotionally exhilarating. (In theaters)
10. 'Stonewalling' (Huang Ji and Ryuji Otsuka)
It's 2019 when this understated, formally rigorous heartbreaker opens and the painfully young Lynn (Yao Honggui) is facing a series of daunting hurdles, including her rotten boyfriend, bickering parents, no job and an uncertain future. By the time the story ends it's early 2020, everyone is wearing surgical masks and Lynn is exhausted, having tried every imaginable gig and hustle. She is also pregnant, and now has something of exchange value. (Streaming on Criterion)
Ten more: "All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt," "Earth Mama," "Fallen Leaves," "Ferrari," "John Wick: Chapter 4," "Past Lives" "R.M.N.," "Scarlet," "Will-O'-the-Wisp," "Youth (Spring)."
Where Evil Lies
This was the year of evil at the movies: gut-wrenching, bone-chilling, ordinary evil. It didn't wear villainous capes, nor did it often arrive in the expected horror movie package. That's why it was so terrifying.
The movies this year posited that evil's opposite isn't goodness; it's reality. Evil was something for men of science, like J. Robert Oppenheimer, to wrestle with, realizing that when the physical universe intersects with human ethics, no decision can really be neutral. Evil was discussed at Cannes in the news conference after "Killers of the Flower Moon," a film about how barbarous civilization can be. In "The Zone of Interest," unspeakable evil is obscured, willingly, by people who are just going about their everyday business. Bureaucratic language and euphemism keep them from having to acknowledge the horrors they're perpetuating.
In fact, the way language can mask and produce evil -- especially the banal sort that stems from self-delusion -- was all over the movies this year. Todd Haynes's juicy "May December" is loaded with willful blindness on the part of characters who can't even form the words to tell the truth about their lives. Justine Triet's "Anatomy of a Fall" takes a marriage built on linguistic compromise -- the partners communicate in English, a second language for both -- as the jumping-off point for a story about the everyday violence that careless words incur, whether in the courtroom or the living room. And perhaps the strongest and most daring of these was "Reality," which uses a real interrogation transcript to show the bendiness of words, the way power and justice can be warped to manipulate, well, reality.
When the great novelist Cormac McCarthy, no stranger to the movies himself, died this year, I found myself thinking about him because his vision of evil was far more in line with these depictions than the cartoon villains Hollywood typically serves up. To McCarthy, evil was a force or a being that stalked humanity, the basic fact of the human condition, nearly impossible to resist and embedded somehow in language. In his 1994 novel "The Crossing," a character says that "the wicked know that if the ill they do be of sufficient horror men will not speak against it." In fact, "men have just enough stomach for small evils and only these will they oppose."
If he's right, that may be why the antidote to cinematic evil could be found in people speaking words of healing to one another, facing truth together. The couples at the center of "The Eternal Memory" and "American Symphony," the chaplains of "A Still Small Voice," the family of "You Hurt My Feelings" -- all are people who have found that in the midst of an impossible world, communicating with one another is what lets us go on.
Any form of art is capable of exploring the nature of evil. But there's something about cinema -- immersive, time-bound, hitting several senses at once -- that feels uniquely suited for the task, since evil is something more readily identified in the gut than in the conscious mind. In a world increasingly unmoored from reality, where we can barely trust what we see with our own eyes, evil floats freely. Maybe cinema can give us language to face it courageously.
1. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' (Martin Scorsese)
From the start of his career, Scorsese has been obsessed with guilt: What does it mean to be guilty? Is anyone really innocent? Is forgiveness possible, or just a convenient fantasy? The many-layered "Killers of the Flower Moon" offers perhaps his broadest take on the topic yet -- proceeding from the firm belief that guilt is generational, just like grief, and that telling the story (in this case, of the systematic murder of Osage members) is both fraught and impossible to avoid. (In theaters)
2. 'Past Lives' (Celine Song)
Once in a while, an understated stunner from a debut director (in this case, the playwright Celine Song) arrives early in the year, grabs you by the heart and won't let go. For me that happened all the way back at Sundance in January with "Past Lives," about a woman (Greta Lee) contemplating the lives she could have led and thus the choices that created the one she does lead. With magnificent co-stars in Teo Yoo and John Magaro, it's brilliant and moving, an examination of destiny, chance, love and the invisible thread that binds one soul to the next. (For rent on most major platforms)
3. 'The Zone of Interest' (Jonathan Glazer)
Based loosely on a Martin Amis novel, "The Zone of Interest" bone-chills by omission, its meaning contained in what's not onscreen. The story concerns the family of Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), commandant of Auschwitz, who lives an idyllic life with his family just outside the walls of the notorious extermination camp. His wife (Sandra Hüller) runs a peaceful household, proudly showing her life to her mother when she visits. But you can hear, and almost smell, what's going on over the wall. It's a nauseatingly and formally bold inquiry into the extent to which humans can, and do, willfully blind themselves to evil. (Opens in theaters on Dec. 15)
4. 'Reality' (Tina Satter)
"Reality" stars Sydney Sweeney as Reality Winner, the former N.S.A. translator imprisoned for leaking information about Russian interference into the 2016 elections. Adapted from a play also written and directed by Satter, the dialogue is a verbatim (and sometimes redacted) transcription of the F.B.I.'s interrogation of Winner at her home before her arrest. Sweeney is incredible in the role, the anchor of a furious, true thriller. But what stands out is the way "Reality" forces us to question what's real on several levels -- not just whether and when a government is trustworthy, but also when language deliberately obscures reality, and whether the movie itself is fiction, documentary or something uncomfortably in the gray area between. (Streaming on Max)
5. 'A Still Small Voice' (Luke Lorentzen)
Early in the pandemic, at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, a group of chaplaincy residents are caring for patients and their families while dealing with their own grief and fear. Lorentzen's observational documentary (which he largely shot himself) follows one resident, Mati, and her supervisor. Mati's idealism is challenged as she ministers to people of all faiths and none in particular while simultaneously experiencing her own crisis of faith. The nature of mercy, mortality and belief in the face of unimaginable pain makes this, somehow, a hopeful film, though it's a hard-won hope. (In theaters)
6. 'Oppenheimer' (Christopher Nolan)
One-half of the year's biggest moviegoing event, "Oppenheimer" is at its core an examination of power, both in the geopolitical and the atomic sense. Nolan's choice to split the film along two power-generating acts, fission and fusion, underscores the point: While the film is largely about the Manhattan Project and the moral compromise Oppenheimer wrestles with, it's also about man's petty battles to gain power without regard for the future. Nolan is obsessed with the interplay between the scientific and the humanist, and thus it's a perfect match. (For rent on most major platforms)
7. 'Smoke Sauna Sisterhood' (Anna Hints)
A number of good and much buzzier films from this year -- "Barbie," "Poor Things" -- chronicled women's journeys toward becoming their own heroes in a world still tilted toward patriarchy. But the Estonian documentary "Smoke Sauna Sisterhood" is the one that's stuck with me most. Women gather in a smoke sauna (we see their tightly framed nude bodies, shot from the neck down, for most of the film) repeatedly throughout a calendar year. They discuss the painful and joyful realities of their lives: fears and hopes, romances and abuses, weaknesses and strengths. Visually striking and uncommonly frank, it gets at an authenticity that few fiction films can fully capture. (In theaters)
8. 'Godland' (Hlynur Palmason)
It's the 19th century, and a young Danish priest with plenty of self-regard has decided to lead a church in remote Iceland (at that time a Danish colony). What he discovers on the frigid shores is a beguiling landscape that's wholly indifferent to his existence. Watching him disintegrate when confronted with the reality of his calling is both tragic and darkly funny, but the deeper meaning is what remains: We can plan all we want to change the world, but the world usually gets the best of us. (Streaming on the Criterion Channel)
9. 'The Eternal Memory' (Maite Alberdi)
Alberdi's haunting documentary centers on Augusto Góngora, one of the most famous cultural journalists in Chile, and his wife, Paulina Urrutia. Góngora is living with Alzheimer's, and Alberdi parallels his slowly deteriorating mental state with his lifelong fight to preserve Chile's history and collective memory. Without memory, Góngora says, we are lost. What anchors him is Urrutia's fervent love, a bond so strong that it can withstand tragedy -- and there are lessons there for nations that wish to wipe away their own memories. (Streaming on Paramount+)
10. 'Menus-Plaisirs -- Les Troisgros' (Frederick Wiseman)
Wiseman, America's greatest chronicler of institutions, turns his observational documentary eye toward La Maison Troisgros, a three-star Michelin restaurant in Roanne, France, run by several generations of the Troisgros family. While the food looks delectable and the diners are often very funny, the true joy of Wiseman's film is his subtle weaving of a point into it all. Future generations of artists and chefs, diners and growers depend upon balancing profit with careful cultivation today, whether it's in the way a kitchen runs, the way grapes are grown or the way a family plans its business. That balance is evident throughout the film, which is a sensory delight and at times almost balletic in its touch. (In theaters)
And don't miss: "Afire" (Christian Petzold), "American Fiction" (Cord Jefferson), "American Symphony" (Matthew Heineman), "Anatomy of a Fall" (Justine Triet), "Anselm" (Wim Wenders), "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" (Kelly Fremon Craig), "Barbie" (Greta Gerwig), "BlackBerry" (Matt Johnson), "Eileen" (William Oldroyd), "Fallen Leaves" (Aki Kaurismaki), "Four Daughters" (Kaouther Ben Hania), "The Holdovers" (Alexander Payne), "May December" (Todd Haynes), "Poor Things" (Yorgos Lanthimos), "Priscilla" (Sofia Coppola), "The Royal Hotel" (Kitty Green), "Showing Up" (Kelly Reichardt), "The Starling Girl" (Laurel Parmet), "The Taste of Things" (Tran Anh Hung), "You Hurt My Feelings" (Nicole Holofcener)

Topsy- Turvy Swimmer: Fish With a Fishing-Rod Face Lives Life Upside Down: [Science Desk]

Full text: Deep-sea videos from around the world show how the whipnose anglerfish prefers to swim belly up.
Usually, a belly-up fish isn't long for this world. But video evidence from the deep ocean suggests that some species of anglerfish -- the nightmarish deep-sea fish with bioluminescent lures -- live their whole lives upside down.
"Just when you think they couldn't get any weirder, anglerfish outdo themselves," said Pamela Hart, an associate professor at the University of Alabama who researches fish that live in extreme conditions.
The behavior, documented earlier this month in the Journal of Fish Biology, is "beyond anyone's wildest imagination," said Elizabeth Miller, who studied the evolution of deep-sea fish as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oklahoma. (Neither Dr. Miller nor Dr. Hart was involved in the discovery.)
Whipnose anglerfish are small sea monsters with a fishing rod-like appendage on their faces. While a whipnose's body is no bigger than that of a house cat, it has a long, floppy spine that sprouts from its nose and stretches up to four times its body length. The fish tempt prey with bioluminescent bacteria that live in the tip of the lure. (This applies to female whipnoses, said Andrew Stewart, curator of fishes at the Museum of New Zealand and an author of the study. The males of the species are "sad little tadpole things" a fraction of the size of the females, and without the lure.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For nearly a century, scientists assumed whipnose anglerfish would dangle their lures in front of their faces, as many anglerfish with shorter lures do. But now, videos from underwater missions in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans suggest that whipnoses spend their lightless days upside down, with their long lures hanging toward the seafloor.
The videos are confirmation of a tantalizing observation from more than 20 years ago, Dr. Stewart said.
In 1999, a remotely operated vehicle, or R.O.V., caught glimpses of whipnose anglerfish floating motionless, and, notably, upside down, about midway between Hawaii and California. Researchers suspected that they were targeting prey on the seafloor, but scientists couldn't discard the possibility that it was just one goofy fish behaving abnormally, Dr. Hart explained -- a hazard of animal behavior studies.
If that whipnose was a goof, then they're all goofs, based on evidence from the footage that has been captured by remote subs and crewed vehicles. In a video filmed near the Izu-Ogasawara Trench off Japan, a whipnose drifts with the current, her body parallel to the seafloor, mouth agape and hundreds of tiny teeth glistening in the light.
Suddenly, she bursts into motion, using her powerful tail to swim in a tight circle, still inverted. Eventually she calms and begins drifting again, only to bump into the R.O.V.'s light apparatus -- probably a shock for a creature used to living in the featureless deep sea. Then she uses the tiny fins at her side to backpedal into the darkness.
In other videos, "the propellers and power of the submersible tumbled the anglerfish so it was right side up," Dr. Stewart said. But the whipnoses weren't having any of it, "they very quickly reverted to being upside down again," he said.
While humans may find it hard to take a belly-up predator seriously, swimming upside down may make the whipnose more lethal. Researchers suspect that, by keeping their lures farther from their mouths, whipnose anglerfish could take down larger and faster prey without accidentally biting themselves. Dr. Stewart said that one dissected whipnose specimen had a gonatid squid in its belly -- a real prize.
"Squid are very much the Ferrari of the deep ocean," he said, adding that whipnose anglerfish "must be extremely fast and efficient for them to have nailed a gonatid."
This new insight into the whipnoses' behavior underscores how revolutionary R.O.V. footage has been for deep-sea biology, Dr. Stewart said. Before this technology, scientists relied on dead specimens hoisted from the deep by trawling nets and pickled to preserve their delicate tissues, which are often damaged by the drastic change in pressure. There was nothing in the whipnose anglerfish's anatomy to suggest their bizarre behavior.
"These videos are really precious," Dr. Miller said. "Even a short, one-minute video tells us so much about how the anglerfish is living its life that we can't otherwise get."

$55 Million for a Series, but Not a Single Episode: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Near the height of the streaming boom in the fall of 2018, a half-dozen studios and video platforms lined up to woo a little-known filmmaker named Carl Erik Rinsch. He had directed only one movie, "47 Ronin." It was a commercial and critical dud, and Mr. Rinsch's tussles with its producers had raised eyebrows, even in an industry where such conflicts are the norm.
But memories in Hollywood are short, and the demand for new content was intense. In just a decade, the number of scripted TV shows had soared from 200 to more than 500, with new streaming services from Disney, Apple and NBCUniversal on the way. Amid the feeding frenzy, the project that Mr. Rinsch was pitching -- a science-fiction series about artificial humans -- became a hot property.
After a competitive auction, Mr. Rinsch and his representatives reached an informal eight-figure agreement with Amazon. But before they had a chance to put it in writing, Netflix swooped in. Cindy Holland, the company's vice president of original content at the time, called Mr. Rinsch at home on a Sunday and dangled millions of dollars more, as well as something studios rarely gave directors: final cut.
Netflix won the deal -- and would soon come to regret it.
The project with Mr. Rinsch has turned into a costly fiasco, a microcosm of the era of profligate spending that Hollywood studios now are scrambling to end. Netflix burned more than $ 55 million on Mr. Rinsch's show and gave him near-total budgetary and creative latitude but never received a single finished episode.
Soon after he signed the contract, Mr. Rinsch's behavior grew erratic, according to members of the show's cast and crew, texts and emails reviewed by The New York Times, and court filings in a divorce case brought by his wife. He claimed to have discovered Covid-19's secret transmission mechanism and to be able to predict lightning strikes. He gambled a large chunk of the money from Netflix on the stock market and cryptocurrencies. He spent millions of dollars on a fleet of Rolls-Royces, furniture and designer clothing.
Mr. Rinsch and Netflix are now locked in a confidential arbitration proceeding initiated by Mr. Rinsch, who claims the company breached their contract and owes him at least $ 14 million in damages. Netflix has denied owing Mr. Rinsch anything and has called his demands a shakedown.
It's not uncommon for Hollywood productions to run into trouble, but a debacle of this magnitude is rare. And it has surfaced at an inopportune moment, with Hollywood under pressure from investors to cut back on lavish spending and to focus on making profits rather than adding streaming subscribers at any cost. That squeeze is only expected to intensify. Hollywood studios' recent agreements to pay writers and actors more are likely to further pinch profits.
Mr. Rinsch declined to respond to a detailed list of questions. In a recent Instagram post, he said he did not cooperate with The Times because he expected the article to be "inaccurate." He predicted that it would "discuss the fact that I somehow lost my mind ... (Spoiler alert) ... I did not."
Thomas Cherian, a spokesman for Netflix, said the company had provided substantial funding and other support to Mr. Rinsch's series, but "after a lot of time and effort, it became clear that Mr. Rinsch was never going to complete the project he agreed to make, and so we wrote the project off."
'The Organic Intelligent'
By all accounts, Mr. Rinsch, 46, is a talented filmmaker. The youngest son of an insurance executive, he grew up in California's San Fernando Valley and started renting camera equipment and shooting short films in his early teens. After attending Brown University, he returned to Los Angeles and joined Ridley Scott's production company, making commercials and apprenticing under the acclaimed director.
Friends say Mr. Rinsch always had a quirky side. He had a habit of telling tall tales about his childhood, claiming that he grew up in Africa and that his father was a spy. While living at the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica for a stretch, he insisted that the staff cover every inch of his room in white sheets.
Mr. Rinsch's career began to take off in 2010 when a short film he made for the Dutch electronics maker Philips won top awards at the Cannes Lions international advertising festival.
There was talk that Mr. Rinsch would direct a prequel to "Alien," Mr. Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic, for his feature film debut. Instead, Universal Studios hired him to direct "47 Ronin," a big-budget action movie starring Keanu Reeves.
The project encountered difficulties. Mr. Rinsch clashed with Scott Stuber, one of the producers, and at one point was removed from the editing room, according to a person familiar with what happened. When the film was released on Christmas Day in 2013, it bombed. Universal had to write off a large portion of its $ 175 million budget.
Mr. Rinsch went back to making commercials. On the side, he and his wife -- a Uruguayan model and fashion designer, Gabriela Rosés Bentancor -- began working on a passion project: a sci-fi TV series about a genius who invents a humanlike species called the Organic Intelligent. The O.I. are deployed to trouble spots around the globe to provide humanitarian aid, but humans eventually discover their true nature and turn against them. Mr. Rinsch called the show "White Horse," a reference to the first horseman of the apocalypse.
At first, Mr. Rinsch financed the production with his own money and hired mostly European actors and crew members, which reduced costs and avoided Hollywood union rules. The early shoots followed punishing schedules. During a shoot in Kenya, Mr. Rinsch insisted on filming for 24 hours straight, two members of the production said. In Romania, the lead actress caught hypothermia doing a scene barelegged in the snow and had to be rushed to a hospital, they said.
To keep the project going, Mr. Rinsch secured an investment from 30West, a production company backed by the billionaire entrepreneur Dan Friedkin. But when Mr. Rinsch missed a deadline, 30West threatened to take possession of the project. Mr. Reeves, the Hollywood star, who had become friends with Mr. Rinsch during the shooting of "Ronin," came to his rescue by investing in the show and becoming a producer alongside Ms. Rosés.
With the money Mr. Reeves contributed, Mr. Rinsch finished editing six short episodes ranging from four to 10 minutes. He used them to pitch the big streaming companies on a 13-episode, 120-minute first season. At the time, streaming services were in an expensive arms race for content to attract new subscribers. Netflix, in particular, was lavishing money and creative control on top creators like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. Hollywood was also open to new show formats. Quibi, a short-form video platform conceived by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former DreamWorks Animation chief, had just been founded to much fanfare.
Mr. Rinsch's pitch attracted interest from Amazon, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Apple and YouTube. Amazon -- which had shown its willingness to spend big by paying nearly $ 250 million for the rights to make a television show based on J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" -- looked set to win the bidding. But Netflix snatched the project away at the last minute, convinced it had the potential to become a sci-fi franchise as successful as "Stranger Things" that could spawn sequels and spinoffs.
The company agreed to pay $ 61.2 million in several installments for the rights to the series, which it renamed "Conquest," according to a November 2018 term sheet reviewed by The Times. The deal included two unusual clauses: Netflix gave Mr. Rinsch final cut, a privilege it had previously bestowed on only a few directors. And it assured Mr. Rinsch and Ms. Rosés that they would remain "locked for life" to all subsequent seasons and spinoffs.
In granting Mr. Rinsch such generous terms, Netflix ignored several red flags. One was the project's troubled past. At the time, Mr. Rinsch was still fighting with 30West and other early investors. (They received $ 14 million of the $ 61 million from Netflix under a legal settlement.) Another was the fact that the series didn't have a complete script.
Netflix also overlooked Mr. Rinsch's checkered reputation in Hollywood. Mr. Stuber, the producer who had clashed with him on "Ronin," had joined Netflix's movie division a year earlier. Ms. Holland, the company's head of original content, didn't consult him before buying "Conquest."
Punching Holes in a Wall
With Netflix's big-money commitment, Mr. Rinsch now had to deliver. Shooting of the remaining episodes of "Conquest" got underway in São Paulo, Brazil, and then in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Budapest.
In São Paulo, the local film industry union dispatched a representative to the set after receiving a complaint that Mr. Rinsch was "mistreating the team" with "shouts," "cursing" and "excessive irritation," according to a letter the union sent Netflix's local production partner. Netflix was informed of the issue and addressed it with Mr. Rinsch, a person familiar with the matter said.
In Budapest, Mr. Rinsch went days without sleep and accused his wife of plotting to have him assassinated, two people who witnessed the outburst said.
Ms. Rosés later said in a court filing in her divorce case that Mr. Rinsch's behavior had started to change even before the overseas shoots. On several occasions, he had thrown things at her and twice punched holes in a wall.
Mr. Rinsch has said he was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and took medications for both. Ms. Rosés and some crew members worried about his use of Vyvanse, an amphetamine that is commonly prescribed to treat A.D.H.D. When overused, the drug can have serious side effects, including mania, delirium and even psychosis, according to psychiatrists.
After filming wrapped up in Budapest in late 2019, Ms. Rosés hired a behavioral health consultant to try to persuade Mr. Rinsch to enter rehab. Accompanied by Mr. Reeves, one of Mr. Rinsch's brothers and several members of the "Conquest" crew, the consultant staged an intervention at Mr. Rinsch's Los Angeles home, several people who attended said. Mr. Rinsch agreed to let a sober companion stay with him, but he sent him packing within a couple of days, the people said.
In March 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was reaching U.S. shores, Mr. Rinsch asked Netflix to send him more money. The company had already spent $ 44.3 million on "Conquest." Mr. Rinsch had missed several production milestones and was toggling between two versions of the script, a shorter one that matched the original 13-episode plan and one twice as long that would have required greenlighting a second season.
Netflix initially resisted Mr. Rinsch's demand for more funds, but it relented when he claimed the whole production risked collapsing without an immediate cash injection.
Netflix wired Mr. Rinsch's production company $ 11 million, bringing its total outlay to more than $ 55 million. It gave Mr. Rinsch permission to use some of the new money to do preproduction work on the longer version of the script. The caveat was that if Netflix didn't sign off on the expanded script after five weeks, Mr. Rinsch had to use the rest of the money to finish and deliver the originally agreed-upon first season.
Mr. Rinsch transferred $ 10.5 million of the $ 11 million to his personal brokerage account at Charles Schwab and, using options, placed risky bets on the stock market, according to copies of his bank and brokerage statements included in the divorce case. One of his wagers was that shares of the biotech firm Gilead Sciences, which had announced that it was testing an antiviral drug on Covid patients, would soar. Another was that the S&P 500 index, which had already declined more than 30 percent, would fall further. Mr. Rinsch lost $ 5.9 million in a matter of weeks.
In the following months, he behaved more erratically. Like many people, he was deeply affected by the pandemic, and he espoused strange theories about the coronavirus, according to text messages and emails reviewed by The Times. When Ms. Rosés went to check on him in June 2020, he took her to a scenic lookout in the Hollywood hills and pointed at planes overhead. They were "organic, intelligent forces" that "came to say hi," he told her, according to Ms. Rosés's filing in the divorce case. He also sent her texts claiming that he could predict lightning strikes and volcanic eruptions.
At Netflix, Ms. Holland, too, was witnessing some of Mr. Rinsch's behavior. He was sending her text messages, which The Times reviewed, containing bizarre doodles with incomprehensible annotations.
Yet Ms. Holland didn't realize the extent of the problem until Ms. Rosés reached out in July 2020. She informed Ms. Holland and another Netflix executive, Peter Friedlander, about Mr. Rinsch's state. Two days later, she filed for divorce.
In September 2020, Netflix shook up its management team. Ms. Holland and another executive involved with Mr. Rinsch's contract would leave the company.
A few months later, Mr. Friedlander and a Netflix business affairs executive, Rochelle Gerson, called Ms. Rosés. They wanted to know whether she could get access to the show's footage so they could figure out what still needed to be done to complete the first season. When Ms. Rosés told them that she didn't feel comfortable doing so without Mr. Rinsch's approval, Ms. Gerson worried that Mr. Rinsch might have an "explosive response" if Ms. Rosés broached the matter with him.
Ms. Gerson soon began receiving emails from Mr. Rinsch in which he claimed, among other things, to have found a way to map "the coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth."
Netflix executives grew so concerned with Mr. Rinsch's behavior that they consulted with the Los Angeles Police Department's threat management unit, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A Police Department psychologist reviewed Mr. Rinsch's texts and emails and concluded that he didn't seem like a threat to himself or others.
Five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari
Netflix no longer saw a way forward with the production. On March 18, 2021, Ms. Gerson informed Mr. Rinsch by email that Netflix had decided to stop funding "Conquest." She told him that he was free to shop it elsewhere but that any acquirer would have to reimburse Netflix for what it had spent.
Mr. Rinsch sent angry emails to Ms. Gerson and a Netflix lawyer, accusing them of breaching his contract. In one email, he addressed the subject of his mental health. "To state it simply, I am of sound mind and body," he wrote.
Mr. Rinsch had begun using what remained of the $ 11 million that Netflix had wired his production company to place bets on crypto. He transferred more than $ 4 million from his Schwab account to an account on the Kraken exchange and bought Dogecoin, a dog-themed cryptocurrency, according to an account statement reviewed by The Times. Unlike his stock market investments, this one paid off: When he liquidated his Dogecoin positions in May 2021, he had a balance of nearly $ 27 million.
"Thank you and god bless crypto," an elated Mr. Rinsch wrote in an online chat with a Kraken representative.
Mr. Rinsch then went on a spending spree. He bought five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, a $ 387,630 Vacheron Constantin watch and millions of dollars' worth of high-end furniture and designer clothing. The tab came to $ 8.7 million, according to a forensic accountant hired by Ms. Rosés.
By then, Mr. Rinsch's divorce from Ms. Rosés had turned acrimonious. Her legal team suspected that the purchases were designed to hide Mr. Rinsch's crypto winnings.
Mr. Rinsch responded in a deposition that the cars and furniture were props for "Conquest" and that he had paid for them with Netflix's production money. But in his arbitration case with Netflix, he took a different position: In confidential filings reviewed by The Times, he argued that the money was contractually his and that Netflix owed him several more payments totaling more than $ 14 million.
Netflix disagrees. In a motion it filed in July, the company said the payments were contingent on Mr. Rinsch's hitting various production milestones, which it contends he never did. The case went to a hearing before an arbitrator this month. A ruling is expected soon.

At Las Vegas Race, Big Stars Outshine the Cars: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "If this was an R-rated comedy, and they put all these set pieces together like the poker, and the cars, and the Vegas of it all, no one would buy this movie," said Hamish Linklater, an actor and playwright.
It was Friday night in Las Vegas and Mr. Linklater was standing inside Lavo, a dark, chandelier-filled lounge at the Venetian Resort. About a hundred people had gathered for a star-backed charity poker and blackjack tournament hosted by Ben Affleck -- with Jennifer Lopez at his side -- during the Formula 1 Grand Prix Weekend, an event that culminated with one of the nearly two dozen similar races that determine Formula 1's world champion.
Organizers spent $ 500 million on the Las Vegas race, which was the first of its kind in the city in decades. The race -- which was won by Max Verstappen -- drew celebrities, athletes, and moneyed spectators to watch drivers zoom around the famed Las Vegas Strip turned racetrack, and attend extravagant parties. Between the roaring cars, marquee names, and lucrative branding opportunities, it was over the top, as Mr. Linklater suggested, even for Las Vegas, a city founded on diversion.
The tournament opened with a reception at Lavo, and then moved upstairs to a side room for the games. Guests, who included Jon Hamm, Jimmy Kimmel, Colton Underwood, James Marsden and Tobey Maguire, spent about an hour drinking champagne (served by a woman dressed as a peacock) and eating Wagyu sirloin and Australian rack of lamb.
The guests then played rounds of poker before stepping out to a terrace at about midnight to watch racecars hurl down the Strip during the qualifying round of the F1 race. (Proceeds from the tournament benefited the Eastern Congo Initiative, a charity founded by Mr. Affleck, which provides humanitarian assistance for the people of Congo.)
Mr. Affleck said he was struck by the influx of people. "I've never seen Las Vegas like this, so full," he said, after posing for pictures. "I've never had so many celebrities and high-rollers be like, 'Can you get me a room?"' said Mr. Affleck, who frequently visits Las Vegas.
Mr. Hamm, standing with his wife Anna Osceola, said he got into F1 as a child. "I loved collecting all the cars," he said, adding, "Americans are just now discovering it, even though it's been around for so long."
Mr. Kimmel, the television host, however, found the entire affair to be a headache, a sentiment echoed by some locals. Ubers and taxis couldn't get to some locations, and crossing the street near the Strip was difficult.
"It's a little crazy out there," he said referring to the Strip, which was shut down for long stretches during races and practices. "The driver who picked us up from the airport had no idea where to take us."
But Mr. Kimmel said he is not really familiar with F1. "I am sure I would get into F1 if I watched three episodes of the Netflix show, but I'm really busy," he said, referencing "Formula One: Drive to Survive," the documentary series that follows F1 drivers, which many attribute to fueling American interest in the sport.
Despite the popularity of F1, however, there were questions about how the weekend would be received. The eventual winner, Mr. Verstappen, had critiqued the event as "99 percent show and one percent sporting event." (After his win, he changed his tune, chanting "Viva Las Vegas" in his racecar.) Early ticket sales did not meet expectations, and an early practice round had to be canceled because of a hazard on the track, which led to a lawsuit from ticket holders.
But the fans, brands and public figures still showed up. More than 300,000 people attended, and Formula 1 estimated that the event would have an economic impact of $ 1.2 billion to Las Vegas. American Express gave out F1-themed friendship bracelets and fanny packs to cardholders, Sotheby's hired James Corden to help auction off used F1 racecars, and T-Mobile branded the Las Vegas Sphere. Patron had a booze-fueled party headlined by Fisher, the Australian D.J., at the nightclub Hakkasan.
About four hours before the race was scheduled to begin, huge crowds of people, including Rihanna, David Beckham, Brad Pitt and Gordon Ramsay, packed into the Paddock, the working area of F1 next to the track where the cars are kept, drivers prepare for the race, and the engineering teams are based. The Paddock also had a premium hospitality area known as the Paddock Club with a rooftop deck with wide views of the track and private, premium suites.
Celebrities and sponsors inspected the cars up close and watched engineers run through practice drills like changing a tire in seconds. Bars set up outside the track served espresso martinis and champagne, and an Elvis impersonator conducted weddings and vow renewals in a makeshift chapel. Nearby, couples posed for pictures with a racecar decorated with the sign, "Just married."
"Everything is a shock to me right now," said Will Claye, an Olympic track and field athlete. "My mind is blown. I thought they just drove, but there are all these people managing all these details and everything is thought of in terms of milliseconds."
Other F1 events have been held in similarly opulent destinations and Mr. Claye said the locations of the races are part of the appeal. "You have Miami, you have Monaco, you have Vegas, these are places you want to go regardless," he said. "So when they have F1 with these cars, and how much they cost, you're like I'm going."
Taylor Zakhar Perez, an actor who starred in the romantic comedy "Red, White, & Royal Blue," said being around these sophisticated cars was nothing new. "My dad has a body shop, and I grew up in body shops, so this is very normal for me," he said.
But seeing them race around a place like Las Vegas was new. "You just hear zoom, zoom when the cars go past you, and it's so sick," he said.
He was with Madeleine White, a social media influencer who has more than 4 million followers on TikTok. "I attended the Ferrari fashion show in September and got to know the team, and they asked if I wanted to come to Vegas with them," she said. "Of course, I said yes."
The race began about 10 p.m., and celebrities, like Patrick Dempsey, Paris Hilton and Usain Bolt, filed into suites to watch the main event while drinking from an open bar and dining on items like lobster and steak.
While most of the notable names were spectators, some were enlisted in the festivities. Donny Osmond sang the national anthem and Justin Bieber stood at the finish line and waved the black and white checkered flag.
Kylie Minogue, the Australian singer who was performing at a party over the weekend at Voltaire, one of Las Vegas' newest nightlife venues, where she is also doing a residency, had the opportunity to ride around the track at speed, before the race.
"I was screaming my head off. Tiny me in that car!" she said. "I was safely buckled in, but I was being thrust around, and it was a real thrill."
It gave her a chance to take in all the crowds around the course. "It was a lot of a lot, which is Vegas."

F1 in Las Vegas: A Roaring Spectacle for Fans, but a Huge Headache for Locals

LAS VEGAS — Rajine Jones has a front-row seat to the Las Vegas Grand Prix, one of the most audacious events to roar into a city built on spectacle. Not that she will be able to see it.
On Saturday night, Formula One race cars will be hurtling down the Las Vegas Strip and buzzing past towering casinos, just outside the convenience store where Jones sells vape cartridges and energy drinks to tourists. But race organizers have shrouded the Strip in black tarp and fencing, and covered the glass on pedestrian walkways with white film and floodlights, obscuring the festivities from those without a $1,000 ticket.
“They blocked it,” Jones said, looking out her front doors at a line of tarp-covered fence. “We can’t see nothing.”
Race and county officials described the barriers and film as safety measures to protect the public and drivers. But to workers and small-business owners, it is the latest indignity of a monthslong construction project that has turned the Strip into a racetrack, while also causing huge headaches.
Race organizers and tourism officials have touted the Las Vegas Grand Prix as a sporting and economic success story years in the making — one that will infuse Las Vegas with celebrities, concerts and $1 billion in economic activity on a normally quiet pre-Thanksgiving weekend.
But local businesses and workers say they have been disproportionately forced to pay the price — in reduced profits, layoffs and exasperated hours stranded in traffic. They say that while the race may fill airports with private planes and penthouse suites with high-rollers, the losses suffered by everyday workers and small businesses are being overlooked.
“You can’t do this to a city,” said Wade Bohn, who runs Jay’s Market, a gas station and convenience store a few blocks off Las Vegas Boulevard, the formal name for the Strip.
He and other business owners say they have lost customers over the past six months as construction and road closures turned the Strip into a gridlocked labyrinth. Crews have repaved roads to accommodate F1 racers going 200 mph, built a pit area and erected temporary grandstands to accommodate 105,000 fans.
At Battista’s Hole in the Wall, an old-school Italian restaurant in the middle of the construction, revenue from each dinner shift has fallen by about $6,000 a night. The owner, Randy Markin, said he has stopped paying himself and can no longer afford to give his staff quarterly bonuses.
Hourly workers at casinos, hotels and restaurants also say they have been hit hard. Some servers and bartenders have lost thousands of dollars in tips because of a drop in customers. Some people’s commute times have tripled.
“They don’t pay me for the extra time,” said Carmen Gomez, who works nights sweeping the pedestrian bridges that span Las Vegas Boulevard. She said her 15-minute bus ride to work now takes an hour.
Jones, 28, who works at the convenience store facing Las Vegas Boulevard, said she has to navigate one set of road closures and one-lane traffic to take her 8-year-old son and 2-year-old twins to a 24-hour day care, and then fight through a second gantlet to get from day care to her job. Her half-hour commute is now 90 minutes each way.
At the cherry-red Jay’s Market, Bohn struggled on Thursday to contain his emotions as he surveyed the half-empty store. He blamed a temporary bridge on Flamingo Road that had been built to carry traffic over one section of the racecourse. It has funneled customers away from him entirely.
Normally, his gas station is packed with tourists from California filling up their tanks and grabbing sandwiches, but he said his revenue this year is down $2.2 million compared with 2022.
He has laid off seven of his 12 employees, and said he does not know whether his store will survive if the Grand Prix becomes an annual event in the heart of the Strip, as local leaders envision. He said he has sent several emails and called Clark County commissioners, who approved the race, but has not gotten any response. (Because the Strip and racecourse lie outside Las Vegas city limits, the event is overseen by the county).
Colleen Angel is one of the workers who was laid off from Bohn’s store. She had taken the job as a graveyard-shift cashier this year in the hope that it would be steady work after years of doing various gigs such as teaching singing, performing in a classic-rock band and doing retail work.
She said the tensions swirling around the Grand Prix had highlighted the disparate treatment received by major corporations and the thousands of workers who keep the roulette wheels spinning, pillows plumped, floors gleaming and drinks cold.
“It’s not just about bad traffic for a few months,” she said. “It’s the people who work on the Strip. The reason people come here from all over the world, the amenities — it takes a lot of backbreaking work to keep it in place.”
Fans and race organizers are calling the Grand Prix a triumphant return that brings F1 racing back to Las Vegas for the first time in 40 years. The race Saturday is the first in what is expected to be a decade of racing, and local officials say they want a “lifetime partnership” with F1 — part of a campaign to diversify the Strip with new sports stadiums and an otherworldly Magic 8 ball of an amphitheater called the Sphere.
County officials have said the race is expected to bring in $100 million in taxes and create at least 7,700 jobs.
“It has not all been sacrifice,” Jim Gibson, a county commissioner, told 8 News Now Las Vegas. Members of the county commission did not respond to interview requests, or declined to comment. Race organizers did not respond to a request for comment.
This fall, the commission sharply questioned race officials over their plans to help get thousands of casino employees to and from work. Some commissioners have also balked at a request from the Grand Prix for Clark County to chip in $40 million to help pay for road work done for the race.
One of the questions still looming like a cloud of exhaust over the race is whether it can draw enough people to fill 105,000 seats and generate all of the predicted economic returns for Las Vegas. On Friday, the day before the race, there were still tickets available for the three-day event, and ticket prices on resale websites were going for less than full price.
Still, as the race cars revved up for their first practice run Thursday night, the Strip was filled with thousands of excited fans from China, Mexico, Europe and across the United States, decked out in Ferrari T-shirts, Mercedes-Benz baseball caps and Red Bull racing jackets.
Some fans, including Jesus Nuñez, 31, who flew up from Mexico City with eight family members, could not afford tickets, so they perched along a railing outside a casino, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mexican driver Sergio Pérez through the black-screened fencing. “It’s exciting,” he said.
Zia Hasan, who bought passes as a birthday present for his 17-year-old son, Shayan, said it was thrilling to wander down Las Vegas Boulevard beside the racing lights.
“The tickets are pricey, but it’s once in a lifetime,” he said.
A different kind of Las Vegas Grand Prix, however, is taking place away from the track and lights.
Out there on the clogged streets, Tsegaw Ashine, 38, a taxi driver who moved to Las Vegas in 2016, said he would love to watch the Grand Prix, but instead will spend race weekend weaving through the orange barrels, avoiding angry drivers and trying to earn enough to get by despite the gridlock.
“Our business is our time,” he said. “We’ve got to try to pick up more people.”

Full text: The flashy adult playground shrouds itself in black tarp to block views of the racing spectacle from prying (unticketed) eyes. Its transformation has become a long-term, costly nuisance for locals.
Rajine Jones has a front-row seat to the Las Vegas Grand Prix, one of the most audacious events to roar into a city built on spectacle. Not that she will be able to see it.
On Saturday night, Formula One racecars will be hurtling down the Las Vegas Strip and buzzing past towering casinos, just outside the convenience store where Ms. Jones sells vape cartridges and energy drinks to tourists. But race organizers have shrouded the Strip in black tarp and fencing, and covered the glass on pedestrian walkways with white film and floodlights, obscuring the festivities from those without a $ 1,000 ticket.
"They blocked it," Ms. Jones said, looking out her front doors at a line of tarp-covered fence. "We can't see nothing."
Race and county officials described the barriers and film as safety measures to protect the public and drivers. But to workers and small-business owners, it is the latest indignity of a monthslong construction project that has turned the Strip into a racetrack, while also causing huge headaches.
Race organizers and tourism officials have touted the Las Vegas Grand Prix as a sporting and economic success story years in the making -- one that will infuse Las Vegas with celebrities, concerts and $ 1 billion in economic activity on a normally quiet pre-Thanksgiving weekend.
But local businesses and workers say they have been disproportionately forced to pay the price -- in reduced profits, layoffs and exasperated hours stranded in traffic. They say that while the race may fill airports with private planes and penthouse suites with high-rollers, the losses suffered by everyday workers and small businesses are being overlooked.
"You can't do this to a city," said Wade Bohn, who runs Jay's Market, a gas station and convenience store a few blocks off Las Vegas Boulevard, the formal name for the Strip.
He and other business owners say they have lost customers over the past six months as construction and road closures turned the Strip into a gridlocked labyrinth. Crews have repaved roads to accommodate Formula One racers going 200 miles per hour, built a pit area and erected temporary grandstands to accommodate 105,000 fans.
At Battista's Hole in the Wall, an old-school Italian restaurant in the middle of the construction, revenue from each dinner shift has fallen by about $ 6,000 a night. The owner, Randy Markin, said he has stopped paying himself and can no longer afford to give his staff quarterly bonuses.
Hourly workers at casinos, hotels and restaurants also say they have been hit hard. Some waiters and bartenders have lost thousands of dollars in tips because of a drop in customers. Some people's commute times have tripled.
"They don't pay me for the extra time," said Carmen Gomez, who works nights sweeping the pedestrian bridges that span Las Vegas Boulevard. She said her 15-minute bus ride to work now takes an hour.
Ms. Jones, 28, who works at the convenience store facing Las Vegas Boulevard, said she has to navigate one set of road closures and one-lane traffic to take her 8-year-old son and 2-year-old twins to a 24-hour day care, and then fight through a second gantlet to get from day care to her job. Her half-hour commute is now 90 minutes each way.
At the cherry-red Jay's Market, Mr. Bohn struggled on Thursday to contain his emotions as he surveyed the half-empty store. He blamed a temporary bridge on Flamingo Road that had been built to carry traffic over one section of the racecourse. It has funneled customers away from him entirely.
Normally, his gas station is packed with tourists from California filling up their tanks and grabbing sandwiches, but he said his revenue this year is down $ 2.2 million compared with 2022.
He has laid off seven of his 12 employees, and said he does not know whether his store will survive if the Grand Prix becomes an annual event in the heart of the Strip, as local leaders envision. He said he has sent several emails and called the Clark County commissioners, who approved the race, but has not gotten any response. (Because the Strip and racecourse lie outside Las Vegas city limits, the event is overseen by the county).
Colleen Angel is one of the workers who was laid off from Mr. Bohn's store. She had taken the job as a graveyard-shift cashier earlier this year in the hope that it would be steady work after years of doing various gigs such as teaching singing, performing in a classic-rock band and doing retail work.
She said the tensions swirling around the Grand Prix had highlighted the disparate treatment received by major corporations and the thousands of workers who keep the roulette wheels spinning, pillows plumped, floors gleaming and drinks cold.
"It's not just about bad traffic for a few months," she said. "It's the people who work on the Strip. The reason people come here from all over the world, the amenities -- it takes a lot of backbreaking work to keep it in place."
Fans and race organizers are calling the Grand Prix a triumphant return that brings Formula 1 racing back to Las Vegas for the first time in 40 years. The race on Saturday is the first in what is expected to be a decade of racing, and local officials say they want a "lifetime partnership" with Formula 1 -- part of a campaign to diversify the Strip with new sports stadiums and an otherworldly Magic 8 ball of an amphitheater called the Sphere.
County officials have said the race is expected to bring in $ 100 million in taxes and create at least 7,700 jobs.
"It has not all been sacrifice," Jim Gibson, a county commissioner, told 8 News Now Las Vegas. Members of the county commission did not respond to interview requests, or declined to comment. Race organizers did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this fall, the commission sharply questioned race officials over their plans to help get thousands of casino employees to and from work. Some members of the commission have also balked at a request from the Grand Prix for Clark County to chip in $ 40 million to help pay for road work done for the race.
One of the questions still looming like a cloud of exhaust over the race is whether it can draw enough people to fill 105,000 seats and generate all of the predicted economic returns for Las Vegas. On Friday, the day before the race, there were still tickets available for the three-day event, and ticket prices on resale websites were going for less than full price.
Still, as the racecars revved up for their first practice run on Thursday night, the Strip was filled with thousands of excited fans from China, Mexico, Europe and across the United States, decked out in Ferrari T-shirts, Mercedes-Benz baseball caps and Red Bull racing jackets.
Some fans, like Jesus Nuñez, 31, who flew up from Mexico City with eight family members, could not afford tickets, so they perched along a railing outside a casino, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Mexican driver Sergio Pérez through the black-screened fencing. "It's exciting," he said.
Zia Hasan, who bought passes as a birthday present for his 17-year-old son, Shayan, said it was thrilling to wander down Las Vegas Boulevard beside the racing lights.
"The tickets are pricey, but it's once in a lifetime," he said.
A different kind of Las Vegas Grand Prix, however, is taking place away from the track and lights.
Out there on the clogged streets, Tsegaw Ashine, 38, a taxi driver who moved to Las Vegas in 2016, said he would love to watch the Grand Prix, but instead will spend race weekend weaving through the orange barrels, avoiding angry drivers and trying to earn enough to get by despite the gridlock.
"Our business is our time," he said. "We've got to try to pick up more people."

Ferrari Luxury Has Its Price: $51.7 Million for a '62 GTO: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A single-lot auction of a classic racing car that is considered the Holy Grail of Ferraris last changed hands in 1985 -- for a fraction of the price.
A bright red Ferrari with a storied history sold for $ 51.7 million, with buyer's fees, on Monday, becoming the most expensive automobile from that Italian carmaker ever sold at auction. The price nevertheless fell short of the auction house's expectations at a time when the once red-hot market for collectibles has begun to cool amid geopolitical uncertainty and rising interest rates.
RM Sotheby's, the automobile seller in which Sotheby's bought a controlling stake in 2022, offered the 1962 Ferrari 330 LM/250 GTO by Scaglietti with an unpublished estimate of $ 60 million. Two bidders drove the price to $ 47 million before auction-house fees. (RM Sotheby's declined to give any information about the buyer.)
Sotheby's promoted the car as a luxury object, offering it in a stand-alone sale during its marquee fall auctions of fine art in New York. To drive the point home, the auctioneer, Oliver Barker -- who is also chairman of Sotheby's Europe -- presided over the proceedings at Sotheby's York Avenue headquarters, where the car was parked in front of a painting by the contemporary art star Jonas Wood.
There are only 36 Ferrari 250 GTOs in existence, produced between 1962 and 1964. Owners of the car instantly become members of an exclusive club that includes the fashion designer Ralph Lauren and Nick Mason, the drummer for Pink Floyd.
RM Sotheby's described this particular car as "one of one." Although it looks almost identical to a 250 GTO, it was originally configured as a 330 LM, an even rarer car with a slightly larger engine. Converted into a 250 GTO later in 1962, it is the only one ever raced by Scuderia Ferrari, the carmaker's racing division. Ferrari sold it to a Sicilian surgeon in 1964 for $ 6,000.
The car, known as Chassis number 3765, failed to approach the current auction record for a classic car, which was set last year when RM Sotheby's sold a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe for €135 million, or about $ 144 million today. (A Ferrari 250 GTO was reported to have sold privately in 2016 for more than $ 70 million.)
The $ 51.7 million price is still a considerable markup from the roughly $ 500,000 it sold for when it last changed hands in 1985 -- or $ 1.4 million today -- according to Gord Duff, RM Sotheby's global head of auctions. An RM Sotheby's spokesman confirmed the seller was Jim Jaeger, an Ohio-based collector and co-founder of a radar detection business.
Simon Kidston, a Geneva-based classic car dealer, said that the Chassis number 3765's unique history may have hurt more than it helped. "It's a great car. I don't think, unfortunately, that everybody understands it," he said. "In a market where appearances are very important and people like the comfort of belonging to a group of like-minded owners, anything that needs explaining is always a little bit more of a challenge to sell."

Picasso Work Sells for $139.4 Million at Sotheby's: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The blue-chip collection of Emily Fisher Landau sold at Sotheby's on Wednesday night for a total of $ 406.4 million.
A brilliant blue painting by Pablo Picasso of his young mistress was crowned the prized lot of the November auction season so far after it sold at Sotheby's in New York for $ 139.4 million, with buyer's fees, on Wednesday.
Completed during one of the most intense years of the artist's personal life, the 1932 portrait of Picasso's great muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, remained on the auction block for four minutes as three collectors over the phones from around the world fought to establish control. But it was an anonymous bidder who named the winning price over the telephone. (The work fell short of the $ 179.4 million auction high for the artist, established at Christie's in 2015.)
The evening sale of blue-chip modern and contemporary art from the estate of Emily Fisher Landau, an arts patron who had her own private museum in Long Island City, Queens, was somewhat protected from market volatility because Sotheby's had assured the owners that it would purchase the Picasso -- and nearly 30 other consignments from the estate -- if buyers failed to bid above a minimum price. Auctioneers said that over recent weeks they were in a frenzy to secure third-party guarantees that were slightly higher, saving their company from assuming debt on the trove of artworks.
"When it's hard to compel someone to sell something, you need to put money on the table," said Benjamin Godsill, an art adviser watching the sale. "The headline for me is keep calm and carry on. There is still a market, even if there weren't fireworks."
The sale drew a total of $ 406.4 million, on estimates of $ 344.5 million to $ 430 million. It included a new benchmark for the painter Agnes Martin, whose 1961 "Grey Stone II" went for $ 18.7 million -- the estimate was $ 6 million to $ 8 million -- in a bidding war between gallerists and collectors in the room that briefly recalled the rabid buying of last year.
"The estimate was extremely conservative, likely because the market had never been tested for a piece like that," said Betsy Bickar, a senior art adviser at Citi Private Bank.
But that electricity soon faded when the marquee Picasso arrived on the auction block. The room was quiet as Sotheby's staff worked the phones to arouse bidders. The winning bid was taken by Brooke Lampley, the company's chairman and head of global fine art, who organized the sale.
"That was a lot of effort for a foregone conclusion," the arts journalist Marion Maneker remarked in the room. The Picasso had an irrevocable bid ensuring the lot would sell. The price of an irrevocable bid is typically close to the painting's low estimate.
Financial engineering and tight choreography have become an industry standard as higher prices collide with the headwinds of economic uncertainty. High interest rates and two wars have knocked out a sizable portion of collectors. Sanctions brought after the outbreak of war in Ukraine prevented many Russian collectors from directly participating in the auctions, and more recently, the Israel-Hamas war has diverted the attention of some Middle Eastern collectors.
Asian buyers have also indicated a soft retreat from the market. Last month, an auction of deaccessioned paintings from the Long Museum in Shanghai only achieved a fraction of its high estimate of $ 150 million. The total after fees was $ 69.5 million, with 10 artworks failing to sell, including a $ 7 million picture of a lion by the artist David Hockney. Some analysts attributed the lackluster results to China's cratering property market.
But there were signs of return at Sotheby's, where the auction house said a $ 22 million painting by Mark Rothko and a $ 1.4 million Jean Arp sculpture were among the pieces that went to Asian collectors.
"This has definitely moved from a seller's market to buyer's market," said Kristine Bell, a senior partner at David Zwirner who monitors auctions for the mega-gallery.
On Tuesday, the "21st Century" evening sale at Christie's inaugurated the biggest week of the art market with a thud. Premium fees kicked the total to $ 107.5 million across 41 lots, after two paintings were withdrawn and others failed to gain bidders. The sale estimate range, which does not include fees, was $ 99 million to $ 143 million.
Patterns seen in the uneven spring sales continued this season: Speculation on paintings by "ultracontemporary" artists -- those born after 1975 -- remained the liveliest part of the evening. Works completed in the last three years by rising artists like Stefanie Heinze, Jenna Gribbon and Jadé Fadojutimi zoomed past their high estimates. (Gribbon, Fadojutimi, Jia Aili and Ilana Savdie achieved auction highs.)
But some works from established artists like Cy Twombly, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jeff Koons failed to reach their low estimates.
"They just didn't feel like once-in-a-lifetime opportunities," said Godsill, the art adviser. "And it's important to note that new artists who did succeed were women and artists of color."
Ahead of Wednesday's evening auction, Sotheby's executives boasted about the Picasso, saying that the artist used the painting to unveil his affair simultaneously to his wife and to the world.
"My only question is, should the estimate have been higher?" Lampley mused. "No one has challenged me to say that the estimate is too high."
The major auction houses will continue to offer paintings through next week as they try to close nearly $ 1 billion each in total business. Upcoming highlights at Christie's include two Nazi restitution cases. The Thursday evening sale of 20th-century art at Christie's includes a Cézanne, estimated at $ 35 million to $ 55 million, specifically meant to help a Swiss museum with financial problems; it will also involve some compensation for the family of a Jewish dealer who once owned the painting. A second sale at Christie's offers several Egon Schiele drawings, returned to a family that has been seeking them for more than a quarter-century, which will fund a scholarship program for young musicians.
Both major houses are spicing up their sales with luxury items. Christie's sold a Jean Royère sofa on Tuesday for $ 945,000, while Sotheby's is planning to auction a Ferrari GTO next week for more than $ 60 million. Both sales will contribute to the grand totals that the companies will promote when the fall auction season ends.
Natasha Degen, professor of art market studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said these unorthodox offerings attract new clientele and generate publicity. "It is yet another example of the auction houses wanting to be perceived as central clearinghouses for luxury writ large," she said. "And if the Ferrari does meet its mark, then Sotheby's will have another headline-grabbing price."

Privacy Concerns Rise With the Rapid Spread Of Facial Recognition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Facial recognition software is speeding up check-in at airports, cruise ships and theme parks, but experts worry about risks to security and privacy.
You may not have to fumble with your cellphone in the boarding area very much longer. As the travel industry embraces facial recognition technology, phones are beginning to go the way of paper tickets at airports, cruise terminals and theme parks, making checking in more convenient, but raising privacy and security concerns, too.
"Before Covid it felt like a future thing," said Hicham Jaddoud, a professor of hospitality and tourism at the University of Southern California, describing the way contactless transactions have become common since the pandemic. That includes facial recognition, which is "now making its way into daily operations" in the travel industry, Dr. Jaddoud said.
Facial recognition systems are already being expanded at some airports. At Miami International, for example, cameras at 12 gates serving international flights match passengers' faces to the passport photographs they have on file with the airlines, letting passengers at those gates board without showing physical passports or boarding passes. The company installing the systems, SITA, has been contracted to do the same for a number of international gates in 10 other U.S. airports, including Boston Logan International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. (Passengers can opt out and still present physical documents instead, SITA says.)
The technology is also speeding up the wait for some passengers at immigration. Members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry program can now bypass lines at the kiosks at seven U.S. airports, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport, by taking a selfie on arrival using its new phone app. The selfie is matched with the agency's facial biometrics database.
Cruise ship operators are also betting that facial recognition will improve passengers' experience. On Carnival Cruise ships, a camera photographs passengers each time they get on or off the ship to know who's aboard in case of an emergency, and to make sure only authorized people are on the ship. Facial recognition also allows passengers to receive pictures of themselves taken by onboard photographers, rather than scanning hundreds of photos looking for the ones in which they appear. Holland America, which uses similar technology, says facial recognition has sped up its check-in process by as much as 40 percent. Both companies say they purge all biometric data after each voyage and that guests can opt out of the system.
Visitors to the theme parks on Yas Island, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, can use a facial recognition system for entry and to buy food and souvenirs at attractions like Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World Abu Dhabi and Yas Waterworld. Guests who sign up for the program submit a selfie using an app, which connects their photos with their tickets. When they arrive at the park, the turnstiles open automatically once a camera identifies them. And park guests who submit credit card information can also pay for souvenirs and food by looking into a camera. In the United States, Disney World said it tested facial recognition to enter parks in 2021 but decided not to keep using it.
Hotel chains are taking more of a wait-and-see approach, Dr. Jaddoud said. Marriott tested facial recognition technology for check-in at two hotels in China a few years ago, but there's no sign the broader industry has any immediate plans to roll out technology that might, for example, let guests open their hotel rooms with their faces instead of key cards.
As the use of facial recognition technology spreads, some experts worry about the risks to travelers' privacy and security. Unlike a password, which can be reset, biometric data cannot easily be changed without significantly altering your appearance, said Phil Siegel, co-founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation, a nonprofit group.
As with other sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, people's images could be used by criminals, perhaps to impersonate people online or even create deepfake videos, said Nima Schei, chief executive of Hummingbirds AI, a start-up that works with facial recognition.
If biometric data is stolen or misused, travelers don't have much recourse, said Alex Alben, who teaches privacy, data and cybersecurity at the University of California Los Angeles and University of Washington law schools. There are no federal laws regarding the use of biometric data, he said, although a few states are beginning to create a patchwork of legal protections, and in the European Union and Britain, companies must get permission from consumers to collect their data and must tell them what it will be used for.
Private companies' management of facial recognition data worries Jeramie D. Scott, director of the Project on Surveillance Oversight at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Companies, he said, could be hacked or could turn the data over to government entities, who might use it for surveillance. Some might even sell customers' biometric information or find other ways to profit off it and bury those intentions in the fine print, Mr. Scott said -- a scenario that could echo the "Black Mirror" episode "Joan Is Awful," in which a fictional streaming service uses its terms-and-conditions agreement to hijack the main character's life for a TV series.
One company has already used facial recognition technology to exclude people from its premises. Last year, MSG Entertainment, which owns Radio City Music Hall in New York, barred a lawyer from seeing the Rockettes with her daughter's scout troop, because she worked for a firm the company viewed as adversarial.
Facial recognition software has also been shown to be less accurate for certain demographic groups, said Mr. Scott, and even with improvements, the algorithms are typically not shared or tested publicly "so we need to take the company's word about their accuracy," he said.
On a recent Virgin Voyages cruise through the Greek Islands, one passenger, Divya McDuffie, a media executive from New York, was asked to upload a selfie as part of the check-in process to help identify her when she got on and off the ship. Ms. McDuffie said she was fine with facial recognition as a security measure, but if hospitality companies started using it to, say, assess her mood, target her with offers or steer her toward some kind of action, "absolutely 'no' to that," she said, and stressed the need for transparency. "If there isn't a disclaimer where I can make an informed decision, that would be disturbing. Where would it end?"
Some companies are responding to privacy concerns as they offer new products. GetPica, an Italian facial recognition software company, helps resorts like Club Med deliver personalized photo streams to its guests from the hundreds taken each day by photographers roving a property. Guests can opt in by logging into the phone app and submitting a selfie. They will then be shown a copy of any photo they appear in, to see if they want to purchase it.
Guests can choose to be anonymized with A.I.-created faces if they appear in other people's photos, and those who do not opt into the system have their faces automatically anonymized. "Privacy protection is one of the most important aspects of the system," said Dhiren Fonseca, a strategic adviser for GetPica, "so we let the users select the level they want."
Facial recognition technology will increasingly offer travelers shorter lines and fewer documents to juggle, but all that convenience may have a cost, warned Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. By accepting more surveillance technology, he said, "we open ourselves to tracking where we are and who we are with all the time."

Bars Can't Constrain Their Teen Spirit: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The land of high fashion and Ferraris turns its talents to disposable teenage melodrama.
The latest television export from Italy is called "The Sea Beyond" but you could be excused if you thought you were watching "Italy's Next Top Juvenile Offender." The young performers playing the inmates of a Naples detention center are molto bello. It's hot in there and we're not just talking about the steam in the showers, though there's a lot of that, too.
And the eye candy isn't just human. Like "My Brilliant Friend" and "Gomorrah," "The Sea Beyond" exploits the Neapolitan sun, water and sky for maximum pictorial effect, and it wraps itself in the city's architectural and scenic splendors. Mount Vesuvius looms in the distance while the fictional prison that serves as the primary location looks like a factory building converted to industrial-chic dormitory housing for tech workers. A naval base in real life, it has a picturesque location on a pier; the show's Italian title, "Mare Fuori," translates more literally to "The Sea Outside," as in the sea outside the prison windows.
These are most likely a few of the reasons for the popularity of "The Sea Beyond," whose first season (from 2020) premieres in America on Tuesday on the streaming service MHz Choice. Italian viewers are getting ready for Season 4, whose filming was occasionally interrupted by the screams of fans clustered outside the prison gates.
Based on the first season, it is easy enough to understand the impact of "The Sea Beyond" on T-shirt sales and young heart rates. But the series does not ascend to the rarefied levels of teenage melodrama where you would find James Dean or "The O.C." (a show that "The Sea Beyond" has in its DNA). Its heart is pure soap opera, and the writing and direction do not aspire to more.
Anguished wailing and collapsing in tears take up a lot of screen time, with the occasional didactic lecture from a warden or parent. Hard slaps are followed by hard hugs. Prison-movie clichés are indulged, perhaps with a wink or perhaps not; a tough guy actually says "Tell my pa I wasn't scared" as he dies in a guard's arms. When coherent plotting becomes too much to ask, coincidence takes over; characters talk about their plans or leave their hiding places at exactly the wrong moments.
This is all reasonably entertaining, in a while-you-check-your-email kind of way. When you get to the part about the girl who shoplifts a dress and goes to surprise her boyfriend at the fancy hotel where he's staying but gets there a few minutes after the prostitute sent to his room as a gift by a gangster, you may roll your eyes but you probably won't stop watching.
Cristina Farina, the show's creator and head writer, shrewdly exploits the way in which her youth prison story sits at the nexus of a cluster of dramatic genres -- family, romantic, social, criminal, medical, classroom, striving-artist -- to give the show variety.
The first season is structured around the fight for the soul of Filippo (Nicolas Maupas), a rich boy from northern Italy who is a classic jailhouse innocent. Representing good is Filippo's fellow newbie Carmine (Massimiliano Caiazzo), an aspiring hairdresser who happens to be a member of a low-level crime family; on Filippo's other shoulder is Ciro (Giacomo Giorgio), a young career criminal who is the detention center's alpha male.
These three go through a convoluted cycle of betrayals, beat-downs and rapprochements, stretched beyond dramatic coherence in order to fill the season's 12 episodes while landing on a cliffhanger. The numerous subsidiary stories include the travails of a boy and his pit bull (named Tyson) and the wary romance between Filippo, who is a piano prodigy, and the equally talented Naditza (the charismatic Valentina Romani), who has her own problems in the girls' ward with an auburn-haired psycho Svengali named Viola (Serena De Ferrari).
The presence of girls and boys in the same jail, separated by a flimsy fence and guarded with a laxity that allows for frequent hookups, reflects a melodramatic license that runs through the show. Despite the objective seriousness of the situation (many of the teenage inmates have committed murder, though with extenuating circumstances detailed in copious flashbacks) and the constant threats and violence, there is an innocence of tone and a general lack of real fright or tension. As drama goes, that's a failing; as youth-focused cultural phenomena go, it's a feature.

Cult Star Makes A Statement, Much of It Unprintable: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The impish persona and insouciant attitude of the Formula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda have overturned stereotypes. The next step? Showing he can keep up with rivals.
The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula 1 race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.
Yet at a fan event in central Tokyo last week, Mr. Tsunoda appeared jovial as he shared the stage with several rivals. When a moderator asked him to teach his fellow drivers a few words of the local language, Mr. Tsunoda took the microphone and chirped, "We are all slower than Yuki" in Japanese, drawing a laugh from the hundreds of fans hoisting their cellphones for photos.
It was in keeping with an impish persona, and, atypically for a top-level Japanese athlete, a foul mouth and devil-may-care attitude that has inspired a cult following and an international appeal that outstrip his accomplishments so far in F1.
When he made his debut in 2021, he was the youngest driver on the F1 grid and, as it happens, the shortest (he still is, at a reported 5 feet 3 inches). With his baby face, Mr. Tsunoda, 23, quickly gained an incongruous reputation for cursing volubly on the radio that drivers use to give feedback to engineers and mechanics -- audio traffic that is also broadcast to fans during races.
Clips of him shouting "Shut up!" and other less printable outbursts went viral on social media, and his colorful reference to a "traffic paradise" that angered him on the track became a meme among fans.
In the wildly popular Netflix series "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," Mr. Tsunoda was shown farting, being lackadaisical about strength training and announcing "I want to go first poo" before a massage.
In his first year, some fans questioned whether he had earned the right to act that way. "People would think, 'Why is he shouting a lot in the radio even if he is not performing really well?"' Mr. Tsunoda said during an interview over Zoom a few weeks before the Japanese Grand Prix.
But just as Hideo Nomo, one of the earliest Japanese players in Major League Baseball, upended stereotypes about Asian masculinity, Mr. Tsunoda may help topple other racial clichés.
While Asians are often characterized as disciplined and obedient, Mr. Tsunoda's behavior shows that they "are allowed to have this full range of emotions and dispositions, even if what you're saying has to be bleeped out," said Christina Chin, associate professor of sociology at California State University, Fullerton.
Mr. Tsunoda's global exposure has coincided with a resurgence of Formula 1 racing in Japan, which last boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the European-dominated sport, Mr. Tsunoda is the first Japanese driver to race in the elite circuit since Kamui Kobayashi left in 2014.
Last weekend, 220,000 fans attended the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka over three days of practice, qualifying and racing, the highest number since 2006. Fans in T-shirts bearing the logos of teams like Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari jockeyed with "Yuki Go Go" banners in the stands.
Even Mr. Tsunoda's former English tutor, Junko Tasaki, 51, showed up wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a maple leaf design from Mr. Tsunoda's AlphaTauri team helmet and carrying a large cardboard cutout of the driver's face.
"I had no interest in F1 before I met him," Ms. Tasaki said. For the record, she added, "I didn't teach him to say 'shut up' or the F-word."
Just before climbing into his car on race day, Mr. Tsunoda consulted with several engineers and paused for a last-minute selfie with Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire fashion retail entrepreneur. The day turned somber for Mr. Tsunoda when he finished 12th, outside the sacred top 10 where team points are scored. His best finish in any of the 16 races this season so far was 10th place.
One spot in front of him on Sunday was Liam Lawson, the younger backup driver rumored to be in contention to replace Mr. Tsunoda next year. But going into the race weekend, AlphaTauri and Honda, the Japanese carmaker that supplies engines and financial backing for the team, announced that Mr. Tsunoda would continue to drive for them next year.
Speaking to Japanese reporters after the race, Mr. Tsunoda rubbed his fist in his right eye socket and lamented not placing higher in front of local supporters.
Mr. Tsunoda's rise to Formula 1 started in the pits of go-kart racing near his home in Sagamihara, a suburb outside Tokyo, when he was 4. At age 5, he won the Japanese series championship for his age group.
"I didn't think of it as raising him to be a driver, as much as having fun together," Nobuaki Tsunoda, 60, Mr. Tsunoda's father, said during an interview in a garage office crammed with custom-built bicycles, a vintage Honda S2000 sports car and a row of his son's helmets. "I always said if you want to stop, you can stop."
Moving up to single-seater racing was more than his family could afford. His father, who had business connections with Honda, suggested he try out for the carmaker's racing school, which accepted him.
By 2018 -- the year Honda started building engines for Red Bull, the parent team of AlphaTauri -- Mr. Tsunoda had won the championship of a lower circuit, Formula 4.
Honda's backing has been crucial for Mr. Tsunoda. "F1 takes a lot of money," said Masahiro Owari, a Japanese sportswriter. "I think a lot of the reason he is on the team is because of Honda's support."
When Mr. Tsunoda was promoted to F1, he first moved to Milton Keynes, England, racing for AlphaTauri. Before his second F1 race in 2021, he crashed during a qualifying session, and his driving deteriorated over subsequent races. Since then, the team hired him a psychologist, he toned down the swearing and his driving improved.
He said he didn't consider therapy a punishment. "I take it like they wanted to support me as much as possible to be a better driver," he said.
AlphaTauri did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Beyond racing, Mr. Tsunoda said he wants to open a restaurant after winning a world championship. He didn't enjoy the food in Milton Keynes, he said, but since traveling more and moving to Italy, where AlphaTauri is based, he has eaten more palate-pleasing meals. He envisions a fusion menu with items like Wagyu beef tacos.
The first time his parents visited him at his home in Faenza, his mother, Minako Tsunoda, hoped to eat a meal in an Italian restaurant. Instead, she said, Mr. Tsunoda asked her to fix him ozoni, soup with sticky rice cakes, and sekihan, rice with red beans.
"I was not really a foodie guy" in Japan, he said. "Probably because I didn't recognize how good Japanese food is compared to other cuisine."

SUZUKA, Japan — The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula One race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.

Full text: The dizzyingly diverse program ranges from the quiet "Here" to Michael Mann's psychological portrait of a carmaker, "Ferrari."
Bradley Cooper may still be on strike (solidarity!), but there's no stopping the New York Film Festival. Over 61 transporting, galvanic and at times weird and fractious years, this institutional stalwart has weathered financial woes, regime change and unfortunate opening-night selections, so there was never any question that it was going to survive M.I.A. stars like Cooper and Natalie Portman. As the festival's longevity and reputational standing prove, there is far more to movies than crowded red carpets and photo ops.
The festival opens Friday with Todd Haynes's "May December," a standout at Cannes that explores what happens when an actress (Portman) meets the woman (Julianne Moore) she's about to play in a biopic. The New York Film Festival invariably skims the cream from earlier events, but what matters here is less the premieres than the programming. There are larger, more prominent and certainly more glamorous festivals, but New York remains a standard-bearer for the art. It's a necessary rejoinder to the grotesqueries of the word "content."
One of the great satisfactions is its sweeping, dizzying diversity. There are shorts and features, personal films and historical epics, austere dramas and wide-ranging documentaries as well as work like Paul B. Preciado's "Orlando, My Political Biography," which resist facile categorization. Narrated by Preciado, this sui generis work uses Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel, "Orlando: A Biography," as a launchpad for a messy, often funny, intellectually provocative and finally deeply moving inquiry into trans identity. It's one of the essential titles in the festival, and one that I'm eager to revisit when it opens in November.
I'm also looking forward to rewatching "Menus-Plaisirs -- les Troisgros," the latest from Frederick Wiseman, a mesmerizing four-hour portrait of a family, a business, a world. It centers on the Troisgros, a dynasty of chefs best known for the titular three-star Michelin restaurant in central France. Intimate and expansive, the movie takes you from kitchen to farm fields and back as it charts the triumphs and quotidian frustrations along with the aesthetic and ethical sensibilities of people whose love for their calling is inscribed in every tweezered morsel. It's a dedication that recalls that of the genius behind the camera, who was born in 1930, the same year the Troisgros family opened its first restaurant.
Other festival must-sees include "Here," Bas Devos's delicate, gracefully paced tale of two strangers -- a construction worker and a botanist who studies moss -- as they first drift into each other's orbit on a moody day in Brussels. Not much happens except that everything does: life, labor, perhaps love. With an eye for beauty and little chatter, Devos makes his characters come expressively into view as he follows each separately and then together during their chance encounter in some verdant woods. Every moment signifies in this lovely, unexpected movie, starting with the opening image of a tall building framed by lush greenery.
"Pictures of Ghosts," the latest from the Brazilian writer-director Kleber Mendonça Filho ("Bacurau"), is a deeply personal, intricately constructed meditation on, well, everything, though mostly movies or rather his life in and with movies. Divided into three fluid chapters and set at the intersection of documentary and fiction, it wistfully yet playfully focuses on the apartment, the city (Recife) and the movie theaters that Mendonça Filho inhabited and that, in turn, sustained and inspired him. There's an elegiac cast to "Pictures of Ghosts" -- most of the once-bustling cinemas are now derelict as are his old stamping grounds -- yet the vigor of the filmmaking is a testament to how our beloveds never truly leave us.
For her estimable feature debut, "All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt," the director Raven Jackson has pared her story of a girl and the woman she becomes down to the very bone. Beautifully shot and staged, the movie elliptically traces the coming-of-age of a young Mississippian whose life comes into focus piecemeal across the years. Jackson can test your patience, particularly with her fondness for holding on images long past their ripening. But this is a movie very much worth seeing, as is "Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World," an exasperating tour de force from Radu Jude that opens with a young woman awakening and morphs into a hilarious, at times furious, exploration of Romania's past and present. You never know where it's going or why, and while it, too, tests your patience (if more teasingly), it also rewards it.
Among this year's more unsurprising attractions is "Maestro," an intimate, energetic, largely politics-free and scrupulously well-behaved look at the different lives -- both on and off the podium -- of Leonard Bernstein (1919-90). The movie, which stars and is directed by Bradley Cooper, will first screen in David Geffen Hall, home to the New York Philharmonic. In 1943, the 25-year-old Bernstein made headlines with his sensational conducting debut for the Philharmonic, which he later went on to lead while teaching generations of Americans that it was A-OK to love both Mahler and Broadway musicals.
One of the more interesting things about "Maestro" is how it recasts the familiar Great Man narrative by lavishing attention on Bernstein's marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan, who has top billing) while he continued to sleep with men. Bernstein remains the main attraction, no doubt. Yet because the movie consistently circles back to Felicia as Lenny catapults into American public life -- from Carnegie Hall to "West Side Story," baby! -- her character is more richly imagined than the classic movie wife. It's an admirable feminist intervention, yet partly because of the pantomime quality of Cooper's performance (prosthetic nose and all), Felicia's pain registers more deeply than Lenny's genius.
Michael Mann has also updated the Great Man template for "Ferrari," an intensely focused look at the many lives of the famed Italian car maestro, who's played by the grayed, tightly wound, perfectly named Adam Driver. Set largely in 1957, when Ferrari was close to bankruptcy, the movie is a psychological portrait of another visionary, both on and off the racetrack, of whom one biographer said: "In Italy, there was the pope and then there was Enzo." Here, the great man's inner life largely emerges through his fraught relationships with his wife, Laura (Penélope Cruz), and his lover, Lina (Shailene Woodley), women whose dual, dueling hold on Enzo is as steeped in love and death as his mania for fast and faster racecars.
One of the festival's bigger headscratchers is that the latest from Martin Scorsese -- a producer on "Maestro" -- isn't at the event. That would be "Killers of the Flower Moon," which had its premiere in May at Cannes and will open theatrically Oct. 20. "We loved the film and invited it immediately after seeing it in Cannes," Dennis Lim, the artistic director of the New York Film Festival, told me. Days before the festival announced its main slate in August, however, Apple, which is releasing the movie, said that it would not be participating. As Lim noted, "Flower Moon" wasn't in any of the other major fall festivals, which help usher films into the new season and onto the long road to the Oscars. (Apple could not be reached for comment.) Whatever the reason, its absence is a shame, especially because this is the event that 50 years ago presented a little film titled "Mean Streets."
The role that festivals have in the cinematic biosphere extends far beyond the Academy Awards, of course (hallelujah!), and has only grown more vital since the New York event was established. In 1962, when Lincoln Center announced that it would start presenting films alongside the performing arts -- after almost seven years of wrangling and despite objections from its board of directors -- it was big news. Among those advocating their inclusion was the director Elia Kazan. The art was held hostage by "merchants," he lamented to William Schuman, Lincoln Center's president then. "It is a big, big business which must, by its nature, please everyone and offend no one," Kazan continued. "Out of such a basic stance no art can come."
Kazan's insistence on film as an art may sound quaint, but I find it moving. That's especially true given the deadening stranglehold of the entertainment conglomerates, which don't just try to please everyone but pander to fans by giving them exactly what they expect. I've seen most of the movies in this year's lineup, and while I like a lot, I don't love everything. I am, for instance, still waiting for Bertrand Bonello -- who's back at the festival with the muddled romance "The Beast" -- to make a movie that doesn't inspire tears of boredom and laughter. But at least his newest has ideas (however risible) and a pulse (however somnolent). It isn't for me, but by all means see if it's for you. Consensus can be dreary, and fan service isn't art.

Visitors often come to Portland, Maine, for the first time because they want to spend a summer weekend in a quaint city by the water, or because they've heard about the city's superlative seafood (80 percent of the United States' lobster comes from Maine). Seduced by the easy access to nature and relative affordability, many return for longer stays or even for good. Between 2020 and 2022, Maine's population had the highest percentage increase of any New England state.
But Maine's desirability is nothing new. Artists, artisans and writers have long gravitated to the state; they established an art colony with two schools of painting in Ogunquit, on Maine's southern coast, in the first half of the 20th century, and the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts on Deer Isle, which was founded in 1950, continues to draw instructors and students from around the world. More recently, the state's creative spirit has resulted in a dynamic food scene. Turn down any one of Portland's cobblestone streets and you'll find more quality restaurants and bakeries (of both the old- and new-guard varieties) than you might expect in a place with just 68,000 year-round residents. The same is true just northeast of the city, in the mid-coast region, especially in the town of Rockland -- an easy and scenic 90-minute drive away -- which has a burgeoning food and art scene on track to rival Portland's.
Kazeem Lawal, the owner of the clothing and accessories store Portland Trading Co., moved from New Jersey to Portland 14 years ago, and has witnessed its stratospheric growth from a small port town to a destination city. "It's a bit like the Brooklyn of 20 years ago, with old and new coexisting," he says. "and it's continuing to grow and evolve, as all cities should and do."
Here, Lawal and three other Mainers share their favorite spots in and around the state's largest city.
The Insiders
Alex Day, a co-owner of Death & Co. cocktail bars (with locations in New York City, Los Angeles, Denver and Washington, D.C.), moved to Portland in 2019.
Lily King, the novelist, has lived in Portland since 2002.
Kazeem Lawal, the creative director of the clothing and accessories store Portland Trading Co., moved to Maine in 2009.
Toshiko Mori, the architect and principal at Toshiko Mori Architect, divides her time between New York City and a home on an island in Maine's Penobscot Bay.
Sleep
"Before my husband and I moved to Maine, we tested out all the lodging options in Portland. I like the AirBnBs in Munjoy Hill, but if going the hotel route, The Francis is my favorite spot -- comfortable, centrally located, tastefully curated, and the home of one of Portland's coziest restaurants, Wayside Tavern." (Rooms from $ 129 a night) -- Alex Day
"Best Bower is a contemporary guesthouse at the top of Munjoy Hill with six warm, lovely rooms and rotating works of art by artists-in-residence. Blind Tiger in the West End, whose billiards room was once a prohibition speakeasy, offers more luxury; and out on Chebeague Island there's the magical Chebeague Island Inn, where drinks and dinner are served on its wraparound porch." (Rooms at Best Bower from $ 165 a night, two-night minimum; Blind Tiger, from $ 259 a night; Chebeague Island Inn, from $ 219 a night) -- Lily King
"I prefer new hotels, and the Canopy Portland Waterfront is two blocks from downtown. Spring for a room with a view of the water, and plan on a drink at the rooftop bar." (Rooms from $ 199 a night) -- Kazeem Lawal
"In Rockland, 250 Main is extremely pet-friendly. The hotel provides dog treats from Loyal Biscuit Co., a great pet supply store that's just down the street. Rooms are simple and comfortable, with harbor views and excellent coffee from its neighbor Rock City Coffee Roasters." (Rooms from $ 169 a night) -- Toshiko Mori
Eat and Drink
"Smalls, a tiny neighborhood cafe-bar and supply store in the West End, cranks out some of the best coffee and small plates around. On lazy Sundays, I cruise by for a cappuccino, then walk up to Zu Bakery for a textbook croissant. And J's Oyster is the perfect combination of old-school charm, a fun team and delicious seafood that couldn't be fresher." -- A.D.
"It's hard to eat a bad meal in Portland. Dok Mali is my current favorite restaurant. Opened less than a year ago by the chef and owner Nonglack Thanephonesy, [this Thai restaurant] is new enough that you can still get a table in high season. I'm utterly addicted to her drunken noodles." -- L.K.
"If you want the Ferrari of lobster rolls, go to Eventide. The buns are steamed, the lobster meat is doused with brown butter, reservations are extremely limited and when they tell you how long the wait for a table is, you'll probably pass out. Go early, put your name in and then spend the hourslong wait exploring. If lobster's not your thing, the fish and chicken sandwiches here are also poppin'." -- K.L.
"Leeward, a restaurant with Italian-style seasonal food, focuses on pasta, but the menu also highlights local seafood, such as Maine bluefin tuna crudo with pickled rhubarb, or a cucumber salad with smoked eel, sumac and fried capers that's fresh and earthy." -- T.M.
Explore
"A short walk from our house, the Fore River Sanctuary, a series of hiking trails meandering through forests and marshland, is a lovely retreat from the hustle of town. I like starting from Jewell Falls and wandering toward the Fore River. The deep banks as you near the end are the remnants of an 1800s canal that connected Portland to Sebago Lake." -- A.D.
"Board a ferry on Commercial Street and visit any of the Casco Bay islands. Or, if you want to see them all, book a ticket on the mail boat. It runs three times a day (at 10 a.m., 12 p.m. and 3 p.m.) and the ride takes two and a half to three hours. Absorb it all: the teams working on the boat, the fisherman navigating their boats in Portland's harbor, the beauty of Maine's rocky coast." -- K.L.
"The Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland has an in-depth collection of works by [19th- and 20th-century] Maine artists, including Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth and Louise Nevelson, as well as the work of young contemporary artists. Across the street (behind Atlantic Baking Company, which makes an excellent apricot-pistachio cookie) is the Center for Maine Contemporary Art, housed in a building I designed. It has temporary shows of work by artists living or connected to Maine, including Reggie Burrows Hodges and Lois Dodd." -- T.M.
Shop
"I can lose an hour at the knife and kitchenwares store Strata flipping through books, admiring delicate Japanese glassware far too thin for my clumsiness or -- as one should do here -- talking with the fantastically knowledgeable and friendly staff about the shop's huge collection of culinary knives, largely crafted by Japanese smiths. I've yet to convince my husband that a knife-sharpening workshop is an acceptable date night." -- A.D.
"For antiques, drive 20 minutes north to Cabot Mill Antiques in Brunswick, which is a multidealer antiques mall in an old mill building. Or drive out to Arundel, to the Arundel Antique Village. At both places, you'll find things that are hard to come across in most big cities." -- K.L.
Take Home
"I consulted the shopping expert in my life, my daughter Eloise King-Clements. She says Blanche + Mimi has the best quilts ever, like the block-printed ones made from soft cotton."
-- L.K.
"In Rockland, Trillium Soaps is a family-owned small-batch producer of handmade soaps subtly imbued with the fragrance of nature found in Maine. My favorites are the pine, Maine seaweed, black rosemary and orange calendula soaps, and I can't live without Trillium's gardener's soap, which has poppy seeds and cornmeal as an exfoliant, calendula petals, geranium and cedar oil to keep your hands soft after gardening. The store also carries antique farm baskets, ceramics and linens." -- T.M.
Practical Matters
"One of the reasons I moved to Portland is the convenience of our little airport. It rarely has a T.S.A. line of more than a couple people. But in the busy summer months, when flights get atrociously expensive, I fly in and out of Boston's Logan airport. I'm generally pretty skeptical of taking a bus, but the Concord Coach arrives right outside baggage claim and heads directly to Portland [a two-hour trip], and on the way back, it drops you right in front of security. It's cheap, clean and has very friendly drivers and Wi-Fi." -- A.D.
"Bring a book. At some point, even on the most dazzling summer day, you're going to want to curl up on a hammock or porch swing or window seat and read. I don't know if that feeling is in the water or the air, but it will overtake you. If you get a foggy day or two, you might need several books. Be prepared." -- L.K.
"The best times to visit are June and September. June is verdant, with amazing flowers, including lupine and lilacs, and it's strawberry season. The air is clear and cool and you'll be here before the tourists hit in July and August. In September, there's the largest organic farming fair, the Common Ground Country Fair, and the Camden International Film Festival, the best documentary film festival -- and it's less crowded, and the weather is great for sailing." -- T.M.

'Built on Clams,' One Town Feels Invader's Pinch: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Goro, on the Adriatic Sea, is famous for its clams -- essential for the beloved spaghetti alle vongole. But an infestation of crabs is threatening the town's cash crop.
Before dawn in Goro, on the Adriatic Sea, Massimo Genari drove by the central roundabout, with its sculpture of two concrete clams in a net, and under a billboard of a mollusk donning a crimson royal crown. Wearing waders, he boarded his boat and motored to the lagoon with scores of other fishermen to rake the clam gardens that for decades have transformed this sleepy Italian village off the Po River Delta into a bivalve boomtown.
As the sun rose, Mr. Genari, a leader of the local fishing cooperative, poured his first haul of clams into the basin of a metal sorting machine. The shells clinked like coins falling from a slot machine. But instead of bushels of treasure, he looked with horror at the remains of a massacre, with the guilty parties -- marauding armies of invasive blue crabs -- caught blue-and-orange-handed as they scurried over the eviscerated bodies of their victims.
"Opened, opened, opened," Mr. Genari said, as he sifted through shells and avoided the murderous crabs snapping at his fingers. The killers had, he said, laid waste to the baby clams. "Another two months, and that's it. The clams will be gone."
Goro's fishermen, swamped by the insatiable blue crab, are trying to save not only their local cash crop -- the meaty verace clam they first imported from the Philippines in the 1980s -- but also a good portion of Italy's beloved spaghetti alle vongole that is made with them.
"We will lose our identity," said Arianna Zucconelli, 44, a local wholesale fish buyer, who said that Italy without clam sauce would be a much blander place, and that Goro without clams would be a much poorer one. "This town is built on clams," she said. "Eighty percent of the town won't have an income."
Experts aren't sure how or exactly when the alien crabs first arrived from North America. Some speculate that crab larvae arrived decades ago in cargo ships. Around Goro, years of droughts allowed seawater to seep further into the Po River's estuaries, making for more brackish pools preferred by the crabs.
Then floods this spring in the Emilia-Romagna region, where Goro is, washed them into the lagoon, where the warm summer water increased the blue crabs' metabolism and, free of natural predators, they found an all-you-can-eat buffet of local crabs, mussels, oysters and the prized clams.
"The table," said Eduardo Turolla, a local mollusk scientist, "was set."
And the battle joined. Around Mr. Genari's boat, an armada trawls for the blue crabs, pulling what he estimated to be about 10 tons of them daily from the lagoon, though they have also amassed across Italy's east and west coasts. He pointed out the spongelike pads teeming with eggs on the bellies of females and the way the males held the claws of dismembered crabs in their clutches. He told stories of children rushed from the neighboring beaches to the emergency room with clawed fingers and toes.
"Either they survive," he said. "Or we survive."
The Italian government has mobilized a full-scale "if you can't beat 'em, eat 'em" campaign. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni served up a platter of cooked blue crabs, as shown in a picture taken by her brother-in-law, Francesco Lollobrigida, the country's agriculture minister, who recently visited Goro and promised aid. The minister -- perhaps best known for warning about "ethnic replacement" of the Italian people, and not its marine life -- also posted a video of himself holding a live crab next to a pot and admiring its "optimal" meat.
Supermarkets around the country are promoting them. ("Blue Crab: A Recipe to Save the Seas!") Seafood companies are trying to export them.
"In particular, to the U.S. market," said Carlotta Santolini, a founder of Mariscadoras, which has exported containers of blue crabs to a distributor in Miami. She said Mr. Lollobrigida called her to strategize and invited her to promote Italy's blue crabs at a frozen seafood exposition next month in Spain. But she acknowledged the toughest market may be the domestic one.
"A signora that goes to the restaurant," Luca Pavani, 56, said after a morning of hunting crabs, "she can't just start eating with her hands."
Mr. Genari noted that they were no picnic to prepare either.
"The first time I brought them home to my companion to cook, she was interested and happy to do it," he said. "The second time, she threw it at my head."
In the Chesapeake Bay, Marylanders hammer and rip and douse crabs in Old Bay seasoned salt. But Italians, resistant to culinary novelty and mindful of table manners, are trying to incorporate them into the usual frying pan.
At the Locanda Ferrari restaurant, where diners slurped up plates of spaghetti alle vongole and compared notes on their favorite places for eel, Paola Ferrari, 61, scissored the crabs and dumped them in a pan of tomatoes, onions and herbs.
"They don't really" order it, she said.
At a restaurant across from the fish market, the crabs were not even on offer, though a drawing above the display case depicted crabs being devoured by an octopus and a sharp-beaked curlew.
"Nature will always find a solution," it read.
"I see no solution," said Mr. Turolla, the expert.
In the surrounding streets, residents spoke fondly of the easy money of the clam days. "It was like going to the A.T.M.," Alessandro Milani, 58, said as he built a crab trap. At the Bar dell'Angolo, fishermen drank bottomless Aperols, cursed the crabs and told horror stories about crab attacks on colleagues wading in the shallow water.
"One of them stabbed right through her boots," recounted Giorgio Bugnoli, 50.
"Who?" his friends asked aghast.
"Luisa!" he said.
Hundreds of blue tubs filled with blue crabs arrived for sorting at Mr. Genari's cooperative, for either sale or disposal. An enormous aluminum pan used to cook 1,300 pounds of clams for spaghetti alle vongole during the annual clam festival rested on heaps of black plastic nets. The fishermen hope these nets will protect future crops of clams, though they say the crabs have climbed over, dug under and cut through barriers in the past.
The rejected crabs ended up back at the port, which resounded with the sound of constant typing, as thousands of crabs clicked over one another. A forklift rolled over amputated claws and dumped crate after crate of fly-swarmed crabs into a green container labeled: "Material Category 3. Not Destined for Human Consumption." A truck loaded the writhing freight for delivery to an incinerator up north. More boats, and more blue tubs, came in.
"In the two months we have been fighting the crabs," Mr. Genari said, "it is like we have done nothing."
At 3:30 p.m. in the nearby fish market, a siren announced the beginning of the fish auction. Workers loaded dozens of blue tubs on a white conveyor belt that appeared in front of buyers eating cherry ices on bleachers.
The first crabs were small and had no takers.
"No one wants crabs," one of the buyers said.
The auctioneer, Fabio Bugnoli, 46, wore a thick blue rubber glove and picked up chains of clinging crabs to demonstrate their size and vim. ("They got me twice," he said, showing off the marks on his thumb.) One buyer who supplied Chinese neighborhoods bought hundreds. Others who supplied restaurants enticed by the prospect of extreme profit margins bought bigger crabs. The prices were so low, the fishermen said, that they barely covered the cost of gasoline or the crab incinerations.
But Ms. Zucconelli, the buyer, suggested Italians might yet develop a taste for crab. She said her mother had found a way to cook them in a red sauce.
"They're good and sweet. They're great fried," she said. "Then again, a slipper is good fried."

GORO, Italy — Before dawn in Goro, on the Adriatic Sea, Massimo Genari drove by the central roundabout, with its sculpture of two concrete clams in a net, and under a billboard of a mollusk donning a crimson royal crown. Wearing waders, he boarded his boat and motored to the lagoon with scores of other fishermen to rake the clam gardens that for decades have transformed this sleepy Italian village off the Po River Delta into a bivalve boomtown.
As the sun rose, Genari, a leader of the local fishing cooperative, poured his first haul of clams into the basin of a metal sorting machine. The shells clinked like coins falling from a slot machine. But instead of bushels of treasure, he looked with horror at the remains of a massacre, with the guilty parties — marauding armies of invasive blue crabs — caught blue-and-orange-handed as they scurried over the eviscerated bodies of their victims.
“Opened, opened, opened,” Genari said, as he sifted through shells and avoided the murderous crabs snapping at his fingers. The killers had, he said, laid waste to the baby clams. “Another two months, and that’s it. The clams will be gone.”
Goro’s fishermen, swamped by the insatiable blue crab, are trying to save not only their local cash crop — the meaty verace clam they first imported from the Philippines in the 1980s — but also a good portion of Italy’s beloved spaghetti alle vongole that is made with them.
“We will lose our identity,” said Arianna Zucconelli, 44, a local wholesale fish buyer, who said that Italy without clam sauce would be a much blander place, and that Goro without clams would be a much poorer one. “This town is built on clams,” she said. “Eighty percent of the town won’t have an income.”
Experts aren’t sure how or exactly when the alien crabs first arrived from North America. Some speculate that crab larvae arrived decades ago in cargo ships. Around Goro, years of droughts allowed seawater to seep further into the Po River’s estuaries, making for more brackish pools preferred by the crabs.
Then floods this spring in the Emilia-Romagna region, where Goro is, washed them into the lagoon, where the warm summer water increased the blue crabs’ metabolism and, free of natural predators, they found an all-you-can-eat buffet of local crabs, mussels, oysters and the prized clams.
“The table,” said Eduardo Turolla, a local mollusk scientist, “was set.”
And the battle joined. Around Genari’s boat, an armada trawls for the blue crabs, pulling what he estimated to be about 10 tons of them daily from the lagoon, though they have also amassed across Italy’s east and west coasts. He pointed out the spongelike pads teeming with eggs on the bellies of females and the way the males held the claws of dismembered crabs in their clutches. He told stories of children rushed from the neighboring beaches to the emergency room with clawed fingers and toes.
“Either they survive,” he said. “Or we survive.”
The Italian government has mobilized a full-scale “if you can’t beat ’em, eat ’em” campaign. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni served up a platter of cooked blue crabs, as shown in a picture taken by her brother-in-law, Francesco Lollobrigida, the country’s agriculture minister, who recently visited Goro and promised aid. The minister — perhaps best known for warning about “ethnic replacement” of the Italian people, and not its marine life — also posted a video of himself holding a live crab next to a pot and admiring its “optimal” meat.
Supermarkets around the country are promoting them. (“Blue Crab: A Recipe to Save the Seas!”) Seafood companies are trying to export them.
“In particular, to the U.S. market,” said Carlotta Santolini, a founder of Mariscadoras, which has exported containers of blue crabs to a distributor in Miami. She said Lollobrigida called her to strategize and invited her to promote Italy’s blue crabs at a frozen seafood exposition next month in Spain. But she acknowledged the toughest market may be the domestic one.
“A signora that goes to the restaurant,” Luca Pavani, 56, said after a morning of hunting crabs, “she can’t just start eating with her hands.”
Genari noted that they were no picnic to prepare either.
“The first time I brought them home to my companion to cook, she was interested and happy to do it,” he said. “The second time, she threw it at my head.”
In the Chesapeake Bay, Marylanders hammer and rip and douse crabs in Old Bay seasoned salt. But Italians, resistant to culinary novelty and mindful of table manners, are trying to incorporate them into the usual frying pan.
At the Locanda Ferrari restaurant, where diners slurped up plates of spaghetti alle vongole and compared notes on their favorite places for eel, Paola Ferrari, 61, scissored the crabs and dumped them in a pan of tomatoes, onions and herbs.
“They don’t really” order it, she said.
At a restaurant across from the fish market, the crabs were not even on offer, though a drawing above the display case depicted crabs being devoured by an octopus and a sharp-beaked curlew.
“Nature will always find a solution,” it read.
“I see no solution,” said Turolla, the expert.
In the surrounding streets, residents spoke fondly of the easy money of the clam days. “It was like going to the ATM,” Alessandro Milani, 58, said as he built a crab trap. At the Bar dell’Angolo, fishermen drank bottomless Aperols, cursed the crabs and told horror stories about crab attacks on colleagues wading in the shallow water.
“One of them stabbed right through her boots,” recounted Giorgio Bugnoli, 50.
“Who?” his friends asked aghast.
“Luisa!” he said.
Hundreds of blue tubs filled with blue crabs arrived for sorting at Genari’s cooperative, for either sale or disposal. An enormous aluminum pan used to cook 1,300 pounds of clams for spaghetti alle vongole during the annual clam festival rested on heaps of black plastic nets. The fishermen hope these nets will protect future crops of clams, though they say the crabs have climbed over, dug under and cut through barriers in the past.
The rejected crabs ended up back at the port, which resounded with the sound of constant typing, as thousands of crabs clicked over one another. A forklift rolled over amputated claws and dumped crate after crate of fly-swarmed crabs into a green container labeled: “Material Category 3. Not Destined for Human Consumption.” A truck loaded the writhing freight for delivery to an incinerator up north. More boats, and more blue tubs, came in.
“In the two months we have been fighting the crabs,” Genari said, “it is like we have done nothing.”
At 3:30 p.m. in the nearby fish market, a siren announced the beginning of the fish auction. Workers loaded dozens of blue tubs on a white conveyor belt that appeared in front of buyers eating cherry ices on bleachers.
The first crabs were small and had no takers.
“No one wants crabs,” one of the buyers said.
The auctioneer, Fabio Bugnoli, 46, wore a thick blue rubber glove and picked up chains of clinging crabs to demonstrate their size and vim. (“They got me twice,” he said, showing off the marks on his thumb.) One buyer who supplied Chinese neighborhoods bought hundreds. Others who supplied restaurants enticed by the prospect of extreme profit margins bought bigger crabs. The prices were so low, the fishermen said, that they barely covered the cost of gasoline or the crab incinerations.
But Zucconelli, the buyer, suggested Italians might yet develop a taste for crab. She said her mother had found a way to cook them in a red sauce.
“They’re good and sweet. They’re great fried,” she said. “Then again, a slipper is good fried.”

Investigators Examine Bus Crash That Killed 2: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The bus, which was transporting a high school marching band from Long Island to a camp in Pennsylvania, overturned on a New York highway Thursday afternoon.
Investigators continued on Friday to comb through the wreckage of a bus that went off a New York highway and overturned while carrying a Long Island high school marching band to Pennsylvania the day before, killing two people and injuring dozens of others.
Although Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Thursday that a faulty front tire appeared to have caused the bus to veer off the road, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, the New York State Police and the Orange County, N.Y., Sheriff's Office were seeking to determine whether other factors may have been involved, officials said. In a news conference on Friday afternoon, John Humm, an investigator with the N.T.S.B., said it was too early to determine what had caused the incident, but said several people had been ejected from the bus. Mr. Humm said he expected his team to be on site for five to seven days.
One of the two people killed in the crash, Gina Pellettiere, suffered injuries to her head and torso when the bus tumbled down a 50-foot ravine on a stretch of Interstate 84 in the town of Wawayanda, officials said. The second person killed in the crash, Beatrice Ferrari, died while being taken to a hospital, officials said.
Ms. Pellettiere, 43, and Ms. Ferrari, 77, were among four adults and 40 students from Farmingdale High School who were on one of six coach buses taking the marching band on its annual trip to a camp in Pennsylvania. Ms. Pellettiere was the band's beloved director; Ms. Ferrari was a volunteer chaperone.
At least five people, including several students, were critically injured. One, a freshman, was released to his parents on Friday morning after getting stitches and staples in his head and body, said Ralph Ekstrand, Farmingdale's mayor.
Another freshman, a girl whose spine was fractured, was taken from Westchester Medical Center to Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park on Long Island, Mr. Ekstrand said. Nearly 20 other people, most of them students, were still being treated at other hospitals, officials said.
Mr. Humm said that his team planned to interview all of the victims, including the bus driver.
Naomi Luke, 14, a freshman at Farmingdale High School, was on FaceTime with her best friend, who was with her bandmates on the bus that crashed, when she heard the screech of tires.
The image on Naomi's phone spun, her mother, Carolina, said in an interview. When her friend's face reappeared on the screen, it was covered with blood. The girl had a broken nose and cuts on her tongue and lips, Ms. Luke said.
Santino Talavera, 17, a senior at Farmingdale High School who plays the trumpet, was riding on the bus behind the one that crashed when it jolted to a stop. Almost immediately, students began standing up and craning their necks to look out the windows.
"I stood up and I saw the bus lying literally in the ditch, on its side," he said. "I felt like it was a dream."
As people on his bus absorbed what had happened, they got very quiet. "We were just at a loss for words," he said.
Santino said the bus sat parked on the side of the highway for about two hours as emergency workers responded to the scene. He watched as people on stretchers were wheeled past his window.
Classes were in session at the high school on Friday, but a football game scheduled for the evening was canceled, as were other after-school competitions that had been planned for the weekend.
Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said at a news briefing that counselors would be available through at least next week.
Rose Walker, a Nassau County legislator whose district includes Farmingdale, said at the briefing that the crash was "personal" for her.
"I know many of these children, the staff," Ms. Walker said. "I always tell them when we're at anything together that although they don't live in my house, they're all my kids."
Ms. Walker said that she had known Ms. Pellettiere, the band director, since Ms. Pellettiere was in grade school. Ms. Pellettiere "had a love for music," Ms. Walker said, and was a drum major in high school.
"It was a dream to go further with her career, and she did. She became that band director over at Farmingdale High School," Ms. Walker said.
Ms. Luke, who was Ms. Pellettiere's classmate decades ago at Hicksville High School, said she played "every instrument" and was known for her sense of personal style.
She described spending Friday morning looking at Ms. Pellettiere's picture in the high school yearbook. "She was the light of the classroom," Ms. Luke said.

Full text: New films by Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher and Bradley Cooper lead a select list of the season's highlights.
What's the anatomy of a fall movie season? Although the writers' and actors' strikes have kept Hollywood in suspense, the calendar is, for now, still filled with exciting titles, including work from established masters (Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher) and relative breakouts like Justine Triet, the director of, well, "Anatomy of a Fall," which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

PRISCILLA Mention Elvis, and there's no need to specify a last name. Sofia Coppola, no stranger to chronicling the isolating effects of fame, elevates Mrs. Presley to a similarly iconic stature in this look at one of the most watched marriages in rock 'n' roll. Cailee Spaeny plays Priscilla; Jacob Elordi is the King. (Oct. 27 in theaters)
November

THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SHERE HITE Nicole Newnham (a director of "Crip Camp") made this documentary on the work of Shere Hite, who in 1976 published "The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality," which advanced the then-radical notion that women could achieve sexual satisfaction without intercourse. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
FALLEN LEAVES The latest from the Finnish treasure Aki Kaurismaki won the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival; the award scanned as an affectionate third place. It's a love story -- in an unusually bittersweet and low-key register -- between lonesome members of the working class (Alma Poysti and Jussi Vatanen), and between Kaurismaki and cinema. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES Set before the events of the Jennifer Lawrence films, this screen installment from Suzanne Collins's books casts Tom Blyth as a teenage tyrant in the making and Rachel Zegler as the tribute he tries to prepare for the deadly games.

MAY DECEMBER Todd Haynes investigates what constitutes realistic acting -- and what attracts viewers to tabloid sensationalism -- in this drama, which casts Natalie Portman as a TV star shadowing her latest role's infamous real-life inspiration (Julianne Moore), a woman whose past is not dissimilar from Mary Kay Letourneau's. With Charles Melton. (Nov. 17 in theaters, Dec. 1 on Netflix)
NEXT GOAL WINS Smarting from a record-breaking loss, American Samoa's soccer team braces for another try at the World Cup qualifying matches, this time with a new, curmudgeonly coach (Michael Fassbender).

TROLLS BAND TOGETHER The Troll universe expands again as Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) seek out Branch's brothers, with whom he previously formed a boy band. That the siblings are not voiced by Timberlake's former 'N Sync mates seems like a missed opportunity. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
THE BOY AND THE HERON Ten years after "The Wind Rises," which had been billed as a final feature, the master animator Hayao Miyazaki gives us this story of a boy who moves from Tokyo after his mother's death during World War II. An enigmatic tower that stands near his new home becomes a gateway to a parallel world -- a quintessentially Miyazakian realm. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
MAESTRO In the director's chair again after "A Star Is Born" (2018), Bradley Cooper also stars as the legendary conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein.

MENUS-PLAISIRS -- LES TROISGROS After more than 40 features, the 93-year-old Frederick Wiseman is still going strong.

(Nov. 22 in theaters)
NAPOLEON Stanley Kubrick's Bonaparte biography will, alas, always be one of cinema's great what-ifs. But we are getting Ridley Scott's version of the life of the French military leader, with Joaquin Phoenix donning the bicorn. Vanessa Kirby also stars. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
WISH Will Ariana DeBose belt out a hit as big as "Let It Go"? Disney's latest animated offering, advertising its affinities with "Frozen," among other movies, casts the "West Side Story" Oscar winner as a heroine who takes on a king with the help of a cosmic force and a goat. Alan Tudyk and Chris Pine lend their voices as well. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
SALTBURN The writer-director Emerald Fennell's first feature behind the camera since "Promising Young Woman" is set at Oxford, where a student played by Barry Keoghan becomes taken with the lifestyle of a classmate (Jacob Elordi). (Nov. 24 in theaters)
December

Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef co-star. (Dec. 8 in theaters)
THE ZONE OF INTEREST Loosely based on Martin Amis's 2014 Holocaust novel, the director Jonathan Glazer's first feature since "Under the Skin" a decade ago is an intensely formal exercise that tries to immerse viewers in the perspective of Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), the commandant of Auschwitz, as he carried on with his life next to the camp. With Sandra Hüller as Höss's wife. (Dec. 8 in theaters)
ANYONE BUT YOU Advance word suggests that this film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, is unusually racy by the standards of comedies faintly inspired by "Much Ado About Nothing." Will Gluck directed. (Dec. 15 in theaters)
CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET A teaser trailer suggests that the "nugget" in question is a newborn chick -- although the title could also refer to the invention of chicken nuggets, which would make this sequel to "Chicken Run" (2000) more of a horror film than a family feature. Thandiwe Newton, Zachary Levi and Bella Ramsey provide some of the voices. (Dec. 15 on Netflix)
WONKA While "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" and Roald Dahl's book left many questions, how Wonka defeated a chocolate cartel to found his factory was not exactly foremost among them. Will the movie at least explain how Timothée Chalamet, who plays Wonka in this prequel, could grow into Gene Wilder? (Dec. 15 in theaters)
AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM Jason Momoa has to form an alliance to save Atlantis. As long as there aren't flesh-eating bacteria in the water, how bad could it be? Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman return. James Wan directed. (Dec. 20 in theaters)
ALL OF US STRANGERS A run-in with a neighbor (Paul Mescal) somehow causes a rupture in the life of a screenwriter (Andrew Scott), who encounters the home where he grew up. Claire Foy and Jamie Bell also star in the latest film from the "45 Years" director Andrew Haigh. (Dec. 22 in theaters)
THE IRON CLAW Sean Durkin ("The Nest") directed this dramatization of the real-life Von Erich brothers, who beginning in the 1970s made a name for themselves wrestling and who almost all died young. Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White star. (Dec. 22 in theaters)
MIGRATION A family of ducks -- the Mallards -- do what a lot of American families do: fly south for a winter getaway. Not surprisingly, travel proves to be a hassle. Mike White, a long way from "The White Lotus," wrote the screenplay for this animated feature, which has the voices of Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, among others. (Dec. 22 in theaters)
REBEL MOON -- PART ONE: A CHILD OF FIRE Sofia Boutella bands together misfit warriors to save the galaxy. Untethered from DC Comics characters and the zombies of his "Dawn of the Dead" and "Army of the Dead," this could be the most unfiltered dose of Zack Snyder since "Sucker Punch" (2011). This is the first of two installments, with the next one due in April. (Dec. 22 on Netflix)
THE COLOR PURPLE The Broadway musical version of Alice Walker's novel, which itself was already adapted into a movie by Steven Spielberg in 1985, hits the big screen. The singer Fantasia, a.k.a. Fantasia Barrino, plays Celie, the role Whoopi Goldberg embodied in the original film. With Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo and Halle Bailey. Blitz Bazawule directed. (Dec. 25 in theaters)
FERRARI Michael Mann and the sleek Italian auto brand go way back. (See also "Miami Vice" in its TV and movie versions.) Adam Driver plays the sports car maker Enzo Ferrari in 1957, at a time of personal turmoil, when he bets big on the Mille Miglia race across Italy. Penélope Cruz and Shailene Woodley also star. (Dec. 25 in theaters)
OCCUPIED CITY Working from a book by his wife, the Dutch filmmaker Bianca Stigter, the director Steve McQueen combines documentary footage from present-day Amsterdam with narration that recounts events in the city throughout World War II. "With formal rigor and adamant focus, it maps -- street by street, address by address -- the catastrophe that befell Amsterdam's Jewish population," Manohla Dargis wrote when the film played at Cannes. (Dec. 25 in theaters)

No List Can Capture the Best of Emilia-Romagna: [Travel Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tell people you are going to Emilia-Romagna, the food-rich region in northern Italy, and unsolicited recommendations follow: places to linger over pistachio ravioli and mortadella sandwiches, lasagna berberè and "really good" gelato.
"Possibly the greatest food city in the world," one friend decreed about Bologna, the largest city in Emilia-Romagna, as well as its capital. "Beyond charming and crazy delicious," said another.
By the time I arrived in Bologna in late March, my brain was swimming: Would it be better to do aperitivo at the place beneath the portico or the one in the alleyway? Would it be sacrilege to get pizza? When would I have time for a mortadella sandwich? Would there be anything to do besides eat?
The truth about Emilia-Romagna is that you cannot help but eat well, whether it's at a Michelin-starred restaurant -- this is the home of the chef and restaurateur Massimo Bottura, whose temple of modernist cuisine, Osteria Francescana, put the region on the food-lover's map when it opened three decades ago -- or a humble bar on a cobblestone street.
"We don't have the Dolomites," said Mr. Bottura, while piloting one of his many Emilia-Romagna-made vehicles (a Maserati) down a country road. "We don't have the Amalfi Coast. But we have the countryside. We have a food valley."
Then there are the hikes to take, the artisans to visit, the cars to drive -- Ferrari and Lamborghini, as well as Maserati, all manufacture here -- and the wine to taste. As I prepared for my trip, the list of things to eat, see and do seemed endless.
First, tortellini
My first stop, shortly after landing in Bologna from Los Angeles, was dinner at Al Sangiovese, a warm, wood-paneled restaurant on Vicolo del Falcone. I was joined by my friend Amanda Montell, an author and podcast host who was spending a month in the city.
"I wanted to stay somewhere that felt quaint but open," she said. "I love the university vibe." The University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is among the oldest in the world; the blocks surrounding it thrum in a way that evoke the Greenwich Village streets around New York University.
Having recently deplaned, and having not seen a salad in days, I requested a side of verdure -- green vegetables -- with my tortellini en brodo (tortellini in broth). Ms. Montell communicated this to our server in Italian. The server's response came in English.
"With the main? No, no, no," she said, shaking her head with reproach. "The tortellini is the king of the pasta," a king who, apparently, eschews consorts. "No vegetables."
A bit of back and forth resulted in a plate of steamed spinach arriving with our "antipasti" of mortadella, prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano-Reggiano (three of the region's D.O.P. or Denominazione di Origine Protetta products, a certification that ensures they are locally grown or produced). The server was right. The verdure had no place at this table. I could eat steamed spinach anywhere. Why bother in the city of "la Dotta, la Grassa, la Rossa?"
"It means, 'the learned, the fat, the red,"' Ms. Montell explained. "They're the nicknames of Bologna," with the last referring both to the color of the medieval buildings and the city's past as a communist stronghold.
Walking the 'Path of the Gods'
The next morning, I was due to hike part of the "Path of Gods," an 84-mile trail that connects Bologna to Florence. After a nightcap at Velluto, a sleek cocktail bar that was a 10-minute walk from the restaurant, near Bologna's central piazza, I woke raring to go. "How long is the drive?" I asked Catia Aliberti, a local guide who met me at my hotel, eyeing her walking sticks with suspicion. How rugged would this path get?
"No drive," she said, genially.
Before making its way through the countryside to Florence, the Path of Gods winds for four miles along Bologna's streets, beneath the city's porticoes. Built from the early Middle Ages onward, the porticoes make up a series of shaded archways that is protected by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; strung together, they would cover more than 38 miles.
"The part we are doing, the Portico di San Luca, is the longest portico in the world," Ms. Aliberti said. At first, we walked alongside shops, restaurants and stalls. Those gave way to a series of steps and an upward sloping, portico-covered path. Religious frescoes appeared. "In the past, if you did something bad and you wanted the Virgin Mary to forgive you, you'd do this hike on your knees," Ms. Aliberti said. "Now it's a place to walk and run, but back then, it was a place to pray."
Two hours after we started, we reached the Santuario di San Luca, a palatial 18th-century church that offers panoramic views of Bologna and the verdant hills beyond. There was also, blissfully, a restaurant, Vito San Luca, whose tagliatelle al ragù might be the platonic ideal of a post-hike meal. (There was also another plate of mortadella and Parmigiano-Reggiano.) That plus two glasses of local Lambrusco -- a sparkling red wine, this region's answer to Champagne -- necessitated a nap upon my return to my hotel. I awoke with just enough time to meet Ms. Montell and her friend, Kaitlyn Mikayla, at Camera a Sud, a Via Valdonica bar rife with books and records that makes a chuggable Americano (not the coffee -- the cocktail of Campari, club soda and sweet vermouth).
Local products, local artisans
The light turned golden and then faded. I ventured off to Ahimè (Italian for "alas"), a minimalist restaurant and natural wine bar that opened in July 2020 on Via San Gervasio and which takes an aggressively local approach to cuisine. "There are people who go to the market, buy the cheapest Parmesan and veal, which probably comes from abroad, make ragù and tell you it's traditional," said Gian Marco Bucci, one of Ahimè's owners. "We support producers from here and offer something different."
A dish of local cabbages and "roasted yogurt" tasted like something you might find in a trendy restaurant in Los Angeles; around me, urbane diners chatted in English. Ms. Montell texted me. Did I want to join her and Ms. Mikayla for a "little concert in an adorable apartment? Very Bologna, intimate, least touristy thing in town."
I walked 20 minutes to Efesto House, which occupies the sixth floor of a centuries-old apartment building on Via Castiglione. Technically, Efesto House is a private member's club, but unlike a multinational private member's club that also has "house" in its name, dues do not cost more than the average monthly mortgage, and membership can be granted on the spot. The cost: 10 euros and your email address.
"We decided to keep our prices very low," said Gaia Musumeci, a neurologist who runs Efesto House with two friends. "We want people to feel like they're at home when they come here." (Matteo Paragona, Efesto's president, inherited the apartment, as well as the floors above it, from his great-grandmother. Seventeenth-century antiques and works from such artists as Carracci adorn the walls.)
The club regularly hosts musicians and comedians. The night I went, two dozen members sat, rapt, as an Italian guitarist in a Western shirt performed covers of Johnny Cash. "The idea is to listen to music," Dr. Musumeci said. Virtually no one took in the performance with a phone in front of their face, save for one American tourist (guilty as charged).
The following morning, I went to Double Trouble, a fashion and accessories brand that I heard of from Ms. Mikayla, who had bought one of Double Trouble's signature, tortellini-shaped key chains the previous day. Founded by the sisters Margherita and Caterina Libouri, who grew up between Bologna and Gabon, Double Trouble sources surplus leather and fabric from factories that produce for brands like Dolce & Gabbana, and turns it into handbags, wallets and dresses.
The Libouri sisters share their work space and showroom, on Via Degli Albari, with Natalia Triana, a Colombian designer who attended the University of Bologna and founded the jewelry line Pepaflaca. As we spoke, she assessed a collection of porcelain earrings, fresh from the kiln, that looked like pieces of pasta.
"I came to Italy to study ceramics," Ms. Triana said. "I fell in love and I stayed. You can find artisans around every corner."
The women pointed me in the direction of another like-minded artisan: Sara Biancalana, the proprietor of Cobalto Lab, on Via San Felice. Like the Libouri sisters, Ms. Biancalana fashions designs from surplus fabric; she also breathes new life into vintage silks. "This is from the '70s," she said, extracting a wisp of a white shirt from a rack. With an embroidered collar and a boxy cut, it looked like something I'd recently seen at a West Hollywood boutique (for $ 700 more).
To the country
Sated by the city, I drove 40 minutes to Casa Maria Luigia, a sumptuous, 12-room bed-and-breakfast in Modena that Mr. Bottura and his wife, Lara Gilmore, opened in 2019. "It was supposed to be our country home," Ms. Gilmore said, greeting me in the property's sprawling backyard wearing clogs and an apron. It turned into a full-time job that inspired a book forthcoming this fall, "Slow Food, Fast Cars," that she co-authored with her husband.
Art from the couple's collection studs the property (the Duane Hanson in the gym could fuel nightmares). Jazz, rock and classical records amassed by Mr. Bottura line the walls of a turntable-equipped listening room (guests can make requests).
"We take a very personal approach," Ms. Gilmore said, setting up a side table for a pair of guests who wanted to set down their Negronis. I asked if she could recommend a running path. The following morning, I found her downstairs, laced up. "I don't have time to bike up to the Apennines today, anyway," she said, referring to the mountain range that constitutes Emilia-Romagna's southern border, as I huffed and puffed alongside her. "You must make sure to have breakfast," she added, as we closed a four-mile loop. "It's an absolute delight."
I was due to check out the Mercato Albinelli, Modena's nearly century-old farmer's market, as well as the Modena Cathedral, an improbable construction of Carrara marble from the 11th century. Also on my agenda: Caseificio Rosola, a Parmigiano-Reggiano factory, and Cantina della Volta, a woman-owned Lambrusco winery. "If you're a little late, it's OK," Ms. Gilmore said, batting away my concerns. "It's Modena."
Wood-fired artichokes with mint, a highlight of Casa Maria Luigia's resplendent breakfast spread, were worth delaying the day's events. A broccoli frittata made me wonder why none of my concoctions of eggs and greens ever tasted so good. There was more mortadella, more Parmigiano-Reggiano, this time drizzled with balsamic vinegar made in a production facility at Casa Maria Luigia, yet another place I wanted to check out.
Reality dawned: I would not have time to see everything. I would have to come back. But when?
"Late fall," Mr. Bottura said, when I asked his advice. "The season is incredible: you have mushrooms, truffles, chestnuts, pumpkin, eels, oysters from the Po River and the sea bass is fat."
And perhaps, next time, without a checklist.

Full text: The film, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, stars Emma Stone as a woman who goes on a sexual and philosophical journey. The announcement of its win was met with a roar of applause.
"Poor Things," directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, was awarded the Golden Lion for best film at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on Saturday by a competition jury led by Damien Chazelle. The film stars Emma Stone in a virtuoso performance as a woman with an initially childlike understanding of the world who comes into her own through a sexual and philosophical journey.
Bella Baxter, the main character in the film, "wouldn't exist without Emma Stone," Lanthimos said. "This film is her, in front of and behind the camera." Stone previously collaborated with Lanthimos on "The Favourite," which won the Grand Jury Prize at the festival in 2018.
Like many other actors in films screened at the festival, Stone was not in attendance, as the strike by SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents television and movie actors, continued.
Set in a partly fantastical 19th-century Europe, "Poor Things" follows Bella (Stone) on her eye-opening adventures in Tony McNamara's adaptation of the 1992 Alasdair Gray novel. The film also stars Willem Dafoe as Bella's father who is a doctor, Ramy Youssef as his assistant and her suitor, and Mark Ruffalo as a lascivious lawyer.
Lanthimos said that the film took "quite a few years" to bring into being, before "the world, or our industry," was ready for its story. The award announcement was met with a roar of applause.
The 80th edition of the festival opened with "Comandante," a historical drama about an Italian submarine that rescued Belgian sailors during World War II. Other prominent films included "Maestro," "Priscilla," "The Killer," "Ferrari," "Hit Man," "Origin," "El Conde," "Aggro Dr1ft," "Coup de Chance," "Dogman" and William Friedkin's final film, "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial."
The latest edition received wide acclaim despite advance speculation that the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes in Hollywood might affect the festival's impact. Stars were largely absent. However, there were exceptions, including Adam Driver and Jessica Chastain, thanks to interim agreements secured with SAG-AFTRA; both actors expressed support for the strikes. But the filmmakers did not disappoint: Before the awards ceremony, crowds chanted "Yorgos! Yorgos!" when the director walked onto the red carpet.
The Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize went to "Evil Does Not Exist," the new film from Ryusuke Hamaguchi, whose film "Drive My Car" won an Academy Award. His latest feature centers on a small town in Japan trying to fend off a planned glamping site.
Immigration was a recurring theme among the prizewinners. The Silver Lion for best director went to Matteo Garrone for the immigration drama "Me Captain." The Special Jury Prize went to Agnieszka Holland for "Green Border," her multifaceted look at immigration to Poland.
The Volpi Cup for best actress was awarded to Cailee Spaeny, who played the titular role in Sofia Coppola's "Priscilla," the story of Priscilla Presley's relationship with Elvis Presley. The best actor award went to Peter Sarsgaard for his role as a man with dementia who is accused of past abuse in Michel Franco's "Memory." In his acceptance speech, Sarsgaard spoke movingly against the threat of artificial intelligence. Seydou Sarr won the Marcello Mastroianni Award, given to an outstanding emerging actor, for "Me Captain."
The best screenplay honor was given to "El Conde," a vampiric reimagining of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator, written by Guillermo Calderón and Pablo Larraín, who also directed. "Love Is a Gun," directed by Lee Hong-Chi, received the Lion of the Future award for best debut feature. "Thank You Very Much," a playful look at Andy Kaufman, won the Venice Classics award for best documentary on cinema.
For the Orizzonti section, another competition slate in the festival, the top prize went to "Explanation for Everything," an expansive work from the Hungarian director Gabor Reisz. "El Paraiso," a mother-son drama, also won two awards in this section: Margarita Rosa de Francisco won for best actress, and Enrico Maria Artale won for best screenplay. Notably, a Mongolian film, "City of Wind," was honored for best actor (Tergel Bold-Erdene).
This year's Golden Lions for lifetime achievement went to Tony Leung Chiu-wai, a star of Hong Kong cinema, and to the director Liliana Cavani, whose film "The Order of Time" played out of competition. The Glory to the Filmmaker Award went to Wes Anderson, whose short film "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar" played out of competition.

Trapped Women And Controlling Men At the Center of Stories: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This year's lineup includes films from Sofia Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos and Bradley Cooper in which female characters squirm under the thumbs of egocentric men.
The press room at the Venice Film Festival has to be the most beautiful film festival press room in the world. Taking over the third floor of the imposing Palazzo del Casinò, the main atrium is a gargantuan, triple-height space carpeted in soft cream, with columns clad in marble extending up past Murano glass chandeliers, and floor-to-ceiling windows hung with gold-sheened drapes giving way to a sparkling blue sea. On a clear day -- which it almost always is -- you imagine that, were it not for the curvature of the earth, you could see forever. Or at least to Croatia.
It is an eternal contradiction that this lofty space should be peopled with dozens of perspiring journalists hunched over their laptops, hammering away at their keyboards like birds beating their wings against the bars of a particularly gilded cage. Or maybe such dark thoughts in a such a light-filled structure -- designed by the architect Eugenio Miozzi in 1938 to embody the monumentalist fantasy of Mussolini's fascist regime -- are a symptom of a festival lineup that, this year, features a profusion of stories about women similarly chafing against the restrictive, but often luxurious, enclosures built by controlling men.
Some of these men were towering real-life figures. Penélope Cruz turns in the standout performance in Michael Mann's "Ferrari" as the long-suffering wife of the Italian motoring magnate (Adam Driver), and Carey Mulligan does much the same as Leonard Bernstein's wife Felicia in "Maestro," directed by and starring Bradley Cooper. In both these cases -- and arguably to the detriment of both well-made but strangely evanescent films -- the portrayal of genius pales in comparison to the portrait of a woman who supported and nurtured that genius, even when it threatened to engulf her.
Of two memorable scenes in "Maestro," only one -- Bernstein's performance of Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony at Ely Cathedral in 1973 -- is about his music. The other is a lacerating domestic argument in the couple's bedroom, during which, in every shaking nerve, Mulligan embodies the resentment of a bright, ambitious woman whose devotion to and indulgence of her famous spouse has cost her so much of herself.
The life-draining capacity of egocentric men is even more strikingly literalized in Pablo Larraín's mordant, monochrome "El Conde," in which the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is recreated as a 250-year-old vampire. In Larraín's scabrous, grisly alternate history, Pinochet is a decrepit immortal, drowning in self-pity since faking his death to evade justice. And Pinochet's wife Lucía (Gloria Münchmeyer) is imagined as his equal, or even his better, in sheer perversity; much of the misery the terrorized nation experienced under the dictator is suggested to have been at her behest.
But although that gives Lucía, who constantly petitions her husband to bite her so that she too can live out her depravities forever, a degree of apparent agency, that is robbed from her in one brief scene where "The Count," as he likes to be called, casually trades her off to his obsequious Renfield-style butler (Alfredo Castro). The Count is then free to pursue an affair with a nun, including fantasy play that involves her dressing up as Marie Antoinette. (The Count has been obsessed with the ill-fated Queen of France ever since, in one of the film's most provocatively gruesome early scenes, he licked the guillotine blade that severed her slender neck.)
Marie Antoinette is perhaps the ultimate emblem of decorative married womanhood. And of course, she was the title star of a previous film from Sofia Coppola, whose Venice-competing "Priscilla" is yet another tale of a woman's tentatively self-engineered escape from the influence of a dominant man.
Based on, and clearly in deep sympathy with, Priscilla Presley's memoir "Elvis and Me," the film follows the famous couple's relationship, from their first meeting when then-Priscilla Beaulieu (Cailee Spaeny) was just 14 years old and living on a U.S. Army base in Germany, to the moment, almost a decade-and-a-half later, when Priscilla Presley drove through the gates of Graceland for the last time as the house's mistress.
This is unmistakably a Sofia Coppola movie, in its luxuriant feel for fabrics and facades, but as in "Marie Antoinette," here the surfaces become the substance. It is a story about how, especially to a naïve teenager, the trappings of an outwardly tantalizing lifestyle can be sprung upon you like a trap. During their first tearful goodbye in Germany, Elvis (Jacob Elordi) makes the schoolgirl Priscilla promise to "stay exactly the way you are." But the banner film investigating the icky desire on the part of some men to keep their womenfolk infantilized is Yorgos Lanthimos' joyously macabre "Poor Things." The biggest hit of Venice so far, it is deeply -- if twistedly, and often hilariously -- concerned with the idea of female emancipation, as Bella, played by a riveting, inventive and highly physical Emma Stone, shucks off the psychological bondage first of her adoptive father (Willem Dafoe) and then of her caddish, pompous lover (Mark Ruffalo).
Even the film's hyperreal aesthetic, in which Lisbon and London are depicted by intricate, steampunky set-builds with lurid computer generated skies and seas, reinforce the concept: The film's self-consciously airless and artificial universe makes the vigor of Bella's adventures in sex and self-discovery all the more striking.
There are still more women trapped under the thumbs of domineering men dotted throughout the lineup, most notably in two black comedies that both feature contract killers (another feature of Venice 2023, if you also take David Fincher's "The Killer," Harmony Korine's "Aggro Dr1ft" and the Liam Neeson thriller "In the Land of Saints and Sinners" into further account).
Richard Linklater's "Hit Man" stars and is co-written by Glen Powell, who deserves to leap up to major-league stardom on the back of this effervescently amoral exaggeration of a real-life story: Gary, a diffident English professor who moonlights as a fake hit man, finds love getting in the way of his mission when an abused wife, Madison (Adria Arjona), tries to enlist his services. She is driven to it as a means to escape. But the murder-solicitation in Woody Allen's French-language "Coup de Chance," is far less morally defensible, prompted by jealousy and again, a loss of control, as the possessive rich-guy Jean (Melvil Poupaud), discovers that his young, vivacious wife (Lou De Laâge) has taken a lover.
"Coup de Chance" is, in some respects a return to form for Allen, even if one suspects that some of its breeziness is down to the attractive cast compensating for the staleness of Allen's recent English-language quippery by mercifully speaking in French. (Native French speakers of my acquaintance tell me that the dialogue, to their ears, sounds similarly unnatural.)
But it does feel more current than most of Allen's recent output, not least in how it syncs up neatly with this Venice edition's chief preoccupations: hit men and trapped women, and all the poor things who find themselves in plush Central Park or central Paris apartments, in press room palaces or fantastical Lisbon hotels, surrounded by luxury, but longing to be free.

New Elvis Movie Trades the Music For Dissonance: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The story of her life with the rock star lacks major musical moments because the singer's estate wouldn't support the warts-and-all treatment.
You may not think there's a need for two big Elvis Presley movies in back-to-back years, but it's hard to imagine a pair of filmmakers with sensibilities as different as Baz Luhrmann, who directed "Elvis" (2022), and Sofia Coppola, who came to the Venice Film Festival on Monday to debut "Priscilla," about the rocky marriage between Priscilla Presley and her famous beau.
Luhrmann is a maximalist, a master of shock-and-awe spectacle in which every new frame is a confetti-crammed party. Coppola is more interested in the intimate: Her settings may be as luxurious as Luhrmann's, but the young women she finds living in these gilded cages are a party of one, desperate for real connection.
That's a feeling Coppola has explored in movies like "Lost in Translation" (2003) and "Marie Antoinette" (2006), and "Priscilla" finds the filmmaker at the peak of her preoccupations. "I don't know why I keep coming back to it," Coppola joked at a news conference on Monday after she was asked about her frequent depictions of girlhood. "Hopefully, I'll grow up soon."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Adapted from the memoir "Elvis and Me," Coppola's film gets underway when Elvis, sent to Germany during his military service, meets Priscilla, the daughter of a military officer newly stationed there. She's isolated and homesick, yearning for the life she left behind in the United States. Despite being a superstar, a besotted Elvis finds he can relate.
Priscilla is also 14, a fact the film doesn't shy away from. "Ninth grade? You're just a baby," the 24-year-old Elvis murmurs when they meet at a party, though that age difference hardly slows his pursuit: At times, he even seems to regard Priscilla's virginity as her primary trait. "Promise me you'll stay the way you are," he says as he proceeds to turn the poor girl's life upside down, eventually whisking her from Germany to Graceland, plying her with uppers and sleeping pills, and insisting that she keep their yearslong relationship secret even as he's publicly photographed in romantic clinches with the likes of Nancy Sinatra and Ann-Margret.
As in "Marie Antoinette," when our young protagonist is dropped in the lap of luxury and finds it awfully lonely, Priscilla has everything she thought she could ever want and still feels a lack. The star she found so alluring is often cruel and manipulative, telling her what to wear and how to act, and reminding her every time she balks that millions of women would eagerly take her place. To assert herself, Priscilla has to get creative: Since Elvis wants her to dress only in solid colors, every time he does something upsetting, she retaliates by wearing a vivid print.
Priscilla is sensitively played in the film by Cailee Spaeny, an up-and-coming actress, while "Euphoria" star Jacob Elordi has the even trickier task of playing Elvis a year after Austin Butler's uncanny re-creation made him an A-lister. Elordi acquits himself just fine, and it helps that Coppola isn't interested in staging splashy musical numbers: During the few glimpses we do get of Elordi's Elvis midsong, he's always filmed from the back. That aesthetic choice smartly steers "Priscilla" away from Luhrmann's movie (which was much more interested in Elvis the performer) and further grounds the film in Priscilla's perspective. If he's heading onstage, all it really means is that he's leaving her behind.
The movie may also lack big musical scenes because Presley's estate was unwilling to support the film or authorize the use of his songbook. I'm not surprised. Luhrmann's hagiography was estate-approved and portrayed the singer as the innocent pawn of his craven manager, Col. Tom Parker. "Priscilla" shows how manipulative Elvis himself could be. This is no puff piece: It's a warts-and-all portrayal of a charismatic man who pulled a young girl into his orbit and then wouldn't let her out.
Though Priscilla attended the Venice news conference in support of the film, she didn't sit on the dais with Coppola and her cast, instead watching from the front row of the audience. But when a journalist asked what moved her most about "Priscilla," Presley herself took the mic.
"It's very difficult to sit and watch a film about you and about your life and about your love," she said. "Sofia did an amazing job. She did her homework."
The moment that moved her most was the ending, Presley said. It's the moment just after their marriage crumbles, when Priscilla finally summons the strength to stand on her own two feet.
"Yes, I left, and it wasn't because I didn't love him," Presley said. "He was the love of my life. It was the lifestyle that was so difficult for me, and I think any woman can relate to that."

Histories of Hierarchy, Crafted Into a Film: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The nonfiction best seller explores race and hierarchy but doesn't suggest a straightforward screen story. For her film, DuVernay got creative.
"I've never even seen that beach!" said Ava DuVernay as she took in the view on Monday at a hotel restaurant on the Lido, the island where the Venice Film Festival is held. Staring out onto the sands, DuVernay smiled. "I've been to Venice a couple of times, but I never went to the beach," she said. "I was more into the canals, but this is fantastic."
The trailblazing director has come to the festival to premiere her new film, "Origin," adapted from "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents" by the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson. Though it was a major best seller, Wilkerson's tome doesn't naturally lend itself to a straightforward narrative film: The book is a sprawling, nonfiction exploration of the ways that caste systems have shaped different societies all over the world, and encompasses Germany's persecution of Jews in the lead-up to World War II, India's treatment of its Dalit people, and racism against African Americans in the United States.
To crack the movie adaptation, DuVernay cast the Oscar nominee Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor ("King Richard") as the author herself, anchoring the story in the period that Wilkerson spent researching and writing "Caste," even as she dealt with a series of personal tragedies that included the death of her husband (played by Jon Bernthal). "I'd heard about her losses and that really struck me -- to be creating this massive work on top of it," DuVernay said.
Though "Origin" was originally set up at Netflix, the streamer where DuVernay made the Oscar-nominated documentary "13TH" and the Emmy-winning limited series "When They See Us," she opted to direct it independently to preserve her vision for the film, which included on-location shoots in Germany and India and an opening scene that follows Trayvon Martin on the night he was shot and killed. In advance of the Venice premiere of "Origin" on Wednesday, DuVernay's company Array announced that the red-hot distributor Neon had picked up the film and is planning a year-end release.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
DuVernay is the first African American woman to have a film in competition at Venice, and during our interview this week, she kept spotting and waving to colleagues who had helped realize her vision, including a fellow producer, Paul Garnes, and the cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd. "The whole team came!" she told me, beaming by the beach. "Because we're indie, we used our miles."
Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.
"Caste" came out in August 2020. What was going on in your life at that time?
It was the summer of George Floyd's murder, and I was interrogating that in ways that were deeply personal. I had also just lost a loved one to Covid in the early, very scary time of Covid, which I think so many people have just forgotten about. But when you think of the spring and summer of 2020, it was shocking, it was frightening; people were dying alone in hospitals, which was the situation for my loved one. So when I read this book, I found it to have organizing principles to help me have something to anchor and hold onto as I thought about this crazy world we're in.
Did the idea of an adaptation immediately present itself when you read it?
I have this really bad thing that I do with almost everything I read where I think, "Could this be a movie?" But on this one, I just thought, Well, this is not possible. It was so dense and full-bodied with ideas and there was no linear narrative. It was really the second time I read it that I started to see Isabel in the book. There are some stories she tells that she's actually in, where I started to think, "Oh, wow, she's the recurring character in it," and that was the little seed of the idea.
Did Isabel take some convincing?
When I got on the phone with her and told her I wanted to do something, I remember her saying, "Would this be like '13TH,' or a doc series?" She was just trying to figure it out. I said, "It's a narrative film with actors, and the main character is someone who appears all throughout the book." She said, "Oh, there's not really anyone who's all throughout the book," and I said, "It's you." She got it, because she's a storyteller. All of these stories and ideas and pieces need to be unified through a character that we root for, someone that we're emotionally connected to.
"Origin" is the story about how Isabel put together "Caste," but what is the story of how you put together "Origin"? What obstacles did you face?
The obstacles were money. It was originally with a streamer, and I realized that in order to make the film I wanted to make, I would have to make it on my own.
Netflix is a streamer that isn't normally afraid to spend money.
It just was different visions. They were good enough to let it go and let me try to figure it out on my own, which we did in short order.
How different was their vision for this?
It would have been more of a group thing, and I was interested in a singular voice. But I just want to make sure that it doesn't come across like I'm bashing them, because I'm not. They didn't have to let it go, and some things don't match up. I had a really nice run with them.
While making this film about caste systems, is it true you even sought to dismantle castes in the crew, like the conventional naming of first and second units or A and B cameras?
I challenged different department heads to look at the hierarchies within our set and really think about what we're making: What are we saying about the order of people and who's more valuable? That was really embraced by Matthew Lloyd, our cinematographer, who said, "I've noticed on sets that the B camera is where the women or people of color are. Let's change that, let's not have a B camera."
So we just didn't call it B camera, it was just East or West camera. That's the idea. Can we get on an equitable playing field? It won't happen in our lifetimes, but it's never going to even start if you don't talk about it and name it.
How did you make the decision to open the movie with Trayvon Martin?
That story was so formative for me because Trayvon's like our Emmett Till. That's when I felt like it all started, this idea of a movement for Black lives many years before it was called that. I wanted to really crystallize what had been happening to us through the story of this boy, and I don't want people to forget him because he was the first of this modern era of high-profile cases.
I've always been fascinated by the fact that he was just talking to a friend on the phone -- one of his girls, it wasn't even a girlfriend -- and how that could be so wildly misinterpreted and criminalized by this schmuck of a guy who was empowered to take his life. It angers me still, so I wanted to pay tribute to him. His mother visited Array, and I showed her those sections because I wanted to get her blessing. A strong lady. The two family members she came with were in tears and she didn't cry. She just looked at me and she said, "That's right," and gave her blessing for it.
In "Caste," Wilkerson wrote, "It does us no good to pretend that certain ailments have not beset us." But this is a moment in time when state legislatures around the country are pulling books that examine slavery and racism.
I think that's why you have to do this kind of work. They may not read the book, they may not watch CNN, they may not go to the panel, but they might see one movie. This stuff is going down and we're just acting as if it doesn't really matter, but this is the exact same thing that happened in 1930 to '33 in Germany. So much is happening so quickly that you're overwhelmed by it.
I mean, taking books off shelves, saying that slavery was good for both sides, basically? These are absurd things that are now being codified in law. The people who know that it's absurd are not doing enough, so it's really important for this film to be out at this time when people are making decisions about the leadership of this country. When you look at what happened, it might echo and remind you this is happening now.

Full text: A big obstacle is the lack of loans, a subject of intense disagreement between richer and poorer countries. But in Congo, a hard-fought solar investment shows a possible path forward.
The world is racing ahead with enormous investments in renewable energy, for the first time this year plowing more money into solar power than oil.
But the world's poorest countries, mostly in Africa, are effectively priced out of the action by a global lending system that considers them too risky for investment. Only 2 percent of global investment in renewable energy has been in Africa, where nearly a billion people have little or no access to electricity.
It's a paradox, Africa's leaders argue. Clean energy projects would help stabilize their countries and economies, they say, reducing the very risk that investors say they fear. It's an issue that looms large this week at a climate summit in Kenya, as it will at climate talks sponsored by the United Nations later this year in Dubai.
It also preoccupies Archip Lobo, whose company, against the odds, raised $ 70 million in international funds this year -- capping half a decade of effort -- to build solar-powered microgrids in Congo.
"A year ago, we were about halfway to losing hope," Mr. Lobo said. "We were thinking, These lenders all want us to assure them there's no political risk, no security risk. How can you do that in Congo?"
He has lived that risk. At 8, Mr. Lobo was made a refugee. His brothers were forcibly recruited by the army, and other family members were raped.
Yet he also embodies an entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr. Lobo, now 31, got a degree and co-founded a company that roasts some of the delectable coffee that grows in eastern Congo.
While his second company, Nuru -- the word means "light" in Swahili -- is small by global standards, investments like these are important, experts say, because if the pattern of clean energy investment doesn't change, by midcentury more than three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emissions could come from the least-developed countries, whose populations and economies are growing faster than anywhere else.
Like many businessmen across Africa, Mr. Lobo found himself stymied by the price and paucity of electricity. His coffee company relied on just an hour or two of power from a generator fueled by diesel that had to be trucked thousands of miles from ports in Kenya and Tanzania.
He co-founded Nuru to try to solve that problem. It negotiated a partnership with a consortium of philanthropic funds, anchored by the Bezos Earth Fund and the Rockefeller and Ikea foundations, that agreed to put in the majority of the recent funding, which is intended to give Nuru a chance to prove that, rather than being a risky investment, it is an enterprise that can make money and transform the local economy.
"We're trying to use philanthropic money to create proof points to get the market moving and show it's less risky than international lending institutions and private banks think," said Simon Harford, the chief executive of the consortium, known as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet.
With the money, Nuru will increase its urban microgrids in Congo to four, from one, and be able to produce 13 times as much electricity. The company eventually hopes to provide millions of Congolese with cheaper and more reliable electricity than what is produced by the diesel generators that most now use.
More than 70 million of Congo's 100 million people cannot afford or access electricity. Its population is currently growing faster than new electricity customers are being brought online.
"I pay three times less to Nuru than what I paid for diesel, so you can imagine what it means for my business," said Ezekia Rubona, 27, who runs a shop where people can make photocopies, print banners, upload videos and surf the internet. "That generator, too, it always surged. We would lose machines that way."
While the financing is a major breakthrough for Nuru, the company is receiving it at an interest rate of more than 15 percent, five times as high as interest rates for many renewable energy projects in wealthier countries where companies have easier access to credit. Nuru also can't afford to hire a seasoned chief financial officer. It could barely pay its small team over the years for trying to wrangle an investment that elsewhere in the renewable energy world might seem paltry.
The clincher, said Mr. Lobo, was getting investors to actually come to Congo. That was only made harder by an Ebola epidemic in the region and then Covid-19, as well as unrest that is so persistent it rarely makes global headlines. On the day a New York Times reporter arrived in the city of Goma to visit Nuru's existing microgrid, state security forces killed more than 40 people who were gathering for a protest against the presence of a longstanding U.N. peacekeeping force widely seen as ineffective and a source of corruption.
A day later, Goma was back to its usual bustle.
"Investors are human beings too," Mr. Lobo said. "Once you come here and see the hunger for energy, the potential for growth, you can finally look past the risks and see what a transformative investment this will be, a real, genuine business opportunity."
What African leaders gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, this week for the first-ever Africa Climate Summit hope to do is persuade global investors and multinational development banks like the International Monetary Fund that African companies need not only more deals like Nuru's but also better ones.
There's a term, "concessional," for certain kinds of international loans that are designed to help less wealthy international borrowers. The idea is that loans might have below-market interest rates or grace periods for repayment.
Nuru's loan is anything but concessional.
But the idea is to prime the pump for bigger investments. "The multinational banks are the ones who need to be the mobilizers-in-chief," said Chavi Meattle, an expert on climate finance in Africa at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group. "They've made promises to reform, but they are not following through fast enough."
Ms. Meattle co-wrote a paper last year outlining the flow of climate investments into Africa, which found that a vast majority of what was already a small pool of money went to just a few of Africa's most advanced economies, like Egypt, Morocco and South Africa.
In smaller countries like Sierra Leone, those seeking to develop renewable energy face an even steeper uphill battle than Nuru, which has Congo's large population and famed natural resources as points of reference for potential investors.
Kofie Macauley, a Sierra Leonean engineer, has been trying to raise money for a hydroelectric project in a rural area of the country for a decade. He has courted roughly 60 equity partners, big and small, from around the world, for a dam that costs $ 80 million, a humble sum as far as such projects go. All the groundwork is complete. The money is the only thing.
"I just can't provide the guarantees they insist on," Mr. Macauley said. The dam project, while small, could "change the whole course of Sierra Leone's history," he said, providing power to as many as two million people who now lack it.
"The big banks are too risk-averse to see that," he said. "So the rest of the world will ride a Ferrari, and we stay on the bicycle."

GOMA, Congo — The world is racing ahead with enormous investments in renewable energy, for the first time this year plowing more money into solar power than oil.

Billing 'Maestro' as a Love Story, Not a Biopic: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a teaser set off controversy over the nose of main character Leonard Bernstein, the film finally premieres in Italy. Here's what you need to know.
During a 1976 lecture at Harvard University, the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein said, "A work of art does not answer questions, it provokes them."
It's fitting that Bradley Cooper opens his new movie about the musician with that same quote: Ever since the teaser trailer dropped for "Maestro," which Cooper directed, co-wrote and starred in, all sorts of questions have been flying. And though Bernstein may have been hesitant to answer queries about art, I feel no such reluctance: Having caught the movie Saturday during its debut at the Venice Film Festival, I'm ready to fill you in on everything you might want to know about "Maestro."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's it about?
Due on Netflix in December, "Maestro" tracks the exceptional but complicated life of Bernstein, best known as the composer of works like "West Side Story" and widely considered America's first great conductor. When we meet Bernstein, he's about to get his big break as the fill-in conductor of the New York Philharmonic, news he excitedly shares with the handsome musical collaborator (Matt Bomer) who is still naked in his bed. But as Bernstein's profile rises, he finds himself beguiled by Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), an actress with an exotic Chilean accent and a laugh like a musical trill.
"The world wants us to be one thing and I find that deplorable," Bernstein confides to her. Pressured by friends to live his life and work in a way that is "clean," Bernstein marries Montealegre, who accepts his occasional dalliances with men so long as he's discreet. The problem is, he isn't. (Alongside "Oppenheimer" and the forthcoming "Ferrari," you could file "Maestro" under "Movies About Major 20th-Century Figures Who Might Have Fooled Around a Little Too Much.")
So is it a biography of Bernstein?
If you refer to "Maestro" as a biopic, expect a sternly worded email from the movie's reps. The film is actually a love story, they insist. It's true that the 27-year marriage between Bernstein and Montealegre is the primary concern.
It's also true that "Maestro" doesn't play by traditional biopic rules. This isn't a cradle-to-the-grave record of Bernstein's artistic accomplishments, which mostly occur in the background or in the ellipses between scenes. Even his iconic "West Side Story" score is heard only once, as the unexpected soundtrack to a domestic scene late in the movie. You do get to see Bernstein conduct in a virtuoso long take, but the film's most notable musical sequence is a dream ballet. (Between that scene and the "I'm Just Ken" number from "Barbie," cinematic dream ballets are really having a moment.)
What's up with that fake nose?
After Netflix released the teaser trailer for "Maestro" in mid-August, the prosthetic nose Cooper wore to play Bernstein was criticized on social media, and some questioned why a non-Jewish actor was playing such a famous Jewish figure to begin with. In response, the Bernsteins' three children issued a statement, saying, "It happens to be true that Leonard Bernstein had a nice, big nose. Bradley chose to use makeup to amplify his resemblance, and we're perfectly fine with that."
Leaving issues of propriety aside, how does Cooper's fake schnoz look in the movie? It helps that the first time "Maestro" shows Cooper is during a brief flash-forward set near the end of Bernstein's life: The nose is only one element of the frankly astonishing old-age makeup he's got on, so it's hardly the first thing you'd notice. But when the film flashes back to Bernstein as a young man, the prosthetic proves intermittently distracting. It's both too much and not enough: Unlike the fake nose in "The Hours," which really did render Nicole Kidman unrecognizable, young Bernstein just looks like Bradley Cooper wearing a big beak.
Why is Carey Mulligan billed first?
The trailer for "Maestro" gives Mulligan first billing over Cooper, and the initial poster for the film features only her, which led observers to wonder if "Maestro" would be told primarily through Montealegre's point of view.
It isn't. Though Mulligan has way more to do than some of the other suffering spouses in films this year, Cooper edges her out decisively when it comes to screen time. (Even if you regard "Maestro" as practically a two-hander, it's he who has the upper hand.) But hey, the billing was a nice gesture, at least! Or maybe Cooper, who is cited five separate times in the credits for "Maestro," simply felt he should give his name a brief reprieve.
Will 'Maestro' be an Oscar contender?
Cooper's feature directing debut, "A Star Is Born" (2018), was nominated for eight Oscars and won one, for its original song, "Shallow." Can "Maestro" prove to be similar Oscar bait and even snag Cooper the best-director nomination he missed out on a few years ago?
Raves from industry trades Variety and the Hollywood Reporter will help raise the film's awards chances, though cooler reactions from IndieWire and Vulture suggest not all critics will be in lock step. And since the SAG-AFTRA strike inhibits Cooper's ability to promote "Maestro" -- he wasn't even able to appear at the Venice news conference or premiere, since guild rules currently prohibit actors from doing press for big-studio projects -- he'll have to rely on others to make the case for him.
But it's hard to deny the bigness of those lead performances, and after "A Star Is Born" best-actor nominee Cooper lost the Oscar to a prosthetics-laden Rami Malek playing a real person, maybe it's Cooper's turn to have that kind of award-magnet role. It'll be a crowded field full of contenders like Cillian Murphy ("Oppenheimer") and Leonardo DiCaprio ("Killers of the Flower Moon"), but you can't count out a nine-time nominee like Cooper: If he gets in, I suspect it will be by much more than a nose.

At Festival, Adam Driver Backs Actors: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: His film "Ferrari," a big-budget indie from Michael Mann, is the kind of adult drama the major studios have shied away from.
The name placard on the dais said "A. Driver," and if you're making a Ferrari movie, you'd certainly better have one.
This particular Driver happened to be in high demand at the Venice Film Festival, which bowed on Wednesday and has mostly had to make do without famous movie stars as the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike prohibits actors from promoting films made by most major studios. But since the new Michael Mann-directed film "Ferrari" will be released domestically by Neon and internationally by STX -- two companies that aren't members of the group that Hollywood guilds are striking against -- its star, Adam Driver, was free to make the trip to Venice and add A-list appeal to a festival in dire need of it.
"I'm proud to be here, to be a visual representation of a movie that's not part of the A.M.P.T.P.," Driver said on Thursday at the news conference for the film, referencing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. He praised the interim agreement devised by SAG-AFTRA that allows stars to promote independent films as long as their distributors agree with the terms the actors' guild is seeking.
"Why is it that a smaller distribution company like Neon and STX International can meet the dream demands of what SAG is asking for -- the dream version of SAG's wish list -- but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can't?" asked Driver, who has previously promoted Netflix movies like "Marriage Story" and "White Noise" in Venice. "Every time people from SAG go and support movies that have agreed to these terms with the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people they collaborate with, and the others are not."
After the crowd at the news conference applauded, Mann added, "No big studio wrote us a check. That's why we're here, standing in solidarity."
You wouldn't think while watching it that "Ferrari" is an indie movie. With a reported budget of $ 95 million, this is the sort of lavish adult drama that Mann used to make for major studios all the time. But movies like "Heat," "The Last of the Mohicans," "Ali" and "The Insider," all films Mann made in the 1990s or early 2000s, have fallen out of favor in our superhero-saturated era, and expensive prestige releases like this one have recently struggled to break out at the box office.
Can the record-breaking success of Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" reinvigorate the sort of big-budget dad drama that used to be a theatrical staple? "Ferrari" is counting on it, even if its fellow December releases, like "Wonka" and "The Color Purple," don't necessarily lend themselves to "Barbenheimer"-level portmanteaus. ("Wonkari" and "Ferple" just sound like off-brand Pokemon.)
Like Nolan's summer hit, "Ferrari" is about a midcentury visionary with a wandering eye: Driver's Enzo Ferrari is a racer-turned-automaker who's feuding with his wife (Penélope Cruz), hiding a mistress (Shailene Woodley) and trying to save his namesake company before it goes belly up. Mann tracks him during the summer of 1957, when it seemed like so many of Ferrari's problems could be fixed by a single, momentous race. If one of his drivers can win the dangerous, thousand-mile race Mille Miglia, Ferrari reasons, it would stoke enough demand to lift the company's fortunes. Still, his single-minded pursuit of that goal turns out to be a life-or-death matter with all sorts of unexpected casualties.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It may be hard now to conceive of "Ferrari" as a Driver-less vehicle, but over the many years that Mann tried to mount it, the director flirted with leading men like Robert De Niro, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who went on to topline the Mann-produced "Ford v Ferrari" (2019). The 39-year-old Driver is called upon to play a man two decades older for most of the film's running time, but that gray-haired intensity actually suits him: His Ferrari is hard-nosed and compelling, like a too-serious MSNBC commentator who slowly attracts an ardent, horny fan base.
Regardless of whether "Ferrari" can chase the box-office success of "Oppenheimer," Driver said it was a miracle it was made at all, summing up the film's truncated production schedule and false starts in a way that his title character could understand.
"It's hard not to get philosophical about an engine -- the amount of pieces that have to come together, similar to films, and work on the exact right timing in the exact right moment," he said at the news conference. "And then there's the element of human intuition and reflex. It's a 50/50 marriage, and that's very much filmmaking."
When all those different elements manage to coalesce on a premium race car -- or a big-budget indie film -- it's beautiful, Driver said. "It also makes you aware of how many things could go wrong at any moment," he noted. "It's a special thing to be part of."

Little Star Power, But Auteur Appeal: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New films from David Fincher, Sofia Coppola, Ava DuVernay and Michael Mann will make up for the absence of stars kept away by the Hollywood strikes.
A year ago, the Venice Film Festival had enough star power to put even celebrity-worshiping Cannes on notice. Highlights were quickly beamed all over the world, including the notorious "Don't Worry Darling" kickoff that fueled endless speculation about the film's director, Olivia Wilde, and her stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles; the news conference where an unexpectedly sagacious Timothée Chalamet predicted imminent societal collapse; and the tearful Brendan Fraser comeback that began on the Lido and culminated in his best actor Oscar win.
But without all of those celebrities, can Venice still go viral?
The 80th edition of the festival, which begins on Wednesday, will be significantly affected by continuing strikes by the Screen Actors Guild (or SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guild of America, since the actors' union has instructed its members not to do press for any studio movies until the strike against those companies is resolved. That puts Venice in a bind, as it's regarded as one of the best places for Hollywood to unveil starry awards-season titles. Few major actors will even be permitted to attend this year.
The actors' strike has already cost Venice its original opening-night film, Luca Guadagnino's sexy tennis romance, "Challengers," since MGM delayed it from September to spring in the hopes that its lead, Zendaya, will be allowed to promote it several months from now when the strikes might be resolved. (A low-profile Italian film is opening instead.) And I've heard of a few more starry fall films that were earmarked for Venice but opted for the Telluride Film Festival instead, since that event is less driven by the photo ops and news conferences that are no longer feasible in Italy.
Despite some of those trims, the Venice lineup is still enticing, with an auteur-heavy list featuring directors nearly as famous as their leads. And Venice has proved before that it can adapt to unfavorable limitations: Amid the pandemic in August 2020, the festival opted for a smaller, partly open-air edition that still went on to premiere the eventual winner of the best picture Oscar, "Nomadland."
This year's program includes two films about assassins-for-hire: David Fincher's new thriller, "The Killer," stars Michael Fassbender, while Richard Linklater's "Hit Man" features the "Top Gun: Maverick" breakout Glen Powell, who also served as a co-writer. I'm curious about the off-kilter comedy "Poor Things," directed by Yorgos Lanthimos ("The Favourite") and starring Emma Stone as a sexually curious Frankenstein's monster. Ditto "Maestro," Bradley Cooper's second directorial effort, after "A Star Is Born." He's cast himself as the composer Leonard Bernstein, opposite Carey Mulligan as Bernstein's wife, Felicia, and his decision to wear a prosthetic nose has already set off controversy.
Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" was a big hit last year, but what will that story look like through Sofia Coppola's lens? The "Lost in Translation" and "Marie Antoinette" director puts her spotlight on Elvis Presley's wife with "Priscilla," featuring Cailee Spaeny as young Priscilla Presley and the "Euphoria" star Jacob Elordi as the singer. Ava DuVernay has adapted the Isabel Wilkerson book "Caste" for her new film, "Origin," which stars the Oscar nominee Aunjanue Ellis in an examination of racism and systemic oppression. And though Michael Mann has secured a guild exemption that would allow the cast of "Ferrari" to promote it in Venice, I'm curious whether his new film's press-shy lead, Adam Driver (as the racer-turned-car-magnate Enzo Ferrari), is willing to do a full-blown media blitz for the movie, which the hot indie studio Neon is releasing in theaters on Christmas Day.
Two years after the release of his Oscar-winning breakthrough "Drive My Car," the director Ryusuke Hamaguchi returns to the festival circuit with "Evil Does Not Exist," which originated as a dialogue-free short and became a feature-length film about ecological collapse. And two months after releasing his feature-length "Asteroid City," the director Wes Anderson is opting for something shorter with "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar," a 37-minute Roald Dahl adaptation for Netflix.
Harmony Korine premiered his biggest film, "Spring Breakers," at Venice back in 2012, and he'll return with the mysterious "Aggro Dr1ft," which stars the rapper Travis Scott and was shot solely using infrared photography. He's not the only director taking chances: Pablo Larraín, the director of "Jackie" and "Spencer," has set the divas aside for a moment to make "El Conde," a black-and-white supernatural fable that reimagines the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as a bloodsucking vampire.
And then there are the chances that Venice itself is taking when it comes to three auteurs: It is premiering "Dogman" from Luc Besson, who was accused of sexual assault but cleared by prosecutors; "The Palace" from Roman Polanski, who was convicted of unlawful sex with a minor but fled before he could be sentenced; and "Coup de Chance" from Woody Allen, who has denied sexual abuse accusations by Dylan Farrow, his adopted daughter.
Venice will also serve as an elegy of sorts for the director William Friedkin, who died earlier this month and whose final film, the naval drama "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial," will premiere posthumously on the Lido. Adapted by Friedkin from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Herman Wouk, it stars Jake Lacy and Kiefer Sutherland.

The Bewildering Films of Neil Breen: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The producer, writer, director and star has made five imaginative, bewildering low-budget paranormal thrillers, spurring both ridicule and awe.
A mysterious orb blares across the sky and punches into the sun-baked bed of a desert landscape. From it a messianic being emerges. For the viewer it's at this point, early in the 2009 film "I Am Here .... Now," that the proceedings veer in one of two directions: a solemn polemic about drug use, corporate corruption and environmental exploitation; or an endearingly inept science-fiction parable, the charms of which center wholly on the middle-aged man who plays the alien being. His name is Neil Breen.
Breen has produced, written, directed and starred in five films. His sixth, "Cade: The Tortured Crossing," just opened in select theaters (it screens in New York in August), and if the trailer is any indication, then his singular, if peculiar, vision has remained intact.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For the past 18 years Breen has been making imaginative but bewildering low-budget paranormal thrillers in and near his suburban Las Vegas home. Some concern interstellar visitors like the one in "I Am Here .... Now"; others focus on hackers with superhuman abilities. There are talismanic crystals, mystical animals (predominantly eagles or tigers), and what I assume is Breen's own Ferrari Testarossa. His dialogue tends to be peppered with technological keywords: artificial intelligence, cyberterrorism, metaverse, virtual reality -- concepts that Breen never convincingly grasps and that seem abstract considering his films look as if they were made for tens of thousands of dollars. (Breen claims to have funded his early films with his income as an architect.)
He serves in multiple roles in each production: location manager, music director, sound effects supervisor, editor, lighting designer, set designer, special effects designer, prop master, stunt coordinator, even legal and accounting services. And it's his face emblazoned on each poster, making it indisputably clear that the distinguishing feature of a Neil Breen film is Neil Breen.
"I am honestly sincerely doing the best I can, with the resources that I have, both physically and financially," Breen said in a 2014 interview with New York Cine Radio. (He didn't respond to interview requests for this article.)
If resourcefulness is considered one of the core tenets of independent film, then Breen could be one of the central filmmakers of the past two decades. When he talks about his work, he tends to proudly reiterate the same anecdotes about how he assembles his casts via Craigslist ads or how he corresponds directly with the theaters that exhibit his work. Instead of ruminating on the meaning of his ambitious if barely coherent forays into science fiction, he'll explain at length how he feeds his cast and crew.
Breen's entire cinematic approach can be encapsulated in a backyard cookout scene in "Fateful Findings" (2013), in which the characters are actually eating. You get the sense that Breen's intent here was to simultaneously direct, act and do the catering.
"There's an uncanny quality," Cristina Cacioppo, a director of programming at Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, said when asked to describe Breen's films. "Sort of a resemblance to reality, but just sort of like otherworldly."
All of Breen's films seem clearly to mean something, and watching them, one's suspension of disbelief is constantly threatened by strange directorial choices. Even when they're 90 minutes, some feel interminable. In a simple scene of dialogue he'll freely break the 180-degree rule, a basic staging technique meant to keep the viewer oriented. His later films make generous use of composite photography, and characters will be both uncannily too large and too small in the same ethereal vista. My favorite among his many idiosyncrasies is the thunderously expository dialogue. This is from the 2016 "Pass-Thru":
Media President: I know senior national elected government officials who I can force my political bias and influence on fellow politicians, to vote my way. For a payoff, of course.

Thgil (Breen): Isn't that corrupt?
None of this logically anticipates Breen's dire, cartoonishly violent narratives. "Pass-Thru" culminates in his darkest sequence, with Thgil -- another of the messianic aliens in which Breen specializes -- walking toward the horizon's vanishing point. The landscape is strewn with hundreds of thousands of bodies, a genocide he's issued as punishment for those who've abused Earth's precious resources.
"Fateful Findings," which I and many others consider Breen's most deranged film, exemplifies the tonal stiltedness and libertarian rage that pervades his work. The first two-thirds qualify as a drama, marked by alcoholism, painkiller addiction and unrequited love. By the time it ends there has been an abduction, murders, teleportation and a revelatory news conference that culminates in six consecutive suicides.
With each production, Breen's audience, drawn from word of mouth and social media, has grown. He began to raise interest when "I Am Here .... Now" played at West Coast theaters like the now defunct Cinefamily in West Hollywood, Calif., where it was marketed as a hilarious oddity.
For many audiences the natural response to Breen's films is laughter. He's often likened to Tommy Wiseau, whose "The Room" (2003) is considered one of the worst movies ever made, or Ed Wood, whose charmingly ramshackle genre exercises from the 1950s might be considered forerunners of Breen's work. But these comparisons are shallow. By the end of his career Wood had fallen into obscurity, directing pornography under a pseudonym. And Wiseau seems to have succumbed by self-parody. His six-episode sitcom, "The Neighbors," and his appearances in other films (like "Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance") demonstrate none of "The Room's" manic power.
Breen is still making films under the same unpretentious conditions, which is to say they're just as incoherent as ever, even if they've evolved in technical ambition. Whereas his early films favored suburban Las Vegas and the nearby desert, his 2018 cyberthriller "Twisted Pair" is replete with green-screen photography and stock footage. Breen plays a double role, twins Cale and Cade, bestowed at birth with superhuman powers and pitted against each other with potentially world-changing consequences. The action scenes -- when Cade freezes time, for instance, or leaps grasshopper-like to the upper floor of a building -- contain flashes of "The Matrix." During these sequences at a 2018 screening at the Music Box in Chicago, the crowd went berserk.
"When I used to go to see the first screenings of films like 'Double Down' and 'I Am Here .... Now,' I'd be in the back of the theater listening to the audience," Breen said in the 2014 interview. "The audience may chuckle at parts that I never intended, but in the second half of the film they sort of begin to get it."
Trevor Dillon, who's programmed Breen's work at the Frida Cinema in Santa Ana, Calif., said he thought "Neil Breen is very much like 'I'm about the movies, I am a filmmaker, my movies play at 8 p.m."' Dillon added that the question "is whether or not there's a ton of self-awareness there."
"I think he's a scrappy independent filmmaker and I think he's an even better businessman," Dillon added.
Jake Isgar has programmed "Twisted Pair" and its forthcoming sequel, "Cade: The Tortured Crossing," at Alamo Drafthouse in San Francisco. "I don't ever want to call his movies midnight movies or create this other sort of distinction," he said. "Why should an independent artist who's putting his own work out there have to be ghettoized in any particular way?"
(Like me, Isgar has yet to see Breen's newest. He said Breen "was very straightforward" and declined to send a screener to preview the film. "He says, 'Well, you've seen my other movies."')
In his correspondence with theaters Breen stipulates that his movies should screen at around 7 p.m., and that showings should be limited to maintain demand. But embedded in such restrictions one may infer either a resistance to having his work pushed to the fringes, or a pretension in contextualizing it as a mainstream experience. Regardless, Breen's films continue to engage audiences worldwide.
Consider a 2019 showing of "Twisted Pair" in Paris, at Le Grand Rex, the largest movie theater in Europe. At the sold-out screening, put on by the publication Nanarland ("Nanar" is a French colloquialism that roughly translates as "so bad it's good"), the crowd "went nuts," the Nanarland co-founder Régis Brochier said. "It was really an incredible screening."
A clip posted to YouTube captures the mania: the roaring crowd spills out from both balconies. People start to stand and clap. The film they're all there to see hasn't even begun.

Ripples From a Strike Touch Fashion's World: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actors' strike could have far-reaching implications for how we watch and consume fashion.
At first it seemed impossible to imagine: No more red carpets! No more photos of movie stars and names to watch in fabulous gowns blanketing the internet. Could "Oppenheimer" and "Barbie" be the last gasp of that marketing Valhalla of fashion and film that was the modern premiere -- at least for the foreseeable future?
At least, that is, until the SAG-AFTRA actor's strike, announced July 14, is resolved. For the moment, actors, from the unknown to the most celebrated, are banned by their union from engaging in any promotional activities. That means big openings. That means magazine covers touting new movies. That means film festivals with all their associated dressing and posing opportunities. That means social media pics of them getting dressed for premieres.
And what that means for fashion, an industry that has become increasingly intertwined with the denizens of Lalaland in a mutually beneficial ecosystem of influence and outfits -- and as important, what it means for the public's understanding of fashion, much of which is received through the lens of celebrity -- is potentially enormous.
Actors sign contracts that can be worth millions, negotiated by agents and managers, to be brand ambassadors, appearing in some combination of advertisements, front rows, store openings and red carpets, dressed by stylists, generating coverage, desire and, most of all, publicity for everyone involved.
Their work may form their substance, but fashion is the grease that sends them viral (and that has bolstered their bank accounts at a time when the economics of movies are shifting -- part of the reason for the strike). Timothée Chalamet on the red carpet in Venice in a crimson Haider Ackermann halter top and Florence Pugh in a sheer pink Valentino "revenge dress" are images that put those actors and those brands at the center of social media for days.
Alison Bringé, the chief marketing officer at Launchmetrics, a data analytics and software company, wrote in an email that Margot Robbie's appearance in Schiaparelli at the film's Los Angeles premiere "generated over $ 2.1 million in media impact value in just 24 hours, which is more than half of what Schiaparelli's fall 2023 show amassed overall."
With all of that grinding to a halt, along with studio productions themselves, what happens? And who are most at risk? Actors and studios are not the only ones with a stake in this game.
At the moment, agents and talent seem to be holding their breath and swiveling their heads to see what everyone else is doing. The brands themselves are staying mum. Louis Vuitton, whose ambassadors include Jennifer Connelly, Michelle Williams and Ana de Armas, declined to comment. Versace, which works with Anne Hathaway, ditto. Prada, ditto. Gucci, ditto. Dior did not respond to requests for comment.
In theory, all fashion promotional work (as opposed to movie promotional work) can continue. Commercial appearances are not prohibited, according to the strike guidelines. And there are myriad such opportunities that have nothing to do with premieres. Recently Wimbledon turned into a catwalk of sorts for celebrities including Emma Corrin and Brad Pitt.
Much has been made of the fact that the first big red carpet victim will be the Venice Film Festival, scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 9, and the de facto start of awards season, with all the fashion fanfare that implies.
This year the films rumored to be showing star Zendaya, a Louis Vuitton ambassador (Luca Guadagnino's "Challengers"); Jessica Chastain, who works with Gucci (Michael Franco's "Memory"); Emma Stone, also a Louis Vuitton ambassador (Yorgos Lanthimos's "Poor Things"); and Penélope Cruz, who works with Chanel (Michael Mann's "Ferrari"). All of them will most likely be absent.
Yet, as it happens, early September is also New York Fashion Week, and the start of the whole fashion season. That's four weeks of potential for appearances and events.
Even more pointedly, brands themselves have increasingly tiptoed into the content arena, making short films, especially during the pandemic. What sorts of non-studio videos could they cook up? Entirely independent films are allowed under strike guidelines. YSL even has its own film production division. The studios would look selfless -- supporting talent -- and the talent would look, well, good. When given lemons. ...
Indeed, the strike may make brand relationships even more important, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet. "The first writers strike, our teams were busier than ever, because a lot of the actors had to do more promotional appearances to subsidize for any slowing in their main vocation," said Brooke Wall, the founder of the Wall Group, a talent agency for stylists that is part of the Endeavor group.
That's one way of looking at it. The issue is thornier, however, because of the morality and optics involved. Even if SAG-AFTRA members are allowed by the rules to continue their outside work, will it not seem gauche to do so? Given the glitz and champagne associated with fashion, it could seem a bit like partying while Rome burns.
Fran Drescher, the SAG-AFTRA president and face of the strike, received vociferous blowback when she attended the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda couture extravaganza/junket in Puglia, Italy, just before the strike was announced, even though a spokeswoman for the union told The Hollywood Reporter that it knew about the trip, and it was fine. Add in the fact that it is often the most boldface names in the industry who have snagged the biggest outside contracts -- exactly that layer of Hollywood that does not necessarily need work during a stoppage -- and the situation gets even more complicated.
On the other hand, there is a whole substratum of talent who are not at the negotiating table and yet are seriously affected by the red carpet suspension: the stylists and hair and makeup artists who help create the image-making magic, and whose salaries are generally paid for by the studios, not the talent.
"There is no work!" said Kate Young, a stylist whose work focuses on Hollywood.
The end of movie promotion is a "massive issue," according to the stylist Karla Welch, who said she had had four premiere tours cut short or canceled already. "Basically any stylist who works with celebs just saw all their jobs go away," she said. "The only thing celebs' people can do are fashion jobs, and that's the few people who have celebs with brand deals."
This may be partly why there has been little noise thus far about suspending brand appearances. There is a trickle-down effect at work that is not insignificant when it comes to people's livelihoods. Still, Ms. Wall said, "this is a whole new world, so we shall see."
Indeed, there is a scenario in which the suspension of the red carpet has the unintended but far-reaching consequence of decoupling fashion and Hollywood, or at least significantly changing the balance of power. It could prove to brands that they need celluloid celebrities less than they may think, ushering in a new era of ambassadors focused on the rest of the world and talent that has nothing to do with back lots or Oscar statuettes. Really, it has already begun.

Venice Film Festival Is Expected to Be Largely Unscathed by Strikes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Movies from Bradley Cooper, Sofia Coppola and Ava DuVernay will debut at this year's event, despite the industry shutdown.
The Hollywood strikes have halted production on major movies, pushed back release dates and stopped actors appearing on red carpets. But on Tuesday, the organizers of the Venice Film Festival said this year's event would be relatively unscathed by the turmoil, and announced a star-studded lineup.
Alberto Barbera, the festival's artistic director, said in a news conference that the impact of the strike was "modest," despite the loss of Venice's planned opener, Luca Guadagnino's "Challengers," a tennis drama starring Zendaya. Last week, MGM pushed the movie's release date to next year in light of the actors' union strike.
Otherwise, Barbera said, the planned lineup for the event, scheduled to run Aug. 30 to Sep. 9, was unchanged. Bradley Cooper's "Maestro," a drama about the composer Leonard Bernstein, and Sofia Coppola's "Priscilla," about Elvis Presley's wife, will be among the 23 movies competing for the Golden Lion, the festival's main prize.
They will compete alongside Ava DuVernay's "Origin," inspired by the nonfiction book "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents"; Yorgos Lanthimos's "Poor Things," a sci-fi film featuring Emma Stone; Michael Mann's motor racing drama "Ferrari," which stars Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz; and David Fincher's "The Killer," about a conflicted assassin, starring Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton.
How many American stars will appear on the red carpet, though, is unclear. Under the terms of the actors' strike, union members are prohibited from doing promotional work including interviews, photo calls and attending premieres. On Tuesday, Barbera said "a few stars will not be with us," but added that he hoped to welcome many actors on the red carpet who had worked in independent films showing at the festival.
SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, allows independent films to secure interim agreements, exempting them from the ban on promotional work. These movies cannot have ties to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which is locked in negotiations with the guild over issues including actor pay and protections.
A host of other major movies are slated to appear at Venice out of competition. Those include Richard Linklater's "Hit Man," about an assassin; Harmony Korine's "Aggro Dr1ft," featuring the rapper Travis Scott; and Wes Anderson's 40-minute film "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar."
The festival will also premiere Woody Allen's French-language "Coup de Chance," and Roman Polanski's dark comedy "The Palace." These selections illustrate continental Europe and Hollywood's differing recent approaches to work by filmmakers accused of sexual assault.
Allen's movies have faced a backlash in North America since the #MeToo movement brought renewed attention to Dylan Farrow's allegations of sexual abuse against the director. In 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled Polanski from its membership, because he is a fugitive from the United States, having fled the country in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for statutory rape.
The Venice Film Festival has, in recent years, gained a reputation for debuting Oscar winners. In 2016, it premiered Damien Chazelle's "La La Land," and three years later showcased Todd Phillips's "Joker." Last year, its titles included "Tár," starring Cate Blanchett, Martin McDonagh's "The Banshees of Inisherin" and Darren Aronofsky's "The Whale."

Formula 1 Tries a New Approach to Bringing More Women Into the Series: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The academy is another attempt to get women into Formula 1 in various roles, but also behind the wheel.
It has been 47 years since a woman drove in a Formula 1 Grand Prix, when Lella Lombardi of Italy finished 12th at the Austrian Grand Prix in 1976.
In 2019, the all-female W Series started in an attempt to provide a way to get women behind the wheel, but it collapsed in June without seeing a woman close to a Formula 1 seat.
Now, F1 Academy has filled the void, an all-female racing series started by Formula 1 in April, with 15 drivers competing in three races during seven rounds. The first six are in Europe and the last in Austin, Texas.
But the series is more than about trying to find the next woman Formula 1 driver. It is also an attempt to bring women into other positions in the sport, such as engineers and mechanics.
"The concept of F1 Academy is to create a platform where women can be nurtured to progress further up the ladder, but also to inspire the next generation and to create opportunity, not just on track, but also off it," Susie Wolff, managing director of the academy, said in an interview.
"We're not just focused on finding the next female Formula 1 driver; we want to become a movement, which actually has impactful change in the sport and increases diversity in every area."
Wolff enjoyed a healthy motorsport career. Following many successful years in karting, she raced in various categories before progressing to Formula 1 as a development driver with the Williams team in 2012.
Two years later, she became the first woman to take part in a Grand Prix weekend since Giovanna Amati in 1992 when Wolff drove in practice sessions in the British and German Grands Prix.
After founding the Dare to Be Different campaign, aimed at increasing the participation of women in motor racing, Wolff was team principal and then chief executive of the Venturi Formula E team from 2018 to 2022.
"I feel really lucky that I was a driver for 25 years," said Wolff, who is married to Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal. "So I know what all these young drivers are going through and what the challenges are because I've been there.
"Now I'm with the F1 Academy, I'm not just flying the flag saying 'I think it's possible', I know it is because I've been there. It is tough, but getting to the top of any sport is incredibly tough."
The W Series shone a spotlight on a group of young female drivers aiming to break into Formula 1. All the competitors were subsidized by the series, with the overall champion winning $ 500,000. The program has fallen apart because of financial problems.
F1 Academy is supported by Formula 1, which is providing a budget of $ 160,000 a driver. The 15 drivers must match that with their own sponsorship, with the winner promoted to Formula 3.
"Credit where credit's due, the W Series started something," Wolff said. "Was it how I would have done it? No, but they still managed to achieve a lot.
"At F1 Academy, we would be naïve not to learn from what they did well and what they got wrong," she said, referring to its business model. "But I still applaud them for trying because anyone that springs into action, and doesn't just talk about it, deserves a certain amount of respect."
There are five teams in F1 Academy run by established Formula 2 and Formula 3 teams: ART Grand Prix, Campos Racing, Rodin Carlin, MP Motorsport and Prema Racing.
Stephanie Carlin, team principal of Rodin Carlin, said the big difference between F1 Academy and W Series was the academy's focus "on redressing the balance of females in motorsport."
"It's not just the drivers, but F1 Academy is a shop window for the potential of females in all areas," Carlin, who is also deputy team principal of Rodin Carlin's Formula 2 and Formula 3 teams, said in an interview.
"A year ago, we had no female staff that were not in either P.R. or accounts, and we now have two female mechanics and a female engineer being trained up to become part of our F1 Academy team. They're here because there's been such a drive to get women into motorsport."
As for the ambition of seeing a woman Formula 1 competitor, Carlin said, "F1 Academy is a real enabler of talent, a driving force that will help produce that female star that's going to go all the way, but it's not going to be the work of a moment. It's a long process."
Chloe Grant, 17, is one of the hopefuls. She drives for the ART Grand Prix team founded by Frédéric Vasseur, the Ferrari team principal.
Grant said she felt lucky to be one of the drivers competing in the debut season.
"It's a massive step up for me," Grant, who finished ninth in last year's GB4 Championship, said in an interview. "Last year, I was learning the basics of single seaters, but I wasn't really learning that much.
"But after just a few rounds of F1 Academy, I've learned so much more this year than I ever did last year, and you can see that in my progress through my times, my pace and confidence in the car."
As with every driver in F1 Academy, the goal of reaching Formula 1 is obvious, but money remains a hurdle. To progress up the motorsport ladder, from karting to Formula 1, would likely cost around $ 7 million.
"Financially, to even get to that point, to get through F3 and F2, at the minute it is unrealistic for me," Grant said, "unless I get backing and support."
Wolff said it could be eight to 10 years before a woman drives in a Grand Prix again.
"It pains me to say that, because obviously there are a lot of young girls racing now who might be good enough," she said, "but we've got to always be realistic with our expectations. This is definitely a long-term project, and that's why it's so important Formula 1 is behind it, because we will see and reap the rewards, but it's going to take time."

Reeves Callaway, Turbocharger of Cars Up to 254 M.P.H., Dies at 75: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He turbocharged high-end vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet and others, and in 1988 a Corvette he had modified reached over 254 miles per hour, breaking a record.
Reeves Callaway, who started out driving fast cars and then focused on creating them, including one that set a speed record of 254.76 miles per hour in 1988, died on July 11 at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 75.
His company, Callaway Cars, said the cause was injuries from a fall.
Mr. Callaway and his company were well known in the world of high-performance automobiles custom-made for deep-pocketed clients. He began by modifying cars out of his garage, then established his company in Old Lyme, Conn., with the goal of challenging European manufacturers like Porsche and Ferrari, which were then making the world's fastest vehicles.
Soon the modified cars coming out of his small shop were drawing attention in motor magazines and in speed competitions. A key moment came in the mid-1980s, when Alfa Romeo, the Italian auto company, sought him out.
"They came to us," he told the Truck Show Podcast in 2021, "and they said, 'Look, could you, within one year's time, develop an Alfa twin-turbo system for us that we could use to compete against the Maserati?"'
He did, making about three dozen modified vehicles, but then Alfa Romeo lost interest in the project. Yet somehow one of those modified Alfas found its way to General Motors' Black Lake testing ground in Michigan, and soon GM was asking if Mr. Callaway could do the same thing to its Chevrolet Corvette.
"This was a huge opportunity, to become associated with Corvette," he said. "So we saluted and said, 'Yes, sir; immediately, sir; may I have another, sir?"'
The result was an unusual agreement that made Mr. Callaway's company an authorized "aftermarket tuner," as news accounts put it at the time -- customers could order a limited-edition Callaway-modified Corvette at select Chevrolet dealers, and the car would be shipped to Old Lyme and outfitted with turbochargers and other modifications. The first version, in 1987, added about $ 20,000 to the price, putting the starting price that year at about $ 51,000 (the equivalent of about $ 140,000 today).
Automobile journalists were impressed.
"The awesome power of the turbos is revealed in three ways," Brock Yates wrote in Playboy in 1989, "a faint shriek of impellers as they pump gobs of fuel into the combustion chambers, the whisk of the gauge on the dash toward maximum boost and, most vivid of all, the G-force that seems to want to compress the driver and the passenger into the luggage compartment behind the seats."
John Hicks of The Orlando Sentinel ended a 1988 review of the car by saying, "It's enjoyable to imagine standing on a street corner telling the driver of a smoked-out Euro rod that the Callaway went that-a-way."
In the podcast, Mr. Callaway said Chevrolet had estimated that demand worldwide for the Callaway Corvette would be about 25 cars. In 1988, the second year of production, The New York Times reported that output that year could reach 400 vehicles. The car, which Mr. Callaway produced through 1991, could hit speeds of more than 200 miles per hour, though it was made for driving on ordinary roads.
"People who buy these cars don't go that fast," Mr. Callaway told The Times in 1988. "What they're buying is a configuration capable of doing that. Why do people buy a 400-watt stereo when 99 percent of the time they're listening to music at much lower levels?"
In late 1988, he and his engineers tweaked the Corvette some more, taking aim at 250 miles per hour with a version of the car that they called the Sledgehammer.
"We basically decided that 250 m.p.h. was a reachable goal," Mr. Callaway told the McClatchy News Service. "But if it was to have any meaning, the car had to be docile at low speeds as well. It had to retain all the things that make a car usable on the street, such as air-conditioning."
To prove the point, his team drove the car from Connecticut to a seven-and-a-half-mile oval track in Ohio. (It got 16 miles per gallon, they said.) At the track, it hit 210 m.p.h. on its first run, 223 on its second. After more tweaking, it reached 254.76 on its third attempt, a record for a car made for normal driving. Mr. Callaway's company, in its announcement of his death, said the record stood for more than 20 years.
Ely Reeves Callaway III was born on Nov. 22, 1947, in Bryn Mawr, Pa. His father, Ely Reeves Callaway Jr., was a textile executive who in the 1980s founded the Callaway Golf Company, the maker of golf equipment; his mother, Jeanne Delaplaine (Wiler) Callaway, was a homemaker.
He grew up in the Philadelphia area and in Connecticut, where he graduated from New Canaan High School in 1966. In 1970, he earned a fine arts degree at Amherst College; for his senior project he restored a Ferrari that had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France in 1954.
Mr. Callaway, a self-taught tinkerer, started out racing dune buggies and other vehicles he had modified, having some success, including on the Formula Vee circuit. But it wasn't a lucrative profession. The Gazette-Telegraph of Colorado Springs noted in 1971 that he had spent about $ 2,000 to bring a buggy to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb that year, for the prospect of winning barely more than $ 2,000. (He won nothing; his vehicle broke down during the race.)
"I decided I couldn't earn a living as a driver," he told The Times in 1994. Instead he turned to making souped-up vehicles.
Though the Callaway Corvette was perhaps his best-known car, Mr. Callaway and his company worked on many types of cars, adapting to computerization and other new technologies and opening locations in California and Germany.
"Dad's passion for making beautifully designed and crafted machines can be seen in each and every project," his son Peter, president of the company, said in a statement.
Mr. Callaway's marriages to Dale Vosburgh, Sue Zesiger and Nicole Jones ended in divorce. In addition to his son Peter, from his marriage to Ms. Vosburgh, he is survived by a daughter from that marriage, Augusta Boone Callaway; two children from his marriage to Ms. Zesiger, Sebastian and Walker Callaway; a sister, Louise Wiler Callaway; a brother, Nicholas; and two grandchildren.
In the Truck Show Podcast, Mr. Callaway noted that he wasn't an engineer, though he'd worked with some good ones.
"I'm still the guy who loves building stuff more than anything else," he said. His philosophy? "Just put your mind to it, sit down, build stuff, learn what's wrong with it, fix it and get on with life."

Lowest-Paid Europeans Fare Worst in the Heat, Reflecting a Deep Divide: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Europe's latest heat wave has highlighted the inequities between those who can afford to shelter from the heat and those who can't.
During one of the most extreme heat waves Europe has had this summer, executives in suits dashed from cabs into Milan's air-conditioned offices, while tourists sipped mimosas under clouds of cooling vapor in the Bar at Ralph Lauren. Lowered blinds behind iron balconies signaled that residents had departed for their vacation homes.
Below the darkened windows, delivery riders cycled under the sun to shuttle sushi and poke bowls to office buildings. Elsewhere in Milan, on the airport's incendiary tarmac, baggage handlers drenched in sweat unloaded luggage from planes. And along the highway that connects Milan to the seaside, laborers wore safety vests on bare, sunburned chests as they lugged buckets of concrete in the scorching heat.
Temperatures in southern Europe have climbed past 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 Fahrenheit, with higher figures expected on Wednesday. While everyone was feeling the scorching weather, the heat wave has also highlighted a deep divide -- between those who can afford to shelter from it, and those who cannot.
The extreme weather events that have become more common and intense under climate change have exposed, just as the coronavirus pandemic did, the increased dangers faced by the sick, the old and the poorer, with often-overlooked workers the most at risk.
Last week, a street worker collapsed as he was working at a site near Milan and later died in a hospital. In the outskirts of Florence, a cleaner collapsed in a warehouse and died shortly after. Both deaths are still under investigation to determine the cause, but they have revived worries about the lethality of the current heat wave.
Heat waves across Europe killed more than 61,000 people last summer, according to a recent study. While a breakdown on deaths was not available for last year, experts said that in a 2003 heat wave that killed up to 70,000 people, most who died were low-income.
"Most of the time, you have headaches because of the heat," Naveed Khan, 39, a food delivery cyclist, said before he dove into the Milan traffic. He takes painkillers every other day, he said, to handle the discomfort, but can't stop working. "I don't have any other job," he said.
Mr. Khan, 39, has a wife and two children who rely on him. "If you have a proper job, you can take a break in the heat," he said. "If I take a break, what will they eat?"
According to several studies, the workers that are most exposed to heat and sunlight are the most vulnerable.
"Heat waves don't affect everybody in the same way," said Claudia Narocki, a sociologist who wrote a 2021 report on the impact of heat waves on workers for the European Trade Union Institute, a research institute. "Paradoxically, the most exposed jobs are paid the worst."
Immigrants, self-employed workers and those paid piecemeal are most at risk for dehydration and overexposure to heat, the report from the European Trade Union Institute noted, though few realize how many people are at risk.
"Last year the debate was on what the temperature should be in air-conditioned offices," Ms. Narocki said. "But there is a whole world outside the air-conditioned places."
That was on full display in Milan, where the maitre d' at the Ralph Lauren bar said many regulars had gone on vacation, and cold gusts of air blowing out of luxury stores briefly refreshed those who could not afford to take a break.
The luxury carmaker Lexus was planning a carwash-themed event to promote a new SUV in Palazzo Bovara in Milan's city center, billing it as a "regenerating" space for guests to "relax and evade the city's summer heat."
Not so for those who had to stitch a massive plastic tarp to a scaffolding for the event under the 2 p.m. sun. Workers dripped with sweat as they balanced on metal ladders outside the palazzo.
"It's lethal," said Marco Croci, who managed the construction effort. "But we have to do it. It's an event, and the event will happen anyway."
Simon N'doli works washing cars, via an app that lets customers hire a washer wherever they want. On Sunday, in heat that reached 94 Fahrenheit, he could be found wiping down a white Tesla parked in blazing sun, in front of a bistro. Mr. N'doli had called the owner to ask that the car be moved into the shade, but was told the owner had already left for the gym.
"Sometimes you wonder -- it's not normal that you work in this kind of situation," said Mr. N'doli, 40. "That maybe you deserve better."
He said he had worked every day but one in the past month. Sometimes, his whole body ached when he returned home after bending around cars in the heat. The disparities nagged at him, he said.
"Why are there people who are in offices right now?" he asked, looking at the tall buildings around him. "There is some inequality, some injustice."
When the car's owner returned, he asked Mr. N'doli to put a "premium" product on his tires. Mr. N'doli started wiping again.
The recent deaths of the two workers set off scrutiny over whether they could have been prevented. Unions said that companies should pause business if the heat becomes too dangerous, and that they must provide workers water and a fresh place to rest.
Italian health officials recommended that workers take frequent breaks, and that shifts be moved to parts of the day when the heat is less intense.
In the winemaking region of Franciacorta east of Milan, workers in one vineyard have adopted a modified schedule, from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., to avoid the hottest hours.
In one afternoon, as temperatures hit 104, Krenar Osmani's T-shirt was glued to his body with sweat as he pruned the vines that yield sparkling wine.
"You take some leaves, but not too many, so as not to burn the grapes," he said as the sun hit his dark-red neck and forearms. "After a while, the grapes burn in this sun."
For many in lower-paying jobs, it is hard to find relief even when the workday is over.
"Can't afford an A.C.," said Salvatore Raccuià, 55, a steelworker, as he sat in the shade of a cafe near his home in Milan's Giambellino neighborhood. Many of the public apartment buildings there are decades-old, and residents liken them to "furnaces" in the summer. One retired freight handler said he coped by filling his bathtub with ice-cold water.
For one resident, the biggest concern was that he soon may not have any shelter from the heat.
Alin Andronache, who is unemployed, recently received a letter from the housing authority, saying he must leave the apartment he and his wife live in because they had illegally occupied it. Mr. Andronache, 48, who has diabetes and a heart condition, spent the past few scorching days packing up his clothes, expecting a visit soon by the police.
"What will happen to us on the street with this heat?" asked his wife, Irina Nicolae, who worried about her husband's health.
"What happens if a person dies?"

Naveed Khan, 39, right, a deliveryman, said he must keep working in the heat to help his family. "If I take a break, what will they eat?"

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe you've heard there's a Barbie movie coming out?
Well, this isn't about that. It is, however, about the 11½ inches of intellectual property that inspired all the madness: the doll itself.
You know the one. Often blond, always smiling, occasionally naked and neglected at the bottom of a toy chest? Chances are you do: According to Mattel, more than 100 dolls are sold every minute, and quite a few minutes have elapsed since Barbie made her debut, at a toy industry trade show, in 1959.
Just as remarkable as the ways the doll has changed since then are the ways it hasn't. Like the characters on "Sesame Street" or "South Park," Barbie exists alongside us without quite aging with us -- reflecting our times, but not our wrinkles.
That adaptive consistency may play a role in maintaining her cultural ubiquity (alongside her literal ubiquity), for while the things that make Barbie Barbie may get a face lift every few years, the DNA remains unchanged.
From her hair to her feet, her portfolio of properties to her fleet of automobiles, practically everything in Barbie's tiny plastic world bears her unmistakable signature. How? It's all about the visuals.
Turns Out, It Doesn't Grow Back
Since Barbie first hit the market, rocking a ponytail and curly micro-bangs, her hair has undergone countless changes, from her feathery bouffants and bobs of the 1960s to her "flip" styles of the '70s. Today, you can find Barbies with different updos, highlights, Afros and a range of hair textures. If a hairstyle has been in vogue, there's a good chance that Barbie has at least tried it.
Obsession with the doll's hair reached a peak in 1992, the year Mattel released Totally Hair Barbie, whose 11.5 inches of crimped hair fell down to her toes. According to Mattel, it remains the best-selling Barbie in history.
But for all the variety in Barbie's hair over the decades, nothing came close to the at-home customization children would give to their dolls. There exists a venerable tradition of cutting it with a pair of scissors, often leaving her ends frayed and uneven. Some children would apply paint or Kool-Aid to her tresses -- a de facto form of hair dye -- or dip them in hot water in an attempt to form curls. Plenty of people can say they first learned how to braid or make a ponytail using their Barbie dolls as practice.
Of course, there were many others who accepted her hair as is. But in a society with beauty standards that historically haven't been kind to those without blond, straight or thick hair, transforming Barbie's hair in their own image was one way children could really make the doll their own.

Living Life on Tiptoe
One needs only to see a perfectly pointed foot, positioned to fit neatly into a high heel, to know it belongs to Barbie. The doll's feet spawned an Instagram trend in 2018, and in the first shot of the trailer for the coming "Barbie" movie, Margot Robbie steps out of a pair of pompommed stilettoes onto the ball of her foot, her heel still suspended in air. It's a look as glamorous as it is unnatural; while promoting the film, Ms. Robbie explained that to get the shot, she had to hold on to a bar to keep her balance.
Though a Barbie from the 1970s could wear flats as well as heels, Barbies who could wear flats didn't become mainstream until 2015, when Mattel released a line of dolls with ankles that could be manipulated to fit into flat shoes. Some saw it as a sign that Barbie was modernizing, moving away from outdated standards of femininity.
Although Barbie's feet have stood for years as a sort of visual shorthand for the doll itself, Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatric surgeon, said that if Barbie were human, she would be wise to get checked out for equinus, a chronic condition that often results from tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon, sometimes because of long-term stiletto use.
Even with the risks, Dr. Parthasarathy doesn't think women need to retire their high heels for good. Still, she cautioned, "we don't want too many people wearing high heels all the time, because women should also be comfortable."

Proportional Misrepresentation
Is there anything more symbolic of all that is surreal about Barbie -- the way the doll gave young women a twisted idea of the perfect body, the way she represented female reality distorted by male fantasy (she was based on a German doll meant to be enjoyed at bachelor parties) -- than her measurements? Her pneumatic bosom, teeny waist, blossoming hips and endless legs are just the most obvious distortions. The more you look into her proportions, the clearer it becomes that she is unlike anything ever made in nature -- even Margot Robbie.
Indeed, there have been various efforts to scale her up to adult size, simply to reveal the impossibility of her body shape, which originally clocked in at about 39-18-33. In a 1995 article in The International Journal of Eating Disorders, researchers calculated that to attain Barbie proportions, a healthy adult woman would have to "increase 24 inches in height, 5 inches in the chest and 3.2 inches in neck length, while decreasing 6 inches in the waist." Ten years ago, Rehabs.com issued a report that examined Barbie's effect on young girls' body image, noting that the odds of finding someone with the doll's chest-to-waist ratio were in the billions. The neck of a life-size Barbie would be too thin to support her head, and her torso would have room for only half a liver.
Barbie got a new body in 1998 -- slightly wider waist, smaller chest and hips. By 2016 Mattel had caved to pressure and offered petite, tall and curvy Barbies. But despite all the supposedly more realistic options, impossible Barbie remains the standard Barbie for many. When it comes to the psychology of our physiology, she defies not just nature, but reason and expectations.

The Original Boy Toy
Barbie's ultimate accessory is her man. Since Mattel's introduction of the Ken doll in 1961, Barbie's boyfriend has entered the public imagination as a benevolent himbo, a chisel-jawed foil to her dynamism and curves. Their relationship is sexless (neither has genitals) but supportive: In early promotional images, Barbie occupies the foreground while Ken stands behind her to carry a bag or offer her a flower.
Ken arrived two years after Barbie, a literal afterthought. The original doll was a slim blond who wore skimpy red swim trunks. He beefed up as he tried on the styles of each decade: In the 1970s, there was Sport & Shave Ken, who had bulging forearms and a 5 o'clock shadow. By the 1990s, Ken had a Harley.
His image has been lightly complicated over time. Earring Magic Ken, released in 1993, became a cult item among gay men thanks to his pierced ear. In 2017, amid flagging sales, Mattel released a suite of Kens of different races, body shapes and hairdos (one had a man bun). Ken was no longer a monolith, Caity Weaver wrote in GQ: "He can be complicated, mysterious -- maybe even vegan."
Depending on whom you ask, Ken may be the epitome of emasculation, an all-American sex symbol, a feminist fantasy or a gay icon. He is all of this while still being secondary to Barbie. "She's everything," the poster for the "Barbie" movie reads. "He's just Ken."
-- Callie Holtermann
Not Too Shabby for a Bachelorette Pad
It has taken many architectural forms over the decades, from a three-story townhouse with groovy Verner Panton-style furniture introduced in 1974 to a pink mansion with a balcony and a turret released in 1995, but one aspect of the Barbie Dreamhouse has remained consistent: its lone occupant.
"Even when she has a huge suburban mansion, she has a single bed," said Whitney Mallett, an editor, with Felix Burrichter, of "Barbie Dreamhouse: An Architectural Survey." "Ken does not live there. It's Barbie's house, Barbie's world."
The Dreamhouse has long functioned as both a design lab -- reflecting the changing American interior at a sort of time lag (recent versions have eco-conscious additions like recycling bins) -- and a playground for female self-invention. The first version, a foldout ranch home introduced in 1962, included a bed, a sofa and a stereo console but no kitchen. It was a signal -- radical for its time -- that Barbie's life would not be centered on family or domestic labor but rather on hosting friends and pursuing a career (or, in Barbie's case, many, many careers).
Around 1990, Dreamhouses were supersized, and the elevators, spiral staircases, two-story slides and other over-the-top décor suggested affluence in Barbie's fictional life -- as did her Malibu, Calif., address. "The luxurious expansion of the Barbie Dreamhouse tracks economic expansion in the United States and conspicuous consumption," said Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, curator of contemporary design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.
As for the play set itself, it was made first out of cardboard and then out of molded plastic, inexpensive materials seemingly at odds with the fantasy interiors. But the contradiction makes sense, considering the mass-market nature of Barbie herself: The doll who has everything, at least materially, can be had for $ 5.97 at Walmart.
-- Steven Kurutz
A Clotheshorse With Room to Gallop
Barbie made her entrance into the world in a knit, black-and-white-striped, strapless one-piece swimsuit, but even back then she had other outfits -- 22 of them, in fact. Over the years, she acquired clothes almost as quickly as she was acquired; Mattel estimates that by this point, over one billion outfits have been made for Barbie and her clan, using over 105 million yards of fabric.
Her wardrobe has been a mirror held up to our most identifiable trends over the decades -- a sleeveless blouse and a pencil skirt in the '60s, a bandanna print halter-neck maxi dress in the '70s, an aerobics-ready purple leotard and matching leg warmers in the '80s -- and to our sense of self. Barbie always dressed the parts we allowed ourselves to imagine, from debutante to doctor. Her outfits helped keep her relevant.
Little wonder fashion loves her. Dozens of designers have done special Barbie collaborations, starting with Oscar de la Renta in 1985. There have been Bob Mackie Barbie (1990, in gold paillettes and white marabou stole), Dior Barbie (1997, complete with throwback New Look jacket and skirt), Diane von Furstenberg Barbie (2006, wearing a signature pink-and-white wrap dress and toting a wheelie bag) and Moschino Barbie (in 2015, with faux leather outfit), to name a few.
In 2009, for Barbie's 50th birthday, 50 designers created life-size Barbie-inspired looks for a special runway show at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, Barbie was given the Board of Directors' Tribute by the Council of Fashion Designers of America -- an award that had previously been bestowed on Michelle Obama and Gloria Steinem. Why? Well, Barbie may not be us, but her wardrobe is.
-- Vanessa Friedman
Tickled a Very Specific Pink
Though she is now synonymous with a pink so distinctive that she has co-opted the Pantone swatch 219 C, Barbie made her 1959 debut in monochrome. With just a pop of crimson on her lips, Barbie's black-and-white striped bathing suit provided a neutral springboard that begged to be swapped out for one of 22 other looks (sold separately) in a classic palette of mostly navy, black and red.
Still, there was a hint of the pink to come in a few pieces from Barbie's debut collection: notably, the "Nighty Negligee" dressing gown and the regrettably named "Plantation Belle" ensemble, which featured a flirty pink tea-length frock and matching straw purse. Those particular pinks were a far cry from neon, more reflective of the soigné shades immortalized in the "Think Pink" sequence from the 1957 film "Funny Face." "That candy pink totally suited the moment," said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute.
But the moment changes. The collector and author Bradley Justice cites the late '60s as the time when the relative restraint of Barbie's wardrobe gave way to the pop influence of Mod. Fluorescent colors increasingly came into play in the '70s. Kim Culmone, Mattel's head of design for Barbie, points to the boa-draped Superstar Barbie in 1977 as the first moment the doll "went full-on pink."
The dawn of the '80s ushered in a taste for all things brighter and bolder, and with it, Barbie's signature color. In 2011, Mattel and the industry color authority Pantone teamed up on a Barbie doll swathed in 219 C, a shade already available to the public, and the association stuck. The color is a rich, turbocharged pink that telegraphs the potency and staying power of Barbie not just as a toy but as a global brand.
-- Jeremy Allen
Top Down, Wind in Her Stitched-In Hair
Barbie's taste for the finer things extends well beyond fashion. Her car collection -- sports cars, Jeeps, even a camper -- as well as the various shades of pink that it comes in, is proof.
Her first car, introduced in 1962, was an Austin-Healey 3000 Mark II. The British sports car came in a variety of colors -- most indelibly, a faded light orange with aqua seats, a silver steering wheel and dashboard, whitewall tires and silver hubcaps. It was perhaps sleeker than later Barbie rides, and her signature car -- all-American this time -- was yet to come.
In 1976, the Star 'Vette, as Barbie's Chevrolet Corvette was called, became an immediate touchstone of the doll's image and an enduring staple of her car collection. The toy sports car came in metallic shades of hot pink and purple with shooting star decals on the hood and either of its two doors. Her luggage also came attached to the top of the trunk. Barbie was on the move.
A label on the original packaging called the micro-Corvette a "dream machine for Barbie doll and her friends."
The Star 'Vette has made an appearance in every decade since. Barbie's garage would later grow to include a Ferrari 328 GTS, a Porsche 911 Cabriolet and, in 2000, a Volkswagen New Beetle.
With the top down and room for a passenger friend, Barbie's image took on another meaning, showing girls that the freedom of the road was theirs to enjoy, too.
-- Frank Rojas
A Closet's Worth of Choking Hazards
The designer Michael Kors once called accessories the exclamation point of an outfit. When it comes to Barbie, her accessories also became, for countless parents of Barbie-loving children, the exclamation point at the end of "Ouch!" -- as in "Ouch! I just stepped on a tiny stiletto!"
Household annoyances aside -- dogs eating her handbags, vacuums sucking up her cat-eye sunglasses -- a Barbie is largely defined by her accessories. Once upon a time, these accessories were fashion-forward and valuable collectibles. In the 1960s, a doll-size fur stole made of real mink was sold at Sears for $ 9.99 -- the equivalent of almost $ 100 today.
But as Barbie collected more occupations and hobbies, her accessories became more like identity totems. Today, Music Producer Barbie carries a sound mixing board and wears over-the-ear headphones. Teacher Barbie comes with a blackboard and thick-framed glasses. Fashion Designer Barbie wears statement necklaces and a sewing tape measure around her neck. Where would Surfer Skipper or Surfer Ken be without their accompanying surfboards? At the bottom of the toy box, waiting to be given -- via accessory -- a purpose.
-- Jessica Testa
Dressed for Success, in Every Field Imaginable
Barbie is the ultimate career woman. Who else among us has been a fighter pilot, UNICEF ambassador, marine biologist, cupcake chef, computer engineer and aerobics instructor?
Inevitably, for someone with a résumé boasting more than 250 different occupations over six decades and diamond-hard ambition barely concealed by her fluffy exterior, Barbie's extensive toolbox has grown in line with the advances of modern women in the workplace. In the 1960s, fans could buy Barbie as a ballerina with ribboned shoes; a student teacher with notebooks and glasses; or a registered nurse with medicine, a hot water bottle and a diploma (though as the space race took off, an astronaut Barbie came with a white helmet, a silver suit and snazzy zip-up moon boots). Later on, Barbie also became a veterinarian, complete with a white jacket, plastic cats and dogs, and a stethoscope; an Olympic swimmer with goggles and medals; and an entrepreneur, armed with an iPhone and a tablet displaying a rather promising-looking bar chart.
In recent years, Barbie, who has never had children, has focused on building a career in STEM (the acronym used for science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- all fields in which women are underrepresented). Now, Barbie comes as a science researcher, a robotics engineer and a software developer, with free coding classes for those who buy those dolls.
-- Elizabeth Paton
'Undress Me Everywhere'
To play with Barbie is to take her clothes off. It's all right there in the Aqua song: "You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere." And you can undress her everywhere: Her pelvis is smooth plastic, devoid of anything remotely clinical or anatomically correct. After all, despite what Greta Gerwig's film would have you believe, she is not a human woman.
Still, that distinction hasn't stopped Barbie's nether region from stirring up some controversy. In the mid-1990s, Mattel released Teacher Barbie, an educator doll that sported a skater dress covered in numbers and apples and that came with her own blackboard. Teacher Barbie, like many a Barbie doll, was issued without any underwear. (If you want to get technical, her pelvic area was lightly textured to represent underwear, according to a report from The Journal Times of Racine, Wis.) Moral outrage ensued, and the doll was ultimately reissued with cloth underwear. "They keep forgetting it's a child's toy, and when we put our adult eyes on it, we see things kids don't think of," a spokeswoman for Mattel told the newspaper.
Strangely, there was no such hand-wringing over whether Elizabethan Queen Barbie, issued the same year as Teacher Barbie, needed a set of panties.

Verstappen Didn't Lead Every Lap, but He Did Win His 5th Straight: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He might oversleep one Sunday. He might take his Red Bull racecar to the mall and forget where he parked it. Or lose the keys. He might run into the worst run of bad luck in Formula 1 history.
Barring those possibilities, however, Max Verstappen now seems a safe bet to win his third straight Formula 1 title sometime this year. He inched ever closer on Sunday at the Austrian Grand Prix with his fifth straight Formula 1 victory, the final cherry on top of a dominant weekend in which he was fastest in practice, fastest in qualifying, first in the sprint race and first on Sunday.
Sunday's victory in Spielberg, Austria, was Verstappen's seventh in nine races this year -- he was second to his teammate in the other two. It was marred only by the end of his streak of laps led. Entering Sunday, Verstappen had led every race run in Formula 1 since the May 7 race in Miami Gardens, Fla. But the streak ended at 249 laps when he exited his first pit stop on Sunday in third place, behind the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz.
It hardly mattered: Verstappen passed Sainz and then Leclerc in short order, and promptly started a new streak. It has been that kind of year. Verstappen wins. Everyone else, it seems, is now racing for second.
Best of the Rest
Leclerc was second for Ferrari, a heartening sign for a team whose midseason improvements are bearing fruit. And Sergio Pérez was smiling after a great weekend in Austria: He was second to Verstappen in Saturday's sprint race and third on Sunday, returning to the podium on a day he had started 15th.
"It's been a bit of a rough stretch for me," Pérez said, underplaying a run of weeks of frustrating performances. "Now hopefully we are back."
The Race in Photos
Talking Point: Track Limits
One driver after another was penalized on Sunday for violations of what are called track limits: Essentially, they repeatedly went outside the white lines that mark the edge of the racing surface of the track. It got so bad at one point that drivers who had been penalized began snitching on the cars in front of them, telling their teams to report rivals who had gone off the track.
After the checkered flag, Aston Martin filed a protest that produced time penalties for eight drivers. The result reshuffled the order of finish -- and the points standings -- hours after race had ended.
The top three finishers were unaffected, but the changes scrambled the top 10. Carlos Sainz of Ferrari dropped to sixth from fourth, and Lando Norris of McLaren (to fourth) and Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin (to fifth) each rose one place.
Aston Martin's second driver, Lance Stroll, also benefited from the new penalties: He had finished 10th but jumped to ninth, swapping places with Pierre Gasly of Alpine.
A spokesman for auto racing's governing body told reporters that the federation had received more than 1,200 complaints during the 71-lap race about drivers who had possibly breached the track limits. Reviewing all of them took hours, and left the final results -- and the points standings -- uncertain long after the race had ended.
"Due to the specifics of the circuit layout and the propensity of many drivers to repeatedly drive outside of the boundaries of the track, an unprecedented situation arose which resulted in all potential infringements not being able to be reviewed during the race," the spokesman said.
Track limits had been a talking point all weekend after dozens of laps were erased in qualifying on Friday. Those penalties had sent a handful of drivers -- notably Pérez -- far down the starting grid.
"People will say, 'You should have kept the car in the white lines,"' Verstappen said Friday, when he was among the drivers who lost a fast lap in qualifying. "If it was that easy, you can take my car and try it."
But as the protest proved, track limits taketh, and track limits giveth, too.
Pérez finished third Sunday in part because Sainz had been penalized five seconds during the race. After it ended, Sainz lost even more time, and two places.
Show of Force
How confident was Verstappen on Sunday? With two laps left and a 24-second lead, he persuaded his team to let him pit for fresh tires so he could try to post the day's fastest lap and claim the extra point in the drivers' standings that comes with it.
How good is he? It worked.
It was a risky play: A pit stop at Red Bull Ring costs a driver about 20 seconds, and the Ferraris were looming, ready to steal the win, if anything went wrong. But nothing is going wrong for Verstappen and Red Bull these days.
What They're Saying
"Great day. I enjoyed it a lot." -- Verstappen, every week.
"Lewis, the car is bad. Please drive it." -- Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, trying to calm Lewis Hamilton's complaints and focus him on the task at hand.
"I think Friday and today we have maximized what we have, really. It's good to be back on the podium." -- Leclerc, who stood on it for only the second time this season.
Drivers' Championship Standings
Verstappen's victory and his cheeky push for the fast lap's bonus point pushed him 81 points clear of Pérez at the top of the standings.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The gruff appeal of Harrison Ford, both de-aged and properly weathered, is the main draw in this generally silly entry in the long-running franchise.
What makes Indy run? For years, the obvious answer was Steven Spielberg, who, starting in 1981 with "Raiders of the Lost Ark," guided Harrison Ford's hunky anthropologist, Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr., in and out of gnarly escapades and ripped shirts in four box-office behemoths. By the time Spielberg directed Ford in their last outing, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008), Indy was in his late 50s and fans were speculating that the character was immortal, even if the franchise itself had begun running on fumes.
As a longtime big Hollywood star and hitmaker, Ford had already achieved an immortality of a kind. Indy-ologists, though, were more focused on the eternal life that Indy might have been granted by the Holy Grail when he takes a healthy swig from it in his third outing, "The Last Crusade" (1989). It's pretty clear from his newest venture, the overstuffed if not entirely charmless "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," that while Indy may not in fact be immortal, the brain trust overseeing this installment wishes he were. They haven't simply brought the character back for another go, they have also given him a digital face-lift.
The face-lift is as weird and distracting as this kind of digital plastic surgery tends to be, though your mileage will vary as will your philosophical objections to the idea that Ford needed to be de-aged to draw an audience, even for a 42-year-old franchise that's now older than most North American moviegoers. The results don't have the spooky emptiness of uncanny-valley faces. That said, the altered Indy is cognitively dissonant; I kept wondering what they'd done to -- or perhaps with -- Ford. It turns out that when he wasn't getting body doubled, he was on set hitting his marks before his face was sent out to be digitally refreshed.
The guy you're familiar with eventually appears -- with wrinkles and gray hair, though without a shirt or pants, huzzah -- but first you need to get past the prolonged opener, which plays like a franchise highlight reel. These nods to the past are unsurprising for a series steeped in nostalgia. "Raiders" was created by Spielberg's pal, George Lucas, who saw it as a homage to the serials that he'd loved as a kid. Lucas envisioned a hero along the lines of Humphrey Bogart in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," but with morals (more or less), while Spielberg was interested in making a Bond-style film without the hardware and gimmicks.
As soon as the younger Indy appears in "Dial of Destiny," it's clear that the nostalgic love for old Hollywood that defined and shaped the original film has been supplanted by an equally powerful nostalgia for the series itself. That helps explain why this movie finds Indy once again battling Nazis, who make conveniently disposable villains for a movie banking on international sales. After directing "Schindler's List" (1993), Spielberg expressed reluctance to make Nazis "Saturday-matinee villains," as he once put it. The team here, by contrast, knows no such hesitation, even if evoking Spielberg's films inevitably raises comparisons that do no one any favors, particularly the franchise's new director, James Mangold.
The movie opens in 1944 with Indy -- wearing an enemy uniform as he did in "Raiders" -- being held captive, a sack coyly obscuring his head while Nazi hordes scurry about. Once the sack comes off -- ta-da! -- the plot thickens with a mysterious antique (à la "Raiders"), nods to the Führer, the introduction of an Indy colleague (Toby Jones) and dastardly doings from a fanatic (Mads Mikkelsen, whose face has been similarly ironed out). There's an explosion, a sprint to freedom, a zipping car, a zooming motorcycle (as in "The Last Crusade") and a dash atop a moving train (ditto), a busy pileup that Mangold finesses with spatial coherency.
Things improve once the story cuts to 1969 and Ford and his beautiful, lived-in, expressively alive face make their entrance, with Indy staggering awake wearing just boxer shorts, an intro that elicits chuckles, admiration and bittersweet feelings because Ford's years are etched into every crease. After some more preliminaries, Indy finds his usual fast-paced groove with familiar friends, foes, narrative beats and action-flick clichés, including a gal pal, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge, from "Fleabag"), who's an ethically challenged wisenheimer. The script -- by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and Mangold -- keeps playing the greatest hits, at times nearly blow-for-blow, kiss-for-kiss.

The story turns on the treasure, a prize that dates back several thousand years and, like time, just keeps slipping away. Pressed to retrieve it, Indy suits up -- fedora, bullwhip, leather jacket, check, check and check -- and he and Helena race around the globe chasing it while trading banter and, by turns, evading and fighting villains. For some reason, a grizzled Antonio Banderas pops in as a boat captain. At another point, Indy et al. land in Tangier, a setting that evokes "Raiders" and, uncomfortably, the scene in which Indy shoots a sword-wielding Arab, a death that Spielberg played for laughs and that distills that film's breezy colonialist mind-set.
"Dial of Destiny" avoids such missteps simply by taking aim at Nazis. Indy and company still embark on breakneck chases in putatively exotic locations -- including on tippy three-wheelers that careen through Tangier -- but with less obvious collateral damage to the locals, if not their food stalls. Like all the action sequences here, this one drags on long enough to kill the fun. Mangold can do action. He's best known for "Logan," that rare comic-book movie that achieves a just-so balance between genre familiarity and novelty; he should be better known for "Ford v Ferrari," a smart, nimble car story that underscores he can do one of the hardest things in film, which is to turn two people just talking to each other into cinema.
The Indiana Jones series was customized for mass appeal, which doesn't leave room for Mangold to do much, though at times he slows things down enough for Ford to shift rhythm. It's hard to believe this or any other installment would have worked half as well without Ford, whose gruffly appealing, unthreatening (to women, importantly) masculine persona has always felt natural and unforced. No matter how outrageous Indy's trouble, Ford's persona and outwardly effortless charm -- and his ability to drop that rakish smile for something darker, meaner, even threatening -- have kept the character tethered to the real world of feelings and consequences. Lucas and Spielberg sketched a cartoon; Ford created a character.
That character, or rather Ford, or really the two of them together are the main arguments for seeing "Dial of Destiny," which is as silly as you expect and not altogether as successful as you may hope. Among other things, it takes a while to settle down. Everything seems overly strained, at least at first, including the pacing, the story and Waller-Bridge's performance. It all improves as it continues, or maybe I just surrendered, yielding to the movie's disposable pleasures, its yearning to entertain you, Mangold's old-school classicism and, of course, Ford, who, as befits a Hollywood veteran confident enough to make a grand entrance in only his boxers, can still run away with a movie -- and run and run -- without breaking a sweat.

Verstappen, Leader of 224 Straight Laps, Wins 4th in a Row: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe beating Max Verstappen is the wrong goal now. Maybe the objective for the world's (second-best) drivers needs to pivot to something more modest, more achievable, in the short term.
Maybe, just maybe, if everything goes right and the car is fast and the nerves hold, another Formula 1 driver will find a way to lead a lap.
Just one would now qualify as a moment worthy of celebration.
Verstappen won yet another Formula 1 race on Sunday, finishing comfortably ahead of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. It was Verstappen's third straight wire-to-wire victory, his fourth win in a row and his sixth win in eight races this season. (He was second in the other two.)
What might be more impressive, though, is the sheer dominance he has shown in recent weeks. Verstappen, the two-time world champion and the fastest car on the grid all season, now has led every lap run in Formula 1 since the late stages of the Miami Grand Prix on May 7 -- 224 in a row and counting.
It is the longest such streak in the series since Nigel Mansell led for 235 consecutive laps in 1992, and it has drawn the Formula 1 record of 304 -- set in 1952 by Alberto Ascari -- into view.
Can Verstappen get there? Until someone gets in front of him, even for a lap, there's no reason to think he cannot.
Red Bull by the Numbers
Verstappen's win, and a welcome strong day by his teammate Sergio Pérez, who finished sixth, made it a memorable day for Red Bull Racing. Here are some of the numbers:
4 Consecutive wins this season by Max Verstappen.
6 Verstappen's 2023 win total.
8 Wins for Red Bull, in eight races.
41 Verstappen's career victory total, which tied him for fifth with Ayrton Senna. Lewis Hamilton's record (103) is still out of reach.
100 Wins in Formula 1 by Red Bull.
224 Consecutive laps led by Verstappen this season, the fifth-longest such streak in Formula 1 history.
Sunday's Race in Photos
Silver Linings
Close finish Alonso, Hamilton and the rest of the field -- beaten again -- might be able to take heart in one statistic: Verstappen's margin of victory was only 9.57 seconds, the smallest gap of a race completed at speed all season. Maybe Verstappen eased up at the end. (Unlikely.) Maybe his rivals are seeing some good signs from the upgrades they've been making. (More likely.) But in a season when Red Bull has won every race, that shrinking margin of victory must feel like an omen.
Tough defense Alex Albon was seventh for Williams, a brave defensive performance during which he drove more than 50 laps on the same set of aging tires. It was his best finish of the season.
Salvage job Charles Leclerc (fourth) and Carlos Sainz (fifth) saved Ferrari's day on a miserable weekend that featured a grid penalty by Sainz and a diatribe by Leclerc in which he suggested on Saturday that the team was stumbling around in the dark looking for solutions on how to make up ground.
What They're Saying
"I'm very happy right now." -- Verstappen, pretty much every week.
"We hoped to challenge a bit more, but we lost a place to Lewis at the start and then battled all race. It was like 70 qualifying laps." -- Alonso, on playing catch-up all day.
"It's been a great weekend for us. We're constantly chipping away." -- Hamilton, who was loving the Mercedes upgrades entering the weekend and wound up on the podium for the second race in a row.
Drivers' Championship Standings
Verstappen's lead is now 69 points over Pérez and 78 over Alonso. Except for Hamilton, every other driver is more than 100 points behind through eight races.

As the Peso Plunges, Argentines Go Out to Feast: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Wine glasses clinked in an Art Nouveau culinary gem basking in its restored splendor. It was tasting night in the more than century-old coffeehouse turned restaurant at the old Buenos Aires zoo, as beet tartare, pan-seared squid and a perfect rib-eye floated out of the kitchen, chased by a velvety chocolate mousse.
"As you can see, we are betting hard on the opportunity of the food scene in Argentina," said Pedro Díaz Flores, on a tour of the restaurant, Águila Pabellon, that he co-owns -- the 17th food venture he has opened in Buenos Aires in the past 18 months.
In Buenos Aires, Argentina's cosmopolitan capital, a world-class culinary scene is flourishing. That would not necessarily be news if it were not for the fact that Argentina is in the middle of an extraordinary financial crisis.
Inflation is at more than 114 percent -- the fourth highest rate in the world -- and the street value of the Argentine peso has crumbled, dropping about 25 percent over a three-week period in April.
Yet it is the peso's downfall that is fueling the restaurant industry's upswing. Argentines are eager to get rid of the currency as quickly as they can, and that means the middle and upper classes are going out to eat more often -- and that restaurateurs and chefs are plunging their revenues back into new restaurants.
"Crises are opportunities," said Jorge Ferrari, a longtime restaurant owner who recently reopened a historic German eatery that had shut down during the pandemic. "There are people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are people who go toward other sorts of capital markets. This is what I know how to do."
The boom, in a way, is a facade. Everyone appears to be out having a good time. Yet, in much of the country, Argentines are scraping by and hunger is on the rise.
And in wealthier circles, the rush to go out is a symptom of a shrinking middle class that, no longer able to afford bigger purchases or travel, is choosing to live in the here and now because people do not know what tomorrow will bring -- or if their money will be worth anything.
"The consumption that you have is consumption for satisfaction -- happiness in the moment," Mr. Ferrari said.
The city of Buenos Aires, which has been trying to promote its culinary scene, has been tracking the volume of plates sold at a sample of restaurants each month since 2015. The most recent numbers, for April, show that restaurant attendance is at one of its highest levels since tracking began, and 20 percent higher than at its highest point in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began.
It is not just venerable hot spots that are thriving. In Buenos Aires, under-the-radar residential zones have suddenly become destinations for foodie influencers, which then quickly leads to new crowds of porteños, as residents of the capital city are known.
There are cocktail bars with mixology magicians, drag shows while you dine, vegan bakeries, verdant patios and fusions of global cuisines from chefs who apprenticed in kitchens all over the world. One "it" spot, Anchoita, a modern twist on Argentine fare, has no reservations available until next year.
While the devaluing currency has also drawn tourists back to Buenos Aires as the pandemic has ebbed, it is the locals who are out in full force.
The restaurant boom is a phenomenon that cuts across classes, said Santiago Manoukian, an economist at a Buenos Aires consulting firm, Ecolatina, though it is largely driven by middle- and upper-income earners, many of whom have had their earnings keep up with inflation, but have still had to adjust to the crisis.
For members of the middle class in particular, expenditures like a vacation or a car have become largely out of reach, so they are indulging in other ways.
But even lower-income gig workers, who saw their earnings shrink by 35 percent since 2017, according to data gathered by Ecolatina, are dining out before their money devalues even more, Mr. Manoukian said.
"It's a product of the distortions that the Argentine economy suffers from," he said. "You have extra pesos that are going up in smoke because of inflation, and you have to do something because you know the worst thing you can do is nothing."
In an orchard in Buenos Aires next to a tennis court, Lupe García, who owns four restaurants in the city and another just outside it, reached down and broke off what looked like a miniature watermelon but was actually a cucamelon, a fruit about the size of a blackberry.
She was surrounded by lettuce, parsley, mint, alfalfa and purple shiso leaves used for tempura in one of her restaurants. The garden, owned by Ms. García and run by agronomists from the University of Buenos Aires, reflects the changing taste of locals, which Ms. García's dining venues have helped cultivate.
She opened her latest establishment, Orno, a Neapolitan- and Detroit-style pizzeria, in February in the trendy neighborhood of Palermo.
Still, though the inflation crisis has brought more customers to restaurants, it has also added another layer of complexity to their operations.
To save on expenses, Ms. García has swapped printed menus in all of her restaurants for QR codes for websites that her team can quickly modify.
"Your provider brings you beef, and they tell you it's 20 percent more," she said, "and you have to turn around and raise all the prices."
Nevertheless, Ms. García said, the explosion of restaurant openings makes it an exciting time to be in the business, as competitors brainstorm how to creatively bring in diners.
"It's also in the DNA of porteños to go out every day," she noted. "I don't know if there are many cities where people go out as much as they do in Buenos Aires."
At a bustling new street-food strip in an alley near Buenos Aires's Chinatown, Victoria Palleros was waiting for noodles at Orei, a ramen hot spot that often sells out.
"I think the generation before us thinks more about saving, but not us," said Ms. Palleros, 29, a government worker.
Many Argentines purchase physical U.S. dollars to save, but "buying $ 100 is almost half of a young person's monthly salary," she said, adding, "And, honestly, I think you'd rather make plans like these and live well during the week, rather than live really tight every month."
Ms. Palleros would love to be able to save up to buy an apartment, she said, but that is impossible.
Mariano Vilches and Natalia Vela, a married couple who found themselves amid hordes of people at a Sunday afternoon French food fair, came to a similar conclusion about enjoying life as much as they can despite the economic hardships.
Ms. Vela, 39, an administrative assistant, said they could no longer afford to travel, but still eat out roughly three times a month. "It also satisfies a basic need," added Mr. Vilches, 43, a real estate agent. "You have to eat. You don't have to buy that coat."
As a result, places like Miramar, in the working-class neighborhood of San Cristóbal, have remained packed at lunch and dinner. The iconic eatery, with salami dangling at the entrance and pictures of tango lyricists framed on the wall, has seen its share of financial crises since its doors first opened in 1950.
But now, even as Argentina enters perhaps one of its worst economic moments, Miramar is busier than ever, said Juan Mazza, the manager.
"I don't know if it's a contradiction," he said. "The crisis is here. So with the little money that I have, I want to enjoy."

At a bustling new street-food strip in an alley near Buenos Aires’ Chinatown, Victoria Palleros was waiting for noodles at Orei, a ramen hot spot that often sells out.
“I think the generation before us thinks more about saving, but not us,” said Palleros, 29, a government worker.
Many Argentines purchase physical U.S. dollars to save, but “buying $100 is almost half of a young person’s monthly salary,” she said, adding, “And, honestly, I think you’d rather make plans like these and live well during the week, rather than live really tight every month.”
Palleros would love to be able to save up to buy an apartment, she said, but that is impossible.
Mariano Vilches and Natalia Vela, a married couple who found themselves amid hordes of people at a Sunday afternoon French food fair, came to a similar conclusion about enjoying life as much as they can despite the economic hardships.
Vela, 39, an administrative assistant, said they could no longer afford to travel, but still eat out roughly three times a month. “It also satisfies a basic need,” added Vilches, 43, a real estate agent. “You have to eat. You don’t have to buy that coat.”
As a result, places such as Miramar, in the working-class neighborhood of San Cristóbal, have remained packed at lunch and dinner. The iconic eatery, with salami dangling at the entrance and pictures of tango lyricists framed on the wall, has seen its share of financial crises since its doors first opened in 1950.
But now, even as Argentina enters perhaps one of its worst economic moments, Miramar is busier than ever, said Juan Mazza, the manager.
“I don’t know if it’s a contradiction,” he said. “The crisis is here. So with the little money that I have, I want to enjoy.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The concert had ended, and Riccardo Muti, the music director of the Chicago Symphony, was walking out of Orchestra Hall when he saw a banner in the lobby and stopped in his tracks.
"Muti Conducts the Grand Finale of the 2022-23 Season," it read. This was in May, with just a month of programs to go -- culminating in performances of Beethoven's mighty "Missa Solemnis," June 23-25, which will mark the end of Muti's 13-year directorship.
So when Muti, 81, began railing about the banner to his tiny entourage, it seemed like he must be joking: There could hardly be a grander finale to his acclaimed tenure. But it quickly became obvious that his anger was real.
"I told them not to write 'grand finale,"' he said, grimacing. "It's a finale? And then I'm back in September?"
The next morning, the offending banner was gone. His frustration was mostly silly, of course. The orchestra was just being factual in ginning up a little excitement at a climactic moment in the six-decade career of one of the most eminent figures in classical music.
But Muti had a point. Since his successor has not yet been named, he will be continuing as a kind of shadow music director next season, and possibly longer. Leaving -- yet not entirely leaving -- on a high note, with the adoration of Chicago's musicians and audiences, he has been sensitive that his farewell will seem like a grand anticlimax when he returns, just three months from now, for the fall opening concerts and a trip to Carnegie Hall.
"'He's here again,' they will say," Muti speculated in an interview. "'He's back!' It's too much."
"I don't blame him," said Helen Zell, the former chair of the orchestra's board, who endowed Muti's music director position. "Just as courting him was a big, long process, the exit is just as challenging."
Between the complicated beginning and ending, though, Muti's time in Chicago has been widely reckoned an enormous success. His performances of a broad swath of repertoire -- his signature Italian operas in concert, Beethoven symphonies, world premieres, rarities of the past, Mozart, Schubert, Bruckner, Florence Price, Philip Glass -- have been pristine yet intense, powerful yet graceful.
"He took the great Chicago Symphony Orchestra and made it even greater," Jeff Alexander, the orchestra's president, said. "The sound now is really spectacular -- in a more mellifluous, mellow, lyrical way."
His departure is about more than inevitable turnover at an important ensemble, said Pierre Audi, the stage director and impresario. It's a milestone as the generation of leaders born before the end of World War II passes -- and, with it, the old-school conception of the commanding, protecting maestro.
"Muti will leave Chicago, and that's it," Audi said. "It's the beginning of the end."
Muti was born, as he loves to tell people, in Naples and raised in Puglia. His longest-held position was nearly 20 years at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, and his most lasting affiliation has been with the Vienna Philharmonic, which names no chief conductor. (He will lead that orchestra on the 200th anniversary of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony next spring.) He is European to the core.
Yet perhaps his most triumphant stints have been with two American ensembles: Chicago and, through the 1980s, the Philadelphia Orchestra. When he arrived in Philadelphia, he was an upstart in his 30s, taking over after four decades of Eugene Ormandy.
Ormandy had built an ensemble that was thick and lush, particularly in its famous strings, and he bathed every work in a uniform butteriness: The composer served the sound. Muti aimed to reverse that dynamic, creating distinct styles for Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky -- adding a flexibility that took the group, as the violinist Barbara Govatos said, "from the Cadillac of orchestras to the Ferrari."
He surprised the still-enamored musicians when he left in the early 1990s, partly because of the difficulty balancing his work with La Scala and partly because plans for a new hall in Philadelphia were stagnating. As he focused on Milan, Muti said he had no interest in another music director position in America, with all the attendant extramusical responsibilities.
The New York Philharmonic nevertheless thought -- twice -- that it was on the verge of hiring him. Chicago ended up luckier after Daniel Barenboim announced in 2004 that he was leaving. Watching Muti conduct in Paris early the next year, Deborah Rutter, then president in Chicago, told a colleague, "If we can do it, this is the one it should be."
"There is a sort of electrical current to the energy he brings to his music-making," Rutter said recently. "And that sort of hyper-focused energy is something I would describe as being very Chicago-like."
Muti's relationship with La Scala was foundering, but he hadn't appeared with the Chicago Symphony since the 1970s. He and Rutter agreed he would come in 2006, but he canceled, which was crushing. She lured him back with dates the next fall, along with a European tour.
"I was too tired to travel, to start a new adventure," Muti said. "But when I came back here, immediately it was something that happened between me and the orchestra."
The critic Andrew Patner, describing those 2007 performances, wrote, "By the second date, the Italian maestro almost seemed like an old friend." After the tour, Muti received a box of handwritten letters from the players, a personal touch that helped seal the deal.
"There was an ecstatic reception he had when he was in Chicago, from the press and the public," said Zarin Mehta, then the president of the New York Philharmonic. "He was treated with total respect in New York, but not with the ecstatic admiration he gets in Chicago."
Barenboim had relaxed the ensemble's sound from the muscular, stentorian days of Georg Solti, but it still had a resolute Germanic style. Under Muti, the orchestra has still been able to produce, say, a Beethoven's Fifth of blistering force, but he generally wanted something more Italianate.
"I found a great orchestra," he said, "but not balanced. Everyone was speaking about the brass. The strings were a little too -- not harsh, but hard. No perfume. And the woodwinds, they had good players, but no one spoke about the woodwinds. And there is another thing: I needed them to sing."
The diet he prescribed was heavy on Schubert and, of course, opera, particularly his beloved Verdi, prepared with unsparing attention to detail. "Otello," in 2011, was ferociously dramatic; "Macbeth" (2013), a brooding march. "Falstaff" (2016) was witty, more delicate than slapstick; "Aida" (2019), coolly elegant; "Un Ballo in Maschera" (2022), meticulously sumptuous.
"The relentless thing he will not back down on is the refinement -- of line, of attack, of phrasing," said James Smelser, a hornist. "He doesn't make mistakes. There's always clarity, preparedness, consistency."
Muti has proved enthusiastic about performing in the community, including events at juvenile detention facilities. He embraced a fellowship program seeking to increase the racial diversity of the players' ranks. And after years of resisting, he even began to drop some of his complaints about appearing at endless donor events.
There were troubles. In 2019, a musicians' strike lasted nearly seven weeks; in an unusual move for a music director, Muti publicly sided with the players, and appeared with them on the picket line. During the pandemic, he agreed to stay on an extra year, but the pause in performances -- which meant a pause in appearances by potential candidates -- stalled the search for his successor.
Since relations between him and the orchestra are far warmer than they were with Barenboim at the end of his tenure -- when Bernard Haitink and Pierre Boulez agreed to take on responsibilities in the interregnum, before Muti was hired -- it makes sense for him to help fill the coming gap.
"I've worked in a few other places," said Alexander, the orchestra's president, "where it's much more common that the music director disappears, or they come back once every three or five years. Early in our discussions with Maestro Muti about the end of his term, we said we wanted to keep seeing him for a number of weeks each season, which I think he was happy to hear."
But while Muti will finish the musician hiring and tenure processes he has started, it's not yet clear who will oversee new auditions. He seems intent on maintaining some flexibility, partly in case he should want to scale back his commitment after his successor is announced: He said that he has told the orchestra's administration -- who knows how much in jest? -- "If you choose somebody that really I don't like, then I don't know if I come back."
His replacement is the least of it. It takes little prompting for Muti to bemoan a host of cultural problems: the decline in music education, players and conductors too lazy to properly prepare or respect the letter of the score, what he views as the increasing distance between classical music and mainstream society.
"Today," he said, bags heavy and dark under his eyes, "I think we are all lost."
But his melancholy melts away when he's on the podium, particularly in rehearsals that he leads with a kind of merry rigor, laughter snapping into a crisp downbeat. There was an endearing, oddball quality to the program he led near the end of May, telescoping between the intimate and the grand.
A Mozart divertimento was followed by William Kraft's raucous Timpani Concerto No. 1. After intermission came one of Respighi's lively and tender "Ancient Airs and Dances" suites, before his "Pines of Rome," a Muti party piece that also closed his first concert as music director -- in front of some 25,000 people in Millennium Park.
When you think of "Pines," you usually think of bombast. But the loudness comes very near the end; much of the piece is actually quite subtle, and the way to make the finale really potent is to handle the earlier stuff with atmospheric transparency.
Muti now stretches those earlier passages into a hazily dreamlike, almost out of time quality, building only slowly to triumph. In the first performance, a Thursday evening, the pianist treated a diaphanous cadenza with too much flamboyance; Muti, visibly displeased on the podium, took him aside later, and the following afternoon, the passage was properly light and watery. Any exaggeration turns this piece into kitsch; even the brassy conclusion, under Muti's baton, is shockingly elegant and clear.
"At the end of 'Pines of Rome,"' Smelser, the hornist, said, "most conductors are flailing around. The sheer volume, it's out of control. But he's never out of control, and he doesn't want us to be out of control."
"The orchestra knows exactly what I want," Muti said. "Many times, I don't even conduct -- or it seems that I don't conduct. It's been 13 years of wonderful musical experiences, and friendly. In 13 years, I haven't had a second of fight with them. It's been always like this."

Rain Falls, but Verstappen's Dominance Is Not Dampened: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Circuit de Monaco is one of the most iconic stops on Formula 1's schedule, but it is also one of its most treacherous. A hairpin descent. Walls close enough to kiss. A dark tunnel that ejects drivers into a burst of blinding sunlight.
And that's on a good day.
Sunday was not a good day: When rain started to fall during the Monaco Grand Prix and tires started to lose their grip, the conditions deteriorated so quickly that even the most seasoned teams might have been filled with trepidation.
But Max Verstappen is not the average driver. While others struggled, he simply sped away, claiming his fourth win of the season and the 39th of his career. It was his second win at Monaco in three years, and it extended his lead, and Red Bull's, in the season points standings.
"It was incredibly slippery," Verstappen said of managing the conditions, the first rain of the current Formula 1 season. "When you are that far in the lead you don't want to push too hard, but also you don't want to lose too much time.
"We clipped the walls a few times -- it was super difficult out there -- but that's Monaco."
Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin finished the race where he started it, in second place, and Alpine's Esteban Ocon did the same to claim a satisfying third. But neither was a serious challenger to Verstappen in a race that lasted nearly two hours as the speedy cars sometimes slowed to a crawl as drivers tried to hold their nerve.
Where the Race Turned
Rain that had been on everyone's radar for the first half of the race finally arrived around Lap 50, and that set off a frantic series of pit stops and tire changes for the leaders. The problem was that it was not raining on every sector of the track initially, so tires that were fine on dry pavement suddenly became unmanageable where it was slick.
That produced frantic scenes and different decisions. Alonso, running second, pitted twice in quick succession after his team initially put on the wrong type of tires. Ferrari called its two cars into the pit at the same time to make changes. Other drivers lost vision and then control.
The combination of tight turns, close quarters and slick tires created dozens of nervy moments. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. glided into a barrier. Kevin Magnussen lost control of his Haas but escaped serious damage. Lance Stroll was not as lucky; he was forced out of the race when his Aston Martin could not go on after a late-race mishap.
Through it all, though, Verstappen kept his calm and his team made the right calls. He emerged from the chaotic few laps right where he was where he had been when the race began, when the rain began, when the changes began: in the lead.
The Race in Photos
Best Days Ranked
Verstappen. He was masterly in his strategy and race management, even if he couldn't help himself in the late going. Leading by more than 20 seconds, he gave his team one final scare when he brushed the barriers. But on a day when so much could have gone wrong, that, too, went right for him and Red Bull. His advantage over his teammate Sergio Pérez, who started last after a crash in qualifying and crept home 16th on Sunday, grew to 39 points, and to 51 over Alonso in third.
Ocon. His third-place finish in qualifying was a surprise to some, and his podium finish may be more of one. But he and Alpine managed their car and their position well all day, and were rewarded with the team's first podium finish of the year.
Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell quietly came home fourth and fifth. And while neither was ever in contention for the lead (or, really, for the podium), Mercedes will find hope in those performances. While Monaco's tight quarters didn't offer the best laboratory to test the improvements the team rolled out last week, Mercedes will leave with points and a trove of valuable data. For a team trying to catch up to its rivals in a hurry, that's a win.
What They're Saying
"That was the real Monaco." -- Verstappen.
"Braking was extremely fragile. I think everyone did an amazing job today to keep the cars on track." -- Fernando Alonso, who has seen some things.

Storied Formula 1 Team Struggles to Keep Pace After Change at the Top: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Frédéric Vasseur knows all about pressure.
In January, he was named general manager and team principal of Ferrari, one of the most high-pressure jobs in motorsport because of the popularity of the team. But in 1996 Vasseur had started his own team, and he said there were times he had trouble making ends meet.
"I probably had more pressure when I started ASM 30 years ago," Vasseur said in an interview about the team. "Each Monday, I needed to get paid by the driver to avoid bankruptcy." (At that level of racing, drivers pay the teams.)
When Vasseur, who was the chief executive of the Sauber Group and the team principal of Alfa Romeo last year, was approached by Ferrari to replace Mattia Binotto, who resigned at the end of the season, he had to consider the pressure he knew would be placed on his family.
"I knew I wouldn't be affected or scared by it," he said. "It's just that it's more demanding, and I didn't want to expose them to it. For me it's one thing, but for my family it's another. I had to decide."
Vasseur said it took him one day to do so because of his wife, Marie Laure. "I have four children, my youngest recently turned 15, he has school, and I knew it would be a big change for him," he said.
"But my wife was more convinced than me. She said: 'What do you want? Why are you hesitating?"'
He said that Ferrari was so famous that "it's quite impossible to say no."
It has not been an easy start for Vasseur. After the team and its driver Charles Leclerc, who is from Monaco, both finished second last season in the championships, Ferrari was expected to challenge the champion team Red Bull this year.
But after five Grands Prix, Ferrari is sputtering. It has one finish on the podium and is fourth in the constructors' championship, 146 points behind Red Bull.
After about four months in charge, Vasseur has had little time to make an impression on the team or make major changes. "The main issue I have had is that I joined quite late," he said.
"Between my first day and the launch of the new car was just four weeks. You have a huge wave of things to digest."
Vasseur, who spent about six years with Sauber and Alfa Romeo, said, "If you have a look, all teams take a long time to build up something strong."
"But when we have been in a tough situation," he said about Ferrari, "the reaction of the team has been calm, trying to understand, correcting step by step, not wanting to change everything straight away."
Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said he was surprised Ferrari had failed to challenge this season. The car has been quick over one lap in qualifying, but has struggled in a Grand Prix.
"You can never write anybody off," Horner said.
His team has finished first and second four times in five Grands Prix. "It's been the best start that we've had, and we feel we've made a good step from last year's car to this year's car," he said. "It's the kind of step you would expect.
"It feels like others have lost ground. I'm sure they're working hard to address that, and big gains could come quite quickly. But it's surprised us that others have perhaps under delivered compared to where they were last year."
Vasseur, a Frenchman, has worked in motorsport for almost 30 years. After founding ASM and winning the Formula 3 Euro Series title four times from 2004 to 2007, including with Lewis Hamilton in 2005, Vasseur helped created a second successful team, ART Grand Prix, in 2004.
Vasseur helped Leclerc win the GP3 title in 2016 before mentoring his first season in Formula 1 two years later at Sauber.
Leclerc has built a strong relationship with Vasseur, which has allowed the driver to "trust him fully" now that they are working together again.
"Until now he has basically been trying to analyze the situation as quickly as he can in order to make the best changes possible for the future," Leclerc said. "The big part of his job will be done from now on.
"Obviously, I speak a lot with Fréd, and I know his middle- and long-term plans for the team, and I'm completely behind him."
But Leclerc is struggling. After crashes last season contributed to him falling out of contention for the drivers' title, he has been in three incidents this year.
He was in a first-lap collision with Lance Stroll of Aston Martin in the Australian Grand Prix and crashed in practice and qualifying for the Miami race.
Leclerc said after the qualifying session that he was "really angry" with himself and that he "should be driving at a higher level." He is 85 points behind Verstappen. After five Grands Prix last year, he led the championship by 19 points.
The question is how much time Vasseur will be given to finally end Ferrari's long wait for success. Its last constructors' title was in 2008, and its last drivers' championship was won by Kimi Raikkonen in 2007.
"It's a no-name project," Vasseur said about his plans to improve the team. "It will never be a Fréd Vasseur team.
"It will always be the Ferrari team first. It will have my touch, I will have to make some changes, and the approach will be different, but the important thing for me is to be sure we are going in the right direction."
Carlos Sainz, the team's other driver, said he also had "a very good relationship" with Vasseur, but he had found the car "very inconsistent" to drive during a Grand Prix. His best finish was fourth in the first race in Bahrain, and he is 75 points behind Verstappen.
Vasseur has acknowledged there is "a top-speed deficit" to Red Bull.
"We have compensated for 50 percent of the gap compared to Bahrain, but the advantage is still there," Vasseur said.
"We are bringing updates, but Red Bull is not sleeping either. They will improve, and very often it's much easier to improve when you are in their situation, when you have self-confidence than when you are chasing someone."
He said there was potential in the car because of Ferrari's speed in qualifying, performance Vasseur wants to unlock for the longer Grand Prix, where the team has problems with the degradation of its tires. Ferrari has qualified in the top three in all but one of the Grands Prix, but the team has not translated that into top finishes except in Azerbaijan, where Leclerc qualified first and placed third in the race.
Vasseur said Ferrari's upper management, including John Elkann, the chairman, and Benedetto Vigna, the chief executive, has not interfered with his decisions.
"I have never had the kind of relationship in the past, with the organization above me, as I have now," said Vasseur, who had been team principal of Renault and Alfa Romeo.
"I know if I need their support, they are there. On the other side, I have the freedom to manage the team in a way that I have to."
But then there are Ferrari's adoring fans to contend with. "It's the only team in the world where they are waiting for you every morning when you go to the factory and waiting in the evening when you are leaving. This is the reality.
"But somehow that's good because this gives you extra motivation."

Full text: In 2018, after 17 seasons of dedicating his life to Formula 1, Fernando Alonso had enough.
With two world titles and 32 Grand Prix victories, he walked away, albeit unfulfilled. It had been 12 years since he was crowned champion and five since he had won a race.
"When I finished, it was on a low, and I didn't want that because my performance, my competitiveness, was as high as ever back then, but people didn't see it," Alonso of Aston Martin said in an interview. "Now, I'm proving I'm still fast, at whatever age -- that's part of the comeback story. Winning the 33rd Grand Prix or fighting for a championship would add even more drama to the story."
After all, he was away from the sport for two years, 2019 and 2020, but during that time he continued to race and rediscovered the joy of winning. He became World Endurance Champion with Toyota, took the checkered flag in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and he won one of the most prestigious races in the world, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Twice.
Despite his strong start this season, it has been 10 years since Alonso, 41, last won a Grand Prix. Max Verstappen of Red Bull, the reigning two-time champion who leads this year's title race, would like to see Alonso win again.
"I think Fernando should have won a lot more races than he has done," Verstappen said. "I think he deserves a lot more. So I would be quite happy to see him win number 33. But in a way, I would also like to see him win more, so we'll see in the coming races."
Alonso returned to Formula 1 in 2021 with Alpine with moderate success, but midway through last year, his star rose after Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin, a four-time champion, announced he was retiring. Alonso, an old friend of Lawrence Stroll, the team owner, quickly agreed to a deal.
"I received a phone call from Lawrence asking if I was already committed to Alpine," Alonso said. "I said not yet. My conversations with Alpine were quite advanced, but I didn't have anything on paper.
"He said if I send you something on paper today, you will consider it. He sent it, I was happy, and as I had nothing from the other side, it was an easy decision. Everything was quicker thanks to that relationship over the years."
In an interview, Stroll said he was determined to get Alonso for several reasons. "He is clearly one of the greatest drivers to ever be in Formula 1, and his motivation has never been higher.
"When I spoke to him, he said, 'Listen, I can bring something to this team in my last few years I'm going to drive and hopefully have some sort of role within Aston Martin for many years to come after when I stop driving.' When he said that, I did not need a lot of convincing."
The agreement was built on a friendship forged when Alonso first met Stroll and his then 12-year-old son, Lance, at a go-karting event in Canada in 2011.
Lance Stroll was a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy and Alonso was in his second season of five with the team. Now they are teammates at Aston Martin.
"I wouldn't say we had a relationship back when I was 12," the younger Stroll said. "I was just a fanboy. But yeah, there's a great dynamic in the team at the moment. I definitely enjoy working alongside him. He's incredibly talented, knowledgeable, experienced and hungry to get the most out of himself every day."
Alonso said he remembered first meeting his teammate, saying it's "fun to look back on now. I also remember in my last year with Ferrari in 2014, I stayed at Lawrence's house in north Canada, after the race in Montreal. I was there training for a week.
"I've also visited Lawrence in Monaco on his yacht in the past, and we have had dinner, so we have this kind of relationship, and we have always been in contact."
Alonso said it made it easy for him and Stroll to turn their friendship into "a professional partnership."
Stroll purchased the team in 2018 when it was known as Force India, rebranding it as Racing Point. Two and a half years later, he bought a major stake in the Aston Martin car company, allowing him to return the brand to Formula 1 in 2021 after a 61-year absence.
That year, he said he expected the team to challenge for the world title in five years, helped by the construction of a new factory and wind tunnel at a cost of "over $ 250 million," he said. Staff has increased from "350 people to about 780 today."
Moving into the factory is imminent. The wind tunnel, which will allow the team to aerodynamically test a scale model of a Formula 1 car, will open next spring.
With Alonso's performance, the results are ahead of forecast with the team in second place for the constructors' title.
"When we signed that agreement last year in early August, Fernando didn't know the car was going to be as quick as this," Lawrence Stroll said. "But he did know about all the passion I've put in, the great people I've hired, the great facilities I was building, and he wanted to be a part of it. He believed."
Alonso has been surprised by how quickly he has achieved results. "I trusted the project and felt it was a nice adventure for me at the end of my career, to start with a team that has so much enthusiasm and good prospects," he said.
"But I thought it would take time to reach a certain level," he added, "that maybe in 2024 we can fight for podiums. I was not expecting the car would deliver the kind of performance we have now."
A second retirement and a role with Aston Martin beyond that are far from his thoughts. Alonso is having too much fun again. "I'm aware of my age," he said. "I know I will not be here for the next 10 years, or whatever, so maybe when I stop racing, I will be linked to the team somehow."
He is hopeful that when that day comes again, his wait for win number 33 will be over.
"Winning a championship would be a perfect thing," Alonso said. "If I win another championship all these years since my previous one, that would be unprecedented, that kind of distance between two championships. That is my goal at the moment.
"Or the legacy that I want to leave in this sport, of someone who loves it so much that I kept racing for many years, keeping the level as high as possible. That would prove a point, something that was a part of my comeback."
The team owner is unsurprised that although Alonso is in his 40s, his desire and fitness are strong.
"These guys are gladiators," Stroll said. "The conditioning he has kept himself in physically and mentally and his motivation levels are higher than ever. He's absolutely determined to win. The guy is just a big motivation ball. He's picking everybody up, saying 'Come on, we're going to win."'
Another win, another title are motivations, but he has another desire. "I want to have a family," said Alonso, who is divorced and has no children. "This is my biggest dream in life. I've still not succeeded in that because of my way of living. That's something that when I stop racing, where I will find my happiness."

It's Early Yet, but the Formula 1 Season Has Been All Red Bull, All the Time: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Formula 1 has become the Red Bull roadshow.
It has won all five Grands Prix this season, four of them one-two finishes, and has amassed 224 points from a possible 235.
"That race pace advantage, I think, is quite big at the moment," said the reigning champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, after winning the Miami Grand Prix despite starting ninth.
Red Bull has been ahead of the next-best team by at least 20 seconds at four of the races -- at the other, in Australia, the race finished behind the safety car, which bunched the field.
Red Bull's car, designated the RB19, is an evolution of its title-winning RB18, which had early-season weight and understeering issues that were fixed.
"It's the best start we've had," said Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal. "We feel we've made a good step from RB18 into RB19, the kind of step you would expect."
Verstappen, seeking a third successive title, has a 14-point lead over his teammate Sergio Peréz. He has two wins to Verstappen's three.
Verstappen is the overwhelming favorite for the championship, and Peréz is realistically his only competition. Last season, Verstappen won 15 races, Peréz two. Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, in third place, is already 44 points behind Verstappen.
Alonso said in Miami that "our main focus, to be honest, is just looking behind and trying to keep Mercedes and Ferrari in the Constructors' championship under control."
That leaves just two for the title, and Horner is confident there will be no discord between his drivers.
"I think that it's a luxury problem, first of all," Horner said on having two title-contending drivers. "I think any team principal in the pit lane would hope to have that issue.
"The key thing is to ensure that paranoia doesn't creep in, and that both drivers are treated equally. You go to pains to provide equality, to the point of who drives out the garage first each weekend, you know, it alternates. It even alternates in the debrief who talks first."
At the last race in Miami, the pair ran different tire strategies, leading to an on-track battle in which Verstappen prevailed.
"We know we are free to race," Verstappen said. "Of course, most importantly, is that we don't touch."
Peréz said they had to put the team ahead of themselves.
"We are just two drivers, but there's so many people working back home and working really hard, we have to show respect," he said.
Red Bull's advantage has been aided by its expected rivals, Mercedes and Ferrari, faltering. "I think it's surprised us that the others have perhaps under delivered compared to where they were last year," Horner said.
Mercedes, which won eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 through 2021, slumped to third in 2022. Its W13 was derailed by chronic porpoising, when the car bounces, and once that was remedied Mercedes began to extract better performance. That prompted the team to retain its design concept when developing its next car, the W14. As early as the first race in Bahrain, however, Mercedes realized the car did not perform well when pushed to its maximum.
Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, said Bahrain was one of Mercedes's "worst days in racing," adding that the W14 "lacked pace front, right and center" after it was almost one second per lap slower than Red Bull. In Miami, Wolff described the W14 as "poisonous" given its inconsistency.
The team then brought back its former technical director, James Allison, replacing Mike Elliott, who became chief technical officer.
Mercedes is third in the championship, 128 points behind Red Bull, with one finish on the podium.
Ferrari has also had a sobering season.
It hired a new team boss, recruiting Frédéric Vasseur from Alfa Romeo Racing, but Ferrari's car, the SF-23, whose design predated Vasseur's appointment, has been insipid, and the team is in fourth.
Ferrari has suffered from high tire degradation, inconsistency with tire usage and wind sensitivity. Its reliability has also been flawed, with engine failures forcing its driver Charles Leclerc to retire in Bahrain, which, under F.I.A. rules, penalized his starting position in Saudi Arabia. Leclerc, a distant runner-up to Verstappen in 2022, is seventh in points, 85 behind Verstappen.
"What we are lacking is consistency on the car," Leclerc said. "It's not even from corner to corner, it's just in the same corner I can have a huge oversteer balance and then a huge understeer balance. This is just very difficult as a driver to gain the confidence."
Ferrari and Mercedes have upgraded their cars, but they are still uncertain of the exact solution.
"We need to manage our own expectations," Wolff said. "I have never in my 15 years in Formula 1 seen a silver bullet being introduced, where suddenly you unlock half a second of performance."
Red Bull will not be standing still, either, and it continues to adjust its car.
No team has won every Grand Prix in a season, but McLaren almost did in 1988, winning 15 of that season's 16 races, a 94 percent winning percentage.
Red Bull is, of course, at 100 percent, but there are many races left until the season ends in Abu Dhabi in November.
"Big gains could come quickly. We've got a great car, a great team, two great drivers," Horner said, pausing. "You know, there's still a long way to go."

Inundated by Downpours, Northern Italy Faces Landslides and Power Outages: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: At least 14 people died and thousands were left homeless after some areas received half their annual rainfall in 36 hours in a region that had only recently finished rebuilding after a 2012 earthquake.
Eleven years ago this month, back-to-back earthquakes struck the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, which this week was devastated by another disaster: Widespread flooding that has caused at least 14 deaths and left thousands more homeless.
On Friday, rescue workers continued to clear streets of mud, while towns in the Ravenna area remained submerged. Hundreds of roads were blocked by landslides making travel in the region difficult -- with some towns cut off completely -- and power was still out in some places.
Officials said the full extent of the damage was still not clear in the region, which had recently been plagued by drought and where few have forgotten the devastating 2012 earthquake.
"We couldn't have imagined that we would commemorate the 11th anniversary of the earthquake -- moreover with the satisfaction of having rebuilt practically everything or almost everything -- with a new earthquake to deal with, because that's what it is," Stefano Bonaccini, the president of the Emilia-Romagna region, said in reference to the flooding at a news conference on Friday evening.
But he added the 2012 earthquake had taught an important lesson: "While dealing with the emergency, it is important to plan ahead and think of reconstruction," he said, adding: "We must keep marching on and go back to producing and creating jobs, to give people a chance."
While the Emilia-Romagna region might be less known to foreigners than neighboring Tuscany, many will be familiar with some of its food products, like Parmesan cheese, from Parma and Reggio Emilia; balsamic vinegar from Modena; and cured Parma ham. Coastal towns like Rimini and Riccione are popular beach resorts.
But most of the region's businesses shut their doors this week. Even if spared the rains, hundreds of roads and bridges, essential for transporting goods, were out of commission.
"We're waiting for the waters to subside before we can assess the damage," said Annalisa Sassi, the president of the region's industrial association. "What I can say, knowing this territory, is that it is very hard-working. So I can imagine we will find the rich spirit that emerged after the earthquake. These are people who don't give up."
Experts described the rainfall this week as exceptional. Some areas received nearly 20 inches in 36 hours, about half the annual average. Heavy rains in early May had already saturated the soil, and on Tuesday, a storm system moving slowly across Italy funneled extreme downpours back over the same area.
With the ground already near saturation, like a sponge that is already soaked with water, the rainfall had nowhere to go except to flow to the lowest points, inundating rivers, creeks and other low-lying areas.
Nearly two dozen rivers broke their banks in a vast area between the Apennine Mountains -- where hilltop villages have been left isolated by landslides -- and the Adriatic coast.
"Many mayors are tired," Irene Priolo, vice president of the region, said at a news conference Friday, describing the rescue efforts that have involved hundreds of emergency workers. Fabrizio Curcio, head of the national civil protection agency, said the vastness of the territory affected by flooding and landslides "complicated the situation."
Rainfall this weekend is not expected to rival the levels seen in the past several days, but many areas remain vulnerable: Rivers are high, so any additional rain could exacerbate the flooding or cause landslides.
"These relatively short and small rivers that flow between the mountains and the sea had been dry for a year and a half," said Marina Baldi, a climatologist with the Italian National Research Council. "They could not take so much water."
This part of Emilia-Romagna is particularly vulnerable. Its fertile flatlands, once marshes just above the sea level, have always been exposed to flooding. The Apennines are susceptible to landslides because of the fragile rocks they are made of, and the slopes' grades make them unstable in case of heavy rains.
Ms. Baldi said that such intense rains usually hit Italy only once every 100 to 150 years, mostly in the fall or winter, not in May. "It was an absolutely anomalous phenomenon," she said, referring to the recent deluges.
Ms. Sassi, of the industrialists association, said that "new approaches" had to be adopted when it came to mapping out future plans and that those approaches needed to take into consideration abnormal weather patterns. "For us it's a priority issue, one we've been talking about for the past few years."
The Italian government is expected to declare a state of emergency in the region next week, but it has already allocated 30 million euros, about $ 32 million, to help with the response. Government ministers also raised the possibility of asking the European Union for help.
Stefano Francia, regional president of the farmers' association C.I.A., said that calculating the damage to agriculture would be possible only after water had receded from the fields, and vineyards on the hillsides had been shored up.
"But there is a great desire to start up again," he said. "It's the spirit of Emilia-Romagna to not give up."
The flooding prompted Formula 1 to cancel the grand prix in the area this weekend, saying the deadly flooding had made it unsafe to proceed with the race at Imola, which is in Emilia-Romagna. Ferrari, which has its headquarters in the region, donated €1 million to the regional civil protection agency.
The decision to continue with a concert by Bruce Springsteen was met with some criticism on social media, even though it took place in Ferrara, far from the flooded areas. "Maybe it could have been postponed," Mr. Bonaccini, president of the Emilia-Romagna region, told Italian television.
The hoteliers association in the beach town of Riccione, hit by the storm this week, announced Friday that hotels would be open and ready to welcome vacationers next week.
"Our seaside will be ready as always to welcome tourists, and we must send a clear message," Mr. Bonaccini said Friday. "Nothing will stop, people can and must come to give a hand to our economy."

The Annual Holy Pilgrimage to Cannes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes have works premiering this year at the festival on the French Riviera.
Wes Anderson's films have premiered at a wide variety of festivals, but after "Moonrise Kingdom" (2012), "The French Dispatch" (2021) and his upcoming ensemble comedy "Asteroid City," Cannes is the fest he keeps coming back to. Last week, I asked Anderson what he finds so compelling about a debut on the Croisette.
"The reason to go to Cannes, I think, is because they said yes," he deadpanned. "After that, there isn't really much to contemplate."
Well, there's a little more to it than that, Anderson admitted: For cinema lovers, there is no holier pilgrimage to make than to the Cannes Film Festival, where movies are treated with the utmost reverence and routinely given marathon standing ovations.
It is a place where great auteurs have been canonized, like Martin Scorsese, who won the Palme d'Or in 1976 for "Taxi Driver" and will return this year with his new feature "Killers of the Flower Moon," and Quentin Tarantino, a Palme winner (for "Pulp Fiction" in 1994) and Cannes habitué who'll be back at the fest this year for a wide-ranging conversation that may touch on his upcoming final film.
"I look at Cannes in relation to the other movies I know showed there, and I feel lucky enough to be included in the program that debuted those films," Anderson said. "For me, it's a chance to be involved in this movie history, which I love."
A Cannes launch can be awfully expensive for a studio to bankroll, since the airfare, star entourages and five-star hotels alone all add up. Still, the return on investment can be major. Last year, "Top Gun: Maverick" launched with a fawning Tom Cruise summit and sent fighter jets flying over the south of France, while Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" threw a rock concert on the beach where drones traced Elvis Presley's silhouette in the sky. Both films leveraged their splashy debuts to become some of the best-performing global hits of the year, and were nominated for the best-picture Oscar, to boot.
This year, several star-driven films will attempt to capitalize on a Cannes bow, including "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," which is being billed as Harrison Ford's final appearance in his most iconic role. Can it overcome the tepid response to the last sequel, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," and the substitution of James Mangold ("Ford v Ferrari") for Steven Spielberg as director of the series? At least the addition of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her most high-profile role since "Fleabag," will add a welcome jolt to the franchise.
The director Todd Haynes, who premiered "Carol" at Cannes, returns to the festival with another female-driven two-hander: "May December," which stars Julianne Moore as a teacher whose scandalous relationship with a former student is scrutinized by a movie star (Natalie Portman) preparing to play the teacher in a film. Other star-heavy films include "The New Boy," featuring Cate Blanchett as a nun in her first role since "Tár," and "Firebrand," with Jude Law as Henry VIII and Alicia Vikander as his last wife, Katherine Parr.
And then there are "Asteroid City" and "Killers of the Flower Moon," the fest's two most anticipated premieres. The former takes place at a 1950s retreat for space-obsessed youngsters and stars Anderson staples like Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, as well as new recruit Tom Hanks, about whom Anderson said, "I couldn't have had a better time working with anybody." Scorsese's Apple-backed film charts the mysterious murders of the Osage tribe in the 1920s and will bring stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro to the red carpet.
(Still, weep for what might have been: Greta Gerwig's candy-colored July release "Barbie" will skip an early premiere at Cannes, depriving us of a red-carpet fantasy to trump all others.)
In recent years, the winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or award has often gone to a film with breakout-hit potential, like "Parasite" and "Triangle of Sadness." The director of the latter film, Ruben Ostlund, will preside over this year's competition jury, a group that includes Brie Larson and Paul Dano, and they'll be picking their favorite from an auteur-heavy lineup that includes several former Palme winners.
Among them are Wim Wenders, who took the Palme for "Paris, Texas" and returns with "Perfect Days," about a Tokyo toilet cleaner, and Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose new film "Monster" is the first film he has shot in Japan since his Palme winner "Shoplifters." No director has ever taken the Palme three times, though Ken Loach could this year, if his new working-class drama "The Old Oak" proves as acclaimed as "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" and "I, Daniel Blake."
This year's Cannes has its fair share of long films -- "Occupied City," Steve McQueen's documentary about Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, runs four hours and six minutes -- but not every buzzy premiere will be feature-length. The fest will also premiere shorts directed by Pedro Almodóvar ("A Strange Way of Life") and the late Jean-Luc Godard ("Phony Wars"), while launching "The Idol," an already-controversial HBO series from the "Euphoria" mastermind Sam Levinson starring Abel "the Weeknd" Tesfaye.
And though the festival will offer G-rated pleasures in the form of Pixar's new film "Elemental," it wouldn't be Cannes without a few envelope-pushers. Keep an eye on Catherine Breillat, whose sexually explicit filmography ("Fat Girl," "Romance") gets a new entry with "Last Summer," about a lawyer who falls for her teenage stepson.
Then there's the film I'm most curious about: "The Zone of Interest," an Auschwitz-set drama from the director Jonathan Glazer. Rumor has it that Cannes passed on Glazer's audacious "Under the Skin" back in 2013 and was eager to make up for that mistake. Since Glazer's films ("Birth" and "Sexy Beast") are infrequent but stunning, a new project from the director is reason enough to say yes to Cannes -- and after that, there isn't really much to contemplate.

Full text: Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula 1, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 miles an hour. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It's hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We're inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-sized wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Mr. Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver's seat wearing athletic pants. He won't need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks' time, Mr. Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it's time for lunch. "Is chili bad for you?" he asks, digging into a bowl at his team's commissary. "I don't think it's that bad."
Reaching Formula 1, the highest level of international motor sport, is a big step for Mr. Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at 6 years old and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula 1 itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is enormously popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $ 4.4 billion by the Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media -- F1 had barely kept a YouTube page -- and backed a popular Netflix documentary series, "Drive to Survive." Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220 percent from 2018, and the sport made $ 2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization. "It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood," Bernie Ecclestone, the 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. "F1 is being made more and more for the American market."
The backlash reached a crescendo at last week's Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style pre-race ceremony, the rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a "global music collaboration" with Formula 1. (The lyrics rhyme "Max Verstappen," the name of the sport's top driver, with "your champion.")
"Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1," wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained: "None of the drivers like it," groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic pre-race sequence would be featured at several more grands prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport's stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell's macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style "harbor": blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast "Small Torque," said she was surprised by the spectacle when she attended a race in Austin, Texas. "There were girls with pompoms," she said. "I remember watching it and thinking, Oh my gosh, this is so different from anything I'd seen F1 do in a long time."
Ms. Fairman conceded that some Europeans find the American hullabaloo "tacky." But she added: "When it's something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it's just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party."
The arrival of Mr. Sargeant, who grew up about an hour's drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he's happy to play the part. "What's up America, let's bring that energy!" he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as "the local boy done good."
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Mr. Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: "I'm so sorry. I can't believe it."
Weeks earlier, in an interview in England, Mr. Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. "I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of 'first American,"' he said. "It's still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still."
If Mr. Sargeant doesn't perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. "At the moment," he said, "I just have to worry about staying here."
'I just want to get back in the gym.'
Before his tough Miami weekend, Mr. Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a top 10 finish. "Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London," he replied. "That's all I want to do."
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Mr. Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It's not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or Olympian gymnast, has devoted their life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Mr. Sargeant was 6 when he and his brother Dalton got a kart from their parents for Christmas. "No one in the family was really even that much into racing," Logan said. "We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend." He began winning junior races around the country -- too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula 1, he'd have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing excursions for life on a different continent: "We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe."
Mr. Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing between Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978. "As a kid, it was tough," he recalled. "Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather -- it was literally vice versa." He eventually settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. "I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym," he said. "I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table."
It is incredibly difficult to nab a seat in Formula 1. Today's drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag -- critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grands prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world's most sophisticated racecars. But it's ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion and F1's only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Mr. Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida's Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald J. Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan's father, Daniel Sargeant, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $ 6.5 million in corporate funds "for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities" of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $ 5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesman said that Logan Sargeant was not "in a position to comment" on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Mr. Sargeant's Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was sanctioned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Mr. Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. "I'm incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan's here for any other reason than I think he's got this pure talent," he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Mr. Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year's two other rookies. "He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more," Mr. Vowles said. "He's a perfectionist, and I like that in him."
Tooting around in a Vauxhall Astra
Britain, where Formula 1 originated in 1950, remains the sport's spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it's now an American subsidiary: a Manhattan private equity firm, Dorilton Capital, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $ 200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, like engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park -- a far cry from McLaren's space-age complex an hour's drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Mr. Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team's sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $ 60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure Mr. Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
"Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years," he said in an interview. "There are eager companies who want the publicity." Mr. Sargeant's car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading "Go Logan!" alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year's race fell about 25 percent, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data show that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $ 90 million annually -- up from the $ 5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes. "We were too arrogant," he said. "We couldn't understand why the American fan base wasn't falling in love with us." But he also pushed back on the complaints that Liberty's efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
"This whole argument of 'Americanization,' it's a very crude way to describe things," he said. "We shouldn't ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It's about giving people more choices in the modern era. It's modernization of access to everyone."
Mr. Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty's approach. "I mean jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J," he told reporters in Miami. "I thought it was cool, wasn't an issue to me."
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler -- something Mr. Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
"I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine," he said. "But to be honest, I'm not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn't really interest me."
"The part that interests me," he concluded, "is driving them as fast as I can go."

GROVE, England — Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula One, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 mph.

Commuting in a Compact Car
Britain, where Formula One originated in 1950, remains the sport’s spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it’s now an American subsidiary: Dorilton Capital, a private equity firm in New York City, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, such as engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park — a far cry from McLaren’s space-age complex an hour’s drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team’s sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure that Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
“Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years,” he said in an interview. “There are eager companies who want the publicity.” Sargeant’s car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading “Go Logan!” alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year’s race fell about 25%, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data shows that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, North Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $90 million annually — up from the $5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes.
“We were too arrogant,” he said. “We couldn’t understand why the American fan base wasn’t falling in love with us.” But he pushed back on complaints that Liberty’s efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
“This whole argument of ‘Americanization,’ it’s a very crude way to describe things,” he said. “We shouldn’t ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It’s about giving people more choices in the modern era. It’s modernization of access to everyone.”
Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty’s approach. “I mean, jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J,” he told reporters in Miami. “I thought it was cool, wasn’t an issue to me.”
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler — something Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
“I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine,” he said. “But to be honest, I’m not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn’t really interest me.”
“The part that interests me,” he said, “is driving them as fast as I can go.”

It's Verstappen's Turn as Red Bull Team Remains Unbeaten: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The only question at Sunday's Miami Grand Prix, as usual, was not if Red Bull would win the race. It was which Red Bull driver would win the race.
Sergio Pérez started from pole position and led for a while. Then Max Verstappen. Then Pérez again. Then, finally, Verstappen. This has become, regular watchers of Formula 1 will tell you, routine nowadays.
The winner this week? Verstappen, who slipped past Pérez after a late pit stop and sped away to claim his third victory of the season. (Pérez has the other two; Red Bull has yet to lose in five races this year.)
Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin was third, again, his fourth such finish in five starts. Formula 1 is best in class at a lot of things; surprising people, it seems, is no longer among them.
Verstappen's victory, a satisfying one after a rare slip in qualifying left him far back on the starting grid, will carry beyond Sunday, as it allowed him to extend his lead over Pérez in the season points race. That edge, which had shrunk to 6 points, is now a more comfortable 14.
But the victory also re-established Verstappen as the best driver on Formula 1's best team, and the betting favorite to win the next time out, and the time after that, and the time after that.
"I made it hard on myself," Verstappen had said before the race, alluding to a rare error in qualifying that led to his starting ninth on the 20-driver grid. "But we're going to have a good day."
He was right. But for Red Bull, they are all good days this year.
Where the Race Turned
Laps 20 through 40. Pérez started fast and led for about 20 laps before pitting to get himself onto the same hard tires as Verstappen, who had torn through the field behind him to climb into second place. As soon as Pérez surrendered the lead to him, though, Verstappen sprinted away: At one point he had opened a lead of nearly 20 seconds on the rest of the field.
Of course, Verstappen still had to pit, too. But his lead had grown so large by then that when he emerged from the pit lane, on the 46th of 57 laps, he did so with fresh tires and a clear line on Pérez, only a few yards ahead on the track around the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium. It took Verstappen less than two laps to sprint around his teammate, and that was that.
"Well done, Max," Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, told Verstappen on the radio soon after he crossed the finish line. "That was a mighty middle stint."
The Race in Photos
Best Days, Ranked
1. Red Bull. Always, though Verstappen will go to bed marginally happier than Pérez.
2. Fernando Alonso. Have you ever seen anyone so happy to finish third almost every time out?
3. Mercedes. George Russell finished fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who started 13th, placed sixth. Mercedes continues to make improvements, and both Russell and Hamilton grumbled on the radio at times on Sunday. But given where the team was -- the team principal Toto Wolff had snarled at reporters this week that his own team's car was "a nasty piece of work" -- Sunday was a good day.
What They're Saying
"I don't think I could stand the humiliation again." -- the pit lane reporter Martin Brundle, deciding against asking the tennis star Serena Williams for an interview after being rejected twice by the tennis star in 2022.
"It was not easy. It was never easy. But it was a lonely race." -- Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, third again, which feels like victory to anyone but Red Bull.
"We kept it clean. That was most important." -- Max Verstappen, on battling his Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez for the lead in the final laps.
Why Is This Man Smiling?

Bahrain: Verstappen P1, Perez P2

Annual 93,000-Mile, 20-Country Relay Race That Fans Don't See: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- By late Sunday night in Baku, a few hours after Sergio Pérez of Red Bull had won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, much of the equipment necessary to stage a Formula 1 race had been methodically packed, wrapped and hoisted onto pallets, ready to fly halfway across the world.
Chartered cargo planes did the heavy lifting from there, hauling disassembled 1,700-pound racecars -- and almost anything else imaginable -- to Miami International Airport, where, by Monday, the shipment had been offloaded onto trucks and delivered to the pop-up racetrack around Hard Rock Stadium, which will host the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
Getting from the starting grid to the finish line is not, it turns out, the only high-stakes race against the clock in Formula 1.
For the top tier of international open-wheel racing, putting on premier competitions on back-to-back weekends is a complicated logistical symphony. Behind the scenes, 1,400 tons of stuff travels by air, sea and land from track to track, and continent to continent, for 23 races in 20 countries, a perpetual cycle of packing, unpacking and repacking that this year will cover more than 93,000 miles. The lights' flicking off at the start of each race are contingent on everything, somehow, arriving on time, every time.
It is not just the cars that need to be taken apart and put back together just so. It is entire garages, plus the technical gear and hospitality amenities -- even the weather instruments -- that make up essentially a modest city's worth of necessities large and small that need to be packed up. Tires, fuel, generators. Helmets and baseball hats. Broadcast equipment. Cutlery. On rare occasions, plants.
"In some cases, we bring the ovens and dishwashers," said Simon Price, the trackside manager for the shipping giant DHL, which has been moving cargo for Formula 1 for decades and been its official logistics provider since 2004.
Planes transport the most important -- read: most expensive -- cargo from one race to the next, Price said. The planes flying in from Baku this week stopped to refuel either in Casablanca, Morocco, or Luxembourg before their arrival in Miami. (Yes, everything must clear customs. A lot of paperwork is involved.) The last plane touched down Tuesday afternoon.
This week, the teams were lucky, said Christian Polhammer, the senior logistics coordinator for F1: Miami's time zone was eight hours behind.
"That eight hours make a big difference," he said. "If you go the other way, you lose eight hours."
Ships lug sets of bulkier items to nonconsecutive races. The first vessel with Miami race containers arrived at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in mid-April. By Wednesday, unpacked boxes lay neatly in front of each team's garages: "Sea shipment to Miami, Montreal, Austin, Las Vegas," read a label outside Red Bull's quarters.
Locally sourced and labeled forklifts -- Ferrari 1, Ferrari 6 -- motored to and from garages, beeping warnings as they came and went. Crews in team uniforms unwrapped cases of rims. Outside the Red Bull garage, two men inserted sensors into huge Pirelli tires.
The garages themselves, where the racecars were being reassembled by crew members blaring music, were off limits to outsiders, for competitive reasons. Practice laps were only a few days away. But no one seemed frazzled. They do this almost every week.
Last year, bad weather and vessel congestion delayed a ship in Singapore that had been headed to the Australian Grand Prix, Price said. With the clock ticking down to practices and qualifying, DHL diverted three planes and urgently sent employees to Singapore to unpack the sea freight containers and hustle the cargo into airfreight ones. Everything made it to Melbourne.
But people like Polhammer and Price cannot focus on just a single race at a time. Interviewed in Miami, they were already thinking about upcoming competitions, especially the one later this month in Monaco, where the narrow streets, Price noted with concern, "aren't built for trucks."
The Las Vegas Grand Prix, scheduled to debut in November, will present an altogether different challenge, Polhammer said. As soon as it ends, everything will have to be packed up and flown to Abu Dhabi, which is 11 hours ahead. It will help that the Vegas race will be on a Saturday night rather than the traditional Sunday slot, he added.
But he can worry about that later, after the long hauls to Britain, Belgium and Brazil.
With this year's season running from March to November and requiring travel across five continents, people like Polhammer and Price spend most of their time on planes and in hotel rooms. Price, who lives in England and began his career as a Formula 1 truck driver, estimated he gets about two days a month at home. Polhammer, who lives in Austria and has worked for F1 for 16 years, said that last year he spent more than 260 nights on the road.
"I admire and take my hat off to anyone that holds down a family and a relationship with this job," Price said.
It is difficult to explain to people outside the logistics business what they do. "They're all like, 'What a glamorous lifestyle!"' Polhammer said. "We are definitely not part of that."
No other sport compares in terms of moving so much volume over such long distances in short periods of times, he added.
"F1 -- its deadlines do not move," Price said. In normal commerce, he added, schedules can be adjusted. In Formula 1, "the green flag will go on Sunday no matter what."
Then the packing will begin again, even before the champagne is sprayed on the podium.
"It takes three to four days to set all this up," Price said, "and we pack it down in three to four hours."

Pérez Secures Second Victory as Red Bull Dominates Again: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Max Verstappen was second in Red Bull's third 1-2 finish of the Formula 1 season, but a scary moment in pit lane raised questions about safety.
The only thing in doubt after 10 laps, really, was which Red Bull would win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday. But even that, by the end, was no contest.
Sergio Pérez outclassed both the field and his teammate, Max Verstappen, to win on Sunday in Baku. The finish was Pérez's second victory of the season -- Verstappen has won the other two events -- and was the third time in four races that Red Bull's cars had crossed the line first and second.
The results also left little doubt about Red Bull's advantage over every other team in Formula 1 this season, when it has been fastest in practice, in qualifying and on Sundays. But the contest also set the stage for a long, hot summer of racing between the two Red Bull drivers; Pérez now trails Verstappen by only six points in the season standings.
"Well done, guys, we dominated this weekend," Pérez told his team over the radio after his victory. "We are in the fight."
Charles Leclerc of Ferrari grabbed a consolation prize by finishing third, just holding off Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin. It was Leclerc's first podium finish of the year, but he -- just like everyone else -- was well beaten by Red Bull. Again.
Near Disaster
For the second consecutive race, Formula 1 narrowly avoided tragedy when people came onto the track before the race had ended.
In Australia it had been fans who encroached, slipping through gaps in the fencing to gain access to the track even as the cars were still racing at full speed. On Sunday, the scare came in pit lane, where photographers, crew members and safety officials who had come out of the garage area to watch Pérez and Verstappen cross the finish line were sent scrambling when Alpine's Esteban Ocon entered the area.
The photographers were gathering in front of the area in pit lane where the podium finishers park their cars before the awards ceremony, and team mechanics -- including those from Red Bull -- were celebrating on the pit wall.
But the race, at that point, was not over. Ocon's stop was not optional if he wanted to claim the points earned from his finish. Drivers must complete at least one pit stop to change tires during a race, and he had not been in yet.
Organizers of the Australian Grand Prix opened an investigation after the track incursions in Melbourne, which one acknowledged "could have been horrific." But those appeared to be the fans' fault.
A Formula 1 spokesman told reporters in Baku that they would do the same after the incident on Sunday, in which the people on the track were accredited photographers -- most likely ushered onto the track by stewards -- and crew members far more familiar with the dangers of racing.
Ocon afterward called it a "crazy moment" and one that could have been avoided.
"That is not something that we want to see," Ocon said. "I don't understand why we are starting to prepare the podium and the ceremony when we are still racing."
"If I miss the braking point," he added, "it is a big disaster."
Sunday's Race in Photos
When the Race Turned
Lap 10. Starting second, Verstappen had sprinted past Leclerc by Lap 4, and Pérez did the same three laps later. At that point, the only question seemed to be which Red Bull would win. And then Nyck De Vries crashed, and everything changed.
Red Bull had already told Verstappen to pit when the safety car emerged, allowing Pérez -- who had slipped into the lead -- to essentially save time by making his stop while the field was crawling around the track, and came out of the pit with the lead and a set of fresh tires. (Verstappen, by going in early, had lost much more ground and wound up playing catch-up all day.)
The timing was fortuitous -- "I got a bit lucky there," Pérez admitted later -- but the race was never close after that.
What They're Saying
Pérez, on the 1-2 finish by Red Bull: "We pushed to the maximum today. We both hit the wall a few times. We were pushing out there. The way Max pushed me was really hard, but we managed to keep him under control."
Leclerc, on chasing Pérez and Verstappen every week: "Honestly the feeling is a little better, but when I see the gap, we still have a lot of work."
Verstappen, consistently the world's most unhappy runner-up: "You keep learning. It can never be perfect all the time."
Drivers' Championship Standings
Red Bull's biggest challenge over the next month may be to keep the peace between its drivers as they scrap for the title. That race just got a lot tighter:

The Crypto Detectives Are Cleaning Up: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Before a new breed of cryptocurrency detectives helped bring him down, Ryan Felton marketed his crypto scheme with a grandiose promise: He was creating "Netflix on the blockchain."
He called the crypto-themed streaming service FLiK. For a small amount of the popular digital currency Ether, customers could purchase a FLiK token, which would give them access to shows and movies broadcast on the new platform. Mr. Felton described the project as an "entertainment revolution"; crypto enthusiasts bought more than $ 2 million worth of FLiK coins.
But the streaming business never materialized. Instead, Mr. Felton bought a $ 1.5 million house, along with $ 32,000 in diamonds. He spent $ 180,000 more on a red Ferrari.
When cryptocurrencies hit the mainstream in the 2010s, the technology was widely viewed as a perfect vehicle for crime. A drug dealer or scam artist could transfer large quantities of money instantly, without relying on a bank to validate the transaction. To early advocates, crypto was appealing because it promised the secrecy and anonymity of cash, without the inconvenience of face-to-face exchanges.
That secrecy was an illusion. Crypto transactions are inscribed on a publicly viewable ledger called a blockchain. To the untrained observer, blockchain records are unintelligible -- a jumble of meaningless letters and numbers. But a growing industry is dedicated to deciphering them.
At the center is the New York analytics start-up Chainalysis, which was valued at $ 8.6 billion after a funding round last year. With tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, Chainalysis has built a reputation as one of the crypto industry's leading detectives -- a team of blockchain analysts that helps the government track crypto transactions.
As federal agencies orchestrate an aggressive crackdown on crypto fraud, Chainalysis has come to occupy an increasingly important position in the industry. The company markets itself to the government and private companies as a force for good in a badly behaved sector -- a firm whose business is solving crimes and cooperating with public officials.
After the FTX exchange imploded, its bankruptcy lawyers hired Chainalysis to disentangle the web of entities at the center of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire and track the $ 400 million in crypto that a hacker stole from FTX's accounts. Chainalysis has also been conducting some light diplomacy: In April, it hosted a conference in Manhattan to bring together government officials and the newly chastened crypto executives who are trying to win back their trust. Guests received socks stitched with the Chainalysis logo.
But that ambassadorial role has also put Chainalysis at odds with some of crypto's most passionate advocates, who envisioned digital money as a private, anonymous financial network. That clash is a battle for crypto's future, and it's unfolding at a turbulent moment in the industry's short history.
From the government's perspective, Chainalysis is arguably the most trusted company in the industry -- but only because it sells powerful tools aimed at penetrating the veil of secrecy that made crypto attractive in the first place.
The blockchain is "oftentimes the key to unlocking a case," said Jonathan Levin, 32, one of the founders of Chainalysis. "It's more traceable and more conclusive."
In late 2020, Mr. Felton was indicted on charges that he had used investors' funds to finance his extravagant lifestyle. He went on trial in Atlanta last summer. Testifying for the prosecution was Beth Bisbee, a Chainalysis investigator who once worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2014, her analysis of blockchain records helped the D.E.A. track down an internet drug dealer in Arizona.
That investigation was relatively low-tech: Ms. Bisbee pasted Bitcoin transaction logs into a spreadsheet, which she searched for clues. These days, crypto fraud is more complicated, involving multiple types of currencies, each with its own blockchain. Chainalysis makes software that can do the time-consuming work automatically.
In the courtroom, Ms. Bisbee presented a colorful diagram mapping the movement of the millions of dollars' worth of Ether that investors spent on Mr. Felton's tokens. The funds had been routed to a series of crypto wallets, digital repositories where people can store their holdings. Using a forensic technique called clustering, Ms. Bisbee showed that all those wallet addresses belonged to the same person: Mr. Felton. From those accounts, he had moved his investors' Ether to one exchange before transferring it to another. Then he'd converted the Ether into cash.
"What was the source of the vast bulk of those funds before they were wired out?" one of the prosecutors asked Ms. Bisbee.
"The FLiK token sales," she replied.
The prosecution presented its case over four days in July. On the last day, Mr. Felton pleaded guilty.
A new kind of crypto business
About a decade ago, Mr. Levin, then a master's student in economics at Oxford University, was at a pub with a friend when the conversation turned, naturally, to the topic of cryptocurrency arbitrage. Variations in the price of Bitcoin across two exchanges had created a moneymaking opportunity: Buy Bitcoin at the lower price, then sell it for a profit.
The arbitrage trade proved too time-consuming and logistically complicated for Mr. Levin to execute. "I probably had, like, 100 pounds to my name," he said. But the conversation ignited Mr. Levin's fascination with Bitcoin. The digital currency was invented in 2008 by a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, who envisioned a private, decentralized form of commerce that would operate outside the supervision of any government or financial institution.
Mr. Levin was no radical libertarian, however. A 20-something from the United Kingdom, he was interested in the inner workings of the technology, and he saw an opportunity for professional advancement: Not many other people seemed to be studying cryptocurrencies. At the time, Bitcoin was still considered the domain of hackers and drug dealers; none of Mr. Levin's professors wanted to supervise his research.
Undeterred, Mr. Levin started attending crypto conferences and eventually wrote a master's thesis titled, "Creating a decentralised payment system: A study of Bitcoin." But he still had questions.
"No one understood how and why people were actually using crypto," Mr. Levin said. "If you could package that information up and supply that to all of the most important stakeholders, you can build systemically one of the most important companies."
While he was still at Oxford, Mr. Levin started a blockchain analytics company called Coinometrics, but it soon fizzled. ("It's probably not the best idea to meet your co-founders on Reddit," he said.) Then, in early 2015, he was introduced to Michael Gronager and Jan Moller, Danish entrepreneurs who were working on a similar project. Mr. Gronager had been using blockchain analysis to track crypto lost in the collapse of Mt. Gox, an early exchange. Together, the three men founded Chainalysis.
As the crypto industry has expanded, blockchain tracking has become increasingly important. These days, some of the largest crypto companies hire blockchain analytics firms to help monitor their customers' activity and comply with laws designed to stop money laundering. In bankruptcy proceedings, analytics firms sort through the remains of collapsed crypto companies, investigating public transaction logs to locate missing funds.
The crypto industry's recent downturn has taken a toll on the tracking business. Elliptic, one of Chainalysis' competitors, cut 10 percent of its staff in February. The same month, Chainalysis laid off about 40 employees, a roughly 5 percent cut.
But blockchain analysis companies have been insulated from the worst effects of the market crash. Chainalysis declined to reveal its exact sales figures, but Mr. Gronager said the company's revenue increased 70 percent last year despite the crisis in crypto markets. That growth is partly a function of the company's business model: Two-thirds of its revenue comes from partnerships with public institutions, including law-enforcement agencies, the company says, a source of income that remains relatively stable even when the market implodes.
The Justice Department paid Chainalysis $ 12,500 for its work on the Ryan Felton case, according to federal records. But that assignment was a drop in the bucket. The Justice Department, the Treasury Department and other federal agencies pay for the ability to use Chainalysis' blockchain-tracing software, including a tool called Reactor, which maps transactions. In total, Chainalysis has active contracts with the federal government worth about $ 65 million, according to an analysis of federal records by Jack Poulson, the executive director of the nonprofit Tech Inquiry, which tracks contracts.
Lately, though, Chainalysis has faced competition from smaller rivals including TRM Labs, a tracking firm that has gained prominence by selling software for new types of cryptocurrencies with names like Solana.
In 2021, an official at TRM emailed the Treasury Department to question its decision to award an exclusive contract to Chainalysis, according to email logs obtained through a public records request.
The TRM representative asked for a "rationale as to why this procurement isn't following a competitive bid process," according to the emails. "There are multiple providers with analogous capabilities that meet" the requirements, the representative wrote. By early last year, TRM had secured its own contract with the Treasury Department, according to a company spokeswoman. And TRM was hired alongside Chainalysis to work on FTX's bankruptcy.
"We went from a Bitcoin world to this multi-chain world, and people needing tools to follow illicit activity no matter where it happens in the crypto economy," said Esteban Castaño, TRM's chief executive. "There's constantly going to be new assets, new blockchains."
Fighting for privacy
At times, the transparency of the blockchain has been a boon to law enforcement. In 2020, Chainalysis worked with U.S. investigators to bring down the largest child-pornography website on the dark web. By analyzing the blockchain, agents located the digital addresses of customers who were using Bitcoin to buy the illegal pornography. The trail led to the crypto exchanges where the customers had bought their Bitcoin in the first place; the government could then subpoena those firms to establish the wallet owners' identities.
Despite those kinds of law-enforcement victories, the rapid growth of blockchain-tracking firms has provoked some uneasiness in the crypto world. One of Chainalysis's government clients is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has an active contract with the company worth a total that could rise to roughly $ 12 million, according to federal records. An I.C.E. spokesman did not respond to requests for comment; Mr. Gronager, the Chainalysis founder, said the agency tracks blockchains to combat drug trafficking, and that he's not aware of any cases in which I.C.E. has used his company's tools for immigration enforcement.
To privacy advocates, the company's relationship with I.C.E. looks like a slippery slope.
"It's pretty trivial to use a blockchain analysis tool to see what transactions are sending money back to El Salvador," said Justin Ehrenhofer, an executive at the crypto privacy firm Cake Wallet. "That gives them a new angle to specifically target immigrants."
Mr. Ehrenhofer discovered virtual currencies when he was a teenager; at the time, he was using private browsers to look up L.G.B.T.Q. content on the internet, because he hadn't yet come out to his parents. His interest in the technology stemmed from its potential use as a privacy tool. But that viewpoint is increasingly old-fashioned. In recent years, the radical, idealistic traditions of the technology have largely given way to a more pragmatic approach, as Wall Street traders and Silicon Valley venture capitalists have flocked to the crypto world, in search of new ways to generate wealth online.
"The initial impetus for what we think of as digital cash and currency was privacy," said Finn Brunton, the author of a 2019 book about the history of crypto. "It's flipped all the way around."
Cake Wallet is one of a handful of companies still developing tools to make crypto transactions less traceable, a kind of counteroffensive against the blockchain-tracking industry. One of the firm's main products is a crypto wallet compatible with Monero, a so-called privacy coin that's harder to track than other cryptocurrencies. Every exchange of funds is recorded publicly, but the transaction information is obscured, making it much harder to see which wallet sent or received the money.
Investors aiming to evade blockchain-tracking software can also move funds through services known as mixers, which receive multiple strands of transactions and then combine them to obscure the source and destination of the money. In August, the Treasury Department barred Americans from using a popular mixer called Tornado Cash, saying it had been used to launder more than $ 7 billion in virtual currency, including hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by North Korean hackers.
The sanctions provoked an outcry from crypto investors. A group of Tornado Cash customers sued the Treasury Department to block the prohibition, arguing that mixers are essential to protecting privacy. One of the plaintiffs said he used the service to donate to the Ukrainian war effort, hoping to stay anonymous for fear of retaliation from Russia.
Chainalysis says little publicly about the techniques it uses to combat technologies like Monero or another crypto privacy service called Wasabi Wallet. But the company is trying to trace those transactions: Chainalysis has offered "Wasabi Demixing services" to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a unit of the Treasury Department that oversees sanctions, according to documents obtained through a public records request.
The government's access to such tools has alarmed old-school crypto advocates. "Bitcoin could be the worst surveillance nightmare that we've ever imagined -- a world where everyone uses Bitcoin, but everybody's transaction history is totally public and everyone knows how much money everyone has," said Max Hillebrand, the chief executive of zkSNACKs, the company behind Wasabi Wallet. "That's not a world I'd be comfortable living in."
Cleaning up crypto
One morning in April, Mr. Gronager walked onstage at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Manhattan, welcoming a roomful of guests to Links 2023, an industry conference hosted by Chainalysis. He wore an orange Chainalysis T-shirt, matching his orange sneakers and orange watch strap. A line of glowing orange lights hung overhead.
"It's time to build things," Mr. Gronager proclaimed. "And we're actually doing that."
Blockchain analysis was once just a nerdy subculture of a nerdy industry, but recently it's gained a sheen of mainstream glamour. On Twitter, armchair sleuths with hundreds of thousands of followers use tracking software to expose crypto scams. Chainalysis has hosted the Links conference since 2019, but the most recent edition was the largest, with 900 attendees gathered at a venue that once hosted the N.F.L. Draft.
In November, the technology journalist Andy Greenberg published "Tracers in the Dark," a cinematic account of the rise of Chainalysis that details several of its highest-profile early investigations. Many of the law-enforcement figures profiled in the book have achieved celebrity status in the blockchain-tracking world and parlayed their knowledge of the technology's inner workings into high-paying corporate jobs.
Tigran Gambaryan, a former Internal Revenue Service agent who helped crack the child pornography case, attended the Links conference in his new capacity as a compliance executive for Binance, the embattled cryptocurrency exchange. "I feel like I've met a legend," one admirer said as he shook Mr. Gambaryan's hand.
Mr. Gambaryan and other government investigators used Chainalysis's technology to pursue terrorists and dark-net drug dealers. But the worst behavior in the crypto industry today is arguably even more difficult to combat: fraudulent offshore firms run by secretive executives, companies that engage in complex financial engineering to cover up holes in their accounts. Mr. Levin said Chainalysis is considering offering new product features that would help customers evaluate business risks in the crypto world.
"Everyone, after FTX, started to ask a lot more questions about counterparty risk," he said. "We're thinking about how do we present even better forms of information to them so that they can make informed decisions."
But Chainalysis is deeply enmeshed in the industry it's trying to clean up. A third of its revenue comes from the private sector; other blockchain companies use its software to gather market information. The firm's long-term prospects depend on crypto's continued growth. At the Links conference, Mr. Gronager clicked through a slide presentation full of graphs and statistics that he said showed the industry's resilience during the market downturn. "We believe all value will move on the blockchain," one slide read.
On the sidelines of the conference, some of the company's guests privately expressed apprehension. By trying to legitimize crypto in the eyes of the government, was Chainalysis simply providing cover for companies that violate securities law or engage in widespread fraud?
The stories of crime-busting blockchain tracers have become part of the crypto industry's public-relations playbook, said John Stark, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official and frequent crypto critic. "The idea that 'Hey, we're using these people to help us with our compliance,' it's just more subterfuge," he said. "Some kind of masquerade."
On the first day of Links, Mr. Levin appeared onstage for a friendly Q. and A. with Noah Perlman, a former federal prosecutor who was hired in January as Binance's new chief compliance officer. Two months after Mr. Perlman joined, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance, saying that gross compliance failures had allowed the exchange's customers to launder money.
But Binance claims it's turning over a new leaf. The company has hired former investigators like Mr. Gambaryan. And it has invested in blockchain tracking, buying more than 50 software accounts from Chainalysis.

Before a new breed of cryptocurrency detectives helped bring him down, Ryan Felton marketed his crypto scheme with a grandiose promise: He was creating “Netflix on the blockchain.”
He called the crypto-themed streaming service FLiK. For a small amount of the popular digital currency ether, customers could purchase a FLiK token, which would give them access to shows and movies broadcast on the new platform. Felton described the project as an “entertainment revolution”; crypto enthusiasts bought more than $2 million worth of FLiK coins.
But the streaming business never materialized. Instead, Felton bought a $1.5 million house, along with $32,000 in diamonds. He spent $180,000 more for a red Ferrari.
When cryptocurrencies hit the mainstream in the 2010s, the technology was widely viewed as a perfect vehicle for crime. A drug dealer or scam artist could transfer large quantities of money instantly, without relying on a bank to validate the transaction. To early advocates, crypto was appealing because it promised the secrecy and anonymity of cash, without the inconvenience of face-to-face exchanges.
That secrecy was an illusion. Crypto transactions are inscribed on a publicly viewable ledger called a blockchain. To the untrained observer, blockchain records are unintelligible — a jumble of meaningless letters and numbers. But a growing industry is dedicated to deciphering them.
At the center is the New York analytics startup Chainalysis, which was valued at $8.6 billion after a funding round last year. With tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, Chainalysis has built a reputation as one of the crypto industry’s leading detectives — a team of blockchain analysts that helps the government track crypto transactions.
As federal agencies orchestrate an aggressive crackdown on crypto fraud, Chainalysis has come to occupy an increasingly important position in the industry. The company markets itself to the government and private companies as a force for good in a badly behaved sector — a firm whose business is solving crimes and cooperating with public officials.
After the FTX exchange imploded, its bankruptcy lawyers hired Chainalysis to disentangle the web of entities at the center of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire and track the $400 million in crypto that a hacker stole from FTX’s accounts. Chainalysis has also been conducting some light diplomacy: In April, it hosted a conference in New York City’s Manhattan borough to bring together government officials and the newly chastened crypto executives who are trying to win back their trust. Guests received socks stitched with the Chainalysis logo.
But that ambassadorial role has also put Chainalysis at odds with some of crypto’s most passionate advocates, who envisioned digital money as a private, anonymous financial network. That clash is a battle for crypto’s future, and it’s unfolding at a turbulent moment in the industry’s short history.
From the government’s perspective, Chainalysis is arguably the most trusted company in the industry — but only because it sells powerful tools aimed at penetrating the veil of secrecy that made crypto attractive in the first place.
The blockchain is “oftentimes the key to unlocking a case,” said Jonathan Levin, 32, one of the founders of Chainalysis. “It’s more traceable and more conclusive.”
In late 2020, Felton was indicted on charges that he had used investors’ funds to finance his extravagant lifestyle. He went on trial in Atlanta last summer. Testifying for the prosecution was Beth Bisbee, a Chainalysis investigator who once worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2014, her analysis of blockchain records helped the DEA track down an internet drug dealer in Arizona.
That investigation was relatively low-tech: Bisbee pasted bitcoin transaction logs into a spreadsheet, which she searched for clues. These days, crypto fraud is more complicated, involving multiple types of currencies, each with its own blockchain. Chainalysis makes software that can do the time-consuming work automatically.
In the courtroom, Bisbee presented a colorful diagram mapping the movement of the millions of dollars’ worth of ether that investors spent on Felton’s tokens. The funds had been routed to a series of crypto wallets, digital repositories where people can store their holdings. Using a forensic technique called clustering, Bisbee showed that all those wallet addresses belonged to the same person: Felton. From those accounts, he had moved his investors’ ether to one exchange before transferring it to another. Then he’d converted the ether into cash.
“What was the source of the vast bulk of those funds before they were wired out?” one of the prosecutors asked Bisbee.
“The FLiK token sales,” she replied.
The prosecution presented its case over four days in July. On the last day, Felton pleaded guilty.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: During his first large-scale performance in years, the enigmatic singer suggested a new album was coming, just "not right now."
Three years after a much-hyped headlining set was foiled by the pandemic -- and nearly six years since his most recent large-scale concerts -- the venerated but rarely heard from singer-songwriter Frank Ocean closed the opening weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Sunday with a typically emotional performance of reworked favorites, and a hint that a new album was coming.
Wearing a bright blue jacket with the hood pulled tight around his face, Ocean took to the stage around an hour late, beginning with a rock version of "Novacane," his 2011 debut single that describes meeting a girl at Coachella, before playing reworked versions of hits including "Bad Religion" and "White Ferrari."
Soon, he walked to the front of the stage -- beneath vast screens -- and explained he was performing on Sunday because he used to regularly attend the desert festival with his younger brother, Ryan Breaux, who died in a car crash in 2020. Ocean said one of his "fondest memories" was dancing with his brother in a tent there to the rap duo Rae Sremmurd.
"I know he would have been so excited to be here with all of us," Ocean added.
Ocean, 35, has not released an album since 2016, with minimal public appearances, only a few singles and a luxury fashion line in between. At times on Sunday, he was barely visible to the crowd despite the large screens, as his hourlong set -- which included a DJ interlude from the Paris-based producer Crystallmess -- rounded out the festival weekend's headline performances, following the Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny on Friday and the K-pop girl group Blackpink on Saturday.
Ocean's stage time was perhaps meant to be longer. But after playing "At Your Best (You Are Love)," his version of an Isley Brothers track once covered by Aaliyah, Ocean announced: "Guys I'm being told it's curfew, so that's the end of the show."
The festival -- one of the pre-eminent events in the pop music calendar, with some 125,000 daily attendees, regardless of who's booked onstage -- was held once again at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif., its home nearly every year since 1999, and also livestreamed via YouTube. Other performers across the three days included Rosalía, Burna Boy, Gorillaz, Blondie (with Nile Rodgers), boygenius and the rap producer Metro Boomin, with special guests Future and the Weeknd.
Ocean had initially been slated to headline in April 2020, before Coachella was postponed and then canceled twice because of Covid-19; the festival returned last year without Ocean, featuring the headliners Billie Eilish, Harry Styles and Swedish House Mafia instead. Coachella repeats for its second annual weekend from Friday to Sunday.
Given those canceled appearances, Ocean's set on Sunday was highly anticipated, even by those unable to get tickets. Most of the festival was livestreamed on YouTube throughout the weekend and thousands of music lovers waited online Sunday to watch Ocean's set, too. But YouTube said in a tweet late Sunday that the livestream of his concert would not go ahead. Hundreds of social media users immediately expressed their frustration with crying emojis and animated GIFs.
On Monday, neither YouTube nor Coachella responded to a request for comment about why Ocean's set wasn't streamed. (Björk, who also performed on Sunday, was not shown on the livestream either.)
At the festival, Ocean, who has lately been selling jewelry through his luxury brand Homer, kept his overall presentation minimal, as well: "NO FRANK OCEAN MERCHANDISE," read a sign on the grounds, to the disappointment of some fans.
Having long built its name on genre-spanning spectacle, rare appearances, debuts and reunions -- from the Tupac Shakur hologram and Beyoncé's 2018 tour de force to reconciliations between core members of Pixies, Rage Against the Machine, Outkast, Guns N' Roses and more -- Coachella had more than just Ocean's re-emergence this past weekend. On Friday, the pop-punk group Blink-182 appeared with its classic lineup -- the trio of Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker -- for the first time since 2014. The band was a late addition to the festival, with its set not announced until Wednesday.
And on Saturday, the enigmatic British singer and producer Jai Paul, whose sparse career output makes Ocean seem prolific, performed his first ever concert. Starting off in near-darkness and without a word to the crowd, Paul appeared initially nervous, but was smiling broadly by the end of the 11-track set. While Paul's performance was not shown live online, it later appeared in full on the official YouTube stream.
Some of the biggest cheers during his set came for "BTSTU," a track that mixes Prince-like sensuality with fuzzy electronics and has been sampled by both Drake and Beyoncé. "I know I've been gone a long time," Paul sang, "but I'm back and want what is mine."
Ocean first rose to promise with "Nostalgia, Ultra," a 2011 mixtape. In the years since he has become a cult favorite, a major-label star, a Grammy winner, a chart-topper and a disrupter of those very systems, only further fueling the fan mythology around him. Following the success of his 2012 debut album, "Channel Orange," Ocean waited four years to release a follow-up, eventually unveiling two projects -- one, the visual album "Endless," to satisfy his record deal, and another, "Blonde," released independently -- along with a magazine titled Boys Don't Cry.
Although Ocean released a few one-off singles and played a small slate of concerts, mostly at festivals, the following year, he soon receded from view again.
In 2019, in association with his internet radio show Blonded, Ocean attempted to start a series of club nights -- dubbed PrEP+ after the H.I.V. prevention drug -- that he called a "homage to what could have been of the 1980s NYC club scene" if the medication had existed then. After three events in New York and two additional singles, plans to expand the parties into "larger raves across the world" were spoiled by the pandemic, the singer said later in a statement delivered to fans via merchandise.
He added, seemingly in the third person, "The Recording Artist has since changed his mind about the singles model, and is again interested in more durational bodies of work."
Onstage at Coachella, Ocean didn't debut any new music in full, but he did mention a new album was on the way. As the vast audience screamed in delight, Ocean quietened the crowd. "Not right now," he said. "It's not right now."

Full text: Mr. Leclerc said on Instagram on Sunday that his address had become public and that fans had been gathering at his apartment asking for pictures and autographs.
A Ferrari Formula 1 driver in Monaco is drawing firm boundaries with overzealous fans who have shown up uninvited at his private residence, about a year after he was robbed while taking a selfie.
The driver, Charles Leclerc, who was born and raised in Monaco, pleaded with fans on Sunday not to show up at his home. He added that he would stop to talk to fans elsewhere, like in the streets or at the track.
"For the past few months my home address has somehow become public, leading to people gathering beneath my apartment, ringing my bell and asking for pictures and autographs," Mr. Leclerc said in a now-expired story on his Instagram page.
"While I'm always happy to be there for you and truly appreciate your support, please respect my privacy and refrain from coming to my house," he continued, adding that he would not respond to unsolicited visitors.
"Your support, both in person and on social media, means the world to me, but there is a boundary that should not be crossed," he said.
Mr. Leclerc's management team and the government authorities in Monaco who investigate such matters did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
It's not uncommon for celebrities to come face-to-face with overly excited fans, sometimes called stans, a term derived from a 2000 Eminem song about a fan who becomes so obsessed, he kills.
On occasion, the authorities have known to get involved when interactions become dangerous or unlawful. Last September, an Ohio man was sentenced to more than three years in prison after a dozen years of harassing the actress Eva LaRue and her daughter. In 2019, a man pleaded no contest to stalking Rihanna after he was accused of breaking into the pop star's California home a year earlier, according to KABC, a local news station. He was sentenced to five years of probation.
Mr. Leclerc's concerns about privacy come days after the authorities in Italy arrested four people in connection with the theft of his watch last year. Last April, Mr. Leclerc was robbed by two people wearing helmets, who asked for a selfie in Viareggio, a seaside community in northern Italy, according to Reuters.
The perpetrators took his Richard Mille watch. While it's unclear how much Mr. Leclerc's particular watch was worth, watches from the same maker can range in price from the upper five figures to over $ 2.5 million, according to Gear Patrol, a product-buying guide for technology, cars, watches and more.
Mr. Leclerc is currently ranked 10th in Formula 1, and he came in seventh place at the Rolex Australian Grand Prix qualifying race this month.
After participating in GP3 and Formula Two as a teenager, Mr. Leclerc made his debut in Formula 1 in 2018, and has steadily made a name for himself.
When he's not on the track, Mr. Leclerc remains a thrill seeker and looks for ways to decompress from racing. Last year, he told The New York Times that he had taken up flying as way to challenge himself.
"Over a whole season, you can definitely feel the benefit of having time to relax in between the races, to think about something else, to take time for yourself, with your family, your friends," he said. "This is very important."

Former Barcelona Star Seeks to Reinvent The Sport He Loves: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Gerard Piqué has always been an ideas guy. He has, at various times, had ideas about industries as disconnected as isotonic sports drinks and international tennis tournaments. He has invested in the sunglasses business and the cellphone video game industry. He has dabbled in media rights and soccer team ownership and organic burgers.
For a long time, Piqué did all of that while also being one of the standout soccer players of his generation, a cornerstone on a series of Barcelona squads that harvested glory in industrial quantities and a key component on a Spanish national team that won a World Cup and a European Championship. Excelling at soccer, though, was never enough.
"One of the first things he said to me was that he had finished training by 12," said Nicolas Julia, the founder of the digital sports platform Sorare. "Some of his teammates liked to play video games. Some were happy hanging out with their families. He loved to go to the office and build something."
He was driven to do so, those who have worked with him say, because he knew that soccer would not last forever. "I think he saw a lot of his teammates retire and have nothing to do," said Javier Alonso, a former colleague. "They were only 35 but had no real life except eating in nice restaurants and playing padel. He did not want that."
Piqué was well suited to his side hustle. He is not, by all accounts, much given to sleep. He is a natural networker, a frequent and instinctive schmoozer. His decade-long relationship with the pop singer Shakira gave him a profile outside sports. He has a mind one associate described with the Spanish word "inquieto": restless, curious, perhaps just a touch easily distracted. He is far more flexible than might be expected of someone so famous, Alonso said, adding, "He is happy to listen to experts."
Indeed, Piqué found his side career so rewarding that late last year he decided to bring it front and center. A couple of weeks before the start of the World Cup, he declared Barcelona's next game would be his last. Business had "never been an afterthought for him," Julia said. Now, he wanted to go all in.
Rather than fit his work around his training schedule, Piqué now devotes much of his time to Kosmos, the investment vehicle he established in 2018 with the help of capital from Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder of the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, a former Barcelona shirt sponsor.
He had used it to invest in areas "he understands the most," as Julia put it, usually at the intersection of sports and technology. There was a production arm, focused largely on sports documentaries, and an athlete management wing. He had set up an e-sports team and taken over the running of F.C. Andorra, a minor league soccer club in Spain.
There have been successes: Sorare has grown exponentially since his investment; F.C. Andorra has been promoted to Spain's second tier for the first time; and Koi, his e-sports franchise, has become a major player.
His two biggest plays, though, have been wreathed in controversy. In 2020, Kosmos helped arrange a deal to stage the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. When it emerged that Piqué, then an active player, had reportedly received a $ 25.9 million commission, both he and the Spanish soccer federation had to insist there was nothing illegal about the arrangement.
Then, this year, the International Tennis Federation prematurely ended his most valuable, high-profile project: a $ 3 billion, 25-year deal with Kosmos, signed in 2018, to turn the Davis Cup into a World Cup-style event. Both sides have subsequently threatened to sue the other.
Those setbacks, though, have not discouraged Piqué. As Alonso, a former chief executive of the company, once said of Kosmos: "What we do here is Gerard dreams, and we try to make those dreams a reality." His latest dream is an ambitious one. Piqué wants to take the game that made him a star, and make it better.
Waning Attention
The future of soccer appeared to Piqué while he was on his way to lunch. Not so much the fine details: the dodgeball-style kickoffs, the secret weapons and the guest stars disguised by lucha libre masks all came later. But by the time he had finished his 15-minute walk from his office in Barcelona to the restaurant, the big picture was clear in his mind.
Soccer's central problem, as Piqué diagnosed it, was this: For an audience raised on a diet of bite-size content and guided by the instant satisfaction algorithms of YouTube and Twitch and TikTok, 90 minutes is actually quite a long time.
The traditional soccer game, he decided, contains far too many opportunities for eyes to wander: throw-ins, say, or teams getting their marking schemes right during corners. Younger viewers, Piqué was convinced, would not stand for that. The sport he had always loved would have to adapt.
How? He and Oriol Querol, the chief executive of Kosmos, spitballed ideas on their lunchtime stroll. Soccer should be shorter, for one. It had to minimize the natural pauses, or find a way to fill them. It had to copy and adopt the rhythms and features of video games and streaming and reality television to meet the viewers in their natural habitat.
By the time Piqué and Querol arrived for lunch, they had the outline of an idea. Within a few months, it would have a form: the Kings League, a seven-a-side competition staged in an indoor arena in Barcelona. Its dozen teams are largely made up of former players, and owned and run by some of the country's most prominent streamers.
By the metrics Piqué, Querol and their colleagues care about, it has been an overwhelming success. It accrued some 238 million views on TikTok in January -- more, Querol pointed out, than all of Europe's traditional leagues combined. More than two million people watched some or all of a single round of games at the end of February on Twitch, TikTok and YouTube.
Its Final Four-style playoffs, held on March 26, took place in the considerably grander surrounds of Camp Nou, the stadium where Piqué spent 14 years as a cornerstone of an all-conquering Barcelona team. The steep stands were packed with 92,000 ticket-buying fans.
That popularity has not been universally welcomed. Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, has been the most prominent, outspoken critic. The Kings League, he has said, is not a serious rival to his competition. It is just a "circus," he contends, filled with "streamers dressed up like clowns."
Piqué has been unmoved. The traditional "product of soccer is outdated," he said in response to Tebas. It is in desperate need of "more stimulating rules" to attract and engage a new generation of fans. He knew as he went to lunch that soccer had to change. The Kings League is his attempt to change it.
Enigma
At the turn of the year, a few months after their relationship ended, Shakira released a song that contained a number of extremely thinly veiled critiques of Piqué. The most barbed centered on his apparent infidelity. In one line, the singer accused him of trading "a Ferrari for a Twingo."
A couple of days after the song came out, with his nascent competition still aggravating all the right people, Piqué duly turned up at the league's headquarters in Barcelona at the wheel of a tiny white Renault Twingo. As he climbed, a little uneasily, out of the car, he grinned at the handful of photographers waiting for him. His smile betrayed a confidence that his joke would land.
The move was typical of the marketing strategy he adopted for the first season of the Kings League. He was not necessarily above turning his personal life into a promotional tool if it might generate interest: In reference to another line in the same song, suggesting he had swapped a "Rolex for a Casio," he would later claim (sarcastically) that the Japanese watchmaker had come on board as a sponsor.
He was happy to stoke controversy, too, even if it acted as an open invitation to the league's critics. In an early round of games, one team featured a mystery player, clad in a mask to hide his identity and registered only as Enigma. The player was, the Kings League let it be known, currently employed by a team in La Liga. (This was not strictly true.) The infamy was worth it for the intrigue.
Those confected dramas might seem to bear out Tebas's assessment of the Kings League as a circus, one that is not so much a pioneering vision of the future as a veterans' seven-a-side league garlanded by novelties and promoted with gimmicks.
Its evident popularity, though, warrants greater reflection. It has, as the sight of the heaving stands of Camp Nou made clear, found an audience. Much of that can be attributed, of course, to the presence not only of Piqué, Sergio Agüero and Iker Casillas, all of whom serve as team presidents, but also the likes of Ibai Llanos, the Spanish streamer, and Gerard Romero, a wildly popular online soccer journalist.
"The streamers were the key," Querol said. "You can make a case that Ibai is the most famous person in Spain now."
Viewers who have tuned in to see them, though, have at the very least not been deterred by the "more stimulating rules," drawn from a wide array of sources, that Piqué and his colleagues believe are vital for soccer to continue to flourish.
The concept of a player draft comes directly from American sports. Others are more esoteric: Kings League kickoffs, which feature both teams charging en masse for the ball, are drawn from water polo, and it has revived an approach to penalties last seen in Major League Soccer in the 1990s. (It is telling that one feature inherited from old-school soccer is a postseason transfer market: Piqué and Kosmos have identified that nobody is bored of transfer rumors.)
"We took some things from e-sports, too," said Querol, citing not only the decision to stream everything before, during and after games, but also a "total access" approach in which viewers can hear what referees and players are saying.
"Then we took things like each team having a secret weapon in each game, something they can use whenever they think it might have the most impact, whether it is a penalty or an extra player, from video games," Querol added. "But none of it is static. It's constant reflection. We change whatever we can change."
That process continued through the season. When Querol and his team noticed that games tended to drift at the end of the first half, they started cutting the number of players on the field at that precise moment. Anything, in other words, to keep the audience on its toes, to ensure that something was happening, to stop the eye from drifting and the thumb from scrolling.
"It is sport," Querol said. "It wouldn't work if the soccer was not of a high standard. That is really important." But that is not the only consideration. In his view, as in Piqué's, soccer cannot just be soccer anymore. "The priority," he said, "has to be the spectacle."
That, perhaps, is the point that all those critics who dismissed the Kings League have missed. It may well be a circus. But Piqué might respond that there is nothing wrong with being a circus. Circuses are popular. They draw a crowd, they hold the gaze, because nobody is ever quite sure what is coming next.

End of Gas-Engine Camaro Opens a New Door for Muscle Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: G.M. is ending production of the classic American sports car, but executives say an electric version is likely. Corvette is already planning one.
From rubber-scented street races to the grass-roots drag strips and tracks of America, the Chevrolet Camaro never shied from a fight. But General Motors' stalwart muscle car, first rushed to showrooms in 1966 to take on Ford's phenomenally popular Mustang, could not outrun the onslaught of sport utility vehicles and the industry's sprint to electrification.
G.M. announced last month that it would retire the Camaro in January, when a final 2024 model rolls off a Michigan assembly line. With Dodge closing up shop on its Charger and Challenger this year -- even as it teases an electric muscle car -- the Mustang is the sole surviving member of Detroit's "pony car" band of coupes and convertibles.
"It is a bummer," said Aaron Link, G.M.'s global vehicle performance manager. "The Camaro did everything we wanted it to do, but the car market is just shrinking."
After a long Camaro hiatus, a retro-tinged 2010 comeback model, along with an equally nostalgic Mustang and Challenger, kicked off a new golden age of muscle cars that had enough power, handling and safety to shame any '60s forebear. A star turn as Bumblebee, the shape-shifting Camaro in the Transformers franchise, introduced the Chevy to new buyers.
Yet two-door cars of all types have become especially hard to spot in tall seas of S.U.V.s. Many coupe models have been retired. These days, not even two in 100 American buyers choose a sports car. Just four models account for more than 70 percent of all sports-car sales: the Camaro, Corvette, Mustang and Challenger. Last year, the Camaro found 24,652 buyers, down from 129,000 in 2010 and a high of nearly 283,000 in 1979.
"The Camaro has become this incredibly sophisticated vehicle, and it's a shame nobody is buying it," said Eddie Alterman, chief brand officer of Hearst Autos and former editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine. That's despite the current version's notoriously constricted outward sight lines.
He added: "You almost admire how it's so focused on driving dynamics that nothing else matters. The message is: Screw what's behind you. What's important is the next corner."
The modern Camaro shares its "Alpha" platform with Cadillac's best sports sedans, including G.M.'s groundbreaking magnetic suspensions, a technology now adopted by Ferrari, Audi and others. For top Camaros and Shelby Mustangs, the old "muscle car" term hardly applies: These are four-seat sports cars that can meet or beat any big-name European rival, including in the curves.
In 2017, the Camaro ZL1 1LE slayed more giants. The 650-horsepower showroom Camaro wound through Germany's benchmark, 12.9-mile Nürburgring circuit in 7 minutes, 16 seconds. That topped several supercars costing three or four times its $ 69,995 price, including a Ferrari 488 GTB. In 2021, Elon Musk sent his best, 1,020-horsepower Tesla Model S Plaid to the 'ring and tweeted an unverified lap time: 14 seconds slower than the humble Chevy, an eternity on track, despite the Tesla's enormous edge in electric horsepower.
The Camaro name isn't bound for the junkyard, with G.M. executives broadly hinting it will return. But as the automaker vows to phase out internal combustion models by 2035, analysts say, any reconstituted Camaro will surely be an E.V. or a hybrid.
Mr. Alterman believes automakers can find a small, yet meaningful, place for distinctive, high-personality cars. "Everything else is a potato-shaped minivan surrogate, or a pickup truck," he said.
If the Mustang was a playful ray of sunshine, the 1967 Camaro had a mean streak, especially in hopped-up V-8 editions. Pressed for the origin of the Camaro name, Pete Estes, the Chevy general manager at the time, quipped that it meant "a vicious animal that eats Mustangs." A media blitz included a touring stage play ("Camaro!") and a women's clothing line.
Priced from $ 2,466, and $ 240 more for a convertible, the Chevy scored a hit with 221,000 sales, well off the Mustang's 472,000. Just 602 of those were the Z/28 version, a virtual factory-built racecar from a Chevrolet that officially had no racing involvement. Most buyers had no clue this undercover ringer existed, but insiders could order one via a near-secret sequence of option selections that triggered Z/28 factory production.
With backdoor Chevy support, the team owner and newly retired Corvette racer Roger Penske and the driver Mark Donohue soon dominated the rollicking TransAm racecar series. Their first Penske Sunoco Z/28 went to a Pebble Beach auction in 2021 at an estimated value of $ 1.4 million to $ 2 million, but did not sell. A 1969 ZL1, a big-block V-8 unicorn that was one of only 69 built, fetched a Camaro-record $ 1.1 million at auction in 2021.
The beloved "tri-year" Camaros spanned 1967 to 1969, from the Summer of Love to Altamont. That's where Mark Stielow comes in.
"That car changed my life," Mr. Stielow said, the moment the Ford zealot drove his '66 Mustang into enemy territory as a G.M. engineering intern in 1988. His allegiances shifted, despite his wrecking a pair of old Camaros via youthful exuberance -- a common fate for Detroit's ill-handling monsters of yore.
Now G.M.'s director of motorsports competition engineering, Mr. Stielow sums up the Chevy's enduring appeal, as an egalitarian performance car with the options of more-practical engines or convertibles that drew female buyers as well.
"There was enough of a trunk and back seat to haul your junk in," he said. "It could be your everyday car, your track car -- the Swiss Army knife of muscle cars."
The fruitful association has made Stielow a household name in hot rodding. In his spare time, Mr. Stielow's fantastical, knee-weakening Camaro restorations -- with names like "Tri-Tip" and "the Mule" -- inspired an entire rodding movement called Pro Touring. Its disciples build and race American classics with modern mechanicals hidden beneath nostalgic skins.
Wearing his G.M. hat, Mr. Stielow is helping shepherd a new NASCAR Camaro to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for a June run from "Garage 56," LeMans's annual invitation to a single car for an exhibition of new tech. It's enough to make the French pop their corks: The modified Camaro stock car will be driven by Jimmie Johnson, the seven-time NASCAR champion; Jenson Button, the British former Formula 1 champion; and Mike Rockenfeller, a two-time Le Mans winner.
Mr. Stielow and loyal originalists prefer pioneering models. To others, including the late Bill Mitchell, a onetime G.M. chief designer, the 1970 successor was the masterpiece, a designer's car versus a committee creation. With its alluring tubular fenders and eggcrate grille, this radically new Camaro was heavily influenced by Ferrari 250 GTs.
"G.M. guys were totally obsessed with Ferraris of the time," Mr. Alterman said.
Fast times couldn't last. The first fuel-economy and emissions rules, and the 1973 oil embargo by Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, choked the life from muscle cars. By 1975, the Camaro's strongest V-8 was a 155-horsepower peashooter.
If early Camaros were classic boomer rock, a third-generation model -- sold from 1982 to 1992 -- was '80s hair metal, more meretricious flash and dubious accessories than performance chops. Indignities peaked with the '82 "Iron Duke" Camaro, often cited as among the worst cars ever built, powered by a 90-horsepower four-cylinder engine. Even a Camaro IROC Z V-8 was a plasticized poseur.
Buyers didn't mind, snapping up 262,000 Camaros in 1984. The Camaro had become a patron saint of convenience-store parking lots, homecoming dances and extralegal adolescent high jinks, from stoplight races to the odd lawn job. When Bruce Springsteen sang of roads haunted by "burned-out Chevrolets," he surely had Camaros in mind more than its country-club sibling, the Corvette.
Not all cultural associations were kind. The Chevy's somewhat jockish, lunkhead vibe was easy to lampoon, notably in the Dead Milkmen's tart 1984 song, "Bitchin' Camaro."
A streamlined fourth-generation model for 1993 restored legitimacy, including via optional Corvette-based V-8s. Yet sales of those Camaros dwindled to 29,000 in 2001, and Chevy pulled the plug the next year.
Al Oppenheiser, the Camaro's chief engineer, who now develops General Motors E.V.s, likes to say everyone has a Camaro story. Here is mine. No, it's not the time my teenage pal Donnie wrecked his father's Camaro on Gratiot Avenue in Detroit, sending my head and a Burrito Supreme through the windshield. I walked away mostly unscathed. The burrito did not recover.
In 2017, I drove that stick-shift Camaro ZL1 1LE from Rick Hendrick's NASCAR garage in North Carolina to Daytona, Fla. My fast-paced pilgrimage culminated in an audience with the four-time NASCAR champ Jeff Gordon as he prepared to pace the Daytona 500 in history's fastest Camaro. Mr. Gordon owned a previous-generation Camaro, but told me that the race would be his first go-round in the new ZL1.
"I can remember when 300 horsepower was big for a street car, and now we're more than double that," Mr. Gordon said. With the Chevy drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Chase Elliott in the front row behind his car, directly in his rearview mirror, Mr. Gordon's competitive juices clearly flowed.
"This Camaro is capable of pacing the race if it went green," he said with a wink.
The latest industry arms race, powered by batteries, finds some E.V.s zapping past 1,000 horsepower. In late March, I drove a fossil-fueled Corvette in California's high desert, where Mr. Link, the G.M. development driver, has also been putting finishing touches on the first electrified Corvette. The 2024 E-Ray goes on sale later this year. With 655 hybrid horsepower, it already accelerates faster than any Corvette in a 70-year history.
Camaro fans may shed a tear at the close of an epic, thrilling chapter, but it appears more a cliffhanger. Whatever form a future electric Camaro takes, vintage muscle-car fans won't know what hit them.

Italy's Premier Returns To Her Rightist Roots, Pushing Surrogacy Ban: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has ordered municipalities to stop certifying foreign birth certificates for same-sex couples who used surrogacy, leaving some babies in a legal limbo.
MILAN -- After a long flight from Seattle with their newborn son crying in their laps, an Italian couple gathered their infant's American birth certificate from the overhead compartment, got his American passport stamped and found friends and neighbors cheering with celebratory balloons outside their Milan apartment.
But the Italian state was less welcoming to Davide Fassi, 49; his longtime partner, Davide Chiappa, 44; and their son, Martino Libero Fassi Chiappa, who was born through surrogacy by an American woman.
In the days before they returned to Italy last month, the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ordered municipalities to obey a court ruling made in December and stop certifying foreign birth certificates of children born to Italian same-sex couples through surrogacy, which is illegal in Italy.
The decision has left Martino Libero and several other children suspended in a legal limbo, depriving them of automatic Italian citizenship and residency rights like access to the country's free health care system and nursery school.
"He's a tourist now, an immigrant," said Mr. Fassi as he and Mr. Chiappa sat on a couch in their apartment next to the now-deflated balloons and the cradle of the sleeping baby, clad in lion pajamas and lifting his arms in a dream.
The government ban -- backed up by law enforcement visits to the registry office in Milan -- has become the first prominent sign of a hard-right ideological edge that Ms. Meloni has mostly checked since winning election in September.
Her critics now fear she intends to feed her base by slicing away rights that run counter to the conservative vision of family long promoted by Ms. Meloni, who once famously denounced birth certificates that listed "Parent 1" and "Parent 2" instead of "Mother" and "Father."
Milan, a city that has long served as a cosmopolitan haven for same-sex couples in Italy, has for now complied with the Meloni government order and suspended issuing Italian birth certificates.
Without official recognition, Libero Martino, 2 months old this month, will have to leave and re-enter the country every few months to remain legal. A court could eventually recognize one of the men as the biological father -- they decline to say which one is the sperm donor -- and then they could start a separate adoption process for the other. But in the meantime, they say, their son is stuck.
"The most important thing is the status," said Mr. Chiappa, who wore "Best Dad Ever" socks and obsessively washed the baby's blue pacifier every time it fell on the floor.
"The most important thing," added Mr. Fassi, who whispered, "Ciao, Martino," when the boy stirred, "is that he is our son."
Ms. Meloni's government has sought to shift the issue away from the status of the children to the practice of surrogacy, which, while legal in the United States and Canada, is illegal or restricted in much of Europe outside of Greece, Ukraine and a few other countries. In Italy, home of the Vatican, it is not only illegal, but it is also widely opposed, including among Catholic corners of the center-left opposition.
That has made it an easy issue for Ms. Meloni.
Eugenia Roccella, the minister for family, birthrate and equal opportunity, has railed against the "uterus for rent," warned of "a market of babies" and argued that there was a "racist connotation" to the practice in which having white women carry fetuses cost more than Black women.
Prominent members of Ms. Meloni's Brothers of Italy party have called surrogacy a crime "even worse than pedophilia," in which gay couples, one of whom is usually the biological father, seek to "pass off" children as their own and mistake "children for Smurfs," saying gay couples can uniquely afford surrogacy, even though it is overwhelmingly used more by heterosexual couples.
The party is floating a proposal, made by Ms. Meloni when she was a member of Parliament, to make Italians' seeking of surrogate births abroad -- what she had called "procreative tourism" -- illegal and "punishable with three months to two years of prison and a fine of 600,000 to a million euros."
Ms. Meloni's impassioned speeches against same-sex parents became a rallying point for conservatives around the globe, but were also sampled, ironically, into a house music anthem that played in the clubs and on the radio. (Audio of her saying "Parent 1, Parent 2" was played on a loop before she screamed "I am Giorgia.") And Ms. Meloni telegraphed her tough line on the campaign trail.
In an interview shortly before her election, as her young daughter ran around her in a Sardinia courtyard, Ms. Meloni said she opposed gay marriage, not because she was homophobic -- "I've got many, many homosexual friends" -- but because she saw it as a step to same-sex adoption, which she opposed, and which the Roman Catholic Church successfully lobbied to exclude from a civil unions law passed in 2016.
Ms. Meloni said that growing up without a father -- he abandoned the family in Rome for the Canary Islands -- convinced her that only married families should adopt. She acknowledged that since she is not married, but in a long-term relationship with her companion, the father of her daughter, she, too, in her view, should not be allowed to adopt.
"If tomorrow we will have really lots of babies in the institutions waiting for somebody, I will tell you, 'Everybody can adopt,"' she said. "But it's not the reality of today. So me, I want to give that child the best. Is that unpresentable? Is that the monster? No, I'm not a monster."
But some same-sex couples say Ms. Meloni's fangs are showing.
"It's the real side," Mr. Fassi said.
"The litmus test," Mr. Chiappa said.
"It's only the beginning," they said in unison.
Last month Mr. Fassi and Mr. Chiappa spoke at a major rally in Milan attended by about 10,000 people. After they left the stage, Elly Schlein, the new leader of the liberal opposition and herself an L.G.B.T.Q. woman, told the crowd, "This retrograde majority has inexplicably lashed out at children ideologically."
For the couples who planned to visit Room 143 of the Milan hall of public records to register foreign births, it is painful. But Gaia Romani, a city official who helps the couples navigate a complicated terrain of transcription, adoption and certification policy, explained that Ms. Meloni had tied her hands.
She recounted the "political act" of law enforcement officials' showing up to demand the records of all children registered to same-sex couples since 2015 and then putting her office on notice that they could undo any registration in the past two years.
The city handed over the records so as not to risk the removal of Mayor Giuseppe Sala, who signed many of the certificates, or to provoke the Meloni government into reversing the status of children it had already certified, what Ms. Romani considered "surely the next step."
She personally called the eight families, including Mr. Fassi and Mr. Chiappa, waiting to register their children to explain the situation. At a meeting in her office, which she said had been transformed into a "nursery school," parents asked "very operational" questions to "guarantee all the rights possible" to the children. She said her office would look to the courts to find wiggle room, but she was not optimistic.
"Taking rights away doesn't cost anything," she said, adding that she had expected Ms. Meloni to come after the children of same-sex couples, just "not so quickly."
Mr. Fassi, on the other hand, said that as soon as Ms. Meloni won election, he told his partner she would "do something" to disturb their dream of having a child.
On their first date, in 2009, overlooking Milan's duomo, the two men talked about the idea of gay couples' having families. Both pursued careers in other countries -- China for Mr. Fassi, a professor of public design, France for Mr. Chiappa, who works in fashion -- and had a civil union in 2017, with an exchange of vows.
"We were mentioning the three cats, and then we said, who knows, maybe in the future a child of our own," Mr. Fassi recalled, his eyes welling.
Covid slowed their timeline, but they used Zoom to interview Italian couples and friends who had become parents through surrogacy. They said at least 15 such couples lived in the neighborhood, and even the priest at the parish Mr. Fassi attended seemed supportive. They settled on a surrogate in Oregon.
On Feb. 1, Mr. Chiappa welcomed Martino Libero in the delivery room while Mr. Fassi nervously listened to his playlist in the waiting room.
He recalled the song playing at that moment: "Milano Good Vibes."

Steering Past Chaos, Verstappen Cruises To Win in Melbourne: [Sports Desk]

Full text: One car ended its day in a spray of gravel on the first lap. A second sent its driver scrambling to safety after it caught fire. A third team lost both its entries when they collided only minutes from the finish. Red Bull? Its top driver cruised into his usual position, first place, and stayed there all day.
Max Verstappen snatched the lead in the Australian Grand Prix with a ruthless early pass and then never gave it back on Sunday, powering to his second Formula 1 victory of the year and reinforcing the suggestion -- put forth by some of his top rivals -- that his Red Bull team might just be unbeatable.
Verstappen's dominant performance was the highlight of a day that included multiple stoppages, a thrilling duel between former world champions for second place and a chaotic late restart that crumpled a half-dozen cars and rearranged the finishing order. Verstappen steered clear of all of that, opening a lead of more than 10 seconds at one point on a day when he was never truly challenged.
"It was a bit of a mess, but we survived everything," Verstappen said. "We won, which is of course the most important."
Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time world champion in the midst of a frustrating season, held off Fernando Alonso, the veteran champion now driving for Aston Martin, for second place. On a day when neither had a chance of beating Verstappen, that qualified as its own kind of win.
Sunday's Race in Photos
Where the Race Turned
A red flag on Lap 9 stopped the race for 16 minutes and, crucially, gave Verstappen a free run at the early leader, Hamilton. He took it almost immediately, passing Hamilton like a roadside fruit stand and continuing to pull away. The gap was soon two seconds, then four, then eight. And the racing, at least for first place, was effectively over.
Magic Number: 3
Alonso finished third again, the same spot he has held in each of the season's first three races. That position was briefly in doubt, though, after he was spun by Ferrari's Carlos Sainz on the last competitive restart of the day. That led to some tense minutes as race officials reviewed video, considered penalties and decided the order for the last, slow-speed lap that ended the race. "We had a roller-coaster of emotions today, many things going on at the beginning, and the last half an hour," Alonso said. "Mercedes were very fast and Lewis did an incredible job. I could not match the pace, but we'll take P3."
Worst Days, Ranked
Charles Leclerc. His race ended before he could complete a lap, nudged off the track and into the gravel in a collision with Aston Martin's Lance Stroll on Turn 3. That is two DNFs in three races for Leclerc. But Ferrari's forgettable day somehow got worse when a five-second penalty on Sainz sent him down to 13th, and pushed the team out of the points altogether.
George Russell. If Leclerc had a nightmare day, Russell's wasn't far behind. He took the lead from Verstappen on the first turn but barely got a chance to enjoy the view. He soon came under pressure from his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, and then went in for an early pit stop and was trapped there when Alex Albon's crash spread gravel across the track and brought out a red flag. The nadir for Russell? His engine caught fire on Lap 18, leaving him looking for a place to stop it and scamper out. He walked away from the smoking wreck and didn't look back.
Alpine. The day had been bright for the pink cars of Alpine, but it all went dark on the last restart when Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon -- running fifth and 10th -- came together in a chaotic few moments that eventually took out a half-dozen cars. Within seconds, Alpine's two hopes for points were sliding along a wall in the grass one behind the other. "Unbelievable," was about all the team principal, Otmar Szafnauer, could muster as analysis.
This Week's Red Bull Rally
Two weeks after Verstappen rallied from 15th place to finish second, his Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez got a chance to show off the team's clear competitive advantage. Sent to the back of the starting grid after beaching his car in a sea of gravel during qualifying on Saturday, Pérez methodically clawed his way through the field. He wound up fifth at the end, salvaging some points -- and his weekend.
What They're Saying
"There's no way I'm losing out to him." -- Hamilton, on the radio, focused on the driver behind him (his old rival Alonso) rather than the one in front of him (Verstappen).
"What?!" -- Multiple drivers, after the race was red-flagged for the second time with two laps to go. The decision was caused by debris on the track after Kevin Magnussen clipped the wall and destroyed his right rear tire. Little did the drivers know it would not be the day's last stoppage; the restart led to a third red flag, and another day, before the race mercifully crept through a parade lap to the checkered flag.
"No, it cannot be. It's unacceptable!" -- Carlos Sainz of Ferrari after learning he was assessed a five-second penalty for spinning Alonso on a late restart. The penalty pushed him out of the top five, and out of the points.

Germany Pushing E.U. For Exemption to Build Synthetic-Fuel Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Berlin and Brussels are scrambling for a solution after Germany calls for allowing cars to run on synthetic fuels. The move could endanger the E.U.'s climate goals.
Germany is negotiating with the European Union to win an exception to the proposed 2035 ban on internal combustion engines to permit cars to run on carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, the country's Transportation Ministry said on Wednesday.
Berlin's abrupt decision in early March to seek a change in the measure on the eve of its final vote has caused a rift among E.U. governments and even automakers, and threatens to undermine legislation that is a cornerstone of the European Union's ambitious plans to make the 27-member bloc carbon-neutral by 2050.
The move is supported by some carmakers, including Porsche, but it has provoked criticism from other manufacturers that have begun spending huge sums to shift their production toward electric vehicles in anticipation of the ban.
Ford Motor and Volvo were among several dozen companies that signed a letter on Monday addressed to European leaders, warning that watering down the terms of a transition to electric vehicles could endanger their businesses as well as the environment.
"The lack of a strong regulatory framework could have significant consequences for businesses' decarbonization plans," the letter read.
Germany's Transport Ministry said it was in talks with European Commission regulators seeking a provision in the measure that would allow for the sale of cars with engines that were capable of running only on such synthetic fuels, known as e-fuels. Tim Alexandrin, a spokesman for the ministry, described the talks as "advanced" and "complex."
The commission is striving to reach an agreement with Berlin before leaders of the 27 member states arrive for a European Council summit on Thursday.
"I am confident that we can find a way to make sure that the interpretation we give to the agreement is also to the satisfaction of the German authorities," Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission who oversees the bloc's push toward climate neutrality, said last week.
E-fuels are made using electricity generated from renewable sources like wind or solar to separate hydrogen from water, and then combining the hydrogen with carbon dioxide captured from air or other sources. When the resulting fuel is burned in an engine, carbon dioxide comes out of the tailpipe, but the idea is that those emissions are offset by the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere to produce the fuel.
But e-fuels tend to be expensive and not easily available, and there are doubts about the ability to scale up production by 2035.
If Germany is successful in forcing through a carve-out on e-fuels, it will be the latest time that Berlin has intervened on behalf of its powerful automobile industry to water down Brussels's efforts to curb transportation emissions. More than a quarter of all carbon-dioxide emissions in the European Union are generated by vehicles, according to government statistics.
But with its 800,000 jobs and annual revenue of about 411 billion euros ( $ 443 billion), the automobile industry flexes outsize influence in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
It has long held sway over the country's leaders. Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened in 2013 to prevent European legislation that would tighten emissions rules and, four years later, lobbied again to weaken E.U. emissions testing procedures that were intended to prevent cheating of the kind that Volkswagen committed with its diesel engines.
This time it is Germany's luxury car industry that is pushing back against Brussels's latest attempt to rein in vehicle emissions. Porsche is among the leading proponents of e-fuels and has backed a production facility that opened in Chile last year, even as it continues to develop its popular electric Taycan model.
"E-fuels are a feasible alternative to reduce CO2 emissions rather quickly," Oliver Blume, who is chief executive at both Porsche and Volkswagen, told reporters last week. He said the 1.3 billion vehicles with combustion engines already on the global market would still be driven for decades, especially in developing economies, and would benefit from fuel with no net emissions.
"If you look at climate protection as a whole, this is not only a German or a European issue alone, it is a worldwide affair," Mr. Blume said.
Several companies that supply Germany's auto industry support including e-fuels in the European rules, including Bosch, Mahle and ZF, as well as major energy companies, including Exxon Mobil.
Italy, home to Ferrari and Fiat, joined the resistance after Germany raised concerns, along with the Czech Republic, Austria and Poland. If enough countries decide not to pass the measure, that could endanger its prospects.
But e-fuels have usually been seen as a future fuel for industrial uses, not cars. Even with plans to increase production, the amount of e-fuels projected to be available in Germany by 2035 would be sufficient to meet only 10 percent of the country's fuel needs in its air, shipping and chemical industries, according to a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Unlike cars, those industries cannot rely on electrification alone to reduce their carbon footprint, the institute said.
Volker Wissing, a member of the Free Democrats party who serves as Germany's minister of transport, argues that despite such warnings, all options need to be kept open in the push to reach climate neutrality.
"We are convinced that we need every technological solution to achieve our ambitious climate protection targets and keep society mobile," Mr. Wissing said.
But analysts point out that his party, the smallest of the three partners that make up the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, may have been driven by more than just concern for the environment in promoting e-fuels. Since entering the government, the party has seen its popularity nearly halved to just 6 percent, with key state elections planned in Bavaria and Hesse this year. Challenging Brussels could be seen as a way to reverse that slide by attracting approval from Germans who favor combustion engines.
"The Free Democrats always have to worry a bit about their parliamentary existence," said Uwe Jun, a political scientist at the University of Trier, referring to the fact that the party fell out of Parliament in 2013 after failing to meet the 5 percent threshold needed for representation.
Senior German government officials insist that they are confident that the Free Democrats will not let the standoff reach a point of actually sinking the European policy, saying that internally, the party has made clear it would accept a compromise.
"It remains our goal to reach an agreement," Mr. Alexandrin said.

In Venezuela, Economy's Up, But Not for All: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- In the capital, a store sells Prada purses and a 110-inch television for $ 115,000. Not far away, a Ferrari dealership has opened, while a new restaurant allows well-off diners to enjoy a meal seated atop a giant crane overlooking the city.
"When was the last time you did something for the first time?" the restaurant's host boomed over a microphone to excited customers as they sang along to a Coldplay song.
This is not Dubai or Tokyo, but Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, where a socialist revolution once promised equality and an end to the bourgeoisie.
Venezuela's economy imploded nearly a decade ago, prompting a huge outflow of migrants in one of worst crises in modern Latin American history. Now there are signs the country is settling into a new, disorienting normality, with everyday products easily available, poverty starting to lessen -- and surprising pockets of wealth arising.
That has left the socialist government of the authoritarian President Nicolás Maduro presiding over an improving economy as the opposition is struggling to unite and as the United States has scaled back oil sanctions that helped decimate the country's finances.
Conditions remain dire for a huge portion of the population, and while the hyperinflation that crippled the economy has moderated, prices still triple annually, among the worst rates in the world.
But with the government's ease of restrictions on the use of U.S. dollars to address Venezuela's economic collapse, business activity is returning to what was once the region's wealthiest nation.
As a result, Venezuela is increasingly a country of haves and have-nots, and one of the world's most unequal societies, according to Encovi, a respected national poll by the Institute of Economic and Social Research of the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas.
Mr. Maduro has boasted that the economy grew by 15 percent last year over the previous year and that tax collections and exports also rose -- though some economists stress that the economy's growth is misleading because it followed years of huge declines.
For the first time in seven years, poverty is decreasing: Half of the nation lives in poverty, down from 65 percent in 2021, according to the Encovi poll.
But the survey also found that the wealthiest Venezuelans were 70 times richer than the poorest, putting the country on par with some countries in Africa that have the highest rates of inequality in the world.
And access to U.S. dollars is often limited to people with ties to the government or those involved in illicit businesses. A study last year by Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, found that illegal businesses such as food, diesel, human and gas smuggling represented more than 20 percent of the Venezuelan economy.
Though parts of Caracas bustle with residents who can afford a growing array of imported goods, one in three children across Venezuela was suffering from malnutrition as of May 2022, according to the National Academy of Medicine.
Up to seven million Venezuelans have simply given up and abandoned their homeland since 2015, according to the United Nations.
And despite the Maduro administration's new slogan -- "Venezuela is fixed" -- many scrape by on the equivalent of only a few dollars a day, while public-sector employees have taken to the streets to protest low salaries.
"I have to do back flips," said María Rodríguez, 34, a medical lab analyst in Cumaná, a small city 250 miles east of the capital, explaining that, to pay for food and her daughter's school tuition, she relied on two jobs, a side business selling beauty products and money from her relatives.
Yrelys Jiménez, a preschool teacher in San Diego de los Altos, a half-hour drive south of Caracas, joked that her $ 10 monthly salary meant "food for today and hunger for tomorrow." (The restaurant that allows diners to eat 150 feet above the ground charges $ 140 a meal.)
Despite such hardship, Mr. Maduro, whose administration did not respond to requests for comment, has focused on promoting the country's rising economic indicators.
"It seems that the sick person recovers, stops, walks and runs," he said in a recent speech, comparing Venezuela with a suddenly cured hospital patient.
The United States' shifting strategy toward Venezuela has in part benefited his administration.
In November, after the Maduro administration agreed to restart talks with the opposition, the Biden administration issued Chevron an extendable six-month license to pump oil in Venezuela. The deal stipulates that the profits be used to pay off debts owed to Chevron by the Venezuelan government.
And while the United States still bans purchases from the state oil company, the country has increased black-market oil sales to China through Iran, energy experts said.
Mr. Maduro is also emerging from isolation in Latin America as a regional shift to the left has led to a thaw in relations. Colombia and Brazil, both led by recently elected leftist leaders, have restored diplomatic relations. Colombia's new president, Gustavo Petro, has been particularly warm to Mr. Maduro, meeting with him repeatedly and agreeing to a deal to import Venezuelan gas.
With presidential elections planned next year and the opposition's parallel government having recently disbanded, Mr. Maduro seems increasingly confident about his political future.
Last year's inflation rate of 234 percent ranks Venezuela second in the world, behind Sudan, but it pales in comparison to the hyperinflation seen in 2019, when the rate ballooned to 300,000 percent, according to the World Bank.
With production and prices up, Venezuela has also started to see an increase in revenues from oil, its key export. The country's production of nearly 700,000 barrels a day is higher than last year's, though it was twice as high in 2018 and four times as high in 2013, said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Latin America energy policy fellow at Rice University.
The Venezuelan government's loosening of restrictions on dollars has made it easier for some people to use money sent from abroad. In many cases, no cash is actually exchanged. Venezuelans with means increasingly use digital apps like Zelle to use dollars in accounts outside the country to pay for goods and services.
Still, U.S. officials call Venezuela's economic picture somewhat illusory.
"They were able to adjust to a lot of their problems after sanctions were implemented through dollarization," according to Mark A. Wells, a deputy assistant secretary of state, "and so it starts to look over time that they are able to reach a status that basically helps the elites there, but the poor are still very, very poor."
"So, it's not that everything is more stable and better there," Mr. Wells added.
Mr. Maduro took office nearly 10 years ago and was last elected in 2018 in a vote that was widely considered a sham and was disavowed by much of the international community.
The widespread belief that Mr. Maduro won fraudulently led the National Assembly to deem the presidency vacant and use a provision in the Constitution to name a new leader, Juan Guaidó, a former student leader. He was recognized by dozens of countries, including the United States, as Venezuela's legitimate ruler.
But as the figurehead of a parallel government that had oversight over frozen international financial accounts, he had no power within the country.
In December, the National Assembly ousted Mr. Guaidó and scrapped the interim government, a move some observers considered a boost to Mr. Maduro. A number of opposition figures have announced that they will run in a primary scheduled for October, even though many political analysts are skeptical that Mr. Maduro will allow a credible vote.
"What Maduro does have today is an opposition that is disjointed and dispersed," Mr. Guaidó said in an interview. "He also has a majority of the people against him. He continues being a dictator without popular support, a destroyed economy, which was his own fault, with professors, nurses, older people and workers protesting right now as we speak."
Even people like Eugenia Monsalves, who owns a medical supply company in Caracas and sends her two daughters to private schools, is frustrated with the country's direction.
Though she is upper middle class, she said she still had to watch how she spends her money.
She goes out to eat occasionally and has visited some of the city's new luxury stores, but without buying anything.
"The vast majority of Venezuelans live in a complicated situation, very complicated," she said.
Ms. Monsalves believes the Maduro administration needs to go, but she worries that the best candidates were forced into exile or disqualified. The opposition, she said, has not coalesced around what it most needs: a leader who can energize the electorate.
"That's what I most want, like many other Venezuelans," she said. "But the truth is that without a clear vision from the opposition, a clear platform from a single candidate, I think it's going to be hard."

Red Bull Goes 1-2, With Pérez First This Time: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe George Russell had it right.
Almost as soon as Russell climbed out of his car early this month after the first race of the Formula 1 season, he declared the chase for the season championship over. Red Bull's cars, he said, were simply too fast. "They have got this championship sewn up," Russell said at the time. Red Bull, he said, might just win every race.
So far, that is just what it is doing. Sergio Pérez breezed to Red Bull's second victory in two races on Sunday, capturing the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix with a performance nearly as dominant as the one turned in by his teammate Max Verstappen the last time out.
That Verstappen did not win himself was only the result of a bit of bad luck: He broke the drive shaft on his car during qualifying Saturday, forcing him into a repair that left him starting 15th. It hardly mattered.
Pérez, who had started in pole position, lost the lead to Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin before the first turn, won it back by the fourth lap and slowly and methodically pulled away for his fifth career victory.
Verstappen, meanwhile, was picking his way through the pack behind him with ease. Told before the race of a prediction by a rival that his car was so fast that he would be "P2 by Lap 25," Verstappen shrugged and said he would do his best.
But when the 25th lap arrived, that was right where he was: P2, or second place, with only his teammate Pérez ahead. By then the Red Bulls were cruising, and the sense of resignation about their unmatched speed -- a feeling that was palpable all week in Jeddah -- was spreading.
"Red Bull," the Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc said before the race, "is on another planet."
Max Verstappen's Wild Ride
Verstappen had played down his chances of victory from the moment a broken drive shaft ended his qualifying early Saturday and left him in 15th place. But that did not mean he had any intention of staying in the back of the field.
It took him only eight laps to move into 10th place, and only eight more to rise to fifth. By the halfway point of the race, and helped by the fortuitous arrival of a safety car that allowed him to make up even more ground, Verstappen was in second.
Some radio traffic between Verstappen and his garage suggested his mechanical issues may not have been over, but that was forgotten after he closed the race with the fastest lap of the day. That earned a bonus point, which was just enough to nudge Pérez out of the top spot in the season standings.
He and Red Bull remain, without question, the team to beat.
"I've definitely never seen a car so fast," said Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, a seven-time world champion. "When we were fast, we weren't that fast."
Track Position, Lap by Lap
Verstappen's day might have been a constant climb but others were not so fortunate. Click on each driver to see their changes in track position.
Sunday's Race in Photos
Alonso Third. No, Fourth. No, Third.
OK, read this slowly because it gets a bit tricky.
Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin finished third on Sunday to claim his second podium finish of the season and the 100th of his long career. Hugs were shared. Trophies were awarded. Bubbly was sprayed. Hooray!
But wait! After he had accepted the third-place trophy, stewards ruled that Alonso, who had served a five-second penalty for lining up with his tires outside his box at the start of the race, had actually not served the penalty correctly during a pit stop during the race. (As you can see in Formula 1 television's Zapruder film breakdown of the stop, a crew member's jack had touched his car prematurely.)
Penalized for that illegal contact, Alonso was assessed an additional 10-second penalty, just enough to strip him of his third-place finish and elevate Russell of Mercedes, who had been fourth. Womp womp womp.
Russell accepted the extra points, and the trophy, but said he was happy to cede the onstage moment to Alonso. "I'll take the trophy for sure," he said, "but Fernando and Aston deserve the podium." He called the penalty "harsh."
Oh, but you thought that was the end of it? Heavens no. Even as Russell gazed at his new hardware and Alonso gave interviews, the stewards and Aston Martin officials were huddling and taking a second (or was it a third now?) look.
Reversal! Formula 1 heard the Aston Martin appeal and decided -- hours after the race, hours after the trophy ceremony, and on the strength of evidence that touching a jack to a penalized car is actually quite common -- that Alonso could have third place after all. "Having reviewed the new evidence, we concluded that there was no clear agreement, as was suggested to the stewards previously, that could be relied upon," motor racing's governing body, which oversees the apparently hazy rules, said in a statement. "In the circumstances, we considered that our original decision to impose a penalty on Car 14 needed to be reversed and we did so accordingly."
Got it? Now quickly keep reading before they change their minds again.
What They're Saying
"We will keep pushing. The important thing is we were the fastest car out there today." -- Pérez after posting the fifth win of his career but failing to take the season points lead from Verstappen.
"When they told me I had a five-second penalty, I said, 'OK, I need to drive a little bit faster."' -- Alonso, whose third-place finish would have been his second in two races this season. Instead, he was bumped to fourth by another penalty.
"We are not where we want to be but we will get there." -- Lewis Hamilton, acknowledging that fifth place is better but still not good enough for him or Mercedes.

NEW YORK — Guo Wengui, a fugitive Chinese billionaire, was arrested Wednesday morning in New York on charges that he orchestrated a complex conspiracy to defraud thousands of his online followers out of at least $1 billion, authorities said.
A federal indictment unsealed in Manhattan charged that Guo and a co-defendant took advantage of Guo’s “prolific online presence” to solicit investments in various entities and programs “by promising outsized financial returns and other benefits.”
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Guo was “charged with lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000-square-foot mansion, a $3.5 million Ferrari and even two $36,000 mattresses.” The money was also used to finance a $37 million luxury yacht, Williams said.
Guo, who is also known as Miles Kwok, is a business associate of Steve Bannon, a onetime top adviser to former President Donald Trump. It was on a yacht belonging to Guo that Bannon was arrested in a fraud case in August 2020; Trump later pardoned Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to those charges.
Guo was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday at his apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, a bureau spokesperson said.
A lawyer for Guo had no immediate comment. Guo was taken to a brief court appearance Wednesday wearing a pullover, black cargo pants and black sneakers. He smiled and waved to several spectators, and entered a not guilty plea through an attorney. He was ordered detained pending further proceedings.
For six years, Guo has been seen as a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party, endearing himself to some conservatives in the United States and many members of the Chinese diaspora. The U.S. attorney’s office issued a news release announcing his arrest in both English and Chinese.
In 2017, Guo applied for asylum on grounds that his attacks on top officials had made him “a political opponent of the Chinese regime,” one of his lawyers said at the time.
At the same time, Guo was trying to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration. In early 2017, Guo posted pictures of himself at Trump’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, where Guo was then a member. Several months later, he told his many followers on social media that he had booked meetings at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.
According to the indictment, Guo, a co-defendant and other co-conspirators in 2018 began using fraudulent and fictitious business and investment opportunities to solicit, launder and misappropriate money from their victims.
In one case, the indictment says, they posted a video on social media to announce a stock offering for a purported news-focused social media platform based in New York called GTV Media Group. It was promoted as the “first ever platform which will combine the power of citizen journalism and social news with state-of-the-art technology, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and real-time interactive communication.”
Over six weeks in 2020, the indictment says, about $452 million worth of GTV common stock was sold to more than 5,500 investors in the United States and abroad. But prosecutors said much of that money did not go to developing and expanding the business. For example, prosecutors said, $100 million was invested in a high-risk hedge fund for the benefit of GTV’s parent company and its owner, a close relative of Guo.
In another scheme included in the indictment, Guo and others were accused of inducing people to invest more than $250 million in something called G|Clubs, which claimed on its website to be “an exclusive, high-end membership program offering a full spectrum of services.” To join, prospective members paid a one-time fee, ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.
In reality, the indictment said, G|Clubs “provided nothing close to ‘a full spectrum of services’ and ‘experiences’ to its members.”
Rather, Guo and his co-defendant, Kin Ming Je, misappropriated much of the money, the indictment charged. The indictment says $26.5 million in G|Clubs funds went toward the purchase of Guo’s mansion in New Jersey; more went to pay for extravagant renovations there, and for furniture and decorative items, including Chinese and Persian rugs worth close to $1 million, a $62,000 television and a $53,000 log cradle for a fireplace.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a parallel civil action, sued Guo.
“Guo was a serial fraudster,” Gurbir S. Grewal, the SEC’s director of enforcement, said in a statement. “Guo took advantage of the hype and allure surrounding crypto and other investments to victimize thousands and fund his and his family’s lavish lifestyle.”
Guo’s legal woes span the Pacific. The U.S. charges against Guo echo those that the Chinese government made against him in 2017, when he was accused of bribery and embezzlement. Until he left China in 2014, Guo oversaw a property empire whose centerpiece was a hotel, residential and office complex in Beijing overlooking the venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics.
In his native China, he also forged political and financial ties with influential officials, including a senior intelligence officer, Ma Jian, who in 2017 made a videotaped confession admitting to taking more than $8.7 million in gifts from Guo in exchange for favors.
Guo was ruthless with those who got in his way. A Beijing vice mayor who stood between him and the property rights for the Olympics venue was felled when Guo obtained a video of the official having sex with a mistress.
Guo rose to fame in 2017 when — far from Chinese justice in his newly purchased home at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan — he hurled public accusations of corruption against Wang Qishan, then China’s anti-corruption czar, saying his family owned secret stakes in a major conglomerate. The New York Times could not substantiate Guo’s claims.
At the Sherry-Netherland, Guo lived a life of opulence. British bodyguards controlled access to his $68 million 18th-floor penthouse, where he served guests Opus One wine. Guo liked to show guests his closet full of tailored suits and posed — like a James Bond villain — with his snow-white bichon frisé puppy.
After Guo’s arrest Wednesday, there was a fire on the hotel’s 18th floor around noon, according to the New York Fire Department. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office, said the fire was under investigation.
Guo’s home in Beijing — a spectacular lakeside courtyard mansion just to the north of the Communist Party’s leadership compound — was in 2017 valued at $230 million by one local real estate agent.
But the creditors who had lent tens of millions of dollars to Guo hounded him as he made his way from Beijing to his life in exile in New York. One financial firm sued to seize the penthouse apartment. In 2022 Guo declared personal bankruptcy, listing assets of no more than $100,000 against liabilities of as much as $500 million, Reuters reported.

NEW YORK — Guo Wengui, a fugitive Chinese billionaire, was arrested Wednesday morning in New York on charges that he orchestrated a complex conspiracy to defraud thousands of his online followers out of at least $1 billion, authorities said.
A federal indictment unsealed in Manhattan charged that Guo and a co-defendant took advantage of Guo’s “prolific online presence” to solicit investments in various entities and programs “by promising outsized financial returns and other benefits.”
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Guo was “charged with lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000-square-foot mansion, a $3.5 million Ferrari and even two $36,000 mattresses.” The money was also used to finance a $37 million luxury yacht, Williams said.
Guo, who is also known as Miles Kwok, is a business associate of Steve Bannon, a onetime top adviser to former President Donald Trump. It was on a yacht belonging to Guo that Bannon was arrested in a fraud case in August 2020; Trump later pardoned Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to those charges.
Guo was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday at his apartment in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, a bureau spokesperson said.
A lawyer for Guo had no immediate comment. Guo was taken to a brief court appearance Wednesday wearing a pullover, black cargo pants and black sneakers. He smiled and waved to several spectators, and entered a not guilty plea through an attorney. He was ordered detained pending further proceedings.
For six years, Guo has been seen as a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party, endearing himself to some conservatives in the United States and many members of the Chinese diaspora. The U.S. attorney’s office issued a news release announcing his arrest in both English and Chinese.
In 2017, Guo applied for asylum on grounds that his attacks on top officials had made him “a political opponent of the Chinese regime,” one of his lawyers said at the time.
At the same time, Guo was trying to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration. In early 2017, Guo posted pictures of himself at Trump’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, where Guo was then a member. Several months later, he told his many followers on social media that he had booked meetings at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.
According to the indictment, Guo, a co-defendant and other co-conspirators in 2018 began using fraudulent and fictitious business and investment opportunities to solicit, launder and misappropriate money from their victims.
In one case, the indictment says, they posted a video on social media to announce a stock offering for a purported news-focused social media platform based in New York called GTV Media Group. It was promoted as the “first ever platform which will combine the power of citizen journalism and social news with state-of-the-art technology, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and real-time interactive communication.”
Over six weeks in 2020, the indictment says, about $452 million worth of GTV common stock was sold to more than 5,500 investors in the United States and abroad. But prosecutors said much of that money did not go to developing and expanding the business. For example, prosecutors said, $100 million was invested in a high-risk hedge fund for the benefit of GTV’s parent company and its owner, a close relative of Guo.
In another scheme included in the indictment, Guo and others were accused of inducing people to invest more than $250 million in something called G|Clubs, which claimed on its website to be “an exclusive, high-end membership program offering a full spectrum of services.” To join, prospective members paid a one-time fee, ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.
In reality, the indictment said, G|Clubs “provided nothing close to ‘a full spectrum of services’ and ‘experiences’ to its members.”
Rather, Guo and his co-defendant, Kin Ming Je, misappropriated much of the money, the indictment charged. The indictment says $26.5 million in G|Clubs funds went toward the purchase of Guo’s mansion in New Jersey; more went to pay for extravagant renovations there, and for furniture and decorative items, including Chinese and Persian rugs worth close to $1 million, a $62,000 television and a $53,000 log cradle for a fireplace.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a parallel civil action, sued Guo.
“Guo was a serial fraudster,” Gurbir S. Grewal, the SEC’s director of enforcement, said in a statement. “Guo took advantage of the hype and allure surrounding crypto and other investments to victimize thousands and fund his and his family’s lavish lifestyle.”
Guo’s legal woes span the Pacific. The U.S. charges against Guo echo those that the Chinese government made against him in 2017, when he was accused of bribery and embezzlement. Until he left China in 2014, Guo oversaw a property empire whose centerpiece was a hotel, residential and office complex in Beijing overlooking the venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics.
In his native China, he also forged political and financial ties with influential officials, including a senior intelligence officer, Ma Jian, who in 2017 made a videotaped confession admitting to taking more than $8.7 million in gifts from Guo in exchange for favors.
Guo was ruthless with those who got in his way. A Beijing vice mayor who stood between him and the property rights for the Olympics venue was felled when Guo obtained a video of the official having sex with a mistress.
Guo rose to fame in 2017 when — far from Chinese justice in his newly purchased home at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan — he hurled public accusations of corruption against Wang Qishan, then China’s anti-corruption czar, saying his family owned secret stakes in a major conglomerate. The New York Times could not substantiate Guo’s claims.
At the Sherry-Netherland, Guo lived a life of opulence. British bodyguards controlled access to his $68 million 18th-floor penthouse, where he served guests Opus One wine. Guo liked to show guests his closet full of tailored suits and posed — like a James Bond villain — with his snow-white bichon frisé puppy.
After Guo’s arrest Wednesday, there was a fire on the hotel’s 18th floor around noon, according to the New York Fire Department. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office, said the fire was under investigation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox, became an international force, merging the commercial with the creative in designing some of the world's tallest buildings.
Eugene Kohn, an architect who co-founded the firm Kohn Pedersen Fox in 1976 and whose ambitions led it to become, within a few years, a rival to long-established international architectural firms and one of the most prolific designers of skyscrapers in the world, died on Thursday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 92.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Barbara Shattuck Kohn, said.
At last count, KPF, as the firm is known, had designed more than 250 skyscrapers around the globe, including some of the tallest. Among them are the World Financial Center in Shanghai; headquarters for Unilever and Amazon in London; the World Bank headquarters in Washington; the Abu Dhabi International Airport; the International Commerce Center in Hong Kong; the headquarters of Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati; Baruch College in Manhattan; the IBM headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.; and the Infinity Tower in São Paulo.
The firm also designed some of New York's tallest new buildings, including One Vanderbilt, next door to Grand Central Terminal, as well as 30 Hudson Yards, 10 Hudson Yards and 55 Hudson Yards.
At Mr. Kohn's death, KPF had grown from three partners in a borrowed office in Midtown Manhattan into an enterprise with 650 employees and offices on three continents, devoted to the production of designs that balanced the strong expression of an architectural idea with an equally strong pragmatism.
KPF has been known for being at the forefront of design and for giving its buildings a whiff of the cutting edge, but never so much of one as to alienate its corporate clients. Mr. Kohn knew how to speak a chief executive's language, and if he proposed a building that was somewhat more daring than what his clients had expected, he was exceptionally good at convincing them that it would be in their interest to go along.
"It's kind of ludicrous to say commercial architecture in itself is not worth our best efforts," Mr. Kohn said in an interview for a 1987 monograph on the firm's first decade of work, "because what, in fact, influences the life of the average person in our urban areas more than commercial architecture? Cities are made up of commercial buildings. Designing quality architecture for commercial buildings is the contribution we intend to make."
The key to KPF's success was the unusual partnership between Mr. Kohn, who was passionate about design but did not see himself as a creative innovator, and William Pedersen, a talented designer who had worked under I.M. Pei on the design of the East Building of the National Gallery in Washington and who, by the mid-1970s, was eager to take on new challenges.
Mr. Kohn was then in charge of the New York office of John Carl Warnecke, a prominent architect based in San Francisco, and he recruited Mr. Pedersen to join him there. Mr. Kohn had previously persuaded Sheldon Fox, an architecture school classmate from the University of Pennsylvania, to join him at Warnecke. There, the three men set about trying to expand the firm's presence on the East Coast.
But a lot of the work Mr. Kohn had hoped to generate didn't materialize, and he decided he would be better off on his own. He persuaded Mr. Pedersen to join him as a design partner and Mr. Fox to oversee the firm's business affairs, and the three went into business as Kohn Pedersen Fox at the depth of New York's economic troubles in the 1970s.
"It was a frightening time," Mr. Pedersen recalled. "We had about enough money to survive for three months. We even worried about the long-distance phone charges for all of Gene's calls trying to get work."
Triumvirate at the Top
With the extroverted Mr. Kohn as impresario and the public face of the firm, the more reflective Mr. Pedersen at the drawing board, and Mr. Fox managing the business side, the three constituted an unusual but effective partnership between the commercial and the creative, and KPF prospered despite the challenging economy.
The firm's first commission was the conversion of an armory on West 66th Street in Manhattan into studios for ABC Television, finished in 1977. That led to a second, entirely new building next door for ABC, which was completed two years later. When Capital Cities bought ABC in 1985, Mr. Kohn quickly established a relationship with the new owners, and before long the company was commissioning more buildings from KPF. Eventually the site grew to become an entire ABC campus of production studios as well as a new corporate headquarters, all designed by KPF.
From the beginning, Mr. Kohn's aspirations went beyond Manhattan. Another early commission was in Philadelphia, the city where he was born, and where in 1983 the firm built the One Logan Square complex, with a low, sprawling wing sheathed in granite that contained the Four Seasons Hotel and a 30-story office tower of granite and glass behind it. The combination was an attempt to fit a commercial program into the classical, civic setting of Logan Square.
At the same time, KPF completed 333 Wacker Drive in Chicago, an elegant tower with a softly curving glass facade opposite a bend in the Chicago River -- a sculptural form that made it an instant Chicago landmark and the firm's first building to receive national acclaim.
The success of 333 Wacker Drive was followed by requests to design a headquarters for Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, a large tower at 900 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, an office tower on Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, and several more buildings in New York. At that point KPF was not yet a decade old, and it was winning commissions that a few years earlier would have gone to larger and better-known firms like Skidmore Owings & Merrill and I.M. Pei.
Mr. Kohn positioned the firm not only as business-friendly but also as committed to the new, and in KPF's early years he encouraged Mr. Pedersen to explore the new style that was increasingly coming to be known as postmodernism.
KPF's buildings soon became ornate, rich compositions of stone and glass, often with abstracted and simplified classical detailing. The firm's towers almost never had flat tops; instead, they had pyramids or domes or lanterns or gables or, sometimes, a combination of them all. Mr. Kohn wanted clients to feel that in hiring KPF they were getting buildings that made a strong statement about the architecture of the moment, and they did.
KPF continued to be a barometer of architectural trends as the firm grew, but Mr. Kohn's sympathy for postmodernism's notion of new buildings as collages of historical elements dwindled; both he and Mr. Pedersen had come to find postmodernism fussy. "I must admit, a few of our buildings went too far," he wrote in a memoir, "The World by Design," written with Clifford Pearson and published in 2019.
Mr. Kohn decided, he wrote, that the future lay in "an updated modernism that was more sophisticated and complicated than the simple glass boxes of the 1960s and '70s." The notion of a building as a richly textured assemblage of different geometric shapes became the firm's new signature, expressed in such projects as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, finished in 1992, and the World Bank in Washington, a commission KPF won by beating Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Edward Larrabee Barnes, and Arthur Erickson in an international competition.
As the firm continued to grow, Mr. Kohn turned his ambitions to the rest of the world. He wanted the firm to become global, and he set his sights first on London, where his enthusiasm for networking resulted in an invitation to Kensington Palace to meet with Prince Charles. Before long Mr. Kohn had gotten the commission to design a new European headquarters for Goldman Sachs, and the London practice was launched. (It also led to his meeting Barbara Shattuck, a Goldman banker, who became his third wife.)
Not long after, Mr. Kohn began to market KPF's work in Europe and Asia, where he positioned the firm as a place that could satisfy the growing predilection for super-tall towers across Asia. The firm would design the tallest buildings in South Korea, Hong Kong and Indonesia, as well as the tallest towers in six Chinese cities: Beijing, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Guangzhou and Kunming. KPF also designed numerous skyscrapers in Shanghai, and the tallest buildings in Paris and Montreal.
Watercolors and Steel
Arthur Eugene Kohn -- he used only his middle name throughout his life, but sometimes wrote his name as A. Eugene Kohn -- was born on Dec. 12, 1930, the only child of William and Hannah Kohn. His father owned a medical supply company, and his mother was a dressmaker who loved to paint and would instill in her son a lifelong passion for making watercolors.
He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree, spent three years in the Navy, and then returned to Penn, where he studied under Louis Kahn and received a master's degree in architecture.
He began his career in 1960 as a designer at the Philadelphia architecture firm of Vincent G. Kling. Five years later, he moved to New York to become the design director of Welton Becket Associates, a large commercial firm, where he remained until John Carl Warnecke recruited him to oversee his New York office. He started as the head designer there and soon became the firm's president.
Although KPF's success came quickly, the firm was not without its internal tensions. Mr. Kohn's enthusiasm for growth was not always shared by his partners, and Mr. Pedersen and Mr. Fox tried at first to talk him out of opening an office in London. Years later, after the London office had become a major profit center for the firm, the partner who had left New York to run it, Lee Polisano, tried to secede from the rest of KPF and make London into a separate firm with himself in charge. Determined to quash the coup, Mr. Kohn, who by then was 78, moved to London for two years and ran the London office himself.
Although the firm would also open offices in Berlin, Shanghai, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and San Francisco, New York remained the "mother ship," as James von Klemperer, now the president of KPF, put it. "The real design work is done in New York and London," he said, because Mr. Kohn, who prided himself on his mentoring of younger architects, wanted to be involved in every project.
"Gene never wanted this to be a franchise operation, no matter how large it grew," Mr. von Klemperer said. "He wanted every partner to know every other partner, and he wanted the firm to feel like a tight unit."
Mr. Kohn eased away from day-to-day management of the firm in the early 2000s, but he remained its chairman until his death. He continued to oversee several projects himself, including one of KPF's most unusual buildings, the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, which he wrapped in a series of silver ribbons mounted over what he called "Ferrari red corrugated aluminum panels." He wanted the design to "express the aerodynamics of wind whipping around a speeding car," he said.
Mr. Kohn married Barbara Schwartz in 1954. That marriage ended in divorce, as did a subsequent marriage, to Diane Barnes. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children from his first marriage, Brian Kohn, Steven Kohn and Laurie Parkinson; his stepchildren, Alexandra, Charles and Melinda Dubow; seven grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren. He spent the winters in Montecito and the rest of the time at homes in Manhattan and Washington, Conn.
Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Kohn continued to meet with potential clients in the hope of persuading them to hire KPF, and he did not accept defeat. "If we don't get the job after competing for a big project, I stay in contact with the client," he wrote. "I cultivate relationships like some people do orchids or bonsai -- carefully and with the long term in mind."

Verstappen Dominates in a Not-So-Grand Season Opening: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The first race of the Formula 1 season wasn't much of a race at all.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing opened the defense of his world championship with a dominant performance on Sunday at the Bahrain Grand Prix, winning by 12 seconds -- an eternity in a sport that measures gains in the hundredths of seconds -- and sending a message to the rest of the series that he will not surrender his championship easily.
Fastest in Saturday's qualifying, Verstappen pulled away from the starting line on Sunday, beat his top rivals and his teammate Sergio Pérez to the first turn and never looked back. His lead grew slowly at first, two seconds, then four, then five. He beat Pérez by just under 12 seconds and the rest of the field by at least 38.
The big surprise was the car that followed the Red Bulls across the line: Fernando Alonso, the oldest driver in the field at age 41, who gave Aston Martin a surprise trip onto the podium in his first race with the team. Carlos Sainz, in a Ferrari, was a distant fourth but his team had bigger problems: His teammate Charles Leclerc didn't even finish.
Aston Martin had raised eyebrows with its fast performances in testing and practice sessions the past two weeks, but even Alonso wasn't sure that would translate to Sunday's race. Until it did.
"I had the same feeling from testing -- it's too good to be true," Alonso said of his ability to stay with the top teams on Sunday. "But it seems real. I could have driven for another hour on the track."
Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, had been just as uncertain before the race, calling the first start of any season "a bit of a trip into the unknown." And Verstappen's ride was not flawless: He grumbled about some gear troubles on his radio, worried about tire conditions and, afterward, suggested Red Bull could still get better.
"Nothing big," Verstappen said. "Just little things that you always want to fine-tune."
Sunday's Race in Seven Photos
Track Position, Lap by Lap
Verstappen surrendered the lead only once on Sunday, to his teammate Pérez, and only briefly. He quickly took it back and ran away from the field.
Where the Race Turned
This one was effectively over the moment Verstappen stepped on the gas. Starting from the pole, he was fastest to the first corner, and then second, and the third ... you get the idea. Charles Leclerc gave Ferrari a few seconds of hope when he passed Red Bull's Pérez in the opening sprint. But it wasn't long before he was behind both Red Bulls and, like everyone else, wondering where Verstappen had gone.
Worst Days, Ranked
Esteban Ocon. The landslide winner in this contest. The Alpine driver managed to line up in the wrong place on the starting grid, drawing a five-second penalty, and then served it incorrectly, bringing on a second one. A third penalty -- for speeding in the pit lane as he tried to make up the seconds he had lost -- just seemed comical. Honestly, if there was a way to lock the keys in an F1 car, Ocon probably would have done it.
Oscar Piastri. His much-discussed move to McLaren last year, after Alpine had announced him as a driver for 2023, produced one of the more spicy moments of the new "Drive to Survive" season. But Piastri's debut race for McLaren was a disaster: He was out after roughly a dozen uninspiring laps, part of a miserable day for his team.
Charles Leclerc. He was running third when his car's power unit suddenly gave out. (Essentially, the car just died after he was going around a corner.) Starting the season out of the points was not in his plans, or Ferrari's. Leaving the garage in a million-dollar racecar only to hitch a ride back to it on a Vespa, though? Ouch.
What They're Saying
"That was exactly the start to the season we needed." -- Max Verstappen after Red Bull went 1-2.
"Yes! Bye-bye." -- Fernando Alonso on the radio, after a late-race pass of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz put him in third place and (eventually) Aston Martin on the podium.
"Unfortunately we've taken a step back and Red Bull's on another planet. Third was the best we could hope for." -- Charles Leclerc, after his Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz finished fourth and he didn't finish at all.

Once-Mighty Mercedes Ponders Its Mistakes: [Sports Desk]

Full text: There was a period during its record streak of eight consecutive world championships from 2014 to 2021 that Mercedes seemed unbeatable.
Yet when new rules were introduced to Formula 1 last year, changing the car designs to provide better racing, Mercedes' prospects strikingly changed. The team failed to adjust to the new rules as well as the Red Bull and Ferrari teams, leaving it unable to compete regularly for wins.
It was a day that Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, always knew would come.
"Every single year when we were successful, we discussed that eventually, we're going to have a difficult one," he said.
"There is no sports team in the world that won every single competition that they participated in. That moment came last year, and it was difficult."
Mercedes ended the year third in the standings, winning just one race and finishing 244 points behind the champion team, Red Bull, which won 17 races. Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, went a full season without winning a race for the first time in his Formula 1 career.
The experience has prompted Hamilton to be more cautious about his chances going into his 11th season with Mercedes.
"I wouldn't say I'm bullish like I was last year," Hamilton said. "I would say just more cautious. I know that whatever we're faced with, we have the best team to deal with whatever we come across."
The core problem Mercedes faced last year was a phenomenon called porpoising, where the car bounces when reaching high speeds because of the airflow stalling when passing underneath the car. It was something all teams faced, but Mercedes struggled the most, even raising safety questions after Hamilton reported suffering back pain and headaches because of the bouncing.
But as Mercedes made changes to its car design midseason to solve the porpoising, more problems emerged. One of the biggest issues was the balance of the car going through corners, making it hard for the drivers to have confidence when pushing to the limit.
George Russell, Hamilton's teammate, said he wanted "more consistency and a more predictable car" from Mercedes this season. "If you could choose a balance that you would least like to have, the W13 probably had it," Russell said of last year's car.
Hamilton had asked the team to focus on improving every element of the car, "from the tip of the back to the tip of the front." He said the W13 "didn't behave like a racing car should," prompting a push for changes going into the new season. This included revised bodywork around the rear of the car, as well as completely new front and rear suspension designs.
But Mercedes did not want to undo all its work with last year's car. The team did make big improvements toward the end of the season, allowing it to finish first and second at the penultimate race in Brazil, defeating Red Bull and Ferrari.
Mike Elliott, the team's technical director, said there was "a lot of goodness in the car" that he wanted to carry over to 2023, particularly its reliability and consistent performance over long stints in races. "If we tear it all up and we start again, you're going to start further backwards," he warned.
Although many of the technical changes made for this year's car are hidden underneath the bodywork, there was one very visible difference: the paint scheme or, in many places, the lack of one.
Weight was a big issue for teams under the new regulations. Because of improved safety requirements and heavier tires, many cars were above the minimum weight of 798 kilograms (1,759 pounds) throughout last year, costing them lap time.
To try to save weight, some teams removed paint from parts of their cars, exposing the black carbon fiber. But Mercedes took this to the extreme with its new car. The team switched its paint scheme from silver to black, so it could expose more carbon easily without affecting the overall livery design. Only the nose, cockpit and engine cover are painted black, blending in with the black carbon fiber elsewhere.
"We have tried to figure out where we can squeeze out every single gram," Wolff said. "There is not tons of weight that you can save on the paint, but it shows the intent of what we do." It also paid homage to the origin of Mercedes' nickname as the Silver Arrow when white paint was scraped off its racecars in 1934 to meet the weight limit for a race, exposing the silver chassis.
Hamilton said that he felt glad that Mercedes' weight problem had been taken seriously, and that while he preferred the black livery to silver, the color didn't matter to him.
"It's all-out for performance," he said. "It's not necessarily how it looks. It's about how quick it goes."
Hamilton will renew his bid for a record-breaking eighth drivers' championship this year. While he hoped that Mercedes would be quick enough to compete with Red Bull and Ferrari from the first race, he wanted to reserve judgment until he drove on the track.
"It's not until we get the car on the road, and we figure out what it's doing and where the limitations are, that can we then steer the rudder and develop in that direction," he said.
"But the great thing is we've got I think two strong drivers, so it'll be clear straight away if there are issues. The guys understand the car much more to be able to deal with it. I'm excited."
Max Verstappen, who won 15 races for Red Bull last year, expected Mercedes to pose a serious threat to his championship defense, which starts Sunday in Bahrain.
"They will be our main rival, but also I think Ferrari will be strong," he said. "Mercedes has shown, of course, over the last few years that they've always been really, really strong. They have a good group of people."
But Wolff said Mercedes had to "prove that ourselves" and show the team had "taken the right decisions" over the winter to create a competitive fight for the championship.
"I would love to have a fight in the front there," he said. "That's good for Formula 1. That's what makes it so enjoyable."

Formula 1 Teams Play Musical Chairs, and Now Everyone Feels Pressure: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Formula 1's off-season was unusual.
It is natural for drivers to swap teams, and several indeed did, but for several team principals and senior executives to move around is rare. But before the season started, there were major changes.
Mattia Binotto resigned from Ferrari and was replaced by Frédéric Vasseur, who had been the team principal of Alfa Romeo and chief executive of the Sauber Group. That set off a series of moves.
Andreas Seidl, team principal of McLaren, then filled the Sauber chief executive vacancy, with Alessandro Alunni Bravi, managing director of the Sauber Group, which owns the Alfa team, being named to help run it under the newly created title of team representative.
McLaren also promoted from within, with Andrea Stella rising from executive director, racing, to team principal.
At Williams, Jost Capito departed and James Vowles took over, ending a 13-season association with Mercedes, with the last four of those as strategy director.
"He will be missed," Toto Wolff, the team principal of Mercedes, said of Vowles. "We were a strong alliance, strong sparring partners when making the difficult calls during a race, and we almost never disagreed, so he is definitely a loss.
"He will grow into this team principal role, and it is what he deserves."
Vowles was instrumental in helping the team win eight consecutive constructors' championships from 2014 to 2021, and seven drivers' titles -- six for Lewis Hamilton and one for Nico Rosberg.
In contrast, Vowles has joined a Williams team that has finished at the bottom of the constructors' standings in four of the last five years. But he is aware of the considerable task he faces.
"What will definitely be wrong is when you're hurting, when you've been punished and pushed down as an organization because you are suffering, that doesn't get any better year on year, unless you get a change to the culture, to the methods and systems," Vowles said.
"I suspect, if we go back a few years, a lot of it was the fact Williams didn't have the strength that was Dorilton Capital," referring to the American company that took over the team in 2020.
Vowles recognizes that he cannot stop the rot on his own. His plan is to strengthen the technical team and to allow employees "to shine and prosper."
"You have to instill a culture that allows everyone to realize you have to be empowered, you have to grow, you have to move forward as a unit together, and it has to be one collaborative motion," he said.
After Vowles' announcement, he and Wolff held a joint news conference. It was unusual, having someone leaving a team speak about his new team alongside his current employer.
At the heart was the strength of their relationship, but Wolff and Vowles also said that there would be no collaboration between the teams beyond Williams already using a Mercedes power unit.
"Williams is an entirely independent organization and furthermore, it's one that my success is subject and dependent on me doing a good job there," Vowles said. "That has to be independent of Mercedes."
Wolff was as dismissive. "If I were ever to get involved with James and ask him to become a mini-Mercedes, he would tell me to get lost," Wolff said.
There is naturally pressure on Vowles to succeed, but while the bar he has to raise starts from a low position, in contrast Vasseur has to win championships.
Ferrari's last constructors' title was in 2008, and its last drivers' title was Kimi Raikkonen's in 2007.
Last season, the team and the driver Charles Leclerc both finished second, yet Binotto left after the team, which started strong, was undermined by unreliability and strategic errors.
"My approach to racing is that we have to do a better job more than today," Vasseur said. "If today you say the team is in a good shape then you are dead. You always need to have the mind-set to say 'OK, where can we improve?'
"When you are a top team, you cannot have another target other than to win. The day you start a season and say 'OK, we can be P2' [second place], means there is a lack of ambition. We have everything we need to do a good job, and the target, for sure, is to win."
Leclerc drove for Vasseur in his rookie season in Formula 1 in 2018 at Sauber and has been impressed by what he has seen.
"Ferrari is very different to whatever you've been used to before," Leclerc said. "Once he got here, he understood extremely well the way Ferrari works from the first few days.
"He's very clear on what he wants and extremely good in putting the people in the right mind-set and providing the right ambience to give their best."
At McLaren, Stella's transition to team principal was "seamless," said Zak Brown, the chief executive.
"He's very aware of the teams here," Brown said. "He's worked very closely with all of them after being here almost a decade, so he is exactly who we wanted to have run the racing team. He was our No. 1 choice."
Stella said his role was about consolidating the direction of McLaren, which had been steered by Seidl.
"I worked well with Andreas," Stella said. "We established some very important directions, and now we want to consolidate them, but at the same time the complexity of F1 leaves the business open for opportunities."

Full text: When the pandemic took hold, Chicago was awash in affectionate memes featuring Lori Lightfoot, the city's stern, no-nonsense new mayor. Since then, the joke has worn off.
CHICAGO -- Mayor Lori Lightfoot was standing guard all over Chicago -- virtually, anyway.
In March 2020, in the early, frightening days of the coronavirus pandemic when city officials had closed down public spaces to stop the spread of the virus, a meme began circulating on social media with Ms. Lightfoot as the star: an image of her stern, unsmiling face Photoshopped around Chicago.
There was Ms. Lightfoot in front of the giant, stainless steel Bean sculpture in Millennium Park, guarding the entrance to beaches along Lake Michigan and standing in a parking garage behind Ferris Bueller as he tooled around the city in a lipstick-red Ferrari.
"Lori Lightfoot don't play," wrote one Twitter user, with an image of Ms. Lightfoot's glowering face superimposed over picnickers in a Seurat painting that hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago.
At first, the real-life mayor was baffled by it. But after her City Hall aides explained that the meme was an affectionate nod to her tough persona and no-nonsense countenance, she warmed to the scolding Lightfoots that began to spring up all over the city, cardboard cutouts in the windows of apartments and shuttered stores. Chicagoans needed a laugh, and the image of the mayor -- diminutive, a little surly, dressed in fedoras and trousers so long as they puddled at the ankles -- had provided.
But after Covid-19, a crime surge and a tough four years in office, what began as something friendly now also reflects harsher perceptions of the mayor and her time in office.
This week, Ms. Lightfoot is in a fight for survival as she runs for a second term as mayor in a city that has yet to recover from its pandemic-era struggles. The blunt, tough-talking persona that earned Ms. Lightfoot early affection and respect turned into something else: the image of a mayor with an exhausting capacity for feuds and insults, whether aimed at her own staff, city employees or fellow elected officials.
She is one of at least four candidates viewed as having a good chance to make it into a runoff election and could very well lead the current nine-person field. But even some supporters now worry that she may have alienated many people she needs as allies. Those include business owners, City Council members and voters, some of whom are fed up with her tone and substance on issues like crime, policing and public education -- and are turning to other mayoral candidates.
Take Bruce Heyman, a former ambassador to Canada, who remembers during the pandemic when his children printed a picture of the stern Ms. Lightfoot and hung it on the refrigerator in his Chicago home -- a wry warning not to eat the food inside.
"She was endearing, there was no doubt about it," he said. "She was somebody we had a lot of hope for."
Mr. Heyman, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who worked closely with the former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel, voted for Ms. Lightfoot in 2019. But he grew frustrated and disappointed with the mayor in the years since. During the pandemic and riots that tore through downtown after George Floyd's murder, Mr. Heyman watched as Chicago's problems began to multiply.
"She didn't tackle them as an effective leader -- she began a very defensive, authoritarian style," he said. "We've had strong mayors in our city before. But they got stuff done, and they were able to communicate and collaborate."
Andre Vasquez, a member of the City Council who represents a ward on the North Side, said that council members called her "the great unifier," since so many members were lined up against her.
"When there is disagreement, she takes it personally in a way that isn't helpful," Mr. Vasquez said. "It's always felt very personal coming from her. And she can be dismissive and condescending."
Ms. Lightfoot has responded to critiques of her style by invoking previous mayors and saying she is no different.
"I personally get asked this question of, 'Well, Mayor, you know your relationships with City Council, shouldn't you be nicer?' Which I have to laugh at," Ms. Lightfoot said last year. "When I think about who my predecessors were -- I worked for Rich Daley and I was around Rahm a lot -- it's not like they won contests for Mr. Congeniality."
And to many voters, her message and record resonated far more than her leadership style. Giavonni Downing, who works in marketing and lives on the South Side, said she liked Ms. Lightfoot's message on investing in neighborhoods with fewer resources and thought the mayor deserved another term.
"Covid hit, so, realistically, whatever you thought you were going to do when you got in office, all that had to go on the back burner," said Ms. Downing, 40.
In the final days of her campaign, the mayor has crisscrossed the city, trying to shore up support in neighborhoods that were once full of enthusiastic Lightfoot voters.
On Friday afternoon, Ms. Lightfoot and her wife, Amy Eshleman, stopped in a record store in the Andersonville neighborhood on the Far North Side, an L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly community where rainbow flags peek out of storefront windows and hang above the porches of greystone buildings.
Four years ago, Andersonville was a power center of Ms. Lightfoot's support. Now many front yards are decorated with signs bearing her opponents' names: Brandon Johnson, a county board commissioner; Paul Vallas, a former schools executive; and Representative Jesús G. García, a congressman from Illinois.
Chris Hawkins, a manager at a nearby shop on Clark Street, was in the record store browsing when Ms. Lightfoot stopped in. Mr. Hawkins, who was born and raised in Chicago, said he would vote for Ms. Lightfoot again. She took care of the city during a trying time, he said, and she had been judged harshly because she is a woman.
"We're living in a society where women are marginalized and not perceived as leaders -- they're perceived as a stereotype," he said. "I look at crime and stuff that's happening in the city, and I just think, it's easy to point the finger at one person. This is a mayor who's taken on a lot."

The Busy Furniture Hustlers of Silicon Valley: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As tech companies cut costs and move to remote work, their left-behind office furniture has become part of a booming trade.
Brandi Susewitz touched the curved stitching on a pair of bright red Arne Jacobsen Egg Chairs and announced they were worth around $ 5,000 each. The chairs were in pristine condition, perched in the reception area of the software company Sitecore's office in downtown San Francisco.
Trisha Murcia, Sitecore's workplace manager, said she was likely the only person who ever sat on them. "It's really sad," she said. "They opened this office in 2018 and then Covid happened."
Ms. Murcia led Ms. Susewitz around Sitecore's office, pointing out bar stools that had never been used, 90-inch flat screens, shiny conference room tables and accent chairs from the retailer Blu Dot. The whiteboard walls, outfitted with markers and erasers, were spotless. And rows upon rows of 30-by-60-inch, height-adjustable Knoll desks with Herman Miller Aeron chairs sat collecting dust.
Ms. Susewitz measured and snapped photos, identifying designer brands and models. Her office furniture resale business, Reseat, would take all of it, she declared. "We can find a home for this," she said. "We have time."
Ms. Susewitz, who started Reseat in 2020, is one of an increasing number of behind-the-scenes specialists in the Bay Area who are carving out a piece of the great office furniture reshuffling. There are professional liquidators, Craigslist flippers and start-ups spouting buzzwords like "circular economy." And a few guys with warehouses full of really nice chairs.
All of them are capitalizing on a wave of tech companies that are drastically shrinking their physical footprints in the wake of the pandemic-induced shift to remote work and the recent economic slowdown.
Nowhere is the furniture glut stronger than in San Francisco. Tech workers have been slowest to return to the office in the city, where commercial vacancy rates jumped to 28 percent last year, up from 4 percent in 2019, according to the real estate firm CBRE. Occupancy in San Francisco in late January was 4 percent below the average of the top 10 U.S. cities, according to the building security firm Kastle. And companies of all sizes, including PayPal, Block and Yelp, are giving up their expensive downtown headquarters or downsizing their office space.
Add to that the tech industry's recent U-turn from optimistic hypergrowth to fear and penny pinching. That has led tech giants such as Google and Salesforce, along with smaller companies like DoorDash and Wish, to carry out widespread layoffs, cutting more than 88,000 workers in the Bay Area over the last year, according to Layoffs.fyi.
Some start-ups have abruptly gone under, including the flying car company Kittyhawk, the autonomous vehicle start-up Argo AI and the interior design start-up Modsy. Others have slashed spending, starting with their dusty, rarely used offices full of designer furniture.
Last month, Twitter held a public auction for some of its furniture, hawking dry erase boards, conference tables and a three-foot blue statue of its bird logo. The social media company, which is owned by Elon Musk, at one point stopped paying the rent on some of its office leases.
Martin Pichinson, a founder of Sherwood Partners, an advisory firm that helps restructure failing start-ups, said he was staffing up to handle increased demand. Today's reckoning was not as severe as that of the dot-com bust in the early 2000s when dozens of tech companies collapsed, he said, but "everyone is acting as if businesses are falling apart."
That's led to a lot of expendable furniture, much of it hewing to a specific youthful aesthetic of Instagrammable bright colors and midcentury modern shapes. That look, complemented by plant walls of succulents and kombucha on tap, was a hallmark of the tech talent wars over the past two decades, telegraphing a company's success and sophistication.
Then there's the Aeron chairs. The $ 1,805 black roller-wheel desk chairs are a closely-watched barometer of tech excesses. Their sleek design makes them a work of art, according to the Museum of Modern Art. And in the tech industry, where workers are used to being pampered while chained to their desks, they are ubiquitous.
When internet companies imploded in 2000, liquidators filled their warehouses with the "dot-com thrones." Now any whiff of empty Aerons piling up conjures memories of that slump and sets off fears that another is imminent.
The Bay Area's Craigslist currently has gobs of the chairs for sale, photographed in warehouses, lined up in corners of conference rooms and wrapped in plastic outside a storage unit. Some are selling for as cheap as a few hundred bucks.
The listings are a reminder: Silicon Valley is a place of booms and busts, with enterprising hustlers who see nothing but opportunity, even in the rubble.
A trail of Dropbox furniture
For furniture specialists, it all starts with supplies from tech companies like Dropbox.
In 2019, the file storage company moved into its 735,000-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco. Its 15-year lease was the largest in the city's history at the time. Dropbox's old office was rented to other companies, and last year, a cache of furniture -- futuristic-chic chairs, couches and tables -- from that office made its way to a liquidator.
The inventory included several emerald green velvet Jean Royère-style Polar Bear chairs that cost roughly $ 10,000 to custom make in 2016, according to their maker, Classic Design LA.
Three of those chairs sold to Tenzin Norbu, a furniture reseller in Richmond, Calif., who paid around $ 1,000 for each. Mr. Norbu, 25, started buying and selling high-end furniture on online marketplaces early in the pandemic, when people were eager to redecorate the homes they were stuck inside and stymied by supply chain delays on furniture.
Since then, his business, called Enliven, has expanded to include a van, three employees, a 4,000-square-foot warehouse and annual revenue in the mid-six figures.
The tech talent wars, with companies competing to out-perk one another with the fanciest offices, were good for designer furniture. The retreat from that battle has been just as good for resellers.
Last year, Mr. Norbu scored some lounge chairs and couches from Fast, a payments start-up that collapsed in the spring. He also paid "tens of thousands" of dollars, he said, to fill a 20-foot truck of still-in-the-box furniture that WeWork, whose valuation had plummeted, had kept in storage since 2019. The trove included dining chairs, lamps, couches and a chunky red Bollo armchair by the Swedish designer Fogia.
On a recent tour of his warehouse, Mr. Norbu pointed out a pair of never-used felt poufs from a start-up, two glass coffee tables from Delta Air Lines, some gray lounge chairs that were "probably from Google" and plants from a venture capital firm.
Mr. Norbu aims to target more tech start-ups as his business expands. The companies are always acquiring or shedding furniture, since they tend to grow quickly and shut down abruptly. Many of his buyers also work in tech, he said, which means they could find themselves eating dinner at the very conference table they once gathered around for meetings.
Last year, Mr. Norbu sold one of the Polar Bear chairs that had been owned by Dropbox to a fellow furniture flipper, Nate Morgan, for $ 1,400. Mr. Morgan started trading furniture in the fall after he was laid off from a business development job at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. He said he quickly discovered the Bay Area contains "crazy pockets of massive amounts of furniture."
Mr. Morgan's business, Reclamation, recently worked with a wealthy tech entrepreneur who had bought a second San Francisco home to live in while his main home was being renovated. The entrepreneur furnished the 4,000-square-foot second home with new goods from Restoration Hardware. Nine months later, when the entrepreneur moved into his main home, Mr. Morgan bought all of the second home's furniture for 10 percent of its retail price.
Mr. Morgan, 44, said the furniture business was a welcome shift from the 15 years he spent working in tech. "It feels really good to be building a local community business that's tied to this geographic area," he said.
Mr. Morgan later sold the Polar Bear chair that had been at Dropbox for a profit to an interior designer in Los Angeles, who then sold it to a client in the Hollywood Hills. From the liquidator, to Mr. Norbu, to Mr. Morgan, to the interior designer, each person in the chain made a little money.
Dropbox declined to comment. During the pandemic, the company shifted to remote work and made plans to sublet 80 percent of its headquarters. Takers have been slow; the company recently lowered its expected rate, pushed out its target for finding tenants by two years and recorded a $ 175 million charge on its real estate holdings in 2022.
Dropbox's remaining space has been converted into what the company calls a "studio" instead of an "office," designed for meetings and "touchdown spots," or cafes and libraries for people to sit, chat and work briefly. There are no more desks.
'It was a ghost town'
Ms. Susewitz, 49, has worked in office furniture since 1997, when she became a customer service representative at Lindsay-Ferrari, a Bay Area furniture dealer now known as One Workplace.
The furniture industry's wastefulness always bugged her, she said, with companies discarding durable, commercial-grade items that were built to last decades every time they moved. Companies waited until the last minute to deal with the furniture, she said, increasing the odds it wound up in the trash.
In the late 1990s dot-com boom, Ms. Susewitz created a business plan to build an online marketplace for used office furniture. She abandoned it when eBay took off, thinking the company would eventually solve the problem. "But that never happened," she said.
Over the next two decades, she worked in sales and business development, outfitting Bay Area businesses with goods from "the big five" of workplace furniture -- Steelcase, MillerKnoll, Haworth, Allsteel and Teknion.
When the pandemic hit, Ms. Susewitz's livelihood of new office furniture screeched to a halt. She watched with disgust as companies tossed out barely used desks and chairs.
"Perfectly good, brand-new furniture is just being carted off to landfills," she said.
So she created Reseat to help businesses liquidate furniture. The company uses an inventory management system that tracks the items' "life cycles" so it can quickly share the specifications for the furniture, making the goods easier to sell. Given enough time, sellers can expect 20 cents on the dollar for their furniture, she said. Reseat, which has 14 employees, has worked with more than 100 companies and sold more than eight million pounds of furniture.
"Our goal is to sell it standing," Ms. Susewitz said. "Once it ends up in a warehouse, it loses value and ends up collecting dust."
In December, Reseat was hired to liquidate more than 900 work stations, 96 office chairs, 40 work benches, 24 sofas and 84 file cabinets at an office in Santa Clara, Calif. Analog Devices, the semiconductor company that had moved out, hardly used the space during the pandemic. But Pure Storage, the data storage company moving in, didn't want those pieces. Reseat had just four weeks to sell the items.
"It just ate me up inside," Ms. Susewitz said. That she found buyers in time was "a miracle," she added.
Pure Storage said it was reusing a "substantial" amount of Analog Devices' furniture, including desk chairs and conference room items, but it planned to install its existing desks "to better suit how Pure employees work in a more open office environment." An Analog Devices representative declined to comment.
Ms. Susewitz was excited about the furniture at Sitecore because the company had contacted Reseat months ahead of its move, setting it up to easily find a home for its goods. At Sitecore's office, she showed off how to identify the size of an Aeron chair. Each one has a set of plastic bumps hidden on its back. Two bumps indicate the most common size, a "B."
There were 16 size Bs around a wooden conference table that Sitecore had built using wood from a houseboat that was in Sausalito, Calif. In the center, a basin filled with Legos was flanked by the universal emblems of the pandemic: a bottle of Purell and a package of Clorox wipes.
Before the pandemic, Sitecore was expanding its space so rapidly that it had leased another half of a floor in its office tower. But "once the pandemic hit, it was a ghost town," said Brad Hamilton, the company's head of real estate and facilities.
Sitecore plans to downgrade to 30 desks from 170. "We're paying an outrageous amount of money for a floor that nobody uses," he said.
Toward the end of the office tour, Ms. Susewitz surveyed Sitecore's empty kitchen area, outfitted with a Ping-Pong table, a Ms. Pac-Man machine and two curved, six-foot privacy coves. Ms. Susewitz said she would take everything, except for the plates and silverware.
Chair influencers
One result of the furniture trading is a lot more people logging into Zoom meetings from very nice chairs -- and not only in the Bay Area.
In January, Gilad Rom, a software engineer in Los Angeles, decided to upgrade his work station at home. He searched Craigslist and found a seller with 500 Aeron chairs -- apparently acquired from a SiriusXM office that had shifted to remote work -- in Culver City, Calif.
When he posted a picture of the chairs gathered in a room, their black foam arms intertwined, the reaction was explosive. Some people wanted to score their own cheap Aeron. Many more wanted to reminisce about what the empty chairs represented -- corporate excess gone awry.
"I think it brought back a lot of memories," Mr. Rom, 43, said. "Flashbacks from 2008 and 2000."
The seller, a secondhand furniture shop called Wannasofa, was so overwhelmed with calls after Mr. Rom's tweet that the store gave him a 25 percent discount. "Apparently I'm a chair influencer now," he said.
The reaction also gave him an idea.
"Maybe I should build an app that helps people find cheap luxury furniture," he said. "Maybe there's something there."

Full text: Last summer, die-hards and newbies sweated it out in the hot sun for a brief glimpse of pure speed.
You can feel the energy rushing toward you, a telekinetic current through the sea of spectators. Carbon fiber hammerheads cut through the thick air, leaving elevated heart rates in their wake.
It doesn't matter if you're in the grandstands, general admission or the exclusive paddock; even the most expensive ticket won't get you a view of the whole circuit.
The Formula 1 Grand Prix is a touring spectacle that attracts hundreds of thousands of people from all over the planet for one weekend. Last year, the premier motorsport championship came to Miami for the first time in its 70-year existence, part of Formula 1's latest effort to tap into the lucrative American market.
The sport's thrill and glamour draw an audience from across the socioeconomic spectrum, though all would agree: The weekend costs a fortune. Single-day tickets can go for thousands of dollars, on top of travel and hotel prices that reflect the host city's sudden surge in population.
In attendance are grade schoolers and retirees, veteran fans from the bygone era of bellowing V12 engines and fresh converts from Netflix's "Drive to Survive." They cheer for country, driver, team or some mix of the three.
A mélange of colors signifies everyone's allegiances. Specks of Aston Martin emerald and Mercedes teal, worn by supporters of the mighty (Sir) Lewis Hamilton, dot the pointillistic legion. Those are mere accents to the two-tone wave of Red Bull navy blue and Dutch orange, for the reigning world champion, Max Verstappen.
They are all engulfed by Rosso Corsa red, a color that just looks fast, worn by the Tifosi, disciples of the national motor religion of Italy: Ferrari.
The sprawling circuit cultivates a music-festival atmosphere. When there is no action, you make your own. Many wander the vast landscape, paying a premium for officially licensed Charles Leclerc caps and Diet Pepsi as they seek the most valuable resource: shade.
The buzz of the turbo-hybrid engines crescendos with every gear shift as Daniel Ricciardo and Fernando Alonso dart down the track. Whether you're gazing at a Jumbotron, perching atop a sturdy branch or clinging to a chain-link fence, creativity and zeal are key to catching a glimpse.

Tom Whitlock, 68, Who Co-Wrote 'Top Gun' Anthem: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Whitlock wrote the words for that song and the chart-topping "Take My Breath Away," central elements in the success of the hit 1986 movie.
Tom Whitlock, who co-wrote two songs that helped elevate the 1986 movie "Top Gun" into a pop-culture phenomenon, died on Saturday in Gallatin, Tenn. He was 68.
His death was confirmed by Gorman-Scharpf Funeral Home, which did not cite a cause.
The "Top Gun" songs "Danger Zone" and "Take My Breath Away," with words by Mr. Whitlock and music by Giorgio Moroder, were just two of the more than 100 songwriting credits he accrued over his career. Songs he helped write were performed and recorded by Bonnie Tyler, Ray Charles, Graham Nash and others. But the work he did with Mr. Moroder for "Top Gun," the hit Tom Cruise movie about fighter jets and machismo, has especially endured.
Mr. Whitlock worked frequently with Mr. Moroder. Together they wrote five songs for the movie, but two in particular achieved widespread acclaim.
"Danger Zone," performed by Kenny Loggins, served as the guitar-heavy, energetic scene setter for the movie's opening moments, as fighter jets roared off into the sky. The lyrics spoke for an unapologetic thrill seeker, culminating in the oft-repeated line "Highway to the danger zone." The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. It was also featured on the soundtrack of the hit 2022 sequel, "Top Gun: Maverick."

Even more successful was "Take My Breath Away," the soulful ballad performed by the group Berlin that was heard in a love scene. It topped the Billboard charts on Sept. 13, 1986, and won the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for best original song.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Thomas Ross Whitlock was born on Feb. 20, 1954, in Springfield, Mo., to Ross and Peg Whitlock. He started playing the drums when he was 11 years old, he said in a 2014 interview archived on the website rediscoverthe80s.com, and was soon working professionally.
After attending Drury University in Springfield and playing in a short-lived band, he moved to Los Angeles. He was helping a friend at a sound studio there when Mr. Moroder, an already accomplished musician who had just bought the studio, said he was having issues with the brakes on his Ferrari, Mr. Whitlock said in the interview. Mr. Whitlock bought some brake fluid, used his own tools and fixed the issue. A few weeks later, he was hired to do odd jobs in the studio.
After other people had left the studio for the day, he would stay and work on his own songs. And when other songwriters weren't around, he recalled, Mr. Moroder turned to Mr. Whitlock for help on the "Top Gun" lyrics.
He also wrote lyrics for the theme songs for the 1988 Summer Olympics and the 1990 FIFA World Cup.
His marriage to Hollie Whitlock ended in divorce. Survivors include his sister, Mary Whitlock Schweitzer.

Longtime Renters in Brooklyn Just Wanted Closets and a Little Privacy: [Real Estate]

Full text: For more than a decade, JV Mercanti and Joe Ferrari rented a sunny railroad apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Unlike many of the neighborhood's ground-floor units, which had paved yards, this one came with a wraparound garden, which the couple revamped with their landlord's permission.
They cleared the overgrowth, transforming the space into an oasis of herbs and native perennials, and left their extra iris bulbs in a box out front for neighbors to take. "Now our irises are all over the neighborhood," said Mr. Mercanti, a theater professor and director at Pace University.
"It was a joyous place to live," said Mr. Ferrari, who quit his job as a retail executive and opened a garden shop, Tend Greenpoint. The couple, now in their mid-40s, knew many neighbors and held many dinners and parties. But the building was on a loud corner, the unit had no closets and the only interior door was to the bathroom.
"Sometimes I watch horror movies, and that drives Joe crazy if he is in the bedroom listening to folk rock," Mr. Mercanti said.
One day, they calculated how much they had paid over the years in rent, which had risen to $ 2,800 a month from $ 2,100. Alarmed by the number -- more than $ 400,000 -- they decided it would be prudent to buy. So they began the hunt for a one-bedroom, with the help of a friend, Christophe Tedjasukmana, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group. With a budget of up to $ 800,000, they couldn't afford Greenpoint -- or rather, "there were things in their price point, but they weren't large enough," Mr. Tedjasukmana said.
The couple hoped to find a place close to the G train, so Mr. Ferrari could walk from the Greenpoint Avenue station to his store and Mr. Mercanti could transfer to the A/C to get to his office in the financial district. They also wanted a bit more privacy.
"A bedroom door was a necessity, but everything else was kind of negotiable," Mr. Mercanti said. Among their options:
This boxy one-bedroom was about 625 square feet, with an open kitchen, floor-to-ceiling windows, a washer-dryer and a smart thermostat. It was in a refurbished two-building complex from 2006 with a gym and a roof deck. The G train was in walking distance, but the neighborhood was unappealing. The asking price was $ 645,000, with monthly charges of less than $ 300 (assuming a tax abatement until 2036).
This one-bedroom co-op unit was around 700 square feet. It had original prewar details, refinished hardwood floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a soaking tub and a linen closet. But the view in the bedroom was of a brick wall. The eight-unit 1930 building was a few blocks from the G and A/C trains, and it had basement storage and a roof deck. The price was $ 695,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $ 700s.
This one-bedroom was about 650 square feet, with exposed brick, a decorative fireplace, a balcony, a washer-dryer and a private yard. The newly renovated six-unit building was a few doors from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and a 15-minute walk from the G. The price was $ 749,000, with monthly charges in the mid- $ 700s.
Inside and out, the couple found the Bed-Stuy apartment to be too sterile and hotel-like for their taste.
They liked the charm of the Fort Greene co-op -- especially its gleaming bathroom -- but the galley kitchen was uninspiring, and they preferred the ease of buying a condo rather than a co-op.
When they visited the Clinton Hill condo, "we did the thing you are not supposed to do," Mr. Ferrari said. "JV walked in and said, 'I love it.' We liked that it was new, crisp, clean and generally OK."
The couple paid $ 735,000, and when they arrived in late summer they were delighted to discover that they had a friend whose home backed up to theirs.
But the interior required more work than they had anticipated, including having new bookshelves built in the living room. They are also considering redoing the kitchen cabinets.
In their part of the backyard, which is divided into quadrants, they painted the fence and replaced the fake grass with pea gravel.
Disadvantages of the neighborhood include the lack of a gym and a trek to the subway, but the men aren't bothered by their proximity to the B.Q.E.
"I go to bed at night and pretend it is the ocean," Mr. Mercanti said. "The dishwasher is more annoying to me than the B.Q.E. is."

Ron Labinski, Who Built Stadiums With Fans in Mind, Dies at 85: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An architect, he followed his hunch that teams would abandon ugly concrete multipurpose arenas for fan-friendly single-sport facilities, like Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
Ron Labinski, a visionary architect who a half-century ago foresaw a market for modern single-sport stadiums and then helped design them, replacing look-alike concrete bowls that had often inelegantly housed both baseball and football teams, died on Jan. 1 in Prairie Village, Kan. He was 85.
His wife, Lee (Beougher) Labinski, said the cause was frontotemporal dementia.
Mr. Labinski, who was believed to be the first architect in the United States to specialize in sports facilities, helped transform stadium design over 30 years, creating cozy, fan-friendly venues like Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore and Oracle Park in San Francisco.
At the same time, his designs brought a critical source of new revenue to team owners with club seats, built as exclusive sections with access to climate-controlled private lounges and restaurants.
"His forward thinking about how we watch games and how teams use their building, beyond what was happening on the field, was a real game-changer," said Janet Marie Smith, who was a Baltimore Orioles executive when the team was planning Oriole Park, an urban ballpark with a retro brick exterior that was designed by HOK Sport, which Mr. Labinski helped found. Now 31 years old, Camden Yards is still considered one of the best early examples of the new wave of single-sport stadiums.
"He doesn't get enough credit for putting the stake in the ground of the multipurpose stadium era," Ms. Smith added.
Mr. Labinski helped usher in that era as the project architect of Arrowhead Stadium, which opened in 1972 as the home of the N.F.L.'s Kansas City Chiefs and the companion to Kauffman Stadium, the home of the baseball Royals. The facilities replaced a stadium that the Chiefs and Royals (and before them, the Athletics, before they moved to Oakland, Calif.) had shared.
While working on Arrowhead, Mr. Labinski started looking at the national landscape of aging, multipurpose stadiums -- whose round shapes precluded good sightlines for many baseball and football fans -- and saw opportunity. He listed all the Major League Baseball and National Football League stadiums, the years they were built and when their leases expired, providing him with a guide to his future work.
"There was a huge bubble in the 1990s and a little past 2000, when all the lease agreements at these multipurpose stadiums were up," Mr. Labinski told Sports Business Journal in 2010. "I recognized through all the conversations I was having with owners that the multipurpose stadiums were not the way they'd want to go in the future. They wanted out of those."
His compendium became a to-do list for the next 30 years at architectural firms in Kansas City, most notably HOK Sport, a division of a St. Louis firm. (HOK Sport was renamed Populous in 2009 after a management buyout and Mr. Labinski's retirement.)
He followed Arrowhead by designing Giants Stadium, which opened in the New Jersey Meadowlands in 1976 and became the home of the New York Giants and Jets until it was replaced by Met Life Stadium in 2010. He became friendly with Tim Mara, then the Giants' co-owner, who introduced him to other N.F.L. owners. And by attending N.F.L. and M.L.B. meetings, Mr. Labinski learned what teams might want in stadiums in the future.
"I'd go with him to visit N.F.L. clubs," Joe Spear, a longtime colleague, said in a phone interview. "And we were pitching renovations, like suites, which was his real entree into a lot of franchises."
For his design of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., which opened in 1987 as the home of the Miami Dolphins, Mr. Labinski is credited with creating the category of club seats as a cheaper option for fans than expensive, enclosed luxury suites. Revenue from both the club seats and the suites helped Joe Robbie, then the Dolphins' owner, finance the stadium's construction. Club seats soon became essential parts of every stadium's design.
Mr. Labinski played roles in the designs of other N.F.L. stadiums as well, including Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla., TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, Fla., and M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.
"He greatly influenced the way N.F.L. stadiums appeared from the 1990s through the 2000s, especially with respect to their seating bowls," Earl Santee, a longtime colleague of Mr. Labinski's and a senior principal at Populous, wrote in an email, referring to the shape of the seating sections. "Lower seating bowls in N.F.L. stadiums were formerly contiguous, but Ron had the idea to create 'neighborhoods' of fans, providing different experiences in different areas."
Ronald Joseph Labinski was born on Dec. 7, 1937, in Buffalo. His father, Raymond, was a wholesale food salesman; his mother, Bertha Labinski, was a homemaker. Ron was artistic from a young age, drawing houses, barns and windmills -- and in one instance Ebbets Field, the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, showing a baseball leaving that beloved little bandbox.
"I guess you could say that was a sign," he told The Kansas City Star in 2000.
After graduating from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a bachelor's degree in architecture, he spent six months in Europe studying architecture on a fellowship and two years in the Army at Fort Riley, Kan. He designed hospitals for a firm in Kansas City before being hired by Kivett & Myers, where he was assigned to the Arrowhead project.
After several years, he formed the firm Devine, James, Labinski & Myers, which lost its bid to design the Hoosier Dome (where the Indianapolis Colts played until 2007) to a much larger rival, HNTB. But Mr. Labinski's concepts for the stadium were impressive enough for HNTB to hire him, and he brought along several of his colleagues and set up a sports architecture practice within the firm.
He and other members of his group left HNTB after three years to join HOK, bringing about a dozen HNTB clients with them. HOK Sport became one of the foremost stadium and arena designers nationally and internationally.
The hallmarks of HOK's designs include sightlines that provide the best possible views of games as well as vistas of what's beyond a stadium -- the skyline outside Oracle Park in San Francisco, for example, or the B&O Warehouse outside Camden Yards, or a panorama of downtown Denver and the Front Range mountains from rooftop cabanas at Coors Field. The designs are also distinguished by open concourses that let fans follow the action while buying food from a wide array of concession options.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Labinski is survived by his daughter, Michelle Embry; his son, Kent; two grandchildren, and his sisters, Barbara Maves and Marcia DePasse. He had been living in Fairway, Kan., outside Kansas City, before moving to a memory care facility in Prairie Village.
The prescience that Mr. Labinski showed in compiling his list of potential single-sport stadiums paid off in the 1990s when a tsunami of work came to HOK. He often traveled to find new business but continued to work on stadium and arena designs.
"His touch on the projects varied based on the project and client relationship," Mr. Santee said in his email. "His mode of operation is consistent with how we operate today, where everyone in our leadership, since Ron started the practice, is working on projects."
Mr. Labinski retired in 2000 and scaled back the scope of his architectural projects: He built a two-story addition to his house, a pagoda-like design studio for a neighbor, a playhouse for his granddaughter and a bed designed like a Ferrari for his grandson.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NASHVILLE -- Wynonna Judd was almost late for her date to sing with Joni Mitchell.
It was July 2022, and the country star had rented a yacht off the Rhode Island coast while she rehearsed for her idol's first public performance since a 2015 brain aneurysm. That Sunday afternoon, the captain struggled to find a dock, forcing Wynonna to race to the Newport Folk Festival. She arrived a minute before showtime, squeezed into a spot toward the rear of the onstage throng and sighed with relief. Maybe people wouldn't know she was there.
A dozen songs into the secret set, Mitchell began to purr "Both Sides Now," the tune Wynonna -- who with her mother, Naomi, made up one of Nashville's most indelible duos -- had sung during her debut performance, at eighth-grade graduation. Cameras caught her over Mitchell's right shoulder, often sobbing as she occasionally harmonized. Honest and unmitigated, the footage went viral. Everyone knew Wynonna was there.
"It flipped me like a pancake, man, everything coming out. I was such a beautiful little mess," she said on a recent Saturday afternoon in an enormous Nashville rehearsal hall, red hair cascading over a silver cross resting against her stomach. She paused to apply another stratum of lip gloss. "I was thinking about my mom, how much she loved my voice. And I was so freaking mad at her for leaving me. I realized I was an orphan."
Less than three months earlier, a mediator who has worked with the entire Judd family for more than a decade commanded Wynonna to race to her mother's house across the 1,000-acre farm they shared outside Nashville. Her younger sister, the actress and activist Ashley Judd, was already there. Wynonna arrived nine minutes later to find paramedics ready to rush her mother and lifelong singing partner into an ambulance. Naomi had struggled for decades with severe depression and panic attacks. She died that morning, her death ruled a suicide, the day before the Judds were to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
"We were still at the hospital," Cactus Moser, Wynonna's husband, manager and drummer, remembered later in the same dressing room. "Her exact words were, 'I'm walking my mother into the Hall of Fame tomorrow. We're not going to bail.' She is an oak."
The tearful ceremony was Wynonna's first step in moving toward her own future. Since the Judds disbanded three decades ago, her relationship with her mother had been fraught at best, an exercise in boundaries. A fence split their spread in half. Family dinners observed firm time limits. Meetings about music were led by managers. "I can compartmentalize real easy," she said, curling her lips.
Last week, Wynonna began what may prove the pivotal phase of putting the past to rest: the second leg of the Final Tour, a sweeping survey of the Judds' bygone country supremacy, performed over 15 dates across the United States with a cast of guests that includes Tanya Tucker, Brandi Carlile and Kelsea Ballerini. When it is over, she believes the rest of her career can begin. Now a 58-year-old grandmother newly confronting an empty nest, one of country music's most venerated singers is electrified by the idea of making records that turn away from what Naomi long called "Judd music."
"It's made me even more determined to be myself," Wynonna said of her mother's death in a second interview on her tour bus, flanked by photos of herself with Mitchell. "It's given me a louder voice. I want to do stuff that makes people say, 'What are you doing?"'
With a new record deal through the independent label Anti-, Wynonna hopes to mine the rock, folk and soul she wanted to sing before Naomi suggested a family band, when Wynonna was still a teenager. Already, she has released new music with an indie-rock descendant, Waxahatchee, and had even started a band a few years ago with the elliptical singer-songwriter Cass McCombs.
"We've both lived our lives as people have expected us, but she's just getting started," said Bobby Weir of the Grateful Dead, speaking by phone from Mexico, where Wynonna had just joined Dead & Company for a surprise performance. "I can't wait to see who she takes with her, who she leaves wondering."
FOR MUCH OF the '80s, the Judds were country music's sweethearts next door, the mother-daughter duo mistaken for sisters. The Judds' preternatural Kentucky harmonies politely rebuffed the "Urban Cowboy" craze sparked by the 1980 film, and country's increasing slickness. Wynonna and Naomi sang about grandpa and the good ol' days, and then held each other in love or heartache. Naomi was the playful one, charming crowds as she sang backup; Wynonna, more stoic, was the generational singer out front.
"I don't think there's anybody in the business -- any business, whether it's country or rock or pop, anything -- that has a greater voice than Wynonna," Dolly Parton, a longtime mentor who thinks of her as a daughter, said in an interview. "With all the passion she has, all the stuff she feels, she was able to get that voice out there."
The Judds' life was "a wonderful duet," Naomi wrote in her autobiography, "the two of us against a frightening and unknown world." But for Wynonna, the songs were more idyllic than their circumstances. Naomi was a single mother, pinballing between California and Kentucky, Texas and Tennessee for opportunity or inspiration. By the time Wynonna was 8, she felt the burden of raising Ashley was, in part, hers. Her mother never told her that she and her sister had different fathers.
"We didn't have the sit-down, Norman Rockwell family," she said. "I always wanted that. I was never really allowed to be a kid."
That applied to music, too. Wynonna loved Joni Mitchell and Bessie Smith but longed to be Linda Ronstadt or Bonnie Raitt. She wanted to build a sizzling rock band, not be in a country duo with her mother. Bouncing between short-term jobs and nursing school, Naomi had other ideas, not only to safeguard her firstborn but also to try a novel family business.
"On some level, she knew that this kid could sing," Wynonna said, winking. "She had dreams and plans, and I had dreams and plans. They were very different. But I was so codependent, and I wanted to sing."
Indeed, in only six years, Wynonna's supple vocals led the Judds to country's biggest stages. Their meteoric rise was interrupted in October 1990, when Naomi announced her sudden retirement as hepatitis C ravaged her health. Wynonna wanted to quit, too. "It's like being in the middle of a divorce," said Wynonna, who has endured two of them. "How can you possibly think about dating?"
But as Wynonna built a solo career, Naomi found other ways to impose. Wynonna believes her mother once hired a private investigator to learn if Wynonna's boyfriend was gay. Naomi resented that Wynonna toured while she stayed at home. It got worse after 2009, when Wynonna partnered with Moser. Comparing her voice to some garage-bound Ferrari that had "only ever gone to fourth gear," he encouraged her to try new songs and fresh settings of Judds standbys.
"Mom was not a big fan of me and Cactus, because she desperately wanted to be on the road," Wynonna admitted. "There's a piece of me that feels like I left her at the party."
In 2019, an unexpected invitation arrived. The Nashville promoter Leslie Cohea saw Wynonna perform at a Tennessee festival, as Naomi watched from backstage. Cohea began hatching a plan for a final Judds hurrah: a full tour, taking the hits to arenas one last time.
At a preliminary meeting in a Nashville board room, mother and daughter sat at opposite ends of a conference table and offered redlines. At Naomi's request, the songs would be true to original form, recalled Jason Owen, the founder of Sandbox Entertainment, who built the tour alongside Cohea; at Wynonna's request, the outfits would not be fastidiously coordinated.
When Naomi started in on wardrobe plans, Wynonna gagged. "She said, 'I'm fine. That's just the sound of my mother's uterus strangling my throat,"' Owen remembered in an interview. "They were playing off each other, but it was real."
Sandbox shaped a comprehensive plan to relaunch the Judds, hinging on a taped outdoor performance of one of their final hits, "Love Can Build a Bridge," for the CMT Music Awards in April 2022. They announced 10 tour dates that night, quickly selling most of the tickets.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The performance, however, wobbled. For the first time in Judds history, the ever-punctual Naomi was late, flustered by the unseasonably cold weather and an edit made to shorten her anthem for television. "She went from being at home, putting on makeup, to being in a multimillion-dollar production," Wynonna said. "She wasn't prepared."
Wynonna is not big on regret. She doesn't think she could have saved her mom. "Once you make that choice, you're determined to carry it out," she said flatly. "There's only so much guilt to carry around." Still, she wondered if they should have debriefed more, unpacking the anxiety of working together again.
"I missed that, because I was gone," she said, referring to a tour of her own. Two weeks later, so was Naomi.
LATE IN THE afternoon on the first day of the Final Tour's last leg (at least for now), Wynonna shuffled up the stage steps in a hockey arena in Hershey, Pa. "Oh, hi!" she said to a small crowd in the arena's front two rows, stretching that last word like molasses.
More than two dozen devotees had paid extra for deluxe treatment, arriving three hours before showtime to watch a snippet of soundcheck and pose for a snapshot. After the band raced through "Have Mercy," an early Judds hit about a hopeless cad, Wynonna grabbed a stack of scrap paper. Each fan had scribbled a question, and she started with the easy ones.
How many pets do you have? (Forty-eight, including 26 cats.) Who was your biggest influence? (Her Mamaw, or paternal grandmother.) And then, inevitably, came the queries about carrying on without Naomi. Her mother loved everybody, she said, and taught her gratitude for the life they'd built, even when it seemed impossible.
"She was a good person -- to everybody else," Wynonna said. She paused, as if realizing how harsh that sounded. "I did her hair, so she was strict with me."
Perched above her behind the drums, Moser interceded with a mischievous grin, asking if she was ready to play. "What are you talking about?" she shot back. "I was born ready."
In the weeks after Naomi's death, Wynonna wasn't sure if she was ready for this tour, to say goodbye to the Judds without her mother. She canceled a run with her own band and wondered if continuing was crass. "There was no way I was going to sing these songs without her," she explained. "I had to seek counsel, because I was in a shutdown. Even Jesus had disciples."
The feedback from a retinue that included Moser, her sister and even her farm manager was nearly unanimous: Play. Parton demanded as much in front of a crowd at a private memorial service, telling Wynonna she needed those shows. "I told her that Naomi had her journey, and she had hers. None of that was her fault," Parton remembered. "I told her to get her ass out there on the road. It's time for her to go on and do the great things she's capable of doing, a new start."
Singers including Carlile and Ashley McBryde, both '80s babies reared on "Judd music," volunteered to join her and sing Naomi's parts. The first 11 shows last fall were more celebration than elegy.
"I would have been desperately sad if not," Wynonna said, anxiously rubbing her hands together. "You can't fake this. It's not a time to put on your big-girl panties and just deal with it. This music is my foundational life journey."
These concerts without Naomi are the culmination of an extended and unsteady process of stepping from their famous duo's shadows, personally and professionally. Though Wynonna's solo career was full of left turns into slinky R&B, vaulting pop and collaborations with the likes of Jeff Beck, that work was heard within the context of what she had accomplished with her mother, or might still. That is finally over.
"Almost instantly, there was less weight, less pressure," Moser said, chatting in a Hershey sports bar. "Naomi believed I was trying to tunnel under the Judds legacy and let her fall through the cracks."
An encyclopedic rock fan who scoffs at Nashville mores, Moser speculates about future collaborations with cerebral producers like Daniel Lanois or Blake Mills. He and Wynonna are eight songs into an album that will most likely include work with Weir, Carlile and Iron & Wine's Sam Beam. It feels so real and vulnerable, Wynonna said, it makes her uncomfortable. "It's the most intimate I've ever been," she noted of a song called "Broken and Blessed." "And that's because of my mother."
And two years ago, after her biological father died, she finally met her brother, Michael, when she called him without warning on his birthday. They talked for five hours the first time they met. "We couldn't get over how much we looked alike," she gushed. "They're all so normal."
She never told Naomi about her new family. She beamed, though, when she mentioned someday introducing him to Ashley, whom she repeatedly called "honey bunny." Their relationship has become closer, Wynonna explained, the result of having and respecting boundaries. "We're in such good places now," she said. "It's going to be OK."
MORE THAN 20 minutes before Wynonna was due onstage in Hershey for the opening night's 24-song set, she stood still in a backstage hallway, bare feet on the concrete floor. She talked to her son, Elijah, and asked for more hair spray. Her black velvet outfit was covered in a constellation of gold glitter, and her wavy hair was a ripple of burnished reds. She clutched an enormous white guitar, so new it gleamed even beneath wan fluorescent lights.
For the better part of a year, Moser schemed with Gibson to make a replica of the big, white guitar Wynonna bought soon after the Judds broke up. After a quarter-century of concerts, the original was as yellow as fresh butter, the wood beneath its strings ground down from countless strums. That guitar had signaled a new phase of her life, just like this one. She kept both hands around it, as if protecting a puppy. "It feels good," she said slowly, closing her eyes to reveal more glitter.
Just then, she stopped her tour manager, Tanner Brandell, and asked how much time she had left. "I was coming to tell you that you have the trigger," he said. "Tell me when." Without hesitation, she said "Now" and began sauntering toward the stage, moving deliberately, as if the world could always wait for Wynonna.
She climbed the stairs and strummed a chord as the white guitar caught the spotlight for the first time. She belted out one line from an old Judds favorite, her voice every bit as mighty as it was when they cut the song in 1983: "Had a dream about you, baby." She let the line echo back, and grinned.

After Extended Talks, Ford, Joining Red Bull, Is Back in Formula One: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The automaker and the drinks manufacturer are joining forces on a high-powered team in the world's most popular motorsports series.
The whispers of a merger between Ford and Red Bull had been the talk of Formula One for months, an intriguing story line in a competition that knows the value of drama.
The dance went on for months: Ford suggesting its interest in returning to the series was genuine, and Red Bull open about its discussions with multiple manufacturers.
On Friday, the companies confirmed the loudest rumors were true: Ford is re-entering into Formula One to partner with Red Bull, currently the series's top team and the employer of its reigning champion, Max Verstappen. In the new arrangement, the American automaker and the Austrian drinks company will join forces to design a new power unit ahead of the 2026 season, and try to extend Red Bull's dominance of the world's most popular motorsports series.
A flashy New York launch confirmed the partnership, a collaboration in which Red Bull will tap Ford's expertise in electric vehicles before a fundamental shift in engine rules for the 2026 season, when teams must become reliant on 100 percent sustainable fuels and, crucially for Ford at least, greater electric power.
That looming shift has already lured the German car manufacturer Audi to Formula One. Porsche, which held talks with Red Bull, is considering joining the fray, as is General Motors. Ford, which left Formula One almost two decades ago, also was looking for a way back in.
"We talked to a lot of people, we met with a lot of people," said Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive. "And as soon as we landed on Red Bull, we knew this was the right opportunity."
Formula One racecars are propelled by what is known as a power unit, a complex bit of machinery that includes several components, including an internal combustion engine, electrical motors and a turbocharger. Red Bull had previously been supplied with power units by Honda. But it found itself facing a crisis -- and needing a new partner -- when Honda announced in 2020 that it would leave Formula One within a year.
An agreement has since been reached for the team to continue sourcing Honda engines through 2025, but the shock of losing its supplier focused minds at Red Bull and ended with it resolving to build its own version rather than buy one produced by, or shared with, a rival like Mercedes.
"The Ford discussion felt right from the word go," Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, said in an interview. Both he and Farley declined to provide financial details of their new partnership.
Red Bull, which already employs hundreds of people for its Formula One team, had decided it would go into the engine-building business in 2021, poaching top engineers from rivals, notably Mercedes, and setting up a new division at its factory outside of London. That operation, Red Bull Powertrains, will become the locus of the partnership with Ford.
For Ford, the new rules, particularly the emphasis on electricity, and sustainable fuels, led it to revise its position on Formula One, a sport that it left after deciding it could not justify the business case to remain. Ford sold its Jaguar racing team to Red Bull in 2004.
Ford's new involvement -- and, Farley made clear, its potential costs -- would not be as intensive as those borne by typical teams backed by automobile manufacturers like Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. "We wanted something more strategic," Farley said.
He called it "a very practical approach to entering Formula One," adding, "I can look my shareholders, the Ford family, in the eyes and say we're being very judicious and thoughtful."
Mark Rushbrook, the head of Ford's motorsports division, said Ford spoke with 10 Formula One teams, as well as some aspiring teams, before reaching a deal with Red Bull, a decision that executives said was eventually made late last year.
In an interview before the deal was announced, Farley and Horner both spoke of a division of labor and responsibilities, with Red Bull's expertise in aerodynamics seen as complementing Ford's research and multibillion-dollar investment in developing batteries and electric vehicles.
Farley described the partnership as "a tech exchange," but Ford may be just as excited about tapping into a new audience. Formula One, powered by new races and a popular Netflix series, is resurgent in the United States. Three races, including a first Las Vegas Grand Prix, will be held in America in the new season, more than in any other country on the globe-trotting circuit, and the hit Netflix series, "Drive to Survive," has made stars of its drivers and even team managers like Horner.
"I think, you know, that series opened America's eyes to Formula One," Horner said. "It brought in a whole new fan base, a young fan base, a much broader demographic, and it's had an incredible impact."
That is exactly the cohort that Farley and Ford are trying to reach as the company looks to grow its electric vehicle business. "We wanted to connect with a new group of consumers," he said.
Ford remains the third most successful engine manufacturer in Formula One history, but its last championship-winning car was driven by Michael Schumacher almost three decades ago. It knows as well as anyone how Formula One can be a fickle sport, and how rule changes can disrupt the fortunes of once dominant teams, a fact most recently confirmed by the decline of Mercedes, which until it was usurped by Red Bull in the last two seasons was the undisputed powerhouse of the grid.
By the time the Ford-Red Bull collaboration reaches the start line in 2026, the changes will be even more profound, and the potential for unpredictability even greater. Rushbrook described the changes as akin to "a clean slate" for the sport.
Red Bull's ability to ride rule changes successfully over its 16 years helped to shape Ford's thinking, he added. "They can really have the DNA or the culture inside their team to be the best and to be at the front," he said.
Farley said he is convinced that Ford has found a formula that works, one that will not require Ford to invest bottomless sums to keep pace with traditional factory-run teams.
"This is a different kind of wiring than the traditional relationships in the past," he said, "and one of the best bang for bucks in motorsports."

Full text: Ahead of the first-ever Grammy Award for songwriter of the year, two musicians who have been both headliners and behind-the-scenes cogs trace their unique journeys to recognition.
While Adele, Beyoncé and Harry Styles may soak up the most attention at Sunday's Grammy Awards, other musicians often relegated to the fine print of superstar albums will celebrate one extra chance at recognition this year. For the first time, the Recording Academy will present an award for songwriter of the year, non-classical, making background figures the focus, at least for a moment.
But while the five nominees in the inaugural category may be best understood as collaborators toiling in the studio shadows, each has performed and released their own music, too, pointing to an enduring industry reality: The line between headliner and behind-the-scenes hand is porous and ever-fluctuating, especially in a social media era that has demystified much of the pop-music machine, casting the spotlight in unlikely places.
Terius Gesteelde-Diamant, or The-Dream (formerly Terius Nash), knows the delicate dance between secret weapon and star performer better than most. Credited as a writer on blockbuster hits like Beyoncé's "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)," Rihanna's "Umbrella" and Justin Bieber's "Baby," The-Dream has also released five solo albums across a varied 15-year career.
Nominated six times on Sunday for his contributions to Beyoncé's "Renaissance," plus as a songwriter for work with Pusha T and Brent Faiyaz, The-Dream will face off for the songwriting honors against Amy Allen (Lizzo, King Princess); Nija Charles (Beyoncé, Summer Walker); Tobias Jesso Jr. (Styles, Adele); and Laura Veltz (Maren Morris, Demi Lovato).
If the award had existed earlier, that list may very well have included Priscilla Hamilton.
Now known as the R&B singer Muni Long, Hamilton worked more than a decade as a songwriter on tracks like Pitbull and Kesha's "Timber," Rihanna's "California King Bed" and Fifth Harmony's "Worth It." This year, after breaking through with the TikTok hit "Hrs and Hrs," she earned a Grammy nomination for best new artist, along with best R&B performance and best R&B song.
In a joint interview, Muni Long, 34, and The-Dream, 45, discussed their unique industry vantage point; their intertwining paths to Grammys recognition; and how to best be a vessel for another artist and your own work. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Having alternated between forward-facing artist and behind-the-scenes writer, your nominations this year could easily have been swapped at another point in time. Were you in a background role?
MUNI LONG I've always wanted to perform and never even really knew that songwriting was a profession. I got my start on the internet in 2004 -- YouTube, writing my own stuff, doing covers. I went viral a couple times, back before that was a word, and I got a deal with Capitol Records. I had no idea what I was doing and was just trusting the leadership of those around me. When you come from the dirt-road country and you get thrown into Hollywood, you just think, "Oh, these people know." And now, in hindsight, I realize nobody knows.
I was an NPC -- a non-playable character -- literally just going through the motions and trying to be what I thought people wanted me to be. I did an album under the name Priscilla, but I was very unhappy. I was never my full self in those moments. Then everything came to a grinding halt.
Did transitioning to songwriting feel like Plan B, or did it feel right?
MUNI LONG It was off to the races. I was doing five sessions a day, writing two songs in every session. I did it to eat, No. 1. And No. 2, it was constantly the carrot on the end of the stick: "If you get a Top 10, that will help you in your artist career. If you get a No. 1 ... If you get two No. 1s."
I kept reaching the milestones and the finish line kept moving. I was making lots of money, had a lot of success, and I was still just very unhappy. So I decided to pause. I sat down for like eight months, trying to decide what I wanted out of this. That's when Muni Long was born.
Dream, did you start with visions of stardom?
THE-DREAM It's such a contrast, for me, being from Atlanta, Ga., because everything was about the band -- and it always was. The HBCUs, the Florida [A&M University] Marching 100, Grambling, Jackson. We studied those VCR tapes. And in third grade, I started playing trumpet. Everything was the culture of being in the band and being a part of something, knowing all these things have to come together to make a piece of music. That designed what my flight was.
How did you make it a career?
THE-DREAM Being a kid in the '90s, everything was about hustling the music game to get out -- no different than going to play basketball or football. If there's a dope dealer over here who's trying to put out a rap record, you go over and write the hook. At that time, like stars colliding in space, there was L.A. Reid starting LaFace, So So Def, Dallas Austin writing these incredible songs. These are people that we know! "You seen Dallas in that new Ferrari? You know how he got it?" "Nah ..." "He wrote these records!" Once we knew, voilà.
Muni, did those people pave the way for how your career unfolded?
MUNI LONG I grew up on my grandparents' farm and I would be in the room watching "106 and Park," never realizing that one day I would know these people and be brushing shoulders with them. It took a minute for me to feel like I was supposed to be there and not like I was intruding. Until maybe about five or six years ago.
After all the ways that I attempted to break through as an artist, I decided to take advantage of TikTok and social media. It's so much easier now to break through, especially if your music is good. It only took six days for my song to go from nothing to No. 1.
Dream, you've said you made your solo records reluctantly.
THE-DREAM My first album, "Love/Hate," was showcasing things that people wouldn't take a chance on. Take a song like "I Love Your Girl" -- however sweet it may sound from a tone and texture standpoint, it was saying a super-menacing thing. What R&B artist at the time would've sung that? No one. Now there's a whole genre based on that feeling and idea.
Hits, they go up fast, but they come down fast. When a record goes No. 1, I cringe. If something is that wide, that means it can't really be first. It can't be that unique. Like "Break My Soul" vs. "Cuff It." "Cuff It" is this growing thing that's not on a conveyor belt.
MUNI LONG When things tip over into the mainstream, it's like, "OK, that's corny, we can't do that anymore." People take the slang and start using it wrong. The lyric is slapped on the side of a coffee cup -- that's not cool. Once something becomes huge, it loses its quirkiness and the thing that made it --
THE-DREAM Special.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Recently someone on social media posted the instrumental for "Single Ladies" and was like, how did someone sing over this ?
THE-DREAM I was sitting on the sofa that day listening to this track Tricky [Stewart] was doing. He was about to go on to the next idea. He had no idea that in my head, I've written the whole thing.
I went, basically, from the top of that song all the way down, and we knew exactly what it was. We knew it was a smash. You're hearing this thing that sounds from outer space -- I don't understand where the melody's going to come from. But back to this idea of the South, Baptist church -- some place in Hawkinsville, Ga.
MUNI LONG [clapping and singing] We don't need no music! We don't need no music!
THE-DREAM That's where I am in my head. All I see is big hats, fans in the summertime, hot sweat, gnats -- all that stuff you don't want to be a part of in the South in the middle of June at some church homecoming. Then the business of it is, "What's broad about this?" Broad is the topic: a woman who says you didn't catch me when I was down and now I'm up. It's the ugly duckling -- we know that story. You just put it in a different way.
MUNI LONG One of the biggest things about being a hit songwriter, or an artist who writes these incredible songs, is being able to A&R -- what music is great and what isn't, knowing when not to write on something, knowing when to pass. It's that feeling. You were talking about freestyling a song from top to bottom -- every song I've ever done that on has been huge: "California King Bed," "Timber," "Hrs and Hrs," "Don't Wake Me Up." You don't get in the way of what the song wants to be.
What are your other strategies as a writer when you sit down with a big artist?
THE-DREAM For me to jump in with a Bey and Rihanna, to be them, I was them all day before I got to the studio. I was them five years ago. The gift is being able to communicate a certain emotion.
MUNI LONG I love co-creation. I love being the least talented person in a room. I like to see inside of people's brains. How do you talk? How do you view the world? If I'm writing for another artist, I'm becoming this channel, this vessel for how you speak. I'm in complete service mode.
When did you realize you could be that chameleon?
MUNI LONG I grew up, like I said, watching countdowns -- "TRL," VH1. Very similar to a Max Martin or a lot of my friends from Sweden, where they only get the hits, so that's how they think of songs. It's harder for me to do something niche, like a SZA or a Tyler, the Creator, that cool thing. I'm thinking structure -- "I have to catch them in the first 15 seconds!" I really want to make something that touches as many people as possible.
Muni, what else did you bring from your time as a songwriter into the headliner you've become?
MUNI LONG I didn't really receive the best treatment as a songwriter. I'm not the only one who feels like this. The spaces that I was in -- being a Black woman, being young -- I just knew that I didn't want to continue those toxic cycles of treating people poorly.
What does it mean to see the Grammys acknowledge songwriters with their own category after all these years?
THE-DREAM Nobody knew who The-Dream was in that space until "Single Ladies." That means we missed 24 months of the most special part of my existence. That's why this category is so important. If there's not a person who brings you to the table early on, we have to close that gap. We have to go into that dungeon to find that person. It's the only way we can grow.

The Restless Quest for Better Frozen Pizza: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since 1962, when the Minneapolis entrepreneur Rose Totino introduced it to American shoppers, frozen pizza has been an after-school snack, the quickest route to dinner, a midnight temptation of last resort.
But in the last five years, frozen pizza has become something else entirely: a piece of culinary craft, an authentic taste of Italy, a connection to buzzy pizzerias like Roberta's in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and Pizzana in Los Angeles and Dallas.
Sales of frozen food surged during the pandemic, according to IRI and other market research firms, boosting premium mass-produced brands like Talia di Napoli and Table 87, and pushing even the most traditional pizzaiolos toward the freezer aisle.
The challenge of pizza is to cook each element to peak deliciousness at once. When ice and shipping are added to the equation, that becomes even more complicated. Fresh mozzarella becomes clumpy, tomatoes dry out, crusts become soggy.
New freezing technology and affordable access to express shipping have made it possible for more options to slide into freezers. But they're not coming out of frozen-food factories owned by industry giants like Nestlé or Rich's. These new pies are wood- or coal-fired, hand-pulled and made with organic and Italian ingredients.
What they lack in the lavishness of a Tombstone Roadhouse Loaded Double Down Deluxe pizza, they strive to make up for in simplicity and quality. Like a Starbucks Frappucino and a double espresso, producers say, there is a time and a place for each.
Chris Bianco, the chef and owner of Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, didn't even offer takeout or delivery until the pandemic. Now, he freezes and ships pies directly from his restaurant via the online delivery service Goldbelly. "Survival is an interesting motivator for change," said Mr. Bianco, a notorious purist who uses flour made from regenerative grains, organic mozzarella and organic tomatoes.
"It's pizza played at a different speed," he said of his frozen pies. "I think we could eat better things that are built for speed, comfort and deliciousness."
Anthony Mangieri, the founder of Una Pizza Napoletana in Manhattan, said he has made every ball of pizza dough he has ever served during his 30 years in the business. But in 2017, he set out on a new quest: to create a frozen pizza that would meet his standards -- wood-fired, slow-risen, fashioned from all-natural and all-Italian ingredients -- but made almost entirely with automation.
In the United States, industrially produced pies from companies like DiGiorno and Red Baron are engineered for freezing using dough conditioners, additives and processed cheeses. The crusts are infused with sugar and oil, the dough is par-baked, and the sauce and cheese are applied raw, to be cooked in your oven.
For bakers like Mr. Mangieri, this completely ignores the essential nature of pizza: the slow, natural rise of the dough, and an oven's high heat to fuse the ingredients and char the crust.
Mr. Mangieri eventually found a plant in Northern Italy with wood-fired ovens to produce his frozen pies, which he sells under the name Genio Della Pizza. But the factory managers were vexed by his strict rules and sticky dough, which gummed up the works. Mr. Mangieri, a Formula One fan who knew that Ferrari's headquarters, the pride of the region, were nearby, begged the pizza manufacturer to think of his pizza as a next-generation Ferrari engine.
"If we aren't pushing to be better, why are we even getting up in the morning?" he said.
Especially for products made with unprocessed ingredients, quick freezing is essential in preserving taste, aroma and texture. Once confined to factories, blast-chilling technology now has a much smaller footprint and is available to mom-and-pop pizza chains at relatively affordable prices.
When the pandemic temporarily shuttered the five popular Pizzeria Delfina restaurants in the Bay Area, the owners, Craig and Annie Stoll, began taking online orders for frozen pizza, making and freezing pies themselves and hauling a truck full of Igloo coolers to roadside delivery points. What saved the business, Ms. Stoll said, was the blast freezer they bought for $ 15,000.
It's now possible to order frozen pizzas from some of the country's best pizzerias, either directly or through Goldbelly.
But it is not cheap: Three frozen margherita pies from Pizzeria Delfina, a favorite among four New York Times Food and Cooking staffers in a recent blind pizza tasting, cost $ 104.95 including Goldbelly shipping. Four pies from Pizzeria Bianco cost $ 129.95, or about $ 32.50 per pie. (The same pizza costs $ 20 at the original pizzeria in Phoenix, and $ 24 in the Los Angeles store that opened last year.)
But the pizzas produced specifically for the freezer aisle of grocery stores are more competitively priced. Table 87, Roberta's, Talia di Napoli and Genio Della Pizza all charge about $ 11 for a 14-inch pizza that theoretically serves three people, though two seems realistic and one entirely possible.
Mr. Mangieri said that making his Genio Della Pizza pizzas in Italy keeps the price down because heavy ingredients like buffalo mozzarella and canned plum tomatoes are available in bulk and don't have to travel to the United States.
Elly Truesdell, who advises and invests in small food companies through her venture capital fund New Fare, was director of new products at Whole Foods Market 10 years ago, during what she calls "the premiumization of the frozen aisle."
Although premium frozen products remain more expensive than conventional counterparts like DiGiorno, she said, they provide a chef-driven experience that's cheaper than going out to restaurants.
When Roberta's and Table 87 ventured into the national market, their pizzas' visual appeal, restaurant heritage and unprocessed ingredients were so distinguishable from their competitors that buyers found the products irresistible, Ms. Truesdell said.
The whole point of frozen pizza, though, is to become mainstream. Pizza takes up more space in supermarket freezers than any other product except ice cream, and introducing a new product into that space is difficult.
One way to carve out a spot is to stand out from the competition. Tom Cucco, a longtime Brooklyn restaurateur, started with a very specific dream: to open a pizzeria that sold coal-oven pizza by the slice. (Famously, old-school New York pizzerias like Totonno's and John's of Bleecker Street make only whole pies, to order.) He opened Table 87 in Brooklyn in 2012, and gained a following for his margherita.
His son Robert said no one but his father thought it was a good idea to sell individually packed frozen slices. Though a deal resulting from his pitch on the show "Shark Tank" ultimately fell through, the slices took off and are now sold at Walmart, Wegmans and Whole Foods -- an enviable retail trifecta.
In addition to the demands of the pandemic, many makers credit Joe Ariel, the founder of Goldbelly, for hauling them over the final hurdles to selling and shipping frozen pizza. The company, which handles orders and shipping for nearly 1,000 food businesses around the United States, sends members of its logistics and packaging-science team to get each vendor up to speed on best practices for freezing.
Pizza is the fastest-growing segment on the site, even without the help of the Super Bowl on Feb. 12. Depending on the draw, frozen tomato pies from Corropolese in Philadelphia or pizzas from the St. Louis chain Imo's are likely to dominate.
"People will be stuffing themselves with the taste of home," Mr. Ariel said. "Obviously, seeing Billy Joel at the Garden is the experience, but you're not going to not listen to Spotify."

Banks in Iran And Russia Move to Link Their Systems: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had long been cautious about deepening ties to Iran, but his calculus has changed during the course of the war.
Iran and Russia have taken a step toward integrating their banking systems, according to a senior Iranian official, in a move that would expand collaboration between Tehran and Moscow as they try to work around Western sanctions that have thwarted both countries' access to foreign capital.
Mohsen Karimi, the deputy governor of Iran's central bank, told Fars, the semiofficial Iranian news agency, on Monday that Iranian banks could now rely on Russian bank messaging services, allowing them to make international transactions while bypassing much of the global banking establishment.
Tough economic sanctions imposed by Western countries have disconnected banks in both countries from SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, a Belgian messaging service that links more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world. The system is critical for cross-border payments, allowing international banks and financial companies to transmit payment instructions and alert each other to transactions before they happen.
"We have connected the national banking messaging network of the two countries and we no longer need SWIFT," Mr. Karimi told Fars in an interview, adding that the system would connect about 700 Russian banks with 106 banks from at least 13 other countries.
Representatives from Russia's central bank, which has not yet confirmed the agreement, are set to arrive in Iran in a few days to finalize details, he said.
SWIFT cut ties with Iranian banks in 2018, after then President Donald J. Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in recent months, after nationwide demonstrations in Iran were met with a brutal crackdown.
Some Russian banks were similarly cut off from the SWIFT system following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.
"We're seeing two pariah states trying to find ways in which they can help each other in what can be perceived as a common threat to both of them," said Michael Parker, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who now heads the anti-money-laundering and sanctions practice at the Washington-based law firm Ferrari & Associates. "When you push state actors away from the core into the periphery, it's only logical that they will find each other."
The move toward integrating banking systems seems to signal that Iran and Russia may be solidifying ties that Western officials have described as an alliance of convenience. The Biden administration warned last year that Russia and Iran were strengthening their military links into a "full-fledged defense partnership."
Linking their banking systems will allow Tehran and Moscow to share their experiences operating under sanctions programs, which "are tailored to two different perceived threats" and do not apply uniformly to both countries or financial systems, Mr. Parker said.
The financial sanctions on Russia -- which some call the most extensive in modern history -- have eroded its economy and curbed its post-Soviet efforts to modernize along Western lines. Crippling sanctions in Iran have similarly cut off its access to international markets, decimating its economy and its currency, which in recent months has fallen about 30 percent, a historic low.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has historically approached deepening ties to Iran with caution, but his calculus has changed as his war with Ukraine has frozen Russia out of Western markets. Moscow is now increasingly looking to Tehran as an economic partner to help alleviate some of the effects of Western sanctions.
"Iran has spent years honing its craft to blunt the impact of much more comprehensive sanctions programs that have been leveled against it and its economy," said Mr. Parker. "Russia, in turn, has a much more robust and modern banking system that has not been fully shut out of the global economy just yet."
The agreement this week was mentioned in October by a Russian trade representative, who said that the new banking system could be operational within a few months, according to Tass, the Russian state-run news agency.
The executive director of the Russian Association of the Crypto Industry and Blockchain, Alexander Brazhnikov, told a Russian newspaper earlier this month that it was working with Iran to launch a joint cryptocurrency. The collaboration has the potential to further mitigate the effects of Western sanctions by allowing both countries to conduct transactions outside the international banking system with countries willing to trade in digital currency.

Anthony Mangieri, the founder of Una Pizza Napoletana in New York’s Manhattan borough, said he has made every ball of pizza dough he has ever served during his 30 years in the business. But in 2017, he set out on a new quest: to create a frozen pizza that would meet his standards — wood-fired, slow-risen, fashioned from all-natural and all-Italian ingredients — but made almost entirely with automation.
In the United States, industrially produced pies from companies like DiGiorno and Red Baron are engineered for freezing using dough conditioners, additives and processed cheeses. The crusts are infused with sugar and oil, the dough is par-baked, and the sauce and cheese are applied raw, to be cooked in your oven.
For bakers like Mangieri, this completely ignores the essential nature of pizza: the slow, natural rise of the dough, and an oven’s high heat to fuse the ingredients and char the crust.
Mangieri eventually found a plant in Northern Italy with wood-fired ovens to produce his frozen pies, which he sells under the name Genio Della Pizza. But the factory managers were vexed by his strict rules and sticky dough, which gummed up the works. Mangieri, a Formula One fan who knew that Ferrari’s headquarters, the pride of the region, were nearby, begged the pizza manufacturer to think of his pizza as a next-generation Ferrari engine.
“If we aren’t pushing to be better, why are we even getting up in the morning?” he said.
Especially for products made with unprocessed ingredients, quick freezing is essential in preserving taste, aroma and texture. Once confined to factories, blast-chilling technology now has a much smaller footprint and is available to mom-and-pop pizza chains at relatively affordable prices.
When the pandemic temporarily shuttered the five popular Pizzeria Delfina restaurants in the Bay Area, the owners, Craig and Annie Stoll, began taking online orders for frozen pizza, making and freezing pies themselves and hauling a truck full of Igloo coolers to roadside delivery points. What saved the business, Annie Stoll said, was the blast freezer they bought for $15,000.
It’s now possible to order frozen pizzas from some of the country’s best pizzerias, either directly or through Goldbelly.
But it is not cheap: Three frozen margherita pies from Pizzeria Delfina, a favorite among four New York Times Food and Cooking staffers in a recent blind pizza tasting, cost $104.95, including Goldbelly shipping. Four pies from Pizzeria Bianco cost $129.95, or about $32.50 per pie. (The same pizza costs $20 at the original pizzeria in Phoenix, and $24 in the Los Angeles store that opened last year.)
But the pizzas produced specifically for the freezer aisle of grocery stores are more competitively priced. Table 87, Roberta’s, Talia di Napoli and Genio Della Pizza all charge about $11 for a 14-inch pizza that theoretically serves three people, although two seems realistic and one entirely possible.
Mangieri said that making his Genio Della Pizza pizzas in Italy keeps the price down because heavy ingredients like buffalo mozzarella and canned plum tomatoes are available in bulk and don’t have to travel to the United States.
Elly Truesdell, who advises and invests in small food companies through her venture capital fund New Fare, was director of new products at Whole Foods Market 10 years ago, during what she calls “the premiumization of the frozen aisle.”
Although premium frozen products remain more expensive than conventional counterparts like DiGiorno, she said, they provide a chef-driven experience that’s cheaper than going out to restaurants.
When Roberta’s and Table 87 ventured into the national market, their pizzas’ visual appeal, restaurant heritage and unprocessed ingredients were so distinguishable from their competitors that buyers found the products irresistible, Truesdell said.
The whole point of frozen pizza, though, is to become mainstream. Pizza takes up more space in supermarket freezers than any other product except ice cream, and introducing a new product into that space is difficult.
One way to carve out a spot is to stand out from the competition. Tom Cucco, a longtime Brooklyn restaurateur, started with a very specific dream: to open a pizzeria that sold coal-oven pizza by the slice. (Famously, old-school New York pizzerias like Totonno’s and John’s of Bleecker Street make only whole pies, to order.) He opened Table 87 in Brooklyn in 2012 and gained a following for his margherita.
His son Robert said no one but his father thought it was a good idea to sell individually packed frozen slices. Although a deal resulting from his pitch on the show “Shark Tank,” ultimately fell through, the slices took off and are now sold at Walmart, Wegmans and Whole Foods — an enviable retail trifecta.
In addition to the demands of the pandemic, many makers credit Joe Ariel, the founder of Goldbelly, for hauling them over the final hurdles to selling and shipping frozen pizza. The company, which handles orders and shipping for nearly 1,000 food businesses around the United States, sends members of its logistics and packaging-science team to get each vendor up to speed on best practices for freezing.
Pizza is the fastest-growing segment on the site, even without the help of the Super Bowl on Feb. 12. Depending on the draw, frozen tomato pies from Corropolese in Philadelphia or pizzas from the St. Louis chain Imo’s are likely to dominate.
“People will be stuffing themselves with the taste of home,” Ariel said. “Obviously, seeing Billy Joel at the Garden is the experience, but you’re not going to not listen to Spotify.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Why is it that when you have the most to do you feel the least able to act? This sense of helplessness -- also called "overwhelm freeze" -- always seems to set in when you have a dozen things on your list, all equally pressing. Or it shows up when you have one huge thing to get done that really matters. Experts say that paralyzed feeling is an anxiety response that arises when we view the task (or many tasks) in front of us as a threat. These tips can help you snap out of your frozen state. DANA G. SMITH
Shrink the elephant task. First, you need to turn down your stress levels a notch or two. Try taking a few deep breaths, which can lower your cortisol, one of the main stress hormones. If it's a single task that's making you feel overwhelmed, the gold-standard advice is to break it into tiny steps. "It's like that old adage, 'How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,"' said Piers Steel, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Calgary. These steps should be "ridiculously small," said Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical assistant professor at Boston University. "The measuring stick is that your task should be so small that you feel no resistance."
Incentivize yourself. For an overwhelming list of little to-dos, the key is to start strategically. You could do the most important or timely thing first, but another option is to begin with the most enjoyable task. Starting with the smallest or easiest item can also build confidence and momentum. "Do some part of it that you can do and that you can succeed at, because nothing builds success like success," said Joseph Ferrari, a psychology professor at DePaul University.
Whatever you do, don't avoid it. What you really don't want is for your paralysis to turn into procrastination, where you do something small and pleasurable in the short term, like scroll through Instagram, to avoid the big hard thing. The key is to work through the anxiety and teach your brain that it can still function under stress. Doing so builds confidence and good habits for the next time your to-do list looms.

Full text: He defined a conservative course for the Roman Catholic Church, but his papacy was noted for his struggle with the clergy sexual abuse scandal and for his unexpected resignation.
Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, a quiet scholar of diamond-hard intellect who spent much of his life enforcing church doctrine and defending tradition before shocking the Roman Catholic world by becoming the first pope in six centuries to resign, died on Saturday. He was 95.
Benedict's death was announced by the Vatican. No cause was given. This past week, the Vatican said that Benedict's health had taken a turn for the worse "due to advancing age."
On Wednesday, Pope Francis asked those present at his weekly audience at the Vatican to pray for Benedict, who he said was "very ill." He later visited him at the monastery on the Vatican City grounds where Benedict had lived since announcing his resignation in February 2013.
In that announcement, citing a loss of stamina and his "advanced age" at 85, Benedict said he was stepping down freely and "for the good of the church." The decision, surprising the faithful and the world at large, capped a papacy of almost eight years in which his efforts to re-energize the Roman Catholic Church were often overshadowed by the unresolved sexual abuse scandal in the clergy.
After the selection of his successor that March -- Pope Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires -- and a temporary stay at Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer residence, Benedict moved to a convent in Vatican City. It was the first time that two pontiffs had shared the same grounds.
The two men were reportedly on good terms personally, but it was at times an awkward arrangement, and Francis moved decisively to reshape the papacy, firing or demoting many of Benedict's traditionalist appointees and elevating the virtue of mercy over rules that Benedict had spent decades refining and enforcing.
Benedict, the uncharismatic intellectual who had largely preached to the church's most fervent believers, was soon eclipsed by Francis, an unexpectedly popular successor who immediately sought to widen Catholicism's appeal and to make the Vatican newly relevant in world affairs. But as Francis' traditionalist-minded critics raised their voices in the later 2010s, they made Benedict a rallying point of their opposition, fueling fears that his resignation could promote a schism.
In early 2019, Benedict broke his post-papacy silence, issuing a 6,000-word letter that seemed at odds with his successor's view of the sexual abuse scandals. Benedict attributed the crisis to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, secularization and an erosion of morality that he pinned on liberal theology. Francis, by contrast, saw its origins in the exaltation of authority and abuse of power in the church hierarchy.
Given his frail health at the time, however, many church watchers questioned whether Benedict had indeed written the letter or had been manipulated to issue it as a way to undercut Francis.
Benedict himself was swept up in the scandal after a January 2022 report that had been commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church in Munich to investigate how the church had handled cases of sexual abuse between 1945 and 2019. The report contended that Benedict had mishandled four cases involving the sexual abuse of minors decades ago, while he was an archbishop in Germany, and that he had misled investigators in his written answers.
Two weeks after the report was made public, Benedict acknowledged in a letter that "abuses and errors" had taken place under his watch and asked for forgiveness. But he denied any misconduct.
At the time of his resignation, his decision to step down humbled and humanized a pope whose papacy had become associated with tempests. There were tangles with Jews, Muslims and Anglicans, and with progressive Catholics, who were distressed by his overtures to the most traditionalist fringes of the Catholic world.
It was a painful paradox to his supporters that the long-gathering sexual abuse crisis should finally hit the Vatican with a vengeance under Benedict, in 2010. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, charged with leading the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office responsible for defending church orthodoxy, he had been ahead of many peers in recognizing how deeply the church had been damaged by disclosures that priests around the world had sexually abused youths for decades and even longer. As early as 2005, he referred to the abuse as "filth in the church."
Elected pope on April 19, 2005, after the death of John Paul II, Benedict went on to apologize for the abuse and met with victims, a first for the papacy. But he could not escape the reality that the church had shielded priests accused of molestation, minimized behavior that it would otherwise have deemed immoral, and kept all of it secret from the civil authorities, forestalling criminal prosecutions.
The reckoning clouded the widely held view that Benedict was the most influential intellectual force in the church in a generation.
"It's worth stepping back for a moment and remembering that Benedict is probably the greatest scholar to rule the church since Innocent III, the brilliant jurist who served from 1198 to 1216," the Princeton historian Anthony Grafton wrote in The New York Review of Books in 2010.
John Paul II had won hearts, but it was Cardinal Ratzinger who defined the corrective to what he and John Paul saw as an alarming liberal shift within the church, set in motion by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s.
The church's 265th pope, Benedict was the first German to hold the title in a half-millennium, and his election was a milestone toward Germany's spiritual renewal 60 years after World War II and the Holocaust. At 78, he was also the oldest man to become pope since 1730.
The church he inherited was in crisis, the sexual abuse scandal being its most vivid manifestation. It was an institution run by a mainly European hierarchy overseeing a faithful -- numbering one billion -- largely residing in the developing world. And it was being torn between its ancient, insular ways and the modern world.
For the church's liberals, Benedict represented not the answer to that crisis but the problem: an out-of-step conservative European academic. Many wondered if he would be a mere caretaker, filling the post after the long papacy of the beloved John Paul until a younger, more dynamic heir could be elevated.
He settled that question quickly. Though his shy, bookish demeanor seemed to augur a less ambitious path, he moved with force to act on an idea that he had long embraced: that the church's answer to rising secularism and the gains of other faiths should lie less in broadening Catholicism's appeal than in nurturing its more conservative believers, even if the cost was a smaller church.
Benedict was difficult to label ideologically. Though conservative in his religious and social views, he took what many considered to be liberal stands: promoting environmental protection; condemning the American war in Iraq; and, perhaps most baffling to conservatives, criticizing capitalism, notably during the financial crisis that erupted in 2008.
He also had an unpredictable streak, as his surprise resignation made clear. In 2010, he addressed the church's strict ban on condoms, which had been particularly criticized during the AIDS crisis that gripped Africa. While condoms were not "a real or moral solution" to the AIDS epidemic, he said, "there may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralization, a first assumption of responsibility."
From the outset, Benedict was prone to making provocative statements that alienated one ethnic or religious group or another. These were then followed by clarifications or apologies. It was an unfamiliar pattern for the 2,000-year-old papacy.
In January 2009, he lifted the excommunications of four breakaway bishops who belonged to the far-right Society of Saint Pius X. One of them, Richard Williamson, had roused outrage when he said in an interview days earlier that Nazi gas chambers had never existed and that only several hundred thousand Jews had died in the Holocaust, and not as a deliberate Nazi policy.
The pope cast his decision as an effort to heal a schism in the church. His critics said it was an extreme example of his willingness to cater to the far-right Catholic fringe.
Liberals in the church had made the same complaint two years earlier, when Benedict loosened restrictions on use of the old Latin Mass. That decision angered Jewish groups as well, because it allowed the use of a Good Friday prayer that calls for the conversion of Jews.
Benedict drew more criticism in October 2009, when he eased the rules for the conversion of Anglicans. The Vatican said that it was answering the requests of Anglican traditionalists, who had opposed decisions by the Church of England to allow women into the priesthood and gay men to become bishops.
In the Williamson case, the decision to lift the excommunication only further eroded trust among Jews, which had been shaky since the start of Benedict's papacy, when it was widely noted that the young Joseph Ratzinger had been a member of the Hitler Youth -- an unwilling one, by all accounts -- and a conscript in Hitler's army. The chief rabbi of Rome threatened to cut off relations with the Vatican.
Benedict said that he had not been aware of Bishop Williamson's remarks and apologized. He then acknowledged the depth of his mistake when he issued an extraordinary letter to the world's bishops, suggesting that there was some substance to the accusation that the Vatican was out of touch. He promised to pay more attention to the internet, where Bishop Williamson's remarks had circulated. But he maintained that revoking the excommunications had been a good-will measure toward church unity.
Benedict was said to have a tin ear for politics. In September 2006, at the University of Regensburg in Germany, where he once taught theology, he delivered a speech quoting a medieval Byzantine emperor using the words "evil and inhuman" to describe Islam. With tensions already high after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the speech provoked an outcry in the Muslim world.
Benedict expressed regret for that reaction but did not apologize for using the words. They had to be understood as part of a treatise on religion in modern life, he said. Indeed, the speech as a whole was largely praised, but only his comments on Islam were widely remembered.
The controversies distracted from Benedict's accomplishments. His pastoral letters, or encyclicals, on love, hope and charity were acclaimed as wise and eloquent. His promoting of what his biographer John L. Allen Jr. called "affirmative orthodoxy" emphasized the good that Catholic life could bring rather than the actions that the church forbade -- a theme that stood in contrast to his laying down the law for the faithful when he was a cardinal overseeing church doctrine, drawing complaints that he was divisive.
"The question arises: Do we really want this -- to live eternally?" Benedict asked in a characteristic passage of a 2007 encyclical on hope. "Perhaps many people reject the faith today simply because they do not find the prospect of eternal life attractive."
He went on to describe a heaven that is not, as he put it, "monotonous and ultimately unbearable."
"It would be like plunging into the ocean of infinite love, a moment in which time -- the before and after -- no longer exists," he said. "We can only attempt to grasp the idea that such a moment is life in the full sense, a plunging ever anew into the vastness of being, in which we are simply overwhelmed with joy."
A pianist with a taste for Mozart, Benedict once called rock music a "vehicle of anti-religion." (In contrast, John Paul had clapped along at a Bob Dylan concert.) He worried that Harry Potter might be a danger to young minds.
To those who saw the church as behind the times, Benedict was Exhibit A. But few of his critics disputed his articulation of what it meant to be a Roman Catholic today. He was candid in conceding a decline of faith in the increasingly secularized developed world.
The challenge before him was great, perhaps too great: to renew the Catholic faith in the West. But lacking the emotional warmth of John Paul, he did not set out to recreate the papacy as a popular, media-friendly office for general spirituality and good. Rather, in his professorial way, he pleaded for recognition that reason, science and secular values alone could not explain the human mystery. He preached a return to Catholic basics: going to Mass, adoring the Virgin Mary and declaring the truth of Christianity against the threat of "relativism," the idea that all beliefs are equal.
He resisted calls from the church's liberal wing to rethink the celibacy requirement in the priesthood and to allow divorced Catholics to receive communion. Better, he believed, to accept a smaller church of more orthodox believers at odds with much of the world than a watered-down faith.
His papacy did not fit into any simple boxes, however. Conservatives expressed disappointment that he had not engaged in an American-style culture war. Liberals were often surprised by a pastoral manner that sought to avoid open confrontation. His first encyclical, the highest form of papal teaching, was on love -- not only God's love for humankind, but, surprising many readers, also sexual love between married men and women.
Relations With Islam
Benedict did not shy from voicing what he regarded as uncomfortable truths about Europe's Christian roots and about other religions, Islam in particular. In his 2006 speech at Regensburg, he said, "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."
He was quoting a medieval Byzantine emperor, Benedict made clear, noting that the speech largely criticized the West for quarantining God from daily public life. But he nonetheless stoked fears about radical Islam at a time of terrorist attacks, war in Iraq and growing Muslim immigration to Europe.
Some in the Islamic world reacted with anger and, in places, radical elements committed violence. Churches in the West Bank and Gaza were firebombed, and an Italian nun in Somalia was gunned down, apparently in retaliation for the pope's remarks.
It was not clear that Benedict had anticipated the reaction. Vatican officials, and then Benedict himself, were quick to say that he did not agree with the words he had quoted, suggesting that the Islamic faith was itself prone to violence. Less than a week after the speech, he did what few popes have ever done: He issued a public apology for something he himself had said. "The true meaning of my address in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with mutual respect," he said.
Benedict tested that willingness to talk two months later, on a trip to Turkey, his first to a Muslim country as pope. Many Turks protested the visit. Until the last minute, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then the prime minister and the leader of a moderate Islamist party, refused to meet with him.
But within moments of stepping off the plane, Benedict seemed to offer an olive branch to Turkey, and thus to Muslims. Mr. Erdogan emerged from an airport meeting with the pope reporting that Benedict had given tacit blessing to Turkey's longstanding but troubled ambition to join the European Union.
Benedict's gesture was a reversal. As Cardinal Ratzinger, he had objected to Turkey's joining the union on the ground that the Ottoman Empire had always stood "in permanent contrast to Europe." Conservatives in the church quickly asserted that Benedict had not softened on Islam. He continued to voice concerns about religious freedom for Christians in Muslim lands, and to express abhorrence of any violence committed in the name of God.
Still, the Vatican did not deny that the pope might have had a change of heart about the European Union because of the anger his comments in Regensburg had aroused. His tone, too, shifted. He spoke more than ever about the importance of "dialogue" between Christians and Muslims to overcome the threat of terrorism. The message was vividly delivered in Istanbul in 2006 in a visit to the Blue Mosque, a central symbol of the Ottoman defeat of Byzantine Christianity. Standing silently beside the head mufti of Istanbul, Benedict faced Mecca and prayed.
Few Vatican watchers believed that Benedict's concerns about a radicalized Islam had changed. But after the mosque visit, many Turks expressed a warmer feeling about him, and his own words were embracing.
"During the few minutes of reflection in that place of worship, I turned to the only God of heaven and earth," he told pilgrims and tourists at St. Peter's the week after he returned to Rome. "May all believers see themselves as his creatures and bear witness of true brotherhood."
Bavarian-Born
Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born on April 16, 1927, in the Bavarian village of Marktl am Inn. His father, also named Joseph, was a rural police officer who "was transferred frequently, so we were continually on the road," Benedict wrote in a memoir, "Milestones" (1997).
Benedict said that his father had been opposed to Hitler -- enough to be another reason for the family's repeated moves. Joseph and his wife, Maria, a cook for small inns, had two other children: Maria, born in 1921, and Georg, born in 1924.
Growing up near the Inn river surrounded by hills and woods, Joseph was stamped by the faith of rural "simple believers," as he called them. He often visited the shrine to the Virgin Mary in nearby Altötting.
Joseph wanted to become a priest from a young age. At 5, he was one of a group of children who presented flowers to the archbishop of Munich. Afterward, he announced his intention to become a cardinal. (He later said that he had also considered being a house painter.) His brother, Georg, also became a priest.
In the same way that any understanding of John Paul has to begin with his roots in Communist Poland as Karol Jozef Wojtyla, any insight into Benedict must take into account his coming-of-age in conservative and religious Bavaria during the maelstrom of World War II. Along with the rest of the students at his school, Joseph was automatically enrolled in the Hitler Youth, in 1941. Two years later, as a seminarian, he was drafted into the military, first assigned to an antiaircraft unit and later to the infantry. He was never sent to the front.
There is no evidence that he had Nazi sympathies, as some insinuated after he became pope. He deserted the army near the end of the war and spent months in an American prisoner-of-war camp before his release in June 1945.
Later, as the archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982, he said little about the Holocaust or Germany's historical guilt, though he had an important role in John Paul II's efforts to repair the rift between Jews and Christians. Yet the war shaped his thinking: He viewed the Bavarian church as a root of opposition to the Third Reich.
On a visit to the death-camp complex at Auschwitz and Birkenau in 2006, Benedict said of Hitler's regime, "God finally had to die, and power had to belong to man alone -- to these men who thought that by force they had made themselves the masters of the world." By exterminating Jews, he said, "they ultimately wanted to tear up the taproot of the Christian faith and to replace it with a faith of their own invention: faith in the rule of man, the rule of the powerful."
Benedict believed that the only antidote to godless totalitarianism was obedience to the church -- a credo that his critics said left little room for reasoned opposition inside Catholicism.
After the war, Joseph and Georg resumed their studies for the priesthood and were ordained on the same day, June 29, 1951. Joseph earned his doctorate with a dissertation on St. Augustine and his professorship with a treatise on St. Bonaventure, the medieval Italian philosopher, theologian and priest who gave the church many of its intellectual underpinnings.
Father Ratzinger's own stature as a theologian grew while he was teaching at Freising, Bonn and Munich. Already, colleagues were saying that he was destined for great things.
In 1962, he signed on as a theological adviser to Cardinal Joseph Frings of Cologne at Vatican II. For young and ambitious priests of that era -- Father Ratzinger was 35 -- the conclave was crucial.
The council had been called that year by Pope John XXIII to attune the nearly 2,000-year-old church to the modern world. Father Ratzinger was among the reformers, albeit a careful one: He would modernize the church while respecting its traditions. During Vatican II, he exerted influence by holding seminars and writing speeches and commentaries.
Central to what many call the "Ratzinger myth" was how this reformer became one of the church's most conservative voices. "In the imagination of some liberal critics, Ratzinger's life story would make a script worthy of George Lucas: the young Jedi Knight who went over to the Dark Side of the Force," Mr. Allen, his biographer, wrote in "Cardinal Ratzinger" (2000).
Father Ratzinger had sided with the Vatican II reformers on relaxing the central authority of Rome, curtailing its ability to censure theologians and dispensing with the Latin Mass, which he called "archaeological."
Yet years later, as head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he was emphatic in asserting Rome's authority, censuring theologians and advocating greater freedom to use the Latin Mass.
He denied that his views had shifted. "I see no change in my theological positions over the years," he told Time magazine in 1993.
Still, something had changed. As the spirit of reform in the church and in the wider Western culture gained momentum in the 1960s, he began to see Europe as strangled by secularism and the church's role in public life as diminished. The gentle reforms he saw as necessary in Vatican II had taken an unintended direction.
He was especially troubled by student demonstrations at the University of Tübingen, where he arrived to teach in 1966 with the reputation of a reformer, having been recruited by the Rev. Hans Küng, a liberal theologian.
"Marxist revolution kindled the whole university with its fervor, shaking it to its very foundations," Benedict wrote in his memoirs. The students, calling for a democratization of the church, directed venom at Father Ratzinger himself. Some of his own students chanted, "Accursed be Jesus!" The protests, spreading across Europe in 1968, shocked him.
The Element of Doubt
That same year, Father Ratzinger published what is widely considered his most important theological work, "Introduction to Christianity," which many priests in Rome say was fundamental to their spiritual development. In that book, he argued for belief not as a mystical experience but as something inseparable from reason and doubt, taking seriously the element of doubt in the belief of God.
"Just as the believer knows himself to be constantly threatened by unbelief, which he must experience as a continual temptation, so for the unbeliever faith remains a temptation and a threat to his apparently permanently closed world," he wrote in one celebrated passage. "In short, there is no escape from the dilemma of being a man."
In 1969, he moved from Tübingen to the calmer and more conservative new university at Regensburg, near his hometown, where his brother was a priest and choir leader. In 1977, Pope Paul VI named Father Ratzinger archbishop of Munich and Freising. Later that year, he was named a cardinal, the top cadre of the church from which popes are selected.
More than a year later, another conservative, Cardinal Wojtyla, became Pope John Paul II. In 1981, John Paul summoned Cardinal Ratzinger to Rome to take up one of the church's most important jobs: prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the defender of church orthodoxy. Cardinal Ratzinger assumed the post full time the next year.
With John Paul's blessing, the church embraced an orthodoxy that Cardinal Ratzinger largely defined. His office moved against dissenting theologians; spoke out against homosexuality, birth control and abortion; and questioned the validity of other faiths.
The central battle was over the liberation theology movement in Latin America. Many Catholic leaders and theologians there viewed Christ as the savior of the poor and the faith as an agent for a more just society. But the movement's Marxist leanings endeared it neither to John Paul, the Pole who opposed communism, nor to Cardinal Ratzinger, after his experience with student radicals in the 1960s.
Cardinal Ratzinger saw Christ's mission as offering not "merely earthly hope," he wrote, but also the salvation of souls.
He took up the theme again in 2007, as pope, in his book "Jesus of Nazareth," in which he showed little patience for the inequities of capitalism but nonetheless said that Christ had not been primarily a social reformer.
His office censured several leading proponents of liberation theology, and by the early 1990s the movement was considered defeated.
Scores of theologians and others came under formal criticism during Cardinal Ratzinger's time overseeing doctrinal affairs, among them the priests Charles E. Curran, Edward Schillebeeckx, Jacques Dupuis and Roger Haight. "The congregation's inquisitional procedures are indefensible," the Jesuit-run magazine America editorialized in 2001.
The congregation's delving into social issues provoked similar protests. In 1986, liberal critics objected to a document on pastoral care of homosexuals that discussed homosexuality as an inclination "toward an intrinsic moral evil" and as "an objective disorder."
Cardinal Ratzinger himself caused dissent by issuing a document in 2000 in which he posited that other faiths were "gravely deficient" in offering salvation and that Protestants were not members of "churches in the proper sense."
A fellow German cardinal, Walter Kasper, responding to the complaints of German Protestants, said: "If my friends are offended, then so am I. It's an unfortunate affirmation -- clumsy and ambiguous."
Cardinal Ratzinger's defenders said that he had never denied the possibility of salvation to members of other faiths -- and besides, they said, the document merely restated Catholicism's belief that it is the one true church.
Cardinal Ratzinger found approval on both the left and the right, however, when he sought to close the divide between Catholics and Jews over accusations that the church had remained silent, or at best passive, when Jews were deported and killed during World War II.
He went on to become the Vatican's point man in 2001 in the priesthood's mounting sexual abuse crisis. His office became flooded with case files from bishops seeking church trials for priests accused of pedophilia, and every Friday he would read a stack of them, a routine he called "our Friday penance," his associates said.
In one notable instance, Cardinal Ratzinger reopened a case against Marcial Maciel Degollado, a Mexican priest who had founded the conservative Legionaries of Christ and who had been accused by former seminarians of molesting them when they were 10 to 16 years old. In 2006, a year after Benedict became pope, Father Maciel was stripped of his public ministry. He died in 2008, and it was later alleged that he had had affairs with women and fathered children.
David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said of Cardinal Ratzinger's handling of the case, "That was, in fact, action, not words, so we want to give him credit where credit is due."
No Concessions to Secularism
In the days after John Paul's death, in April 2005, no cardinal had more stature in the Vatican than Cardinal Ratzinger, and as the dean of the College of Cardinals, he was at the center of the emotional transition to the election of a successor.
With three million or more pilgrims flooding Rome to pay tribute to John Paul, Cardinal Ratzinger presided over the funeral Mass, attended by kings, queens and some 70 heads of state, including President George W. Bush.
Even so, among the Vatican cognoscenti, there was no shortage of reasons that he could not become John Paul's successor: He was too old. He was divisive. He did not have John Paul's magnetism. He symbolized the church's European past, not its developing-world future.
After the funeral, the question among many in the church was how to harness what they called the spirit of John Paul. Should his successor reach out to a world that had grown distant from the church, or should he first look within the church to firm up its foundations?
Cardinal Ratzinger delivered his answer just before the papal conclave, the cardinals' closed meeting in the Sistine Chapel to select a new pope. In a speech that was said to have stunned many of those present, he asserted that a "dictatorship of relativism" had taken hold in the modern world, one that "recognizes nothing definite and leaves only one's own ego and one's own desires as the final measure."
An aide called it a "hold on to your hats" moment. Cardinal Ratzinger was putting his colleagues on notice that if they chose him he would make no concessions to the modern secular spirit.
Just over a day later, on April 19, 2005, in one of the shortest conclaves in modern history, puffs of white smoke rose from a chimney pipe in St. Peter's Square, signaling that a new pope had been elected. Within an hour, he appeared on its loggia before hundreds of thousands of onlookers and announced his name, Benedict XVI. The ready-made robes placed on him covered a decidedly unpapal black sweater -- one piece of evidence, a top Vatican official said, that he had not expected to be elected.
"Dear brothers and sisters," he said to the crowd, "after the great pope, John Paul II, the cardinals have elected me, a simple and humble worker in the vineyard of the Lord." Many cheered, chanting "Ben-ne-det-to!" Others stood in silence. The most polarizing of cardinals had become the 265th pope.
Not all cardinals were pleased. One referred to the "they" who had elected Cardinal Ratzinger; another skipped the cardinals' traditional dinner after the election. There was no question, however, that the cardinals had chosen one of the church's most commanding figures.
"For the second conclave in a row, the cardinals had picked the smartest man in the room," David Gibson wrote in his book "The Rule of Benedict" (2006). "They tried to find an alternative to Ratzinger, but they couldn't."
The symbolism in Benedict's choice of name was clear to many Vatican experts: Benedict of Norcia, a fifth-century monk, had founded monasteries that spread Christianity in Europe atop the embers of the Roman Empire. The new Benedict would seek to re-evangelize a Europe that had lost its faith.
Not only liberals were wary of the selection; Benedict's older brother, Georg, was, too. "I'm not very happy," he told reporters. "He's OK, and his health is good. I just wish for him that his health holds out and that his office isn't a worry and a nuisance to him."
Days earlier it had been reported, though never confirmed, that Benedict had been stricken by two small strokes. Georg suggested that his brother also had heart trouble. (The Rev. Georg Ratzinger died in 2020 at 96.)
Whatever the truth was, the bookish new pope plainly did not have the early vigor of John Paul II, a skier, swimmer and soccer player who had been elected at 58. Benedict, 78, announced that he would not travel as much as John Paul had.
There were hints that the new papacy would try to push the church toward still more conservative ground. The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest who edited the magazine America, was forced from his job because he had published articles critical of church positions. Benedict endorsed an ultimately successful campaign by the Italian clergy to kill a referendum that would have liberalized Italian laws on assisted fertility treatments.
Cardinal Christoph Schönborn of Vienna, a former student of Professor Ratzinger's, wrote an opinion article for The New York Times suggesting that belief in evolution might be incompatible with the Catholic faith. A Vatican directive not only condemned homosexual acts among Catholic seminarians; it also seemed to bar from the priesthood candidates who felt they were gay but who were nonetheless celibate. And the Vatican under Benedict set in motion two separate investigations of American nuns, effectively acting to rein in what was seen as disobedience.
For Benedict, the main concern was perhaps best summed up by the British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, whom Benedict often quoted: "Civilizations die from suicide, not by murder." Benedict saw the spread of secularism as a slow spiritual suicide, and he found his primary mission in trying to stop it. His solution was also borrowed from Toynbee: the notion of the "creative minority" -- small groups of nonconformists with the capacity to reinvigorate an entire culture.
Benedict's first trip as pope outside Italy, to Cologne, Germany, in August 2005, seemed an attempt to cultivate that creative minority. The event was World Youth Day, attended by hundreds of thousands of young Catholics. Instead of lecturing them about sex or morality, Benedict urged them to see that their lives would be enriched by faith rather than diminished by an ancient set of prohibitions.
"Open wide your hearts to God!" he said while floating on a boat down the Rhine, the banks lined with young people. "Let yourself be surprised by Christ!"
In January 2006, Benedict issued his first encyclical, "God Is Love," in which he endorsed love between man and woman, including erotic love, if within marriage and for the purpose of creating children. He conceded that Christianity had "often been criticized as having been opposed to the body; and it is quite true that tendencies of that sort have always existed."
Benedict began shedding his awkwardness in his second year as pope, when he would shush crowds cheering for him and even seemed to enjoy his public role at times.
He also began concentrating more on diplomacy, notably with China, which did not have relations with the Vatican or recognize papal authority over Chinese Catholics. There were small advances, but they were overwhelmed by resistance on both sides. The Chinese stepped up appointments of bishops without the Vatican's approval; in February 2006, Benedict angered the Chinese by elevating Bishop Joseph Zen Ze-kiun of Hong Kong, a fierce critic of the government, to the College of Cardinals.
Despite his criticism of Islam, Benedict disappointed some conservative followers in the early years of his papacy by calling for a viable Palestinian state and questioning military operations by Israel that killed civilians. In 2009, he met in Bethlehem with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, and visited the Aida refugee camp in the West Bank, where he said Palestinians longed to live "in a homeland of their own."
Benedict also tried to improve relations with the world's 220 million Orthodox Christians, opening private lines to the Russian Orthodox Church and meeting in Turkey in 2006 with Bartholomew I, the patriarch of Istanbul and spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide.
That was the year Benedict returned to Bavaria and, at his old university in Regensburg, delivered the speech in which he seemed to suggest that Islam was distant from reason and prone to violence. In the anger that followed, less attention was paid to the greater part of the speech, a distillation of Benedict's thought about reason and the West.
The West, he said, had defined reason as a thing apart from God and had therefore walled off God from everyday life. This was a mistake, he said, leaving the West incapable of talking to cultures -- Islam was implied -- for whom faith was fundamental.
Benedict struck similar chords in 2007 on a trip to Latin America. In Brazil, a once solidly Catholic country where evangelical Protestants had lured millions away from the church with promises of a more vibrant and relevant faith, he attacked communism and capitalism alike, asserting that both ideologies lacked a spiritual center.
His message was all but drowned out, however, by statements that forced the Vatican into the unaccustomed position of damage control.
In a news conference on the plane to Brazil, he had appeared to agree with a decision by Mexican bishops to excommunicate lawmakers who favored loosened restrictions on abortion. The Vatican was aware of the impact the statement could have on Catholic Mexican politicians who either favored or did not actively oppose abortion-rights laws, and it changed the official transcript of his comments. The pope, it said, was speaking generally about church doctrine, not specifically about Mexico.
Then, in comments in Aparecida, Brazil, he said there had been no forced conversions of Indigenous people in the early years of European colonization. Indian groups and others protested, and he later issued a clarification. "It is not possible to forget the sufferings and injustices inflicted by the colonizers on the Indigenous population," he said to Ash Wednesday pilgrims in St. Peter's Square.
In July 2007, Benedict moved ahead in relaxing rules governing the Latin Mass -- a concession to traditionalists, who had opposed the Vatican II decision allowing Mass to be said in vernacular languages. The pope was specifically reaching out to the Society of Saint Pius X, the ultraconservative group that John Paul had excommunicated in 1988.
Jewish groups were outraged because the Latin Mass included a prayer calling for the conversion of Jews. The Anti-Defamation League called it a "body blow to Catholic-Jewish relations." Many Catholics worried that Benedict was undermining Vatican II reforms. Benedict, in a letter, reaffirmed his support for Vatican II.
Against this backdrop, in April 2008, Benedict made his first trip to the United States, home to 65 million Catholics. Part of the trip's goal, said Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the papal nuncio to the United States, was to dispel the idea among Americans that Benedict was "this tough, this inhuman, person."
The pope aimed to address the sexual abuse scandal that had forced the resignation of Cardinal Bernard F. Law in Boston, the scandal's epicenter. He went far beyond expectations, apologizing several times and meeting with victims.
Greeted at the airport in New York by President Bush, the pope visited ground zero and said Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral and at Yankee Stadium for 60,000 people.
The glow from his American visit -- he also traveled to Washington -- faded in January 2009, when Benedict precipitated his papacy's deepest crisis by lifting the excommunications of four schismatic bishops, members of the Society of Saint Pius X. Among them was Bishop Williamson, who had not only denied the extent of the Holocaust but also contended that the United States had staged the Sept. 11 attacks as a pretext to invade Afghanistan.
The bishops' rehabilitation gave Jewish groups new cause for outrage, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany asked the pope to clarify his views on the Holocaust. Benedict's aide on Jewish affairs, the influential Cardinal Kasper, said that he had not been consulted on the decision.
Even supporters were at a loss. They gave Benedict the benefit of the doubt for sincerely wishing to avoid a schism, but many said that he had gone too far in appeasing a small number of hard-right rejectionists.
The bad publicity continued. In March, on his first trip to Africa, Benedict provoked new criticism when he said that condoms were not the answer to the continent's AIDS crisis. Public health advocates complained not only that he had repeated the church's long-held opposition to condom use, even as a way to fight the AIDS epidemic, but also that he had gone even further by saying that the distribution of condoms "aggravates" the problem.
That position, said Rebecca Hodes of the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa, revealed that "religious dogma is more important to him than the lives of Africans."
Benedict did not apologize. He suggested that he was comfortable in the knowledge that he had correctly interpreted the teachings of the church as its steward.
(A year and a half later he would revise his position -- and jolt conservatives -- by acknowledging that the need to prevent diseases like AIDS could outweigh the church's opposition to the use of condoms. He continued to assert, however, that there was no justification for using condoms to prevent pregnancy.)
A trip to Israel and Jordan in May 2009 gave Benedict no respite from his detractors. After speaking about the evils of the Holocaust at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, he was criticized in the Israeli press for not speaking personally as a German.
Father Reese, the Jesuit priest who had edited the magazine America, wrote, "The sad thing is that Pope Benedict is saying and doing many great things, but these media disasters are undermining his papacy."
"His words about peace, justice, refugees and the economic crisis are not being heard," Father Reese added.
In 2010, the sexual abuse scandals went global, surfacing across Europe as well as in Brazil, Chile and India. The police investigated; bishops resigned.
In the midst of it, a case that Benedict himself had mishandled years ago in Germany came to light.
In 1980, when he was archbishop of Munich, he had permitted a priest undergoing psychological treatment for abusing children to be transferred to another parish. The priest abused more victims there and was convicted in 1986. But when the story broke in 2010, it emerged that he had been allowed to return to the ministry and was still serving in a parish.
Defending Benedict, the Vatican said that his assistant in the archdiocese had been responsible. But archdiocese documents revealed that Benedict had led a meeting and was copied on a memo in which the priest's assignment was discussed.
Some Vatican officials cast the news media coverage as anti-Catholic persecution, but Benedict tried to respond pastorally. He met with abuse victims on a trip to Malta; in a letter, he apologized to victims and their families in Ireland for the "sinful and criminal acts" committed by priests; and on a trip to Portugal in 2010, he acknowledged the church's failings as the Vatican sought to toughen penalties against abusers.
Then, in the year before Benedict's resignation, an Italian investigative journalist published a book based on insider documents detailing infighting, corruption and a power struggle over the Vatican bank. The documents, it turned out, had been stolen and copied by the pope's butler. The man was sentenced to prison, but he was then pardoned by Benedict.
Benedict's last act as pope, resigning, was by most reckonings his most radical; it was something no pope had done since 1415, when Gregory XII stepped down amid a leadership crisis in the church known as the Western Schism.
There had been hints that he might take that step. In a book-length interview in 2010, Benedict had indicated that he might consider resigning if he no longer felt up to the job.
Benedict formally left the public eye on Feb. 28, 2013, when he was taken by helicopter to Castel Gandolfo. There he appeared at a window, a grandfatherly figure with snowy white hair, and wished the faithful good night, saying, "I am simply a pilgrim beginning the last leg of his pilgrimage on this earth."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The show starts in the foyer.
Guests are greeted there by women in dark red togas wearing gilded arm cuffs, looking like they just walked off the set of "Ben-Hur," the 1959 Hollywood epic about the Roman empire and chariot races. The women are here to take your coat, then hand you off to a colleague who appears to be dressed as an extra from the same movie, who will whisk you through the door and into the theater.
Strike that. It's a dining room, albeit one so eager to project theatrical opulence, and so crammed with color and lush fabrics, that it seems to belong on a stage.
This is Bacchanalia, a new restaurant in the ritziest corner of one of London's richest neighborhoods, and a place as gleefully out of step with the grim temper of this country as a clown car at a wake. You can either recoil at the cartoonish debauchery of it all, or surrender to this immersive production and snap some selfies, along with everyone else.
The latter option is a bit pricier. The lobster paccheri pasta, with black truffle and creamy bisque sauce, costs $ 162 and a cocktail called Freddo, made of Don Julio Blanco and Don Julio 1942 Tequila, cocoa butter, coffee and banana, is $ 31. Ready for dessert? The large portion of tiramisù will set you back $ 42, and its top tile of chocolate will be hand cracked for you by a waiter with a spoon.
Everything about the place feels like a dare. Rubberneckers are dared to tsk-tsk its celebration of high-end gluttony. Rival restaurateurs are dared to imagine a more outrageous concept. (Good luck!) Customers are dared to concentrate on their food, which is a challenge in a room bustling with waiters cosplaying right down to their sandals, and overstuffed with enough art to fill a few rooms in a museum.
This includes five huge and fantastical white sculptures by Damien Hirst, which soar overhead, one of them a flying unicorn carrying two naked lovers, preparing for airborne bliss, as well as a floor-to-ceiling work that reimagines Thomas Couture's 1847 painting, "The Romans in Their Decadence." It looks very much like the original except that a few of the louche and classically attired revelers are using laptops and mobile phones. The original was meant by Couture as a rebuke to the Romans, who look bored and exhausted by their orgy and whose empire is doomed.
So the updated image captures the restaurant's theme: Inspired by the civilization that invented excess, let's overdo it. Then post it to Instagram.
More than anything, Bacchanalia feels like a dare to everyone in Britain who is not dining at Bacchanalia.
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are enduring some well-publicized financial agonies: tax hikes, cuts to public spending, double-digit inflation, rising fuel costs, and what has been described as a "short and shallow recession," which threatens to become something worse. There have been strikes by ambulance drivers, border control staff members and transportation workers. Brexit has multiplied the supply chain woes that have afflicted countries across the world.
With U.K. deficits already swollen by years of Covid-related payouts, austerity is the only medicine that the Tory government says is left in the cabinet.
"There was a period when austerity is what happened to other people, but now everyone can see their gas and tax bills go up every month and it's terrifying," said Oliver Bullough, author of "Butler to the World: How Britain Became the Servant of Tycoons, Tax Dodgers, Kleptocrats and Criminals." "That restaurants like this are still opening despite the fact that people in the rest of the country are deciding whether to heat or eat is pretty bonkers, really."
By coincidence, the day that Bacchanalia opened, on Nov. 17, was also the day that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in a speech to Parliament nearly $ 30 billion of tax increases and $ 35 billion in spending cuts.
"Anyone who says there are easy answers is not being honest with the British people," he said.
The party a few hours later at Bacchanalia seemed to occur in an alternative universe. Guests in cocktail dresses and tuxedos mingled with the likes of Emma Thynn, the Marchioness of Bath, the fashion designer Harris Reed and the model Naomi Campbell. Performers in nymph costumes flanked the doorways, moving with the mannered slowness of living statues, while toga-clad waiters wearing laurels replenished flutes and served canapés. A performer dressed as a glittering Cupid prowled the mezzanine, slowly arching his bow at the crowd.
The Nero of this ersatz Rome is Richard Caring, the perpetually tanned, improbably taut and usually grinning Brit who is often described in the national press as a billionaire and who started his career importing cheap clothing from Hong Kong. Around 2005, he segued into the hospitality business and today owns an empire of mid- and high-priced restaurants here, many of them better known for buzz and snazzy décor than quality cuisine.
A few, like Bacchanalia, border Berkeley Square, a verdant patch of Mayfair abutted by luxury car dealerships (Ferrari, Bentley), social clubs and the London outpost of Blackstone, the private equity giant. It is the playground of oligarchs, petrogarchs and hedge funders. They can dine at Sexy Fish, a Caring creation where eating is "like being punched in the face by Dubai" as The Spectator put it. Across the square is Mr. Caring's most treasured bauble, a private members' club called Annabel's with six restaurants and an immense grizzly, made of twigs, standing in the forest-themed men's room, a visual pun on the old joke about where bears relieve themselves.
Mr. Caring would not comment for this article, nor would the publicity department of his company, Caprice Holdings, explain why he would not comment. This is surprising because he's typically very chatty with the media and months ago decided to lean into the unbridled hedonism of Bacchanalia. In the run up to its opening, the restaurant announced that it was looking for "London's first grape feeder," which was advertised in a full-page ad in The London Times. (Job requirements: "gorgeous hands" and a "basic grasp of Greek and Latin.") Hundreds applied for the job, and all were disappointed. The posting was a publicity stunt.
In early November, The Evening Standard, a free daily, asked in a roundup of new restaurants if Bacchanalia was "a toga too far in troubled economic times." Not to Marcella Martinelli, a stylist who was a guest at one of Bacchanalia's launch dinners.
"Obviously the cost of living crisis is important," she said. "But if you can afford this, it's an experience. As long as they get the pasta right -- that's all that matters."
Alec Gunn, the chief executive of a warehousing company, who was an early Bacchanalia diner, said he felt that such theme parks of overindulgence were important for the London scene, and that they were aspirational. "I've worked hard all my life," he said. "People deserve to have some fun."
Mr. Caring concurred in remarks that he made on opening night, before and after he mingled with attendees, while being trailed by a large man with an earpiece. He seemed acutely aware of the chasm between the festivities he'd orchestrated and the misery everywhere else.
"The last guy that made a speech in these sorts of surroundings started with 'friends, Romans and countrymen,"' he began, quoting Mark Antony from Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar." (By that point in the play, Caesar has been stabbed to death.)
He wanted a haven for conspicuous consumption, he went on, a place that offers escape for those who can afford it.
"Is it a toga too far?" he asked the crowd.
"No!" the crowd shouted back.
At a time when restaurants are scrabbling for waitstaff, part of a broader labor shortage, Bacchanalia one recent afternoon was crawling with employees. (Higher pay is the secret, one of them explained.) They are an efficient and helpful group, identifiable through an elaborate hierarchy of outfits and brooches that seems to echo the stratification of ancient Rome.
At the bottom are runners -- the men and women who deliver the food -- who dress in workaday togas, and jobs rise in status from there, segueing to chic western attire for those at or near the top. The assistant bar manager, for instance, wears a sports jacket of burgundy velvet; the bar manager wears the double breasted version of the same garment, which is incrementally fancier.
Like it or not, diners are automatically part of this caste system, updated versions of the sybarites depicted on the many murals. Given the fate of the Roman Empire, the role comes with a tricky edge. Though Mr. Bullough, the author, conceived an idea that might make customers even more uneasy.
"Next year I anticipate someone in Mayfair will open a replica of the first class deck of the Titanic, with prices to match," he said, "and then we'll know we're all doomed."
