Full text: From low alcohol to no-alcohol, Dry January is in full swing, and never have there been more choices for those who want to begin the year by abstaining from spirits.
Craving a spritz? There's a nonalcoholic aperitif for that. Missing your "Sunday Night Football" pint? Even stalwart brewers like Heineken offer 0 percent beers. Looking to shake, or stir, an elaborate mocktail? Nonalcoholic gin, tequila and whiskey are probably available at your local grocery -- or even liquor -- store.
The ever-widening array of no-spirit spirits reflects a booming multibillion industry. According to IWSR, a firm that tracks beverage alcohol trends, global retail sales of no- and low-alcohol products reached more than $ 13 billion in 2023. About 20 percent of the no-alcohol consumers last year were new to the category.
Ritual Zero Proof, an online alcohol-free spirits retailer, said on Wednesday that it was selling a bottle every 50 seconds, beating its rate from last January, when it sold a bottle a minute. Despite the company's strong sales, its co-founder, Marcus Sakey, said he was somewhat ambivalent about the annual tradition of avoiding alcohol during the first month of the year. He said the interest in his products was evidence of a broader cultural shift that transcends Dry January.
"When we first told people what we were making and selling, the first question was always, why?" Mr. Sakey said of the response to the company in 2019. "At the time, there was an idea that we were against drinking and we were trying to tell people how to live their lives." Now, as more people dabble in sobriety, or identify as "mindful" drinkers and "sober-curious," trading in a martini for a nonalcoholic tipple carries less stigma, he said.
By way of further evidence of how normalized it has become, a mocktail these days may cost almost as much as a regular cocktail. Nonalcoholic spirits can retail for $ 40 a bottle, and at some upscale bars in Manhattan, a zero-proof cocktail can cost $ 26 a glass.
"Given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, on how high interest rates and prices could lead to slowing sales of new vehicles.
"We are no longer selling this brand due to an unacceptable price increase."
Carrefour, a global retail giant, which put up posters in 3,440 supermarkets in France explaining why it was no longer selling PepsiCo products.
"The market has got a bit ahead of itself."
Cayla Seder, a macro strategist at State Street, cautioning that the big slowdown in inflation at the end of 2023 could still reverse course.

Full text: If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms -- in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war.
Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Blocking the Exits
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
'This Business Is Already Russian'
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
The Subcommission
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
Heineken, for About a Dollar
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Erwin Olaf, 64, Dies; Artist Who Let People Express Themselves: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With exquisite precision, he used costumes and sets in staging many of his pictures, letting his subjects, whatever their social status, express themselves.
Erwin Olaf, a contemporary Dutch photographer known for the precision of his staged photographs of both countercultural figures and Dutch royalty, died on Wednesday in Groningen, the Netherlands. He was 64.
Shirley den Hartog, his business partner, said the death, in a hospital, was caused by complications of a recent lung transplant. Mr. Olaf had struggled for years with hereditary emphysema, she said.
Mr. Olaf began his career as a photojournalist documenting the gay liberation movement in the 1980s before becoming one of the first photographers in the Netherlands to stage photos using theatrical costuming and sets. His subjects were often nonconforming to both gender stereotypes and cultural norms -- people with unusual bodies, alternative lifestyles or a penchant for bondage gear.
"He made explicit images or very suggestive images that became iconic," said Taco Dibbits, director of the Rijksmuseum, which owns and displays Mr. Olaf's work. The photographs, he added, "showed to a larger public how important it is to let people be who they are, and to let them express themselves."
Mr. Olaf's work evolved over 40 years to embrace high-end studio and fashion photography as well as formal portraiture. The Dutch royal family commissioned him to shoot their portraits several times.
He became recognized internationally as one of the Netherlands' three most important contemporary photographers -- along with Rineke Dijkstra and Anton Corbijn. To the Dutch he was seen as a national treasure.
"We consider him a 'Hollandse meester,"' a Dutch master, said Mattie Boom, photography curator at the Rijksmuseum, the national museum in Amsterdam. "He was making paintings with the camera."
Erwin Olaf Springveld was born on July 2, 1959, to Simon Jacobus Springveld, a sales manager for an office supplies company, and Lydia van 't Hoff, a homemaker, in Hilversum, about 20 miles west of Amsterdam. He graduated from the School for Journalism in Utrecht, intending to become a documentary photographer.
He moved to Amsterdam when he was 19 and lived in a squat, a building taken over by artists, while volunteering for the Dutch magazine Sek, the official publication of the gay and lesbian activist organization COC Nederland.
He got his first paid job as a photographer in 1984 chronicling Amsterdam nightlife and the gay community with his Nikon 35-millimeter camera for Vinyl, a new wave music magazine. He jettisoned his last name, Springveld, and went by Erwin Olaf thereafter.
"He started off being a major photographer of the gay scene, but that was too limited for Erwin," said Wim van Sinderen, his former editor at Vinyl who later became a curator of the Fotomuseum Den Haag, in The Hague, where he exhibited Mr. Olaf's work. "He was hot then, and he continued to be very hot for a long time. He managed to keep up his reputation throughout 40 years."
In 1983, Sek magazine assigned Mr. Olaf to shoot portraits of Hans van Manen, a leading Dutch choreographer who was also a photographer. The two men developed a close friendship that would last for decades.
Mr. van Manen broadened Mr. Olaf's artistic horizons, introducing him to artists such as the designer Benno Premsela and the art photographer Paul Blanca. "In those years, our relationship was like a master and a pupil," Mr. Olaf said of Mr. van Manen in a 2021 interview for a book of dance photographs the two produced together, "Dance in Close-Up."
The most important influence on Mr. Olaf's work was Robert Mapplethorpe, the paragon of studio photography, whom Mr. Olaf met while Mr. Mapplethorpe was visiting Amsterdam. He was especially taken with Mr. Mapplethorpe's use of square format images, a technique also employed by Peter Hujar and Diane Arbus for their portrait work.
Mr. Olaf soon bought a secondhand Hasselblad camera that, as Mr. van Manen said, made these "nice 6-by-6 neat format images, with no grittiness, very clear and very informative."
Other influences included the raw New York street photography of Weegee and the staged grotesque tableaus of Joel-Peter Witkin.
Not long afterward, Mr. Olaf found a small studio in another art squat, hung up a curtain and began to shoot his first staged photographs, using people in his immediate circle, such as disco queens and punks. He favored gender-bending costumes reflecting the queer, S&M and drag culture of his era. The Hasselblad gave a "classical touch to his very nonclassical imagery," Mr. van Sinderen said.
"We call it visual activism," Ms. den Hartog said. "Erwin always tried to express his anger and his criticisms of society through his work."
Ms. Boom, of the Rijksmuseum, said that staged photography was atypical of the era, especially in the Netherlands, where documentary photography was in vogue.
Mr. Olaf achieved international attention for the first time in 1988, when he won the Young European Photographer of the Year award for his series "Chessmen," black-and-white images of humans transformed into baroque chess pieces. An exhibition for "Chessmen" followed at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, his first major solo exhibition.
In the mid-1990s, Mr. Olaf switched to digital photography, producing a number of photographic series. During that time he also established a career as a commercial photographer, making ads for fashion brands like Diesel and Bottega Veneta and the companies Heineken and Nokia.
Mr. Olaf's main work was always portraiture, even if his subjects were positioned in elaborate sets and wearing fantastical costumes. The Dutch author Arthur Japin, whom Mr. Olaf photographed as a lion, said sitting for him could feel liberating.
"When you were with him you were aware that he saw absolutely everything about you, but that he did not judge," Mr. Japin said. "That's why people opened up to him. Some people would really go far when they were photographed by him."
Mr. van Sinderen said that in the early 2000s Mr. Olaf's noncommercial photography took on "a kind of uber-kitch made possible by Photoshop," but that he changed direction after an American museum curator criticized his work as "Eurotrash."
He began to explore the works of Norman Rockwell and contemporary painters, especially Lucien Freud, as well as the cinematic realism of the Italian filmmaker Luchino Visconti, whom he admired for the "incredible sadness" of his movies, Ms. den Hartog said.
Ultimately, Mr. Olaf became known for a kind of exquisite stillness and perfectionist polish, traits that were highlighted in a double exhibition in The Hague on the occasion of his 60th birthday in 2019.
That same year, the Rijksmuseum exhibited a dozen of his works in conversation with an equal number of Golden Age master paintings by Rembrandt, Gerard ter Borch and others. They were selected from more than 500 photographs of Mr. Olaf's that the Rijksmuseum acquired the previous year.
Over the years Mr. Olaf made friends from a broad range of social circles, including that of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, who in a statement said they mourned the loss of a "quirky, exceptionally talented photographer and a great artist."
Mr. Olaf is survived by his husband, Kevin Edwards, whom he married in 2016, and his two brothers, Jos and Ron Springveld.
Mr. Olaf was hopeful that his lung transplant last month would add years to his life, said Ms. Boom. "We talked quite recently, during the summer, and he was full of plans," she said. "After the operation, he though he would continue for another 10 years, and he had lots of ideas."

For One Euro, Heineken Keeps Promise to Sell Russian Assets: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of Western companies announced they would quit operating in Russia. But actually selling their assets and withdrawing has taken time.
For the price of a single euro, Heineken has sold its operations in Russia, completing an exit the giant Dutch brewer first announced within weeks of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.
Heineken said Friday it had sold its seven breweries and other assets in Russia to Arnest Group, a packaging and consumer goods business based in Stavropol, Russia. The deal will result in a loss of €300 million (about $ 325 million), Heineken said, adding that Arnest will take responsibility for Heineken's 1,800 employees in Russia, guaranteeing their jobs for three years.
"While it took much longer than we had hoped, this transaction secures the livelihoods of our employees and allows us to exit the country in a responsible manner," Dolf van den Brink, Heineken's chief executive, said in a statement.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, hundreds of Western companies announced they would quit operating in Russia, but actually selling their assets and withdrawing has taken time.
Under new rules put in place by the Kremlin after the imposition of Western sanctions over the invasion, foreign companies in Russia can sell their assets only with approval from Russia's finance ministry, which can take six to 12 months. Businesses in certain sectors, including oil and banking, also need a sign-off from President Vladimir V. Putin. And some companies have delayed their withdrawal until a suitable employer is found for their workers.
Critics say the delays suggest an unwillingness to leave, and Heineken faced a boycott after news media reports said that its Russian subsidiary kept selling Amstel beer last year.
On Friday, the brewer said that the Heineken brand was removed from Russia last year, and that production of Amstel would "be phased out within six months." It said that the sale of its operations would have a negligible effect on the group's earnings, and that its full-year forecast for earnings in 2023 was unchanged.
For Arnest, it was at least the second time it has picked up the Russian subsidiary of a Western company. In September, Arnest acquired the Russian operations of Ball Corporation, the Colorado-based manufacturer of containers. The deal included three plants producing aluminum cans for beer and soft drinks in Moscow, Leningrad and the Chelyabinsk regions, Arnest said. In that case, Arnest paid $ 530 million.

Last Call for a Sardi's Veteran: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 1968, Sardi's was still enjoying its decades-long heyday, commanding the limelight as Broadway's foremost hub of show folk, from big shots to wannabes to poignant has-beens. Playwrights, agents, publicists and newspaper columnists vied for strategic tables in the restaurant's dining room, trading artful glances, gossip, poisoned barbs and air kisses. Elated tourists, always an ingredient of the Sardi's experience, basked in the presence of Groucho Marx or Liza Minnelli entering to applause, a Sardi's tradition.
That was the year a young Croatian immigrant, Josip Petrsoric, whose English wasn't so great, arrived to far less fanfare. Soon he was making drinks for all of them.
This week, Mr. Petrsoric, Sardi's avuncular bartender known to all as Joe, is ending his nightly performance of stirring, shaking and pouring after 55 years. He is ready to do last call for good, retiring on Friday.
As unlikely as it seemed in the moment, Sardi's, at 234 West 44th Street since 1927, instantly felt like home to him. "Hair"; "Promises, Promises"; James Earl Jones in "The Great White Hope"; and Marlene Dietrich, in a one-woman show, were the toasts of Broadway, and he was excited to be at the center of the heat. Joe's brother Mike had emigrated to America earlier and got work as a Sardi's chef, which eased Joe's way through the door.
At 23, Joe became a bar boy, lugging cases of liquor, and was soon promoted to be a service bartender, which meant filling drink orders for the mostly Italian-speaking waiters. He worked off the main stage, not directly interacting with customers like Jackie Gleason, Lauren Bacall, Sammy Davis Jr., Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Raquel Welch and Henry Fonda. In those days, Mr. Petrsoric said he would make 2,000 drinks a day, an almost unbelievable number: 150 Bloody Marys, 150 bullshots and innumerable martinis -- "Gin martini-gin martini-gin martini," he said, buzzing the words in speed-talk. "I was like a machine."
Vincent Sardi Jr., the proprietor at the time, took notice, and in 1972 summoned him to his office. Mr. Petrsoric recalled his boss demanding, "Joe, I want you to go behind the bar."
"I was scared," Joe said. "I said, 'Mr. Sardi, no, I don't know enough language. I can't talk to customers."'
Mr. Sardi prevailed. And so, Mr. Petrsoric has been a fixture behind the upstairs bar ever since, other than for a couple of hiccups, like the temporary shutdown of the restaurant in 1990 after a bankruptcy and the roughly 22 months Sardi's was dark during the Covid pandemic. As Broadway began ramping up again, for Joe it's been a blur of gin martini-vodka martini-dirty martini-espresso martini-manhattan-cosmo-gimlet, whatever people want these days.
Earlier this year, Mr. Petrsoric, 78, was working alone around 10 p.m. when 60 or so people filed in after Broadway shows let out. He found himself going back into machine mode, a calm beacon of cocktail efficiency. Matthew Broderick happened to be sitting at the bar, watching with admiration. He expressed his amazement, which Mr. Petrsoric subtly acknowledged, with a hand placed gently to his heart. While he appreciated the accolade, he gives the same polite treatment to the star-struck as to stars like Mr. Broderick, as well as cast members, directors, producers, lyricists and composers from nearby productions.
When a younger bartender recounted to Joe the list of celebrities who flooded the Sardi's premiere party for Wes Anderson's latest film, "Asteroid City" -- Margot Robbie, Greta Gerwig, Scarlett Johansson, Colin Jost, Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman -- Mr. Petrsoric simply shrugged.
"I'm not that crazy about celebrities," he said. "To me, everybody is human, not gods." Many years ago, watching Lucille Ball in the restaurant, her storied career over, taught him something about fame. "She hated to be old," he said. "She was not happy. It's got to be very difficult when you're that popular. It goes to your brain, and then you see it's not forever and you've got to come down to earth."
Trying to squeeze stories from Mr. Petrsoric while he is on duty rarely bears fruit. He is as watchful as an owl, swiveling his head, his brown eyes alert to any movement, someone signaling for a check or another round. He perks up at familiar faces.
"You don't know the names, but you know what everybody drinks," Mr. Petrsoric said, citing dozens of regulars from around the world and their drink orders. He readily recalled what the restaurant's founder, Vincent Sardi Sr., preferred ("Every morning an espresso with a side of Courvoisier, and he lived to be 83") as well as Mr. Sardi Jr., who liked "two Rob Roys, and he died at 91."
To have a fuller conversation with Mr. Petrsoric required catching him in between shifts. For once, he was sitting at a table, not on his feet, dressed in a crisp tuxedo shirt, black bow tie, maroon jacket and black pants, his white hair neatly combed back. Hundreds of framed caricatures of patrons of the past rose up around him, helping to jog his memory.
Not to pick favorites, but the actor he liked waiting on the most, he admitted, was Jack Lemmon. "He was a down-to-earth person," Mr. Petrsoric said. "He would come in every time he was in New York. James Gandolfini, Vanessa Williams, they were good. Paul Newman was very quiet, drank Heineken. His wife" -- Joanne Woodward -- "would come with him, and every time he went to the bathroom, she would wait for him at the door, I don't know why. Elizabeth Taylor was human. One time she came from the bathroom and a guy had just thrown up -- she didn't know him -- and she got the waiters over to help him out."
One of Ms. Taylor's husbands, Richard Burton, was another regular. "Richard Burton, oh, my God," said Mr. Petrsoric. "Three, four, five martinis. Not when he was working, on his day off. He was quiet, kept to himself."
People don't drink like that anymore, at least in public, Mr. Petrsoric observed. He doesn't have much of a thirst himself except for the occasional glass of chardonnay.
Back in 1968, martinis cost $ 1 or $ 1.25, he said, expressing embarrassment that today Sardi's charges almost $ 20. He exudes pride in his expertise, never daring to shake a gin martini, for instance, which he learned as soon as he took the job. "Are you crazy?" he exclaimed. "They'd kill you. People taught me here years ago how to stir. It took me three weeks to learn. It's very difficult to do it right."
There is not much call for pink squirrels, grasshoppers or brandy Alexanders anymore, recipes he can easily recite. He has always loved making cocktails, any kind of cocktail, he said, but did not like to get people drunk.
Throwing drunks out of the bar was anathema to him. "You say nicely, 'Time to go,' and they go," Mr. Petrsoric said. "One time we got a guy who was carrying two guns. I saw he was nuts and said, 'We're having a private party,' and he said, 'OK, I'll go.' I don't want to hurt anyone. I worry about the person. I've had to take a lot of people home when they got drunk." By which he meant back to their hotel, usually near Times Square. "Not lately," he added. "We get good people here, absolutely."
Since news about Mr. Petrsoric's retirement got out, regulars have been crowding in, some of them tearful, to get Mr. Petrsoric to pour them one more for the road. He is leaving the place in good shape but taking his institutional knowledge with him.
"He has been here a lifetime and seen it all, from the ground up," said Max Klimavicius, Sardi's managing partner, who started working his own way up the ladder in 1974. "Look at how youthful he is. He still has a lot of pep, always smiling."
"Come on, it's time to go," Mr. Petrsoric said, discounting the fact that other Sardi's employees of the past had stayed even longer. "I hope I live a long life but why work? The house is paid."
"The house" is where he was born in 1945, an olive-tree-shaded villa on Krk, Croatia, an island in the northern Adriatic Sea. His father and paternal grandfather lived to be 98, and his older brothers are 96, 89 and 80, so a longer life might well be in the cards. The deaths last year of two close friends unsettled him, though, tugging him toward home permanently, not just for a summer vacation. Divorced long ago, he has two grown sons and now three grandchildren; his 62-year-old American fiancée will be going with him.
Mr. Petrsoric couldn't think of a thing to complain about, not his health, his feet, his back nor the salary and tips that sustained his largely unsung career.
"I'm happy, but I'm very sad," Mr. Petrsoric said. "I know so many people I'm never going to see again. I want to say thank you, and I'll miss you, like a friend, like family. This job was made for me. If I'm born again, I will come right back here."

NEW YORK — In 1968, Sardi’s was still enjoying its decadeslong heyday, commanding the limelight as Broadway’s foremost hub of show folk, from big shots to wannabes to poignant has-beens. Playwrights, agents, publicists and newspaper columnists vied for strategic tables in the restaurant’s dining room, trading artful glances, gossip, poisoned barbs and air kisses. Elated tourists, always an ingredient of the Sardi’s experience, basked in the presence of Groucho Marx or Liza Minnelli entering to applause, a Sardi’s tradition.
That was the year a young Croatian immigrant, Josip Petrsoric, whose English wasn’t so great, arrived to far less fanfare. Soon he was making drinks for all of them.
This past week, Petrsoric, Sardi’s avuncular bartender known to all as Joe, was ending his nightly performance of stirring, shaking and pouring after 55 years. He was ready to do last call for good, retiring on Friday.
As unlikely as it seemed in the moment, Sardi’s, at 234 W. 44th St. since 1927, instantly felt like home to him. “Hair”; “Promises, Promises”; James Earl Jones in “The Great White Hope”; and Marlene Dietrich, in a one-woman show, were the toasts of Broadway, and he was excited to be at the center of the heat. Joe’s brother Mike had emigrated to America earlier and got work as a Sardi’s chef, which eased Joe’s way through the door.
At 23, Joe became a bar boy, lugging cases of liquor, and was soon promoted to be a service bartender, which meant filling drink orders for the mostly Italian-speaking waiters. He worked off the main stage, not directly interacting with customers like Jackie Gleason, Lauren Bacall, Sammy Davis Jr., Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Raquel Welch and Henry Fonda. In those days, Petrsoric said he would make 2,000 drinks a day, an almost unbelievable number: 150 Bloody Marys, 150 bullshots and innumerable martinis — “Gin martini-gin martini-gin martini,” he said, buzzing the words in speed-talk. “I was like a machine.”
Vincent Sardi Jr., the proprietor at the time, took notice, and in 1972 summoned him to his office. Petrsoric recalled his boss demanding, “Joe, I want you to go behind the bar.”
“I was scared,” Joe said. “I said, ‘Mr. Sardi, no, I don’t know enough language. I can’t talk to customers.’”
Sardi prevailed. And so, Petrsoric has been a fixture behind the upstairs bar ever since, other than for a couple of hiccups, like the temporary shutdown of the restaurant in 1990 after a bankruptcy and the roughly 22 months Sardi’s was dark during the COVID pandemic. As Broadway began ramping up again, for Joe it’s been a blur of gin martini-vodka martini-dirty martini-espresso martini-manhattan-cosmo-gimlet, whatever people want these days.
Earlier this year, Petrsoric, 78, was working alone around 10 p.m. when 60 or so people filed in after Broadway shows let out. He found himself going back into machine mode, a calm beacon of cocktail efficiency. Matthew Broderick happened to be sitting at the bar, watching with admiration. He expressed his amazement, which Petrsoric subtly acknowledged, with a hand placed gently to his heart. While he appreciated the accolade, he gives the same polite treatment to the star-struck as to stars like Broderick, as well as cast members, directors, producers, lyricists and composers from nearby productions.
When a younger bartender recounted to Joe the list of celebrities who flooded the Sardi’s premiere party for Wes Anderson’s latest film, “Asteroid City” — Margot Robbie, Greta Gerwig, Scarlett Johansson, Colin Jost, Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman — Petrsoric simply shrugged.
“I’m not that crazy about celebrities,” he said. “To me, everybody is human, not gods.” Many years ago, watching Lucille Ball in the restaurant, her storied career over, taught him something about fame. “She hated to be old,” he said. “She was not happy. It’s got to be very difficult when you’re that popular. It goes to your brain, and then you see it’s not forever and you’ve got to come down to earth.”
Trying to squeeze stories from Petrsoric while he is on duty rarely bears fruit. He is as watchful as an owl, swiveling his head, his brown eyes alert to any movement, someone signaling for a check or another round. He perks up at familiar faces.
“You don’t know the names, but you know what everybody drinks,” Petrsoric said, citing dozens of regulars from around the world and their drink orders. He readily recalled what the restaurant’s founder, Vincent Sardi Sr., preferred (“Every morning an espresso with a side of Courvoisier, and he lived to be 83”) as well as Sardi Jr., who liked “two Rob Roys, and he died at 91.”
To have a fuller conversation with Petrsoric required catching him between shifts. For once, he was sitting at a table, not on his feet, dressed in a crisp tuxedo shirt, black bow tie, maroon jacket and black pants, his white hair neatly combed back. Hundreds of framed caricatures of patrons of the past rose up around him, helping to jog his memory.
Not to pick favorites, but the actor he liked waiting on the most, he admitted, was Jack Lemmon. “He was a down-to-earth person,” Petrsoric said. “He would come in every time he was in New York. James Gandolfini, Vanessa Williams, they were good. Paul Newman was very quiet, drank Heineken. His wife” — Joanne Woodward — “would come with him, and every time he went to the bathroom, she would wait for him at the door, I don’t know why. Elizabeth Taylor was human. One time she came from the bathroom and a guy had just thrown up — she didn’t know him — and she got the waiters over to help him out.”
One of Taylor’s husbands, Richard Burton, was another regular. “Richard Burton, oh, my God,” said Petrsoric. “Three, four, five martinis. Not when he was working, on his day off. He was quiet, kept to himself.”
People don’t drink like that anymore, at least in public, Petrsoric observed. He doesn’t have much of a thirst himself except for the occasional glass of chardonnay.
Back in 1968, martinis cost $1 or $1.25, he said, expressing embarrassment that today Sardi’s charges almost $20. He exudes pride in his expertise, never daring to shake a gin martini, for instance, which he learned as soon as he took the job. “Are you crazy?” he exclaimed. “They’d kill you.

Heineken Cuts Forecast
Amid Global Sales Slump
Heineken, the world's second-largest brewer, cut its 2023 profit growth forecast on Monday after an economic slowdown in Vietnam and price increases squeezed sales volumes, depressing first-half earnings more than expected.
Shares in the Dutch brewer, whose brands include Tiger and Sol, fell as much as 6.7 percent to their lowest level since January.
Brewers profited late last year from drinkers' willingness to pay higher prices, but inflation has since taken its toll.
While some shoppers have sought out cheaper alternatives to branded food and white goods, beer drinkers have remained largely loyal to established brands but consumed less.
For Heineken, the average price of its beers was 12.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
In the first half, Heineken sold 5.6 percent less beer, with declines in all regions. Over half of the drop was in Vietnam and Nigeria, with price increases also having an impact. REUTERS

Lamborghini May Sell
10,000 Cars, C.E.O. Says
Lamborghini could sell 10,000 cars this year for the first time, its chief executive said on Monday as the automaker reported a rise in profit and revenues for the first half of the year.
The Italian luxury sports car brand, a subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen, sold 5,341 cars between January and June, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier. The United States was its largest market, with 1,625 deliveries. Lamborghini's revenue grew 6.7 percent to 1.42 billion euros ( $ 1.56 billion), and its operating income rose 7.2 percent to a record €456 million, the company said.
Lamborghini's chief executive, Stephan Winkelmann, said it was not easy to make forecasts because of market uncertainties, including with raw materials, but added that selling 10,000 cars this year was a "feasible goal."
Supported by the success of its Urus sport utility vehicle, which costs around 200,000 euros before taxes, Lamborghini has in recent years expanded its output, relying on solid demand from wealthy car lovers. REUTERS

New Board for Pirelli,
Diluting Chinese Influence
Pirelli investors approved a new board on Monday, giving the tire maker a new three-year governance framework after the Italian government took steps last month to curb the influence of the company's leading Chinese investor.
Andrea Casaluci, previously the general manager operations, has been promoted to chief executive, Pirelli said in a statement. He succeeds Marco Tronchetti Provera.
Mr. Tronchetti Provera, whose Camfin vehicle is Pirelli's second-largest shareholder, retains a strong voice in the new 15-member board in the role of executive vice chairman. Pirelli's new chairman is Jiao Jian, the chief executive of the leading shareholder Sinochem, the state-owned Chinese group.
The Italian government used "golden power" legislation that protects key national assets to impose prescriptions on the proposed renewal of a governance pact between Sinochem and Camfin. REUTERS

Republicans Block Investing Rule
Senate Republicans, joined by two Democrats, voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution -- already passed by the House -- to block a Labor Department rule that would allow retirement plan managers to incorporate environmental, social and corporate governance considerations into their investment decisions. This practice, known as E.S.G., was a widely accepted norm in financial circles for almost 20 years until it recently became a target for conservatives and others who argued E.S.G. investing was hurting businesses and little more than a trend they termed "woke capitalism." The rule from the Labor Department had been intended to overturn a Trump-era policy that limited investing options to purely financial matters. The Biden administration argued that it was necessary to allow retirement advisers to factor in issues like climate change, which has economic consequences. President Biden is expected to use the first veto of his presidency to override the anti-E.S.G. measure.
Justices Weigh Student Loan Cancellation
The Supreme Court heard arguments last week in a case that would decide the fate of some 26 million student loan borrowers who applied to have their debts canceled under President Biden's forgiveness plan. The issue at hand is not whether it is constitutional to wipe out billions in student debt, but whether Mr. Biden has the authority to do so without Congress' approval. Mr. Biden introduced the policy by executive order in August, announcing that the federal government would cancel up to $ 20,000 per borrower. After meeting a flurry of legal challenges, Mr. Biden's plan was blocked from going into effect in November by a lower court. During arguments last week, conservative justices on the Supreme Court -- who have a majority -- appeared skeptical of the Biden administration's power to carry out sweeping debt cancellation, while the court's liberal members said there was a precedent for the secretary of education to address emergencies like the student debt crisis.
Some Companies Are Still in Russia. Here's Why.
A year into the war in Ukraine, hundreds of Western companies remain in Russia despite a vast array of sanctions as well as pressure from boycott campaigns and human rights groups. Some of these companies began scaling back their operations in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion but have yet to complete a full exit of the country. Pfizer, for example, stopped investing in Russia but still sells some products there and sends the profits to Ukraine humanitarian groups. Carlsberg, the world's third-largest brewer, said it was leaving Russia last March but was still trying to find a buyer for its Russian breweries that would agree to allow the company to buy them back after the war ends. Companies have encountered other hurdles to leaving Russia, including, the beer maker Heineken said, warnings from Russian prosecutors that closing or suspending operations would be deemed an intentional bankruptcy.
What's Next? (March 5-11)
The Next Jobs Report? Who Knows?
After the jobs report for January blew past the consensus forecast -- employers added 517,000, an increase from 260,000 the month before -- it is difficult to say with certainty what February's report will show on Friday. Analysts expected to see that the economy added 215,000 jobs last month, which would be in line with the general downward trend of jobs reports up until January. But those surprising numbers suggested that it might not be a smooth, or predictable, descent for the job market. That's a growing concern for officials at the Federal Reserve, who are looking for signs that their efforts to tame inflation are filtering through the entire economy.
Behind the Scenes at Fox News
As Fox News headed toward a trial with Dominion Voting Systems, the company accusing Fox of defamation in a $ 1.6 billion suit, Rupert Murdoch, Fox's chairman, acknowledged that several hosts for his networks promoted the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald J. Trump. "I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight," Mr. Murdoch said in a deposition that was released last week. He added that he could have stopped these hosts, including Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo, but didn't. There has been a steady trickle of revelations like these over the past two weeks, including legal filings with private messages between Fox News hosts that showed that what they were saying publicly often contrasted with their private views. But news coverage of the filings has largely been absent from a vast majority of conservative outlets. Fox News and its sister outlet, Fox Business, have so far avoided the story, too.
Powell Testifies to Congress
Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The Fed chair reports to Congress twice a year to discuss how the central bank is responding to economic conditions and the overall economic outlook. He will also take questions from lawmakers. When Mr. Powell last met with the committee in June, he emphasized the Fed's commitment to bringing down inflation to its 2 percent target, which had become increasingly difficult, he said. A recession, he added, was a "possibility." At this week's hearing, Mr. Powell is likely to address the strong jobs numbers and the persistent pace of inflation. But he will probably avoid saying anything too definitive, as there is one more jobs report and fresh inflation data set to be released before the Fed's next rate decision later this month.
What Else?
Some lawmakers in Congress fear developments in artificial intelligence are far outpacing their ability to regulate the technology. The Biden administration unveiled rules on Tuesday for its "Chips for America" program, which would allot $ 50 billion to shore up semiconductor research and manufacturing in the United States. And a coal mining strike that lasted almost two years ended without a deal on Friday; negotiations over a contract are expected to continue once the miners return to work.

Full text: Not all Western companies packed up and left Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Some say Moscow has tied their hands, while others choose to stay put.
When Russia invaded Ukraine, a phalanx of Western companies pledged to get out fast from what had once been an important market. McDonald's dismantled its golden arches after 32 years. The oil giant BP moved to divest its mammoth Russian investments. The French automaker Renault sold its factories for the symbolic sum of one ruble.
But a year into the war, hundreds of Western businesses are still in Russia, including blue-chip and midsize companies from Europe and the United States. They are doing business despite Western sanctions and boisterous boycott campaigns pressed by Ukrainian officials, consumers and human rights groups.
Some companies, facing accusations that they are helping finance Russia's aggression, say they are staying because their customers need them. Among them is Auchan, one of France's largest supermarket chains, which has kept its 230 stores in Russia open and says it intends to stay. The retailer has drawn the ire of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and recently faced fresh calls for a boycott after a report that Auchan's Russian subsidiary supplied donated food to the country's military.
Auchan has denied those allegations, but is unapologetic about remaining in Russia and Ukraine, where it also has stores, to "meet the essential food needs of the civilian populations."
Other companies have scaled back their Russia operations, or their exits, announced last spring, have stalled.
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has stopped investing in Russia but continues to sell a limited range of products, with the profits sent to Ukraine humanitarian groups. Carlsberg, the world's third-largest brewer, is trying to find a buyer for its Russian breweries that would offer buyback clauses to allow the company to return when the war ended.
For many companies, extraction from Russia has been trickier than expected. Moscow has tied their hands, they say, by brandishing the threat of nationalization and other obstacles. Western corporate chiefs frequently say they have a responsibility to shareholders to find buyers that provide some value for billions in assets, rather than surrender them to Moscow. Such concerns prompted the tobacco giant Philip Morris to say last month that it might never sell its Russian business, despite efforts to do so.
Others do not want to risk surrendering market share to companies from China, Turkey, India or Latin America, whose governments are not part of the sanctions regime, and are eyeing properties and equity stakes left by departing Western firms.
"Russia was a big market for many companies," said Olivier Attias, a lawyer at August Debouzy, a law firm in Paris that advises major French companies with operations in Russia. "Taking the decision to get out was hard, and the process for leaving has been difficult."
Data compiled by Yale showed that of nearly 1,600 companies in Russia before the war, more than a quarter had continued to operate fully there, with some only postponing planned investments. In a survey of twice as many firms, by the Kyiv School of Economics, that proportion was closer to 50 percent.
But another study suggests how few have fully cut ties, finding that below 9 percent of about 1,400 companies from Europe, the United States, Japan, Britain and Canada had divested a Russian subsidiary since the war. Those that did accounted for a small share of the Western business footprint, which the report said called into question the willingness of Western firms to leave.
Despite their saber-rattling, the Russian authorities are concerned about limiting the economic hit from sanctions and preserving hundreds of thousands of jobs, and would prefer not to see Western investors exit, said Dimitri Lavrov, a senior partner at Nexlaw, a Geneva law firm that counsels multinationals in Russia.
A draft bill circulating in the Russian Duma would allow foreign investors "to preserve both their assets and the actual presence of their business in the country, and the possibility to return to Russia in case of forced withdrawal," Mr. Lavrov added.
Auchan offers a window onto the complications that Western companies say they face. Since the war, the privately held company, which is part of a European retail empire owned by France's Mulliez family, has insisted that keeping its stores open in Russia was necessary to provide food to its civilian customers and maintain employment for 29,000 workers.
Auchan said it had halted investments to Russia immediately after the war, leaving the Russian subsidiary a separate, self-sustaining entity. Closing the business, which generated 3.2 billion euros ( $ 3.4 billion) in sales in 2021, or 10 percent of Auchan's revenue, would have been considered a bankruptcy by Russian officials, the company said, leading to a potential prosecution of local managers and the seizure of hundreds of supermarkets in which it had invested more than 20 years.
That has not assuaged Ukraine officials, who say Auchan and other companies help fund Russia's war by continuing to operate there. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, recently accused Auchan on Twitter of having "evolved into a full-fledged weapon of Russian aggression," after an investigation by the French daily Le Monde revealed that some Auchan employees in Russia collected donated goods that were then sent to Russian troops fighting Ukraine.
Auchan said that it had conducted an internal investigation and that the characterization of the findings was misleading. The company said its presence in Russia was not helping to perpetuate the invasion.
"Our business is to feed the population and to be close to the population," said Antoine Pernod, a spokesman. "Because one day, peace will arrive, and it will be important to still be at their side."
Companies that have pledged to leave say shifting Russian rules have made it difficult.
On the heels of Western sanctions, Russia tightened nationalization rules to include insolvency as a trigger. Foreign companies can sell assets only with approval from Russia's Finance Ministry, which can take six to 12 months. Corporations from "strategic" sectors, including oil and banking, need a sign-off from President Vladimir V. Putin.
Heineken said such hurdles had delayed its efforts to divest. Shortly after announcing last March that it would stop selling Heineken beer in Russia, the company said, it "received official warnings from Russian prosecutors" that a decision to suspend or close its Russian subsidiary would be deemed an intentional bankruptcy -- a criminal offense that could result in nationalization.
The brewer, which faces a boycott after media reports that its Russian subsidiary kept selling Amstel beer and introduced more than 60 new products last year, said its Russia employees were compelled to maintain sales to avert insolvency and "the very real threat" of nationalization. Heineken said it expected a financial loss of around €300 million from its eventual Russia exit.
The explanations have riled critics, who have depicted Heineken beer cans as bullets on Twitter and labeled the company "a proud supporter of Russian genocide."
BP made headlines three days after Russia's invasion by pledging to pull out of its nearly 20 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil company, a decision resulting in a $ 24 billion charge on its books. But a year later, the company has yet to give up its shares. It blamed a "drawn out process," constrained by international sanctions and the Russian government, which has effective approval rights on any buyer.
Other companies are trying to leave the door open for a return. Carlsberg is aiming to sell its Russian operations by mid-2023. But the brewer's chief executive, Cees 't Hart, said Carlsberg was seeking a buyback clause that would give it the opportunity to repurchase the Russian assets at a later date.
For Renault, the sale of its factories last summer to a Russian state entity included a crucial clause allowing the automaker to review a return to its state-of-the-art assembly lines in six years. The company said it would take a €2.2 billion financial hit for leaving Russia.
In the meantime, the new Russian owner is cranking out Russian cars -- made mostly with parts imported from China.

On Tap in Super Bowl Ads: More Than Just Budweiser: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For the first time in decades, Anheuser-Busch won't be the only alcohol brand running national ads during the game.
Clydesdale horses. Spuds MacKenzie. Wassssuuuuuuup?!
Beer ads are practically as characteristic of the Super Bowl as touchdowns. And they will be again this year, with one big change: They won't all come from brands owned by Anheuser-Busch.
After three decades as the only alcohol brand to air its commercials nationally during the game, the parent company of Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob Ultra gave up that exclusivity in June.
Cue the competitors -- and a flood of beer and alcohol ads in Sunday's national broadcast.
"It took us less than a minute to decide," said Michelle St. Jacques, the chief marketing officer of Molson Coors, the parent company of brands including Coors Light and Miller Lite. "We were like, 'Game on."'
Jonnie Cahill, the chief marketing officer at Heineken, which will feature its alcohol-free Heineken 0.0 in a commercial on Sunday, said: "As a C.M.O., when that announcement was made, of course your eyes open up and you think, What if?" He added, "We're delighted to be able to access the Super Bowl."
Crown Royal and Rémy Martin will also run national Super Bowl commercials for the first time on Sunday. But Anheuser-Busch will still be the game's largest advertising spender, with four ads: three minutes of national time and 30 seconds of regional time.
The Super Bowl remains the most important event on the advertising calendar in the United States. In the two weeks surrounding the game last year, more than $ 1.6 billion was spent on beer, hard cider and malt beverages, and more than 60 million cases of those drinks were sold, according to Nielsen IQ.
Some advertisers paid Fox, which is broadcasting the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs, more than $ 7 million for a 30-second spot. Several forecasts predict that more than 110 million people will watch this year's game.
Some brands, however, are pulling back on their marketing budgets in response to an uncertain economy. Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, said that "the enthusiasm to spend $ 7 million for 30 seconds waned a little bit" toward the end of 2022, but that the ad slots sold out by late January.
Viewers can expect to see, in addition to booze ads, spots from major food brands like Doritos, Avocados From Mexico, M&M's and Planters, as well as a smattering of ads for car companies and tech firms. Notably, cryptocurrency companies will be absent, after they were so prominent during last year's game that many observers called it the "Crypto Bowl." The industry crashed in the months that followed.
Brands will be marketing their products on other screens, especially phones. Many plan interactive rollouts as well, seeking to engage viewers on TikTok and sports-betting apps around the game.
But the main focus remains on the television ads.

Anheuser-Busch gave up its exclusive rights as part of a "rebalancing" of investments, said Alissa Heinerscheid, the vice president of marketing for Bud Light.
Bud Light's commercial will feature the actor Miles Teller (an Eagles fan) and his wife, the influencer Keleigh Teller. In the spot, the couple drink out of cans of Bud Light and dance as they wait on hold. The energy is "lighter and brighter" this year, Ms. Heinerscheid said.
Though other alcohol brands have long been shut out of national Super Bowl ad spots, they have often found ways to reach consumers during the game. Rémy Cointreau, Rémy Martin's parent company, has run regional ads for its spirits in the past. Molson Coors has promoted a number of digital efforts to engage viewers around the Super Bowl. (One campaign invited viewers to type out a very long URL to burn a single calorie.)
But the companies say they are glad to be able to participate in an official capacity this year.
"Even though we've been locked out for the past 30 years, we've kind of hacked our way into the conversation," Ms. St. Jacques of Molson Coors said.
Her company's campaign, which will highlight Coors Light and Miller Light, started weeks ago and invited viewers to bet on what will happen in its Super Bowl ad -- like the type of dog that will appear behind a counter and how many characters will have facial hair -- and enter a pool on DraftKings, the sports-betting app, which is running its own Super Bowl commercial. People who guess correctly will split $ 500,000 in prize money. Molson Coors has promoted its challenge on social media, in teaser ads during other football games and in a paid media campaign.
The content of the final ad has been kept under tight wraps, Ms. St. Jacques said. Even the company's chief executive, she said in an interview last month, will find out what happens in the commercial when the rest of the world does.
"Everyone has been waiting 30 years, so a couple more weeks will be fine," she said.

Your Memories. Their Cloud.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: I have many fears as a mother. My kindergarten-age daughter recently learned a game on the school bus called "Truth or Force." My youngest refuses to eat almost anything but Kraft Mac and Cheese. Added to the list this year, alongside outside influences and health concerns, is the possibility that my daughters could inadvertently lock me out of my digital life.
That's what happened to a mother in Colorado whose 9-year-old son used her old smartphone to stream himself naked on YouTube, and a father in San Francisco whose Google account was disabled and deleted because he took naked photos of his toddler for the doctor.
I reported on their experiences for The New York Times, and as I talked to these parents, who were stunned and bereft at the loss of their emails, photos, videos, contacts and important documents spanning decades, I realized I was similarly at risk.
I am "cloud-complacent," keeping my most important digital information not on a hard drive at home but in the huge digital basement provided via technology companies' servers. Google gives all users 15 gigabytes free, a quarter of what comes standard on an Android phone, and I have not managed to max it out in 18 years of using the company's many services.
I did fill up Apple's free 5 GB, so I now pay $ 9.99 a month for additional iCloud storage space. Meta has no max; like scrolling on Instagram, the allowed space is infinite.
If I were suddenly cut off from any of these services, the data loss would be professionally and personally devastating.
As a child of the 1980s, I used to have physical constraints on how many photos, journals, VHS tapes and notes passed in seventh grade that I could reasonably keep. But the immense expanse and relatively cheap rent of the so-called cloud has made me a data hoarder. Heading into 2023, I set out to excavate everything I was storing on every service, and find somewhere to save it that I had control over. As I grappled with all the gigabytes, my concern morphed from losing it all to figuring out what was actually worth saving.
Data Harvesting
I find nearly 100 photos from one November night 15 years ago, out with my family at a Tampa Bay Lightning game when my sisters and I were home for the holidays. We're tailgating with a mini-keg of Heineken. My dad is posing by the car, making a funny face at the ridiculousness of a parking garage party. Then, we're posing in the stadium with the hockey rink in the background, toasting with a stranger we sat next to. Had we bonded with him during an especially close third period? The metadata in the Google Photos jpg file didn't say.
The photos transported me back to a tremendously fun evening that I had all but forgotten. Yet I wondered how there could be so many photos from just one night. How do I decide which to keep and which to get rid of?
This kind of data explosion is a result of economics, said Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library based in San Francisco that saves copies of websites and digitizes books and television shows. Taking a photo used to be expensive because it involved film that needed to be developed.
"It cost a dollar every time you hit a shutter," Mr. Kahle said. "That's no longer the case so we hit the shutter all the time and keep way, way too much."
I had captured the 2007 evening in Tampa pre-smartphone on a digital Canon camera that had a relatively small memory card that I regularly emptied into Google Photos. I found more than 4,000 other photos there, along with 10 gigabytes of data from Blogger, Gmail, Google Chat and Google Search, when I requested a copy of the data in my account using a Google tool called Takeout.
I just pressed a button and a couple of days later got my data in a three-file chunk, which was great, though some of it, including all my emails, was not human-readable. Instead, it came in a form that needed to be uploaded to another service or Google account.
According to a company spokesman, 50 million people a year use Takeout to download their data from 80 different Google products, with 400 billion files exported in 2021. These people may have had plans to move to a different service, simply wanted their own copy or were preserving what they had on Google before deleting it from the company's servers.
Takeout was created in 2011 by a group of Google engineers who called themselves the Data Liberation Front. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google employee in Chicago who led the team, said he thought it was important that the company's users have an easy "off ramp" to leave Google and take their data elsewhere. But Mr. Fitzpatrick said he worried that when people store their digital belongings on a company's server, they "don't think about it or care about it."
Some of my data landlords were more accommodating than others. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram offered Takeout-like tools, while Apple had a more complicated data transfer process that involved voluminous instructions and a USB cable.
The amount of data I eventually pulled down was staggering, including more than 30,000 photos, 2,000 videos, 22,000 tweets, 57,000 emails, 15,000 pages of old Google chats and 16,000 pages of Google searches going back to 2011.
It was such an overwhelming amount of digital stuff that I wasn't surprised to see that Google had hired Marie Kondo as a spokeswoman for the paid version of its storage service -- starting at $ 1.99 per month for 100 GB. Ms. Kondo suggested better labeling and organization of emails, photos and documents to make it "easy to find the memories that spark joy."
The Missing
The trove of data brought forgotten episodes of my life back in vivid color. A blurry photo of my best friend's husband with a tiny baby strapped to his chest, standing in front of a wall-sized Beetlejuician face, made me recall a long-ago outing to a Tim Burton exhibit at a museum in Los Angeles. I don't remember what I learned about the gothic filmmaker, but I do remember my friends' horror when their weeks-old son, now 11, had a blowout and they had to beg a comically oversized diaper from a stranger.
The granularity of what was in my digital archive accentuated the parts of my life that were missing entirely: emails from college in a university-provided account that I hadn't thought to migrate; photos and videos I took on an Android phone that I backed up to an external hard drive that has since disappeared; and stories I'd written in journalism school for publications that no longer exist. They were as lost to me as the confessional journal I once left in the seatback of a plane. The idea that information, once digitized, will stick around forever is flawed.
"We often say the internet never forgets, but it does," said the web historian Ian Milligan. Companies shut down, as happened to GeoCities, an early, popular place for hosting personal websites, or a service cuts back on the amount of free storage it's offering, as when the new owner of Flickr announced in 2019 that free accounts had a limit of 1,000 photos and anything more would be deleted.
Margot Note, an archivist, said her profession thinks a lot about the accessibility of the medium on which data is stored, given the challenge of recovering videos from older formats such as DVDs, VHS tapes and reel film. Ms. Note asks the kinds of questions most of us don't: Will there be the right software or hardware to open all our digital files many years from now? With something called "bit rot" -- the degradation of a digital file over time -- the files may not be in good shape.
Individuals and institutions think that when they digitize material it will be safe, she said. "But digital files can be more fragile than physical ones."
Where to Put It
Once I assembled my data Frankenstein, I had to decide where to put it. More than a decade ago, pre-cloud complacency, I would regularly back my stuff up to a hard drive that I probably bought at Best Buy. Digital self-storage has gotten more complex as I discovered when I visited the DataHoarder subreddit. Posts there with technical advice for the best home setup were jargon-filled to the point of incomprehension for a newbie. A sample post: "Started with single bay Synology Nas and recently built a 16TB unRAID server on a xeon 1230. Very happy with result."
I felt as if I'd landed on an alien planet so I turned instead to professional archivists and tech-savvy friends. They recommended two $ 299 12-terabyte hard drives, one of which should have ample room for what I have now and what I will create in the future, and another to mirror the first, as well as a $ 249 NAS, or network-attached storage system, to connect to my home router, so I could access the files remotely and monitor the health of the drives.
Archivists regularly cited the "3-2-1 rule": three copies of everything, two copies on different cloud services and one at home. Some also said to keep yet another copy "offsite," i.e. at a relative's house or in a bank lockbox, depending on your level of paranoia. History is awash in tales of lost data, including the burning of invaluable master recordings of famous musicians in a Universal Studios fire. John Markoff, a technology journalist who writes for The Times, mined the extensive personal archives of the internet pioneer Stewart Brand for a biography. He found that even Mr. Brand, who meticulously preserved his communications, was missing several years of early emails because of the loss of back-up tapes and had hundreds of thousands of others on an old Macintosh that were a jumble of data that was largely impossible to read.
Getting all your data and figuring out how to securely store it is cumbersome, complicated and costly. There's a reason most people ignore all their stuff in the cloud.
What to Keep
I noticed a philosophical divide among the archivists I spoke with. Digital archivists were committed to keeping everything with the mentality that you never know what you might want one day, while professional archivists who worked with family and institutional collections said it was important to pare down to make an archive manageable for people who look at it in the future.
"It's often very surprising what turns out to matter," said Jeff Ubois, who is in the first camp and has organized conferences dedicated to personal archiving.
He brought up a historical example. During World War II, the British war office asked people who had taken coastal vacations to send in their postcards and photographs, an intelligence-gathering exercise to map the coastline that led to the selection of Normandy as the best place to land troops.
Mr. Ubois said it's hard to predict the future uses of what we save. Am I socking this away just for me, to reflect on my life as I age? Is it for my descendants? Is it for an artificial intelligence that will act as a memory prosthetic when I'm 90? And if so, does that A.I. really need to remember that I Googled "starbucks ice cream calorie count" one morning in January 2011?
Pre-internet, we pared down our collections to make them manageable. But now, we have metadata and advanced search techniques to sort through our lives: timestamps, geotags, object recognition. When I recently lost a close relative, I used the facial recognition feature in Apple Photos to unearth photos of him I'd forgotten I'd taken. I was glad to have them, but should I keep all the photos, even the unflattering ones?
Bob Clark, the director of archives at the Rockefeller Archive Center, said that the general rule of thumb in his profession is that less than 5 percent of the material in a collection is worth saving. He faulted the technology companies for offering too much storage space, eliminating the need for deliberating over what we keep.
"They've made it so easy that they have turned us into unintentional data hoarders," he said.
The companies try, occasionally, to play the role of memory miner, surfacing moments that they think should be meaningful, probably aiming to increase my engagement with their platform or inspire brand loyalty. But their algorithmic archivists inadvertently highlight the value of human curation.
Recently, my iPhone served me "Waterfalls over the years," which, as promised, featured a slide show with instrumental music and photos of myself and others in front of a random assortment of waterfalls. Like the British war office during World War II, the technology saw the backdrop as the star of the show.
"I don't think we can simply rely on the algorithms to help you decide what's important or not," Mr. Clark said. "There need to be points of human intervention and judgment involved."
Paring It Down
Rather than just keeping a full digital copy of everything, I decided to take the archivists' advice and pare it down somewhat, a process the professionals call appraisal. An easy place to start was the screenshots: the QR codes for flights long ago boarded, privacy agreements I had to click to use an app, emails that were best forwarded to my husband via text and a message from Words With Friends that "nutjob" was not an acceptable word.
There were some clear keepers, a selfie I took in Beijing with the artist Ai Weiwei in April 2015; a video of my eldest daughter's first steps in December 2017; and a shot of me on a camel in front of the Giza Pyramids in 2007, a photo I had purposely staged to recreate one we had on my childhood fridge of my great-grandmother in the same place doing the same thing, but with a disgruntled expression on her face.
Then there's the stuff I'm ambivalent about, like the many photos with long-ago exes, which for now I'll continue to hoard given that I'm still on good terms with them and I'm not going to fill up 12 terabytes any time soon.
There was also a lot of "data exhaust," as the security technologist Matt Mitchell calls it, a polite term for the record of my life rendered in Google searches, from a 2011 query for karaoke bars in Washington, D.C., to a more recent search for the closest Chuck E. Cheese. I will not keep those on my personal hard drive, and I may take the step of deleting them from Google's servers, which the company makes possible, because their embarrassment potential is higher than their archival value. Mr. Mitchell said super hoarders should pare down, not to make memories easier to find, but to eliminate data that could come back to bite them.
"You need to let go because you can't get hacked if there's nothing to hack," said Mr. Mitchell, the founder of CryptoHarlem, a cybersecurity education nonprofit. "It's only when you're storing too much that you run into the worst of these problems."
Inactive Accounts
Right now, it's cheap to hoard all this data in the cloud.
"The cost of storage long term continues to fall," said George Blood, who runs a business outside Philadelphia digitizing information from obsolete media, creating 10 terabytes of data per day, on average. "They may charge you more for the cost of the electricity -- spinning the disk your data is on -- than the storage itself."
Big technology companies don't often prompt people to minimize their data footprints, until, that is, they near the end of their free storage space. That's when companies force them to decide whether to move to the paid plans. There are signs, though, that the companies don't want to hold onto our data forever: Most have policies allowing them to delete accounts that are inactive for a year or more.
Aware of the potential value of data left behind by those who euphemistically go "inactive," Apple recently introduced a legacy contact feature, to designate a person who can access an Apple account after the owner's death. Google has long had a similar tool, prosaically called inactive account manager. Facebook created legacy contacts in 2015 to look after accounts that have been memorialized.
And that really is the ultimate question around personal archives: What becomes of them after we die? By keeping so much, more than we want to sort through, which is almost certainly more than anyone else wants to sort through on our behalf, we may leave behind less than previous generations because our accounts will go inactive and be deleted. Our personal clouds may grow so vast that no one will ever go through them, and all the bits and bytes could end up just blowing away.
