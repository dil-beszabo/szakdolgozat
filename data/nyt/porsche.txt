Full text: Federal prosecutors said they planned to charge a businessman who has close ties to New York's Turkish community with conspiracy to commit fraud.
One of the businessmen whom the indictment of Mayor Eric Adams described as having made illegal donations to Mr. Adams's 2021 campaign was expected to face a criminal charge and wishes to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Monday.
The prosecutors have filed a notice of intent to charge the businessman, Erden Arkan, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to the illegal contributions, the filing said.
Nothing in the filing indicated that Mr. Arkan has been cooperating with the prosecutors in their case against Mr. Adams, who was charged with bribery, fraud and conspiring with Turkish officials to receive illegal foreign campaign donations. And there was some question of whether foreign money was involved in any of the actions Mr. Arkan is accused of taking, which may limit his ability to aid in the prosecution of Mr. Adams, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York unveiled the five-count indictment against Mr. Adams in late September, making him the first sitting mayor in the modern history of New York City to face criminal charges.
Mr. Arkan's lawyer, Jonathan Rosen, with the Potomac Law Group based in Washington, D.C., declined to comment.
Although prosecutors have not indicated that Mr. Arkan is cooperating with the government, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Adams, nonetheless said that he would be of little benefit in the case against Mr. Adams.
"We know from the government's own interviews that Mr. Arkan repeatedly said that Mayor Adams had no knowledge of his actions," Mr. Spiro said in a statement. "Mr. Arkan's conduct will have no bearing on the mayor's case whatsoever."
Identified as "Businessman-5" in the indictment of the mayor, Mr. Arkan and others listened in April 2021 as Mr. Adams explained New York City's generous matching-funds program -- which rewards candidates who receive small-dollar donations by making them eligible to collect large sums of public money for their campaigns -- and, a month later, held a fund-raiser for Mr. Adams, prosecutors said.
Mr. Arkan, who has close ties to New York's Turkish community and owns a construction firm called KSK Construction, gave $ 1,250 apiece to 10 of his employees to donate to Mr. Adams's campaign, prosecutors said.
While recruiting contributors, Mr. Arkan wrote to them, in part, that this "may feel like swimming against the current, but unfortunately this is how things work in this country," prosecutors said in the indictment.
A day before the scheduled fund-raiser, a Turkish official sent Mr. Arkan at least one check, and he later sent a message saying that the "checks that reached us are 17,000."
In total, the fund-raising event put on by Mr. Arkan raised more than $ 69,000 from 84 donors. The campaign then used those donations to seek an additional $ 63,760 in matching funds, the indictment said.
If prosecutors move forward, Mr. Arkan will be only the second person to be charged with aiding Mr. Adams in a campaign fund-raising scheme. In October, a former City Hall aide was charged with tampering with witnesses in the federal corruption investigation into Mr. Adams. The aide, Mohamed Bahi, has since begun talking with prosecutors about a potential guilty plea, suggesting he may help the government in their case against the mayor, court papers show.
It is not unusual for prosecutors to offer leniency to potential witnesses against the targets of investigations.
Last week, in a memo to the court, prosecutors said that they had a strong case against the mayor that included "multiple witnesses who will expressly implicate the defendant in criminal conduct." They added that the witness accounts were backed up by "electronic communications and other data obtained from over 50 cellphones and other electronic devices and accounts."
Mr. Adams has said that he plans to run for re-election in 2025 even as a dozen members of his inner circle -- two successive police commissioners, his schools chancellor, deputy mayor for public safety and others -- have been ensnared in federal corruption investigations this year.
Last week, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, Mr. Adams's former chief adviser and longtime friend, was charged in state court in a bribery scheme involving $ 100,000 for a new Porsche for her son.

Full text: Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who resigned as the mayor's chief adviser, was charged in a bribery scheme involving $ 100,000 for a new Porsche for her son.
Manhattan prosecutors on Thursday charged the former chief adviser to Mayor Eric Adams and her son with taking $ 100,000 in bribes from two businessmen in exchange for intervening with city regulators on the businessmen's behalf.
The adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, and her 38-year-old son received the payments in checks, which her son cashed and used to buy a Porsche, the prosecutors said.
Ms. Lewis-Martin, her son, Glenn Martin II, and the businessmen were charged in a four-count indictment with participating in "a long-running bribery, money-laundering and conspiracy scheme." The indictment accuses Ms. Lewis-Martin of using her official position to "illegally influence Department of Buildings and other city decisions" in exchange for the cash and other benefits for her and her son.
The businessmen, Mayank Dwivedi and Raizada Vaid, were seeking help with pushing construction projects through the city's Buildings Department, where they had met with delays, the indictment said.
"From the moment Lewis-Martin became the second most senior person in City Hall, she abused her position and sold her influence to enrich herself and her family," prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said in a narrative of the accusations that accompanied the indictment.
A lawyer for Ms. Lewis-Martin, Arthur L. Aidala, said in a statement before she and her co-defendants were arraigned that the prosecutors' "interpretation of the facts will make no sense to any New York jury."
"To think that a high-ranking city official would take a bribe in the form of a check deposited into a bank account defies common sense," he said. "We look forward to the citizens of the City of New York, who Ingrid has served so admirably for decades, clearing her name after a trial."
Prosecutors also accused Ms. Lewis-Martin and her son of agreeing to take financial support from the two businessmen for a clothing line and a Chick-fil-A franchise in exchange for her using her city position to assist with their projects.
Investigators used wiretaps to monitor one or more of the defendants' phones, and prosecutors in laying out the charges quoted from telephone conversations involving Ms. Lewis-Martin, her son and others. The indictment of Ms. Lewis-Martin represents another blow to Mr. Adams, who faces trial in April on federal corruption charges that made him the first sitting mayor in modern New York City history to be criminally charged. He has denied all the charges.
Mr. Adams, who has said he plans to run for re-election in 2025, has seen a dozen members of his inner circle -- two successive police commissioners, his schools chancellor, deputy mayor for public safety and others -- ensnared in federal corruption investigations this year.
All have resigned. But none of them has been closer to the mayor than Ms. Lewis-Martin, who over the years has acted as an enforcer -- and who in the past has intervened with city agencies on behalf of people with business before the city.
The businessmen charged alongside her were pursing construction projects that included work on a rooftop bar, the Glass Ceiling, and a hotel, both in Manhattan, and they had asked her to help move the projects through the city's tangled bureaucracy.
After Mr. Dwivedi and Mr. Vaid paid Mr. Martin $ 100,000 in August 2023, he deposited the money into a joint account he shared with Ms. Lewis-Martin, prosecutors said. Each businessman made a $ 50,000 payment to Mr. Martin; one had the words "personal loan" written in the check memo, according to prosecutors, who called that an attempt to conceal a bribe and said that the defendants had not provided any evidence that loan payments were ever made.
A lawyer for Mr. Vaid, Jonathan S. Sack, called his client "a successful New York City real estate developer and self-made businessman," adding: "He will be entering a plea of not guilty and intends to fight the charges vigorously."
A lawyer for Mr. Dwivedi, Teny R. Geragos, said that her client "did nothing wrong," adding: "We look forward to setting the record straight
A lawyer for Mr. Martin, Michael V. Cibella, said his client denied the charges.
"It's a sad day for justice when the district attorney is spinning and twisting facts to allege a conspiracy -- as they're doing here -- a conspiracy of government corruption, money laundering and bribery," he said.
Prosecutors, in their narrative, included as an exhibit a picture of Mr. Martin in sunglasses, grinning in front of a gleaming black 2023 Porsche Panamera, a big red bow affixed to the hood. He paid $ 113,000 for the car, "something neither he nor Lewis-Martin could have funded without the bribe money," the prosecutors wrote.
The indictment was unsealed Thursday and announced at a news conference by Mr. Bragg and the city Department of Investigation commissioner, Jocelyn Strauber.
Ms. Lewis-Martin, Mr. Martin, Mr. Dwivedi and Mr. Vaid surrendered early Thursday and were arraigned later in the day. All four pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors said Ms. Lewis-Martin used her son as an intermediary in an attempt to cover up her actions. Mr. Martin, a professional D.J. who uses the name "Suave Luciano," has worked at city events overseen by Mr. Adams's administrations, both when Mr. Adams was Brooklyn borough president and since he has been mayor.
Mr. Martin's name had been stored in Mr. Vaid's phone as "Glen Eric Adam," and his mother's number was saved as "Ingrid Martin Eric Adams," which prosecutors cited as proof that connections to city government underpinned the relationships.
The indictment cites a series of fast-paced communications in November and December 2022 relating to Ms. Lewis-Martin's intervention on approvals the businessmen needed for their Manhattan projects, the hotel at 107 Rivington Street and the rooftop bar at 1204 Broadway.
On Nov. 16, Mr. Dwivedi texted Mr. Vaid suggesting that an application for the Rivington Street project had been rejected, adding, "Ingrid Madam is needed," the indictment said.
After Mr. Vaid exchanged messages with Ms. Lewis-Martin, including via the encrypted messaging app Signal, she contacted officials at the city Buildings Department seeking to move the men's applications forward.
On Dec. 8, 2022, Ms. Lewis-Martin met with Mr. Vaid, who goes by the nickname "Pinky," and texted the acting buildings commissioner during the meeting to expedite approval of the Glass Ceiling project, prosecutors said.
After the meeting, the indictment says, Ms. Lewis-Martin texted her son: "Pinky has you completely covered. You[r] fashion line is 100 percent. Call him later." It was not clear whether any fashion line ever materialized.
Later that day, Mr. Vaid again sent Ms. Lewis-Martin his request to expedite the rooftop bar application, which she forwarded to the acting commissioner; it was approved the same day, the indictment says.
Aside from accusing her of using her son as an intermediary, prosecutors laid out other ways they said Ms. Lewis-Martin tried to keep her actions secret.
When Mr. Vaid asked her in a WhatsApp message for help expediting a visa application for a relative, she told him to send "an official email" to her City Hall account, according to communications cited by prosecutors. She later reported back that she contacted the office of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York on his behalf, prosecutors said.
During the same period she was using Signal to field requests from Mr. Vaid and forward them to city buildings officials, Ms. Lewis-Martin set her Signal messages to disappear after an hour, prosecutors said.
In January 2023, after Mr. Vaid texted her saying, "I need this favor" because the Rivington Street project was "stuck," she wrote back: "Please only use Signal for asks," they said. Ms. Lewis-Martin is accused of then instructing him to use coded language in a regular text to alert her when he had messaged her there. "Next time just text me 'trying to reach you['] and I will Look for it," she wrote, according to prosecutors' narrative.
Later that year, according to prosecutors, Mr. Martin became an intermediary for the businessmen to make additional requests of his mother. And Mr. Martin sought Mr. Vaid's backing in opening the Chick-fil-A franchise.
In June of this year, Ms. Lewis-Martin spoke on the phone to a real-estate agent who was helping Mr. Martin and Mr. Vaid find space for the restaurant, according to prosecutors, who quoted from the call in court papers. The agent said she was waiting for Mr. Martin to return some paperwork.
"As soon as it gets back to us, we're going to get him a space and then we'll move forward," the agent said, according to a court filing.
"I'm not playing, your sister has to be rich!" Ms. Lewis-Martin responded, referring to herself. "I'm going to retire."

Volkswagen Reaches Labor Deal, Avoiding Plant Closures: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker agreed to keep all 10 of its factories in Germany open and to guarantee workers' jobs until the end of 2030.
Volkswagen, Germany's largest automaker, reached an agreement with its union on Friday, ending a three-month standoff that had rattled the country and brought to light the extent of German industrial decline.
Under the deal, hammered out during more than 70 hours of talks at a hotel in the western city of Hanover, the company agreed to keep all 10 of its factories in Germany open and to guarantee workers' jobs until the end of 2030. But during that time, the company will carry out a restructuring plan that will include the loss of more than 35,000 jobs through retirement and attrition.
In exchange, the union, IG Metall, which represents most of Volkswagen's workers, withdrew its demand for a wage increase until 2031 and agreed to cuts in bonuses and reductions in production of hundreds of thousands of cars across several plants.
"No site will be closed, no one will be made redundant, and our company wage agreement will be secured for the long term," Daniela Cavallo, the head of the works council at Volkswagen, said in a statement announcing the agreement.
At stake was not just wages but Volkswagen's plans to solve the problem of too many workers and too few orders, amid slumping demand in Europe and abroad and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.
Volkswagen's woes have mirrored Germany's economic malaise. Officials in the country have forecast that the economy will contract in 2024, for the second consecutive year. Economists do not expect to see a significant return to growth in 2025.
The extended wage dispute had strained the 87-year-old automaker's strong ties with its roughly 120,000 workers in Germany, who said management had betrayed the social pact of the country's traditional collective bargaining system, where the welfare of the company and its employees are given equal weight.
Some 100,000 IG Metall members staged brief walkouts in December. The union had threatened to start longer strikes starting in January if an agreement had not been reached.
That pressure, combined with Volkswagen's plunging share price, which has fallen by more than a third over the past 12 months, was enough to force the company to back down from its threats to close as many as three plants. Volkswagen had also initially sought a 10 percent wage cut.
"With the package of measures achieved, the company has set a decisive course for its future in terms of costs, capacities and structures," Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.
For its part, the union retreated from its demand of a 7 percent wage increase and offered a compromise instead: the creation of a communal fund equivalent to a 5 percent wage increase for each worker over the next five years. The fund can be drawn from to compensate those employees whose hours are reduced or who are forced into early retirement through the restructuring.
Volkswagen said the deal would save more than 4 billion euros, or roughly $ 4.2 billion, annually in the coming years. It would also reduce its production capacity by 734,000 cars over the coming five years, allowing the company to invest in new products that it hopes will restore its ability to compete.
"I think it sends a good signal to the work force and creates confidence that the employees are valued," said Beatrix C. Keim, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, adding that it was good for Germany's auto industry because many suppliers and their employees depend on Volkswagen's success.
The agreement was a sorely needed positive end to a difficult year, coming days after Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, setting off new elections in February that are shaping up to focus largely on how to jump-start the country's stagnant economy.
High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt exports, while political paralysis under Mr. Scholz's government exacerbated the situation.
The threat of further protectionism from the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump in the United States has economists worried that the coming year could be more challenging, even if a new German government is able to quickly enact some badly needed reforms.
Volkswagen is struggling against falling demand in Europe and China, the world's largest car market, and is burdened by high costs for labor and electricity, especially in Germany. In October, the company reported that profit fell to €2.86 billion, or $ 3.1 billion, for the months from August to September, its lowest level in three years.
On Friday, Volkswagen's top shareholder, Porsche, said it might have to write down the value of its 31.9 percent stake in the company by as much as €20 billion, or $ 21 billion, creating extra pressure on Volkswagen's management to reach an agreement that included cost cuts.

NEW YORK — Ingrid Lewis-Martin, former chief adviser to New York Mayor Eric Adams, is expected to surrender Thursday on bribery charges involving two businesspeople who gave her son a $100,000 loan to buy a Porsche, several people with knowledge of the matter said.
Her son, Glenn Martin II, and the other two men were also expected to surrender Thursday for arraignment on the charges, which are being brought by the Manhattan district attorney, the people said.
The charges accuse the businesspeople of providing the loan to Lewis-Martin’s son after she helped them resolve an issue with the city’s Department of Buildings in connection with a construction project in one of their hotels, the people said. It is unclear if Martin has made payments on the 2023 loan, which was memorialized in a promissory note, one of the people said.
The accusations grew out of a broad corruption investigation focused on Lewis-Martin, who announced her resignation Sunday — hours before The New York Times reported that a grand jury was hearing evidence against her.
Lewis-Martin, 63, was one of roughly a dozen members of Adams’ inner circle who have been ensnared in federal or state corruption investigations in recent months, inquiries that have led to the searches of homes, the seizures of phones and the resignations of some of the most powerful officials in City Hall.
When she surrenders, she will be the highest-profile city official to face charges since Adams himself was indicted on federal corruption charges in late September — the first sitting mayor in the modern history of New York City to face criminal charges.
Her arraignment is expected to occur during a week marked by several significant legal and political setbacks for the mayor, who is facing trial in April on federal bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and campaign finance charges and has said he will still run for reelection in 2025.
Adams has repeatedly maintained his innocence and has said that the charges against him are politically motivated.
On Sunday, Lewis-Martin abruptly announced her resignation. On Monday, the city’s campaign finance board denied Adams as much as $4.3 million in public funding for his mayoral campaign. On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a motion by Adams’ attorneys to dismiss a bribery charge against him and a request from the defense to move up the mayor’s trial date.
The district attorney’s investigation into Lewis-Martin appears to be ongoing, and there has been no indication that the inquiry has focused on Adams.
Lewis-Martin’s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, declined to comment Wednesday. In a statement Sunday, he said, “The only thing of which we are certain is that Ingrid Lewis-Martin has served this city admirably for decades in an ethical, moral and law abiding manner.”
A lawyer for Martin did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for one of the businesspeople, Mayank Dwivedi, a hotelier with properties in New York City and the Hamptons, said in a statement that Dwivedi had engaged in no wrongdoing.
The district attorney “has an incomplete and inaccurate view of the facts,” said the lawyer, Teny Geragos. “We look forward to setting the record straight and proving Dwivedi’s complete innocence.”
Jonathan S. Sack, a lawyer for the other businessperson, declined to comment.
Spokespeople for the office of District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the city’s Department of Investigation, which is conducting the inquiry with Bragg’s prosecutors and investigators, declined to comment.
Bragg and the investigation commissioner, Jocelyn Strauber, are expected to announce the charges Thursday afternoon. Lewis-Martin and the others are expected to be arraigned later in the day before acting State Supreme Court Justice Daniel P. Conviser.
On Monday, Lewis-Martin convened reporters in a conference room in her lawyer’s offices and declared herself “falsely accused of something, I don’t know exactly what it is.”
“I have never done anything illegal in my capacity in government,” she said.
Lewis-Martin added that she had worked in government for more than 35 years, including as an aide to Adams in the New York Senate and at the Brooklyn borough president’s office, and as Adams’ chief adviser in City Hall.
“During my tenure, I have never taken any gifts, money, anything,” she said, adding that she had never arranged for any gifts or money to be given to a family member or friend.
At the news conference on Monday, Aidala said the Manhattan district attorney’s office was targeting his client for political reasons.
“These decisions are obviously coming from the top, whether it’s to get headlines, whether it’s to figure out a road to get to the mayor, we don’t know,” he said.
Lewis-Martin and Adams have been close for about 40 years. Her husband and Adams, a retired police captain, first met as police cadets in 1984, Lewis-Martin and Adams have said.
Lewis-Martin served as Adams’ campaign manager during his successful 2006 run for the New York Senate and then became a top aide at his Senate office in Albany.
When he rose to become Brooklyn borough president, she served as his deputy and enforcer. She also helped raise money for One Brooklyn Fund, a nonprofit that promoted the borough and Adams, and which the city’s inspector general later found to have improperly solicited funds from groups with business before his office.
Lewis-Martin also worked closely with Brooklyn Democratic Party officials while in her role, helping to organize campaigns and holding political meetings in Borough Hall, former aides have said.
She also intervened with city agencies on behalf of business people with ties to the Brooklyn political machine, emails reviewed by the Times show.
When he was elected mayor in 2021, several of Adams’ supporters urged him not to put her in a position of authority at City Hall. They cited concerns about her history of divisiveness and her ethical probity, according to the supporters who spoke to the Times for a 2023 profile of Lewis-Martin. Adams ignored their advice and, according to Lewis-Martin, let her choose any office she wanted. She became his chief adviser, a role in which she was often considered his second-in-command.
“I wanted a role where I can walk into any meeting at any time, where my voice can be heard any time, anywhere, and that’s what I have,” she said in a 2022 interview with PIX11.
Lewis-Martin has called herself the mayor’s “sister ordained by God.” In a statement Sunday, after she announced her resignation, Adams echoed those terms.
Lewis-Martin’s son, who is 38, is a professional DJ who goes by the name “Suave Luciano,” and he has received exposure over the years through both his mother and Adams.
He has worked as a DJ at establishments owned by Dwivedi and talked about possible business ventures with him, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
He also worked a popular Sunday brunch at Woodland, a Brooklyn restaurant run by Robert and Johnny Petrosyants, twin brothers who were friends of Adams and Lewis-Martin. He performed at Brooklyn Borough Hall while Adams and Lewis-Martin worked there, and later at Gracie Mansion and at the city’s Rise Up concert series in 2022.

Full text: Ingrid Lewis-Martin, her son, and two businessmen were expected to be arraigned on bribery charges connected to the loan for Lewis-Martin's son.
Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the former chief adviser to Mayor Eric Adams, is expected to surrender on Thursday on bribery charges involving two businessmen who gave her son a $ 100,000 loan to buy a Porsche, several people with knowledge of the matter said.
Her son, Glenn Martin II, and the other two men were also expected to surrender on Thursday for arraignment on the charges, which are being brought by the Manhattan district attorney, the people said.
The charges accuse the businessmen of providing the loan to Ms. Lewis-Martin's son after she helped them resolve an issue with the city's Department of Buildings in connection with a construction project in one of their hotels, the people said. It is unclear if Mr. Martin has made payments on the 2023 loan, which was memorialized in a promissory note, one of the people said.
The accusations grew out of a broad corruption investigation focused on Ms. Lewis-Martin, who announced her resignation on Sunday -- hours before The New York Times reported that a grand jury was hearing evidence against her.
Ms. Lewis-Martin, 63, was one of roughly a dozen members of Mr. Adams's inner circle who have been ensnared in federal or state corruption investigations in recent months, inquiries that have led to the searches of homes, the seizures of phones and the resignations of some of the most powerful officials in City Hall.
When she surrenders, she will be the highest-profile city official to face charges since Mr. Adams himself was indicted on federal corruption charges in late September -- the first sitting mayor in the modern history of New York City to face criminal charges.
Mr. Adams has maintained that he is innocent and has said that the charges against him are politically motivated.
Ms. Lewis-Martin's arraignment is expected to occur during a week marked by several significant legal and political setbacks for the mayor, who is facing trial in April on federal bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and campaign finance charges and has said he will still run for re-election in 2025.
On Sunday, Ms. Lewis-Martin abruptly announced her resignation. On Monday, the city's campaign finance board denied Mr. Adams as much as $ 4.3 million in public funding for his mayoral campaign. On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a motion by Mr. Adams's attorneys to dismiss a bribery charge against him and a request from the defense to move up the mayor's trial date.
The district attorney's investigation into Ms. Lewis-Martin appears to be ongoing, and there has been no indication that the inquiry has focused on Mr. Adams.
Ms. Martin's lawyer, Arthur L. Aidala, declined to comment on Wednesday. In a statement on Sunday, he said, "The only thing of which we are certain is that Ingrid Lewis-Martin has served this city admirably for decades in an ethical, moral and law abiding manner."
A lawyer for Mr. Martin did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for one of the businessmen, Mayank Dwivedi, a hotelier with properties in New York City and the Hamptons, said in a statement that Mr. Dwivedi had engaged in no wrongdoing.
The district attorney "has an incomplete and inaccurate view of the facts," said the lawyer, Teny Geragos. "We look forward to setting the record straight and proving Mr. Dwivedi's complete innocence."
Jonathan S. Sack, a lawyer for the other businessman, declined to comment.
Spokeswomen for the office of the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, and the city's Department of Investigation, which is conducting the inquiry with Mr. Bragg's prosecutors and investigators, declined to comment.
Mr. Bragg and the investigation commissioner, Jocelyn Strauber, are expected to announce the charges on Thursday afternoon. Ms. Lewis-Martin and the others are expected to be arraigned later in the day before Acting State Supreme Court Justice Daniel P. Conviser.
On Monday, Ms. Lewis-Martin convened reporters in a conference room in her lawyer's offices and declared herself "falsely accused of something, I don't know exactly what it is."
"I have never done anything illegal in my capacity in government," she said.
Ms. Lewis-Martin added that she had worked in government for over 35 years, including as an aide to Mr. Adams in the New York State Senate and at the Brooklyn borough president's office, and as Mr. Adams's chief adviser in City Hall.
"During my tenure, I have never taken any gifts, money, anything," she said, adding that she had never arranged for any gifts or money to be given to a family member or friend.
At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Aidala said the Manhattan district attorney's office was targeting his client for political reasons.
"These decisions are obviously coming from the top, whether it's to get headlines, whether it's to figure out a road to get to the mayor, we don't know," he said.
Ms. Lewis-Martin and Mr. Adams have been close for about 40 years. Her husband and Mr. Adams, a retired police captain, first met as police cadets in 1984, Ms. Lewis-Martin and Mr. Adams have said.
Ms. Lewis-Martin served as Mr. Adams's campaign manager during his successful 2006 run for the New York State Senate and then became a top aide at his State Senate office in Albany.
When he rose to become Brooklyn borough president, she served as his deputy and enforcer. She also helped raise money for One Brooklyn Fund, a nonprofit that promoted the borough and Mr. Adams, and which the city's inspector general later found to have improperly solicited funds from groups with business before his office.
Ms. Lewis-Martin also worked closely with Brooklyn Democratic Party officials while in her role, helping to organize campaigns and holding political meetings in Borough Hall, former aides have said.
She also intervened with city agencies on behalf of business people with ties to the Brooklyn political machine, emails reviewed by The Times show.
When he was elected mayor in 2021, several of Mr. Adams's supporters urged him not to put her in a position of authority at City Hall. They cited concerns about her history of divisiveness and her ethical probity, according to the supporters who spoke to The Times for a 2023 profile of Ms. Lewis-Martin. Mr. Adams ignored their advice and, according to Ms. Lewis-Martin, let her choose any office she wanted. She became his chief adviser, a role in which she was often considered his second-in-command.
"I wanted a role where I can walk into any meeting at any time, where my voice can be heard any time, anywhere, and that's what I have," she said in a 2022 interview with PIX11.
Ms. Lewis-Martin has called herself the mayor's "sister ordained by God." In a statement on Sunday, after she announced her resignation, Mr. Adams echoed those terms.
Ms. Lewis-Martin's son, who is 38, is a professional D.J. who goes by the name "Suave Luciano," and he has received exposure over the years through both his mother and Mr. Adams.
He has worked as a D.J. at establishments owned by Mr. Dwivedi and talked about possible business ventures with him, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
He also worked a popular Sunday brunch at Woodland, a Brooklyn restaurant run by Robert and Johnny Petrosyants, twin brothers who were friends of Mr. Adams and Ms. Lewis-Martin. He performed at Brooklyn Borough Hall while Mr. Adams and Ms. Lewis-Martin worked there, and later at Gracie Mansion and at the city's Rise Up concert series in 2022.

Full text: Neil Druckmann said Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the adventure of a galactic bounty hunter, would be a story about faith.
After becoming known for cinematic storytelling and heartbreaking realism through franchises such as The Last of Us and Uncharted, Neil Druckmann said his next video game would take place in the fantastical reaches of space, where a tattooed bounty hunter watches anime and drives a Porsche-branded rocket ship.
"The story is quite ambitious," centering on a fictitious religion and "what happens when you put your faith in different institutions," said Druckmann, studio head of Naughty Dog, a development company owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Druckmann has also written and directed episodes of HBO's "The Last of Us," which tells a story of grief and grudges in postapocalyptic America.
The new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, was announced on Thursday in a cryptic trailer at the Game Awards that showed a few seconds of gameplay in which the protagonist battles a hulking cyborg with swordlike weapons. The story is set in an alternative universe where space travel has significantly advanced by 1986.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Druckmann declined to share many details about Intergalactic, which is the first original story he and his team have created in almost 15 years and does not have a release date. But he said it was a return to Naughty Dog's roots in the action-adventure genre that helped build the studio's reputation with franchises like Crash Bandicoot. It takes inspiration, he said, from classic anime like the 1988 movie "Akira" and the 1990s series "Cowboy Bebop."
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who have composed film scores for "Challengers" and "The Social Network," wrote the soundtrack for Intergalactic. Tati Gabrielle ("Chilling Adventures of Sabrina") will star as the bounty hunter, Jordan Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani ("Silicon Valley") will play Colin Graves, one of her wanted men.
Gabrielle was a standout during the casting process, said Druckmann, who has worked with her several times. She was the villain in the "Uncharted" movie and will play Nora in the second season of "The Last of Us."
"She has this intimidating presence to her," he said. "We brought her in for an audition, and she blew us away. It was one of those moments -- like when I first saw Ashley Johnson as Ellie," one of the main characters from The Last of Us.
More than 250 Naughty Dog employees have worked on Intergalactic over the past four years, in addition to outside artists in Druckmann's network.
Druckmann, 46, said that the chance to make something new was earned after a string of successful games -- The Last of Us franchise has sold more than 37 million copies, Naughty Dog said early last year -- and that he did not feel like he had something to prove at this point in his career.
Developing new intellectual property can be nerve-racking because of the financial investment; Naughty Dog has had a series of layoffs over the past two years and underwent a restructuring that Druckmann said would ensure the company could operate as "an I.P. powerhouse."
"It is about striking a balance of business and art," he said. "It is not just jumping on any opportunity to increase our bottom line."
Druckmann said he was keenly aware that some gamers have eagerly awaited news about Intergalactic.
"It's really hard to work on these things in secret and silence for so many years," he said, "and then to see our fans go on social media and say, 'Enough with the remasters and remakes! Where are your new games and new I.P.s?"'
He added, "We are finally starting to lift the curtain on this thing."

Swept Up in Hunter Biden's Whirlwind: [Style Desk]

Full text: When Zoë Kestan first met Hunter Biden she didn't know who he was. His father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was no longer in office, and she didn't read the news much anyway.
As far as Ms. Kestan knew, as she neared the end of her shift at Vivid Cabaret, the Midtown Manhattan strip club where she performed, Mr. Biden was just another V.I.P. client with the clout to book a private room in the wee hours of the morning.
And Ms. Kestan, at the time a 24-year-old downtown "it" girl, fashion designer and social media star, could have had no idea, as she rode the elevator to the top floor of the club, that the evening would change her life -- plunging her into an 11-month love affair with a man whose personal conduct would become the subject of the country's prurient curiosity.
Her relationship with the handsome, well-dressed customer would end with intimate images of Ms. Kestan exposed to the world, via Mr. Biden's infamous laptop, and turn her into a tabloid figure in her own right, dragged into the chummed waters of a partisan-media feeding frenzy.
It would also force Ms. Kestan -- as one of the most extensive observers of Mr. Biden's drug use -- to testify in federal court this spring, along with some of his other former romantic partners.
Seven years after their meeting, Ms. Kestan, 31, is still trying to process what happened. She became well known, but on terms totally different from those she had imagined. The collision of her local fame with Mr. Biden's national notoriety left her with whiplash, unsure of who she was.
"I was confronted with the fact that the only thing I know about my identity now is -- I'm still affected by this person, and certain people around me think of me only in relation to him," said Ms. Kestan in an interview from her Brooklyn apartment, where she lives with her Shih Tzu, Enzo.
Mr. Biden's regular appearances in the news, she says, have made it hard for her to move on, personally and professionally. On Sunday, President Biden announced that he would pardon his son, who was scheduled to be sentenced this month on federal gun and tax evasion charges.
Neither Mr. Biden nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.
While Ms. Kestan did not want to address her ex's high-profile reprieve, she has much to say about her year with Mr. Biden, and its difficult aftermath. There's no doubt she has lived through something sensational and extraordinary, but she can't quite figure out how it fits in with the rest of her life.
Inventing 'WeedSlut'
A New Yorker through and through, Ms. Kestan, the daughter of a lawyer and a saleswoman, grew up in the Yorkville section of the Upper East Side. She attended the elite Horace Mann School, and a lifelong love of fashion and art led her to the Rhode Island School of Design, where she nurtured plans to turn her designs into a brand. Ms. Kestan returned to the city after graduation, by day working for Jeff Koons as a color mixer, and by night immersing herself in Manhattan nightlife. A regular at the Boom Boom Room and China Chalet, she found herself mixing with other designers and picking up freelance projects for Telfar Clemens and the rapper Travis Scott.
She became a star in the downtown world through her Instagram, which combined images of Ms. Kestan in scant dress (often consuming marijuana) with a rainbow-colored moodboard of objects that caught her eye: a Lego house, some patterned yarn, an orange cream soda.
Ms. Kestan had long been a reader of Vice Magazine, which spurred her fascination with porn stars like Sasha Grey and Stoya, who she thought embodied a kind of intelligent feminist sexuality.
"Slutty was an art form for her," said Matheus Lima, a longtime friend of Ms. Kestan's.
It was through her Instagram that Ms. Kestan was discovered by Andrew Richardson, the publisher of a namesake magazine and streetwear label pitched at the intersection of erotica, skate culture and the art world.
Mr. Richardson hired Ms. Kestan to dance at his parties and had her photographed for his magazine. Ms. Kestan soon became a fixture in a dissolute 2010s milieu that included figures like Julia Fox and Jack Donoghue -- people who were not yet famous but on the cusp of it.
In 2015, she lost her Jeff Koons job but soon picked up another as a designer at the ad agency Wieden+Kennedy. Still, she was looking to supplement her income. After some encouragement from a friend who was a stripper, Ms. Kestan began dancing at Vivid Cabaret.
"It boosted my confidence a lot," she said. "It made me feel really powerful."
In the spring of 2017, Ms. Kestan folded all of her nightlife connections and fascinations with the aesthetics of sex work and weed into a collection of lingerie and apparel that she showed at Paul's Baby Grand, a cocktail lounge in TriBeCa.
"WEEDSLUT," read a flier defining her new brand, "is about embracing and enjoying the effort and glamour of an exaggerated style of dress that is unashamedly dripping with sexuality."
Ms. Kestan felt the show was a triumph, and started visiting manufacturers.
"She had a lot of ideas and energy, and she was hard-working," Mr. Richardson said. "After the show at Paul's Baby Grand, we all thought she was going to go on and do something."
Later that year, she met Mr. Biden.
'I'm Just So Attracted to Him'
A few days after their private dance, Ms. Kestan walked into a suite at the Soho Grand Hotel and found Mr. Biden in his underwear smoking cigarettes and blasting Sturgill Simpson. By then, she had figured out who he was, and when another dancer invited her to a party with Mr. Biden at the downtown hotel, Ms. Kestan figured, Why not? Her brand was debauchery and camp, and she was young.
In the hotel room, Mr. Biden immediately asked Ms. Kestan about her work: He wanted to see photos of her designs, to connect on a creative level.
It was disarming, Ms. Kestan remembered. Mr. Biden was 47, nearly twice her age, but he wanted to talk to her as a peer. And he was exciting and spontaneous. When Ms. Kestan mentioned that she wanted to check out some new designs at a nearby lingerie shop, Mr. Biden handed Ms. Kestan the keys to his Porsche to drive the seven blocks from the hotel. Then, she said, he persuaded the staff to let them stay past closing so they could browse.
That night they dined at Fanelli Cafe, and stayed up until 4 a.m. talking. Mr. Biden spoke of his children; his brother Beau, who died in 2015; and his addictions -- to alcohol, and more recently, to crack cocaine. He looked back wistfully at his periods of sobriety, and said he wanted to get sober again. He took a pull from his glass pipe, she said, every 20 minutes, but when he took it he didn't seem impaired or different; he just seemed like himself.
In the morning, Mr. Biden asked Ms. Kestan to stay the week with him. She knew this was fast, but she felt a powerful connection between them.
"I'm just so attracted to him," Ms. Kestan said, recalling her thinking. "I did not want to leave."
Thus began the pattern of their relationship: stays, some long and some short, at luxury hotels in New York and Los Angeles -- the Four Seasons, the Mercer, 6 Columbus, the Roosevelt, the Freehand, the Jeremy. In New York, Ms. Kestan introduced Mr. Biden to her downtown demimonde, taking him to art openings and fashion shows and out to dinner at Lucien. Not yet a national figure, Mr. Biden largely went unrecognized.
The pair had discussed a stint in rehab for Mr. Biden, and agreed to go together to California for him to get sober. But when Ms. Kestan arrived in Los Angeles, Mr. Biden had changed plans, renting a bungalow for a month at the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip.
The haven for immoderation was hardly a place to slow down. But the timing was perfect: Ms. Kestan needed to supervise manufacturing of the WeedSlut line at factories in the area.
Ms. Kestan remembers this stay as the highlight of their relationship. Mr. Biden introduced her around the hotel as his girlfriend, and the pair explored the city together. She found Mr. Biden funny, smart and charming: a history buff who wanted to talk about Genghis Khan and Cleopatra; an artist at heart who wanted to write a great book, gave her ideas for WeedSlut merchandise and listened to her read Camille Paglia essays late into the night; and an exhibitionist who loved posing for selfies as much as she did, and mused about posting explicit videos of himself to Pornhub.
And he was touchingly sensitive, she said. Up late one night, taking mushrooms and listening to their favorite music, Mr. Biden had a surprising reaction to a song by the rapper Lil Peep that Ms. Kestan had put on. The artist had died recently of an overdose, and hearing his songs made Mr. Biden sad. He asked her to turn it off.
Another night, Ms. Kestan introduced Mr. Biden to her mother over dinner at the Chateau. Her mother was skeptical.
"She didn't say anything bad about him," Ms. Kestan said. "But she wasn't particularly impressed."
It wasn't just her. A month earlier, Ms. Kestan had invited her friend, Mr. Lima, to a Manhattan hotel suite to meet Mr. Biden. At first, Mr. Lima was charmed: Mr. Biden was easy to talk to and gave him a gold ring.
"But then very quickly I was like, This has a price," Mr. Lima said. "You don't just get things for free." Mr. Lima expressed his concerns to Ms. Kestan; in particular, he was worried that Mr. Biden's lifestyle could be a danger to her. When Ms. Kestan continued to see Mr. Biden, Mr. Lima was distraught.
"I care so much for her safety, but she's choosing this scary guy over her own future and goals," he said.
Party's Over
As the couple's stay at the Chateau Marmont neared its end, Ms. Kestan had started to understand just how deeply Mr. Biden's addiction ruled his life. When Ms. Kestan went to sleep, she said, Mr. Biden would retreat into the bathroom, where he would set up a laptop and a crack pipe on a chair and stay up all night making phone calls. If no one answered, he would find cam girls on the internet to keep him company.
At other times, Ms. Kestan said, Mr. Biden would go on late-night drives around Los Angeles, sometimes bringing strangers back to the hotel to party. Or he would join her poolside in the morning after a night out, collapsing onto a chaise longue with a double vodka.
He had also turned her into a kind of personal assistant, sending her out to get money from the A.T.M. to pay dealers. He told her that his money was her money, but sometimes he asked Ms. Kestan to spot him.
One morning she woke up and Mr. Biden was gone. When she called him, he said he had rented another bungalow in the hotel to party with some people he had just met. Later, he disappeared for days, claiming he was checking into rehab. But Ms. Kestan, whom Mr. Biden had trusted with his passwords, saw that he was taking money out of the bank far from where he said he was.
At other times, Mr. Biden seemed paranoid, blaming Ms. Kestan when he misplaced his laptop, and accusing her of speaking ill of him to her friends.
Ms. Kestan knew Mr. Biden wouldn't change for her, but she was in love, and she kept traveling to see him: to Malibu, and finally, in November 2018, to Newburyport, Mass., where Mr. Biden was undergoing ketamine therapy to treat his addiction. When she arrived, it was obvious it hadn't taken -- he wanted to find powder cocaine he could cook into crack.
Ms. Kestan drove him to Providence, where she still had college connections who could sell it to them. In a hotel there, the two discussed the English cultural theorist Mark Fisher and listened to "Red Scare," the edgy cultural commentary podcast that would later have Ms. Kestan on as a guest.
The next morning, he dropped her off at the Providence Amtrak station. It was the last time she would see him in person until she saw him in court this June.
After they parted at the station, the pair began to fight bitterly over text, with Mr. Biden by turns lashing out and self-flagellating.
"I wronged you," Mr. Biden wrote in a WhatsApp message. "I intentionally hurt you. I am a bad man. You need to be away from me forever."
"Know how much I am grieving the beauty that was our relationship," Ms. Kestan responded.
Frequent texts became infrequent emails, and then communication mostly stopped.
In the spring of 2019, Ms. Kestan reached out to Mr. Biden to congratulate him on his daughter's high school graduation, which she had seen on Instagram. When she didn't hear back, she sent him another message to make sure he was OK. Shortly after, Mr. Biden wrote to her for the last time.
"Hi Zoe," Mr. Biden wrote in an email. "I got married to the love of my life, and I'm happier than I have ever been. I have begun a new life with my beautiful wife and ask you to please honor my privacy. Wish you well."
The Laptop
In the months after Ms. Kestan stopped seeing Mr. Biden, she felt unmoored. She hadn't danced since the relationship started, and when she tried working again at Vivid Cabaret, she lasted only two shifts.
Meanwhile, the WeedSlut collection was ready, but Ms. Kestan couldn't find the energy to market it. The brand she had spent years building didn't seem right anymore. It had nothing to do with Mr. Biden, and yet she felt it was linked to him. When Instagram took down her account for violating community guidelines, she didn't try to get it reinstated.
"I started not liking it anymore," she said. "I was embarrassed by it."
In October 2020, The New York Post reported that emails from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden contained incriminating evidence against him and his father, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee. The paper's claims about wrongdoing on the elder Biden's part were not substantiated, but as the story took off, the laptop -- which contained thousands of images, videos and text messages from a time period that coincided with Ms. Kestan and Mr. Biden's relationship -- became a media sensation.
As explicit images from the laptop spread on social media, Ms. Kestan had two reactions. One was concern for her family: Anonymous accounts on Reddit and 4chan, for instance, had posted personal details about her parents and friends.
The other was a strange sense of validation.
"Now there's physical evidence that we spent that time together," Ms. Kestan said.
The contents of the laptop also helped Ms. Kestan confirm suspicions she had throughout the relationship. Time stamps seemed to suggest that when Mr. Biden had told her he was checking into various rehabs, he was doing anything but.
And through news reports, Ms. Kestan learned that Mr. Biden had fathered a child with an Arkansas woman, while Ms. Kestan and Mr. Biden were together. Mr. Biden had told Ms. Kestan that she was the only person he had slept with since getting together with his brother's widow, Hallie Biden.
But if these revelations made Ms. Kestan more ready to move on, national events wouldn't let her. Mr. Biden's laptop became the focus of investigations into Mr. Biden's taxes and his purchase of a handgun, and Republicans in Congress had a field day with evidence of his tawdry life.
In July 2023, during a hearing of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about the I.R.S. investigation into Mr. Biden's taxes, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia held up a poster board covered in sexually explicit images of Mr. Biden, including one with Ms. Kestan, which made Ms. Kestan feel, as she put it, "gross and angry."
Fox News posted a video segment about Ms. Greene's stunt on its website with a headline identifying Ms. Kestan as a "prostitute," a job she has never had. Other publications identified her as Mr. Biden's "stripper ex."
When a federal case charging Mr. Biden with illegally purchasing a firearm made its way to court this June, prosecutors called on Ms. Kestan to testify about their relationship. By the time she arrived at the Delaware courthouse, in a black blazer, Pucci scarf and oversize Celine sunglasses, Ms. Kestan was a player in a national drama. And Mr. Biden, who could once walk into a store without being disturbed, was now a celebrity, pilloried by the right as an embodiment of Democratic rot, pitied by many for his addiction and celebrated by sections of the internet as a kind of ironic loser-hero.
In court, when Ms. Kestan identified Mr. Biden for the record, her famous ex -- now sober and married -- waved at her, and smiled.
Her sweeping, colorful testimony included a detail about Mr. Biden's fondness for the indie band Fleet Foxes that spread widely online. It was also a rigorous chronology of Mr. Biden's drug use in her presence, which prosecutors used to establish that he had been addicted to crack when he applied for the gun, and had lied about it on the application.
Under oath, Ms. Kestan discussed his crack pipes and smoking schedule, the parade of dealers, the succession of hotels, his increasingly erratic behavior, the failed attempts at rehab.
This was one reason she sometimes cut her trips to see him short: because, she testified, she couldn't handle seeing him in person not trying to get sober.
"I thought that if I left," she said during her testimony, "he finally would."
Moving On
Days after Ms. Kestan testified, Mr. Biden was found guilty of three felony charges related to the handgun purchase. Then, on Sept. 5, Mr. Biden pleaded guilty to nine charges in a federal tax case against him.
Until President Biden pardoned his son on Sunday, reversing an earlier position that he would not do so, the younger Biden faced a maximum of 17 years in prison for the tax case, and 25 for the gun case, though he was unlikely to receive a sentence near that length.
Ms. Kestan did not comment on the pardon. But she said Mr. Biden's plea had come as a relief: It spared her yet another testimony. And it closed a surreal and sometimes painful chapter in her life she hopes to move past.
"I don't have regrets about anything I did online or with Hunter," she said. "I don't want to live that way."
At the same time, Ms. Kestan says that the relationship has cast a shadow over her in ways she didn't expect. She hasn't had a serious relationship since Mr. Biden, and she can't help wondering whether a succession of promising job interviews that did not turn into job offers has something to do with what happens when you search her name on Google.
"It was only a year of my life, but it doesn't feel like something that should have defined me for so long," she said.
After several years in the creative wilderness, Ms. Kestan has started a new home décor line, and she has been working as design director for the decorative artist and designer Elizabeth Hayt.
And she's stepping out again.
Last month, Ms. Kestan attended an opening at Lomex, an au courant TriBeCa gallery, for Kye Christensen-Knowles, whom she met when they were college freshmen at the Rhode Island School of Design.
Mr. Christensen-Knowles had included in his show a portrait of Ms. Kestan, along with ones portraying other members of the painter's milieu, like the cult writer Dennis Cooper and the art dealer Begum Yasar.
Wearing pink Pucci tights and a nylon bodysuit, Ms. Kestan mingled with the fashionable crowd, some of whom had known her for many years. Like Ms. Kestan, they weren't totally sure what to make of her relationship with Mr. Biden.
Alexander Shulan, who owns the gallery and is friendly with Ms. Kestan, called the relationship "confusing and strange," an uncanny example of the intermixing of cultural spheres.
Mr. Christensen-Knowles described it as a challenge that Ms. Kestan was capable of overcoming. "This is an albatross that is necessary for her to confront so she can grow," he said.
He had painted Ms. Kestan in a pink skirt suit, heels and a pearl bracelet -- as a Jackie Kennedy-esque political spouse. Her gaze is cast down, and her hair is gathered into disquieting tendrils.
"She has an aura that has always struck me, an old-world grace and dignity to her beauty," Mr. Christensen-Knowles said. "I was hoping to capture her how I see her: as a dignified subject with inherent power."

McKinsey Agrees to Pay $122 Million to Settle South Africa Bribery Case: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The global consultancy was accused of bribing foreign government officials. A former senior partner pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge.
McKinsey & Co. agreed to pay a fine of more than $ 122 million to resolve a felony bribery investigation stemming from its work in South Africa, federal prosecutors in New York said in a filing unsealed Thursday. It is the latest in a string of legal penalties for the global consulting firm, which in recent years has agreed to pay about $ 1 billion in settlements for its work with opioid manufacturers.
The fine announced Thursday was part of a deferred prosecution agreement that would dismiss the bribery charge against the company after three years if McKinsey meets the conditions of the deal. Separately, a former McKinsey senior partner, Vikas Sagar, who was a leader in its Johannesburg office, pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate an anti-corruption law, prosecutors said.
The bribery investigation stemmed from work that McKinsey's South African branch performed, starting more than a decade ago, for two state-owned companies: one overseeing the country's run-down electric generating system, the other managing its freight rail system and ports. Mr. Sagar received confidential information about the companies that led to multimillion-dollar consulting contracts, and in return, some of the money McKinsey and its local partners made was routed to two officials as bribes, prosecutors said.
"McKinsey Africa participated in a yearslong scheme to bribe government officials in South Africa and unlawfully obtained a series of highly lucrative consulting engagements" that netted McKinsey $ 85 million in profits, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.
When The New York Times published a 2018 investigation into McKinsey's contracts in South Africa, the firm's questionable work there was considered its biggest mistake in its nearly 100-year history. But the next year, with the United States in the grip of an opioid epidemic, McKinsey's extensive work to "turbocharge" sales at Purdue Pharma, the maker of the painkiller OxyContin, became public. McKinsey's work with opioid makers is the focus of an ongoing federal criminal investigation.
McKinsey's work for the two South African companies -- Eskom, the power company, and Transnet, the freight rail company -- at one point brought in almost half of the Johannesburg office's revenues. Despite McKinsey's extensive consulting for Eskom, the country has been crippled by frequent blackouts in recent years.
South African law required McKinsey to hire local subcontractors, which have been the focus of criminal investigations in that country.
In 2018 McKinsey's managing partner apologized for the way the firm had handled the controversy over its work in South Africa, which came amid a corruption scandal that led the country's president to resign. McKinsey voluntarily returned about $ 100 million and fired Mr. Sagar.
At the time McKinsey was working with Transnet, Mr. Sagar arranged for a former McKinsey employee to ghostwrite an M.B.A. thesis for a senior Transnet executive, according to the former employee.
"McKinsey is deeply remorseful that an employee of our firm engaged in corrupt conduct," the firm said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it "will continue to cooperate" with South African and U.S. authorities in other ongoing investigations.
Mr. Sagar, a native of India and a graduate of the University of Michigan and the Wharton School, was responsible for winning some of the biggest contracts in McKinsey's South African office. Known for his showy, larger-than-life personality, Mr. Sagar drove a Porsche, carried a Louis Vuitton briefcase and once ended a long business meeting by dancing on top of a conference table.
According to the documents unsealed Thursday, Mr. Sagar, 56, pleaded guilty in December 2022 to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The announcement did not say whether he had been sentenced.

Peggy Caserta, Who Wrote a Tell-All About Janis Joplin, Dies at 84: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her Haight-Ashbury clothing store was ground zero for the counterculture. But she was best known for a tawdry book -- which she later disavowed -- published after Ms. Joplin's death.
Peggy Caserta, whose funky Haight-Ashbury clothing boutique was a magnet for young bohemians and musicians, and who exploited her relationship with Janis Joplin in a much-panned 1973 memoir that she later disavowed, died on Nov. 21 at her home in Tillamook, Ore. She was 84.
Her partner and only immediate survivor, Jackie Mendelson, confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.
The Louisiana-born Ms. Caserta was 23 and working at a Delta Air Lines office in San Francisco when she decided to open a clothing store for her cohort, the lesbians in her neighborhood. She found an empty storefront on Haight Street, near the corner of Ashbury, which she rented for $ 87.50 a month.
At first Ms. Caserta sold jeans, sweatshirts and double-breasted denim blazers that her mother made. Then she added Levi's pants, which a friend turned into flares by inserting a triangle of denim into the side seams. When the friend couldn't keep up with the orders, Ms. Caserta persuaded Levi Strauss & Company to make them.
She named the place Mnasidika (pronounced na-SID-ek-ah), after a character in a poem by Sappho. "It's a Greek girls' name," Ms. Caserta told The San Francisco Examiner in 1965, for an article about the "new bohemians" colonizing the Haight-Ashbury district.
"We didn't even know we were hippies," Ms. Caserta told another reporter.
The store became a hangout for Ms. Caserta's friends, a ragtag bunch of drug smugglers and musicians, including a then-penniless band called the Grateful Dead -- "a scraggly group," she called them -- who posed for her store posters and lived around the corner. So did Ms. Caserta and her girlfriend, and Joe McDonald, of the band Country Joe and the Fish, and his girlfriend, a young singer from Texas named Janis Joplin.
Ms. Joplin came into the store one day and asked to buy a pair of jeans on layaway. The jeans sold for $ 4.95, and she had 50 cents to put down. Ms. Caserta gave them to her, at no charge, and the two became fast friends, occasional lovers and then dope-shooting comrades, even as their fortunes rose.
Mnasidika was enormously popular, a go-to clothier for Jimi Hendrix, Kris Kristofferson and Sly Stone, among others -- and the local pot dealers. And Ms. Caserta, with her enticing Southern drawl, became a kind of hippie entrepreneur. She sold tickets for Bill Graham's concerts at the Fillmore and LSD for Augustus Owsley Stanley, the Dead's sound engineer, who found fame with his psychedelic product.
She was generous with her friends -- she bought one girlfriend a motorcycle and a Porsche -- and once put her house up as collateral for a bail bond to get a pot-smuggling pal out of jail. Later, she would help his colleagues break out of a Mexican prison.
Ms. Caserta continued to branch out, opening new stores and buying property, and she and Ms. Joplin were planning to start a production company, said Ms. Mendelson, who was on the scene at the time. They intended to call it Honeysuckle Productions, and they even had a logo and stationery.
Then everything went sideways.
On Oct. 2, 1970, Ms. Caserta and Ms. Joplin had each scored heroin and were staying together at the Hollywood Landmark Hotel. Ms. Joplin's boyfriend at the time was on his way to see her, anticipating a threesome. Ms. Caserta, who declined to participate, left and checked into the Château Marmont.
Two days later, Ms. Joplin was dead at 27 from an apparent overdose. Ms. Caserta's seemingly bottomless descent into addiction had only begun.
She was pilloried by friends, who blamed her for Ms. Joplin's death, and pilloried again when her tell-all, "Going Down With Janis," was published in 1973. Hers was one of a few Joplin books out that year, including the more conventional "Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin," by Myra Friedman, the singer's publicist.
Most reviewers dismissed Ms. Caserta's book as "tedious trash," in the words of one critic, and opportunistic pornography. Ms. Friedman, who decried the book as "loathsome and untrue," was one of many in Ms. Joplin's circle who claimed that the singer had recently been clean and blamed Ms. Caserta for her relapse.
The book's "one revelation," Midge Decter wrote in The New York Times Book Review, "although an unwitting one -- and as if we didn't know -- is that sex and heroin do not mix."
For her part, Ms. Caserta said that she never saw the book before it was published, and that it was the creation of a ghostwriter who had interviewed her at length and hyped up the drugs and the sex.
She acknowledged her own complicity, however, having sold her story to pay for her habit. In the end, she pocketed only about $ 2,000, which, as she wrote in a 2018 memoir, "I Ran Into Some Trouble," "quickly and completely disappeared into my arm."
For more than 30 years after Ms. Joplin's death, Ms. Caserta remained an addict. And as her habit grew, her business collapsed.
She ran one prescription scam with a friend, buying and selling the opioid Dilaudid, and another with a Dr. Feelgood, who ended up in jail.
She spent months in a Mexican prison by choice, pretending to be the partner of a man incarcerated there. The prison was rather lax and allowed conjugal visitors to stay for weeks, which she did while helping her friends dig an escape tunnel. (She stayed longer than necessary to ensure their success because the drugs inside were, to her, so good.)
She also spent many months at a women's prison in California -- not by choice -- and cycled in and out of rehab centers and jails for years before finally kicking her habit in 2004.
Peggy Louise Caserta was born on Sept. 12, 1940, in Covington, La., the only child of Sam and Novell (Kirkpatrick) Caserta. Her father was a postal worker.
Peggy was homecoming queen at Covington High School and an honor student at Perkinston Junior College (now Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College), from which she earned an associate degree.
Soon after, she went to work for Delta, hoping to be a flight attendant. But she was sidelined by airsickness and transferred to a desk job, first in New York City and then in San Francisco, where she was lucky -- or prescient -- enough to start a business at what would become ground zero for the counterculture.
"I Ran Into Some Trouble," written with Maggie Falcon, was her effort at redemption after the fallout from "Going Down With Janis," which many said exploited Ms. Joplin's death -- although in recent years it has been rehabilitated as a gay touchstone.
"I was hiding for those first 25 years," Ms. Caserta told New York magazine when her 2018 book was published. "Later, social media brought it all back to life. The phone would ring and I'd hear my elderly mom say, 'Oh, that's my daughter, just a minute. Peggy?' And I'd think, Oh, my God."
She continued: "One woman told Mom that Janis wants to talk to me, that she came to her in her dreams. I got on the phone and said, 'Now you listen to me. Don't call my mother anymore. And if Janis wanted to talk to me, she would come to me in a dream, not you."'

Adding Some Twists To a Familiar Formula: [Correction]

Full text: Ben Stiller stars in a tonally bumpy comedy with genre roots in Hallmark territory.
If you tilt your head and squint, "Nutcrackers" resembles a Hallmark movie, though it certainly is not one. Michael (Ben Stiller), a big-city real estate guy, is on the verge of closing the deal of a lifetime when he's called away from Chicago to rural Ohio. There, his estranged sister and her husband have died tragically, leaving behind four feral nephews to whom he is now technically guardian. He intends to stay just long enough to get them placed in foster homes, but mischief of all kinds ensues. Also, Christmas is in three weeks. You can see where this is going.
The best part of "Nutcrackers," directed by David Gordon Green, is those four kids, whose easy demeanor with one another makes them feel less like child actors, more like a pack of little hooligans who happened to wander onto set. They come by it naturally, presumably, since in real life, they're brothers (delightfully named Homer, Ulysses, Atlas and Arlo Janson). The movie's most clever line readings and funniest bits are all them, and I'd love to know how much they improvised and deviated from the screenplay.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
That screenplay, by Leland Douglas, lacks imagination. It's a mash-up of the often feminine-coded Hallmark formula and its closest variants are "Garden State" or "Elizabethtown," in which a world-weary guy finds himself in small town life. So two minutes into the movie, it's obvious what will happen: This mean metropolitan man will come to grudgingly enjoy, then love, both his nephews and small-town life; a lady will happen along (in this case, the social worker, played by Linda Cardellini); and probably they'll figure out how to save Christmas or enjoy its true meaning or whatever. The pattern is set in stone, seemingly since the dawn of time.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with a formula, especially one that has been so richly successful and beloved as the Hallmark one. Clearly the idea of the urbanite who can only regain their soul away from the hustle and bustle taps into some vein of desire or anxiety in audiences. It's what makes the movies comfort viewing: You always know what will happen, and they make you feel like the world is a safe and good place.
But most of these movies do not star Ben Stiller, nor do they have extended scenes in which an uncle tries to teach his home-schooled nephews the correct word to use for the male anatomy as they reel off a string of possibilities. (The title of this movie is, indeed, a double entendre.) Stiller's mode here is reminiscent of his years in the "Meet the Parents" franchise, just a guy who's kind of a jerk trying to escape erratic chaos. When he walks into his late sister's house, the mess is overwhelming, as are the pigs and chickens poking around the place. He wakes up the next morning to discover his very young nephews doing donuts in the front lawn in his yellow Porsche. A much more patient man than Michael would be out of his mind, too.
I don't know what to do with this movie, mostly because I can't quite figure out who it's for. It's not really a family film, at least not for many families -- the home-school lesson tells you why -- but it's not really a grown-up comedy either. It hovers in an uncanny valley, and the tonal swing is unpleasant. The film gets better whenever Stiller recedes into the background, but the movie's insistence on Michael's redemption story as the main narrative thread hurts it. It's impossible to care too much about this pompous, uptight, strangely boring guy. Especially because we know how his story will end.

VW to Leave Contentious Region of China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker has long been criticized by human rights activists for doing business in the territory, where China has repressed Muslim ethnic groups.
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it was disposing of its ownership stakes in facilities in northwestern China's Xinjiang region, exiting an area now known for the country's crackdown on predominantly Muslim ethnic groups there.
Volkswagen had a joint venture assembly plant in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, as well as two test tracks in the region, maintaining the largest and most visible presence in Xinjiang of any multinational company. That drew condemnation from human rights groups. The United States and a growing number of European countries bar imports from Xinjiang because of evidence of forced labor there.
The Chinese government, which denies the accusations of forced labor, has put heavy pressure on global companies to keep doing business in Xinjiang. In September, the Ministry of Commerce began investigating whether PVH, the corporate parent of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger clothing brands, had taken "discriminatory measures" by not buying products from Xinjiang.
BASF, the German chemicals giant, has tried for a year to obtain Chinese government permission to dispose of its stakes in two manufacturing joint ventures in Xinjiang. BASF said on Wednesday that it was in negotiations to sell both stakes, but did not identify possible buyers.
For Volkswagen, the assembly plant in Urumqi did not just become a political liability -- it was also a money loser, because it was designed to make gasoline-powered cars. China has swiftly adopted electric vehicles in the last four years, and half the cars sold in China are now either battery-electric or plug-in hybrid cars.
That has left manufacturers like Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche, with considerable unneeded production capacity. Volkswagen was China's market leader from 1983 through last year, but BYD, a Chinese maker of electric cars, has passed it in sales this year.
The Urumqi assembly plant has not built cars since 2019 and is heavily guarded and closed to visitors. During a weekday visit last month to the factory's perimeter, there was no sign of activity inside the complex, where industrial buildings extend for hundreds of yards.
Volkswagen and its state-owned joint venture partner, SAIC Motor, now employ 175 workers who do the final preparation of cars at the Urumqi complex for delivery to dealerships in western China. The Shanghai municipal government owns SAIC Motor, which also makes the MG brand of cars and has been rapidly expanding exports.
Volkswagen said that ownership of the assembly plant and test tracks was being transferred by the joint venture to the Shanghai Motor Vehicle Inspection Center, which is owned by a different arm of the Shanghai government. No price was disclosed for the transaction.
Exporting from Urumqi is impractical: Nearby Central Asian countries buy few cars, and the plant is 1,800 miles from the coast, too far for seaborne shipments.
Volkswagen has been looking for factories to close this year, not just in China but also in Germany, where higher-cost plants have stayed open for years partly because of the company's large profits in China.
The company faces intensifying competition around the globe from Chinese automakers, which are expanding exports of both electric and gasoline-powered cars. Volkswagen responded by setting up a 3,000-engineer complex in central China to develop electric cars.
Volkswagen said that through 2040, it would continue its broader cooperation with SAIC in China, including the introduction of at least eight new electric models by 2030.
Volkswagen and SAIC built the assembly plant in Urumqi in 2012 and 2013 to make inexpensive cars to sell in western China. Volkswagen made a point of hiring numerous Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang. Uyghurs have long faced discrimination from Chinese employers, and difficulties facing Uyghurs deepened after deadly attacks by Uyghur militants from 2008 to 2014.
Beginning in 2014, China cracked down on Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang. As many as a million ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minorities were sent to indoctrination camps, detention centers and prisons. Associated forced-labor programs that sent rural Uyghurs to factories and to do other urban jobs also drew heavy criticism from human rights groups, and they have prompted the United States and some European countries to restrict imports from Xinjiang since 2021.
Volkswagen has denied accusations by overseas activists that it used forced labor by Uyghurs to build its test track near Urumqi. But when it hired an auditing firm last year to review its compliance in Xinjiang with international labor standards, the audit was criticized overseas for not sufficiently protecting the anonymity of the workers who participated.
Since February, Volkswagen had been saying it was in "advanced talks" to decide the future of its activities in Xinjiang. China's foreign ministry publicly urged Volkswagen and BASF in February not to leave the region, saying that they should "cherish the opportunity to invest and develop in Xinjiang."
But with sales of gasoline-powered cars in China dwindling further, and with MG cars and SAIC Motor encountering criticism from human rights activists over ties to Xinjiang, Beijing's hostility to withdrawal began to ebb.
China's foreign ministry did not comment about Volkswagen at its daily briefing.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He made his mark on newspapers in Atlanta, San Francisco and Baltimore, but may be best known for having been abducted in Atlanta in 1974.
Reg Murphy, a widely admired editor and publisher of newspapers in Atlanta, San Francisco and Baltimore whose kidnapping by a lone right-wing gunman in 1974 riveted the nation, died on Nov. 9 at his home in St. Simons Island, Ga. He was 90.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Diana Murphy.
Mr. Murphy was the editorial page editor of The Atlanta Constitution on Feb. 19, 1974, when a man later identified as William A.H. Williams, a drywall subcontractor, called Mr. Murphy's office to ask his advice about how best to donate 300,000 gallons of heating oil to a worthy cause.
He called again the next day at dusk and arranged to meet Mr. Murphy at his home; the two of them would then drive to Mr. Williams's lawyer's office to sign some papers.
"I really had no choice but to go with him," Mr. Murphy wrote in a lengthy account in The New York Times shortly after the incident, "for newspapermen have to lead open lives and be available to anonymous or strange people."
So strange was Mr. Williams that he immediately displayed a .38-caliber gun in his left hand and announced, "Mr. Murphy, you've been kidnapped." He identified himself as a colonel in the American Revolutionary Army and ranted against the "lying, leftist, liberal news media" and "Jews in the government."
"He was a bigot and disagreed vehemently with the anti-Vietnam stance of our 'damn liberal' newspaper and all it had done to promote the civil rights movement," Mr. Murphy, who in fact was generally regarded as a political moderate, wrote in 2011.
Mr. Williams forced Mr. Murphy to cover his eyes with adhesive, hogtied him and placed him in the trunk of his green Ford Torino. He allowed him to make one telephone call. Mr. Murphy called the paper's managing editor, Jim Minter, who at first assumed it was a joke.
Mr. Minter realized it was not when Mr. Murphy's wife confirmed that he had driven off with a stranger -- just two weeks after Patty Hearst, the newspaper heiress, had been kidnapped in California by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Mr. Murphy was held in a motel room, wedged tightly between a wall and a bed, and ordered to record an audiotape demanding $ 700,000 in ransom. The money was delivered in marked bills in two suitcases dropped off on a rural road.
"Does that smell like filthy lucre to you?" Mr. Murphy said Mr. Williams had asked.
"No, colonel," Mr. Murphy said. "That smells like freedom to me."
After 49 hours of captivity, Mr. Murphy was released in the parking lot of a Ramada Inn. Mr. Williams, whom Mr. Murphy identified from photos of suspects, was arrested six hours later.
He was convicted on federal extortion charges and sentenced to 40 years in prison, of which he served nine. His wife received a three-year suspended sentence for failing to report his crimes. The ransom was recovered.
In 2019, Mr. Williams, stricken with Stage 4 melanoma, called the newspaper to apologize. He said he had been high on amphetamines when the kidnapping took place.
"Reg Murphy's legacy in Atlanta remained long after he left the city," Andrew Morse, president and publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said in an email. "He will always be remembered for his kidnapping, but it was his tireless pursuit of the story and his commitment to the craft that made him a legendary editor of The Atlanta Constitution."
In 1975, Mr. Murphy left Atlanta to become editor and publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, owned by Randolph Hearst, whose daughter was on trial at the time for participating in a bank robbery linked to the radical group that had abducted her. After she was convicted, Mr. Hearst appeared in The Examiner's office and dropped the key to a new Porsche on his desk in appreciation of the newspaper's coverage.
"It takes integrity of a different kind for a father to come in and say, 'You did a good job covering the trial of my daughter,"' Mr. Murphy said in an interview published this year in The Mercerian, the magazine of Mercer University in Macon, Ga., his alma mater.
In 1981, Mr. Murphy became publisher of The Baltimore Sun and Evening Sun, which won Pulitzer Prizes during his tenure for feature writing and explanatory journalism.
John Reginald Murphy was born on Jan. 7, 1934, in Hoschton, Ga., in Gwinnett County. He grew up in nearby Gainesville, where his father, John Lee Murphy, owned a convenience store; his mother, Mae (Ward) Murphy, was a teacher.
Reg, as he was called, enrolled at Mercer University intending to become a doctor. But he developed an affinity for journalism when he began writing for The Macon Telegraph to help pay his tuition. In 1952, he dropped out to become a full-time reporter -- 20 credits short of a degree, his wife said.
He was named a Nieman journalism fellow at Harvard in 1959 and joined The Constitution as political editor two years later. He left in 1965 to become managing editor of Atlanta magazine, but after three years he returned to the newspaper as editorial page editor.
His marriage to Virginia Rawls ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Diana (Mather) Murphy, who ran the business operations for The Sun, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Karen Cornwell and Susan Murphy; a sister, Barbara McConnell; and two grandsons.
Mr. Murphy was the author of two books: "The Southern Strategy" (1971), about Richard M. Nixon's campaign to capture the South, and "Uncommon Sense: The Achievement of Griffin Bell" (2001), a biography of President Jimmy Carter's first attorney general, a fellow Georgian.
After his newspaper career ended, Mr. Murphy was the president of the United States Golf Association from 1994 to 1995 (preceding his wife in that position by 20 years) and was president of the National Geographic Society and editor of its magazine from 1996 to 1997.
He was a trustee of Mercer University, which named its Center for Collaborative Journalism in his honor, and a board member of the advertising company Omnicom, which announced this year that it would award journalism scholarships in his name.
"Journalism is, in my mind, sacred," Mr. Murphy told The Mercerian. "It is a sacred trust to tell the truth and to try to give people enough freedom to be able to find the truth and then to pursue it."
While he was being held captive, he later said, he feared that his heart murmur might become life-threatening and calmed himself by replaying previous golf games in his mind -- and bettering his seven handicap.
"At courses I knew well, I would imagine every detail down to the weather, the bounces, the people I was paired with, and the shots they'd hit," Mr. Murphy recalled in a 2011 essay he wrote for Golf Digest. "I made a lot of birdies."

VW and Rivian Deepen Alliance With Joint Venture: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new agreement, which builds on an earlier announcement, calls for the German automaker to invest $ 5.8 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, and Rivian, a California-based maker of electric pickups and S.U.V.s, said on Tuesday that they would form a joint venture to develop software and electronics, extending a partnership they announced in June.
Volkswagen said it would increase its investment with Rivian to $ 5.8 billion from $ 5 billion, which will include a 50 percent stake in the joint venture. While short of an acquisition, the new company broadens the alliance with Rivian and could foreshadow similar partnerships between other established carmakers and new companies struggling to become profitable.
"The partnership with Rivian is the next logical step in our software strategy," Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.
In June, Volkswagen and Rivian had said they would work together on vehicle software -- an area where the German carmaker has struggled. The agreement announced Tuesday goes further by creating an independent company to jointly develop technology for electric vehicles.
The ever-closer association with Volkswagen has helped allay fears that Rivian will run out of money before it becomes profitable. Rivian shares rose 6 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.
Initially the partnership will be focused on developing software for electric vehicles, but could be expanded to include battery modules or other technology, Mr. Blume said during a conference call with reporters. Volkswagen will use the technology in many types of vehicles including subcompacts and cars made by its Audi and Porsche divisions, he said.
Though the world's second-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen has struggled to make inroads in the United States. Sales of its electric cars here have lagged behind General Motors and Hyundai-Kia. Volkswagen's share of the electric car market in the United States was just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, including the company's Audi and Porsche brands, according to Kelley Blue Book.
The collaboration with Rivian is Volkswagen's second tie-up with another automaker this year aimed at strengthening its software, which has been a notoriously weak point for the German company. In February, Volkswagen announced a partnership with Chinese electric vehicle company Xpeng, aimed at helping it to develop electric cars for China, where it has been steadily losing market share.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received positive reviews in the automotive press, but the company is not selling enough of them to make money. Rivian said last week that it lost $ 1.1 billion in the third quarter, an improvement from the same period in 2023, when it lost $ 1.4 billion. However, deliveries during the quarter fell to 10,000 vehicles, from 15,600 a year earlier, because of a parts shortage.
Volkswagen does not sell a pickup truck in the United States, a handicap in a market where such vehicles are best sellers. But the company is building a factory in South Carolina where it plans to revive the Scout off-road brand with a line of electric S.U.V.s and pickups. Scout will also use technology developed by the VW-Rivian joint venture.
Scout began taking reservations for the vehicles last month, but they will not be available until 2027.
In Europe and China, Volkswagen is trying to cut costs as it faces weak demand for its vehicles. The company also faces high energy and labor costs in Germany, home to many of its factories. The company said last month that its profit in the third quarter fell 42 percent to 2.86 billion euros, or $ 3.1 billion, its lowest level in three years.
Volkswagen has asked its 120,000 workers in Germany to accept wage cuts of 10 percent. The company has threatened to close factories there, too. The company's main union is seeking a 7 percent wage increase and says it may resort to strikes if its demands are not met.
The new joint venture will be known as Rivian and VW Group Technology and will be led by Wassym Bensaid of Rivian and Carsten Helbing of Volkswagen. Its headquarters will be in Palo Alto, Calif.
Volkswagen's $ 5.8 billion investment consists of shares in the joint venture and debt. Of that sum, $ 3.5 billion is conditional on the joint venture achieving "clearly defined milestones," Volkswagen said.

There Are Ways to Keep Autocrats Out of Power. Why Don't We Use Them?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Democratic self-rule contains a paradox. It is a system premised on openness and competition. Any ambitious party or politician should have a shot at running for office and winning. But what if a major candidate seeks to dismantle that very system?
America confronts this problem today. Donald Trump poses a clear threat to American democracy. He was the first president in U.S. history to refuse to accept defeat, and he illegally attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Now, on the brink of returning to the White House, Mr. Trump is forthrightly telling Americans that if he wins, he plans to bend, if not break, our democracy.
Mr. Trump tells us he plans to prosecute his political rivals, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney and other members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee; deploy the army to repress protest; and order the deportation of 15 million to 20 million people, including some legal immigrants.
We have been studying democratic crisis and authoritarianism for 30 years. Between the two of us, we have written five books on those subjects. We can think of few major national candidates for office in any democracy since World War II who have been this openly authoritarian.
The view that Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to democracy is shared by Gen. Mark Milley, his onetime chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called him "fascist to the core," and by his former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, who described him as a fascist who prefers dictatorship to democracy.
How could such an openly authoritarian figure have a coin flip's chance of returning to the presidency? Why have so many of our democracy's defenses seemingly broken down, and which, if any, remain?
We spent the last year researching how democracies can protect themselves from authoritarian threats from within. We have found five strategies that pro-democratic forces around the world have employed. None offer foolproof protection (no democracy could enjoy foolproof protection and remain a democracy), and some of them come with important drawbacks. But our research suggests that in the face of imminent extremist threats, these strategies are the best available.
The traditional American response to extremism is laissez-faire which makes it almost odd to call it a strategy. We rely on the self-correcting power of electoral competition. The belief is that all opinions should compete freely, allowing the marketplace of ideas, or what John Stuart Mill called "the collision of adverse opinions," to play out. If we let all candidates compete, the thinking goes, good ideas and candidates will ultimately beat out the bad ones.
Electoral competition is, of course, essential to democracy. But a laissez-faire approach has two important limitations. First, in the United States, competition is distorted by an 18th-century institution, the Electoral College, that allows election losers to win power. In one sense, the electoral marketplace worked in 2016 the way it is theoretically supposed to: More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Mr. Trump. But the Electoral College permitted an authoritarian figure who won fewer votes to become president.
In addition, history shows us that electoral competition alone is insufficient to fend off extremist threats. Good ideas don't always win out. And candidates seeking to subvert democracy don't always lose. In the past quarter-century alone, leaders like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Kais Saied in Tunisia and Nayib Bukele in El Salvador have won decisive electoral majorities -- and then used their elected offices to undermine fair competition, making it nearly impossible to remove them from office democratically.
Yet democracies are not helpless. There are four other strategies for fending off authoritarian threats from within. One of these is a far more muscular approach, known as militant or defensive democracy. Born in West Germany as a response to Europe's democratic failures in the 1930s, the militant democracy approach empowers public authorities to wield the rule of law against antidemocratic forces. Haunted by the experience of Hitler's rise to power via the ballot box, West German constitutional designers created legal and administrative procedures that allowed the state to restrict and even outlaw "anti-constitutional" speech, groups and parties. In the 1950s, these tools were used to ban both a Nazi successor party and the Communist Party. Today, German authorities are investigating the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.
Obviously, there are significant drawbacks and risks to empowering public officials to bar candidates or parties from elections. Candidate disqualification distorts electoral competition and restricts voter choice. Worse, the tools of militant democracy are easily abused by politicians seeking to sideline their rivals, as has occurred with some frequency in Latin America.
Nevertheless, most contemporary democracies employ elements of militant democracy. In South Korea, the Constitutional Court banned the Unified Progressive Party in 2014 because it deemed the party's pro-North Korean views to be antidemocratic. In Brazil, the Supreme Electoral Court has the authority to bar politicians convicted of corruption and other crimes from running for office, and a 2021 democracy protection law made it a crime -- punishable by up to 12 years in prison -- to attempt to overthrow a democratic government. Last year a former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who, like Mr. Trump, tried to discredit and then overturn an election, was barred from public office for eight years.
The United States has a tool on the books for disqualifying anti-constitutional candidates: Section III of the 14th Amendment disallows former public officials who have "engaged in insurrection or rebellion" from holding office. Intended to bar Confederate leaders from public office, Section III might have been used to disqualify Mr. Trump from the ballot -- as Colorado's Supreme Court ruled in late 2023 with regard to its state's primary ballot. Earlier this year, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, barring congressional legislation, the 14th Amendment could not be used to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot. With that decision, for good or ill, America chose to forgo the path of militant democracy.
A third approach to defending democracy is partisan gatekeeping. In the absence of legal tools to block extremist threats, the responsibility for fending off such threats falls to political parties. In a healthy democracy, party leaders police their own ranks, expelling antidemocratic elements or refusing to nominate extremists or demagogues for public office.
American parties were effective gatekeepers throughout the 20th century. In the early 1920s, Henry Ford, the plain-spoken founder of Ford Motor Company, who was admired by many Americans but whose extremism and antisemitism were embraced by Hitler and the Nazis, considered running for president as a Democrat. Early polls showed him leading the pack of potential candidates. But Democratic leaders never seriously considered him. Finding the party's gates closed, Ford abandoned his presidential aspirations.
Half a century ago, Republican leaders engaged in self-policing when they joined in congressional investigations into wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon. When Mr. Nixon's abuse of power was brought to light, key Republican leaders supported impeachment. Their actions shifted public opinion in important ways. It was not until a group of Republican lawmakers came out in favor of impeachment beginning in late July 1974 that a clear majority of Americans supported Mr. Nixon's removal from office.
Today's Republican leaders have abandoned gatekeeping. Even after Mr. Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election, they protected and supported him. Had Senate Republicans voted to convict and disqualify Mr. Trump after his second impeachment, he would not be a candidate today. But they did not. And now, nearly all Republican officeholders support Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, despite having witnessed, firsthand, his assault on democracy and the rule of law. Captive to an authoritarian outsider whom they should have kept out, Republican leaders now imperil, rather than defend, democracy.
When authoritarians make it onto the ballot, prodemocratic forces may turn to a fourth strategy: containment, in which politicians from across the ideological spectrum forge a broad coalition to isolate and defeat the authoritarians. Building a multiparty coalition requires that politicians temporarily set aside many of their short-term ambitions and policy goals. Such sacrifice is arguably in their long-term interest, because without democratic institutions, politicians' ability to pursue their short-term ambitions and policy goals will be undermined.
Opposition parties engaged in successful containment last year in Poland. When the illiberal Law and Justice Party government sought a third term, Poland's fragmented and ideologically diverse opposition united to defeat it. The center-right Civic Platform of the former prime minister Donald Tusk built an alliance with former Communists, greens, the conservative Peasant Party and a party led by Szymon Holownia, a television personality and presidential aspirant, to confront Law and Justice in the October 2023 parliamentary elections. The parties negotiated unified tickets -- to avoid splitting the vote -- for Senate races and, after jointly capturing a majority of seats in the election, elected a new government, putting an end to nearly a decade of democratic backsliding.
On several occasions, French parties have contained illiberal forces by forging what they call a cordon sanitaire -- a multiparty electoral coalition aimed at isolating and defeating far-right extremists. That strategy proved strikingly successful in July, when Marine Le Pen's radical right National Rally stood poised to become the largest force in Parliament after the first round of legislative elections.
In the face of an imminent far-right victory, party leaders and activists from across the spectrum, including the communists, greens, socialists, centrists and center-right Republicans, worked together, district by district, to persuade allied candidates to stand down and back a single candidacy against Ms. Le Pen's forces. Notwithstanding considerable acrimony among the parties, the strategy succeeded: The united "republican front" relegated the National Rally to third place.
In the United States, some Republican politicians have embraced a containment strategy. In a textbook example, the former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans, cooperated with Democrats on the House Jan. 6 Committee. Ms. Cheney, Mr. Kinzinger, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and a handful of other prominent Republicans took the important step of supporting Kamala Harris for president, making it clear that the threat posed by Mr. Trump outweighed any partisan loyalties or policy preferences.
But containment is hard in a polarized two-party system. Most of the prominent Republicans who have not endorsed Mr. Trump, including Senator Mitt Romney, former Vice President Mike Pence, and former President George W. Bush, declined to back Ms. Harris, opting instead to remain on the sidelines. Other leading Republicans who declared Mr. Trump unfit for office after 2020, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, who ran against Mr. Trump this year, now support him. As long as Republican leaders who privately view Mr. Trump as a grave danger refuse to go public, most Republican voters will remain unmoved.
That leaves a fifth strategy: societal mobilization. Democracy's last bastion of defense is civil society. When the constitutional order is under threat, influential groups and societal leaders -- chief executives, religious leaders, labor leaders and prominent retired public officials -- must speak out, reminding citizens of the red lines that democratic societies must never cross. And when politicians cross those red lines, society's most prominent voices must publicly and forcefully repudiate them.
A recent example of societal mobilization is the German public reaction to the revelation of a secret November 2023 gathering in which leaders of the far-right AfD met with neo-Nazi groups and discussed a plan for the mass deportation of immigrants, including foreign-born German citizens.
When the meeting came to light, the chairmen of the boards of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche joined top labor union leaders to condemn extremism and publicly express support for democracy, diversity and tolerance. At the same time, a network of small businesses started the Business for Democracy initiative and published a statement, signed by more than 300 business leaders, defending democracy and declaring that "human dignity is inviolable." Later, the chief executive of Siemens publicly repudiated AfD policies and declared it was time to "stand up and intervene."
The Catholic Church also responded forcefully. Representatives from all 27 German bishoprics released a statement condemning right-wing nationalism and declaring:
Right-wing extremist parties and those that place themselves close to such ideologies can be no place of political engagement for Christians. These parties are not electable. ... We call on all fellow citizens ... to clearly reject political offers from the far right.
Those public declarations took place against the backdrop of the largest street demonstrations in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The demonstrations were organized by a civil society coalition called "Hand in Hand," which encompassed 1,300 different organizations, including unions, churches, doctors' associations, refugee protection agencies and even environmental groups. Millions of citizens from across the political spectrum gathered week after week in large cities and small towns in defense of democracy. Although the AfD remains very popular in several eastern German states, its national support has declined by approximately 25 percent since the protest movement began.
When President Bolsonaro began to threaten democratic institutions in the run-up to the 2022 election, Brazilian civil society mobilized in a similar manner. Mr. Bolsonaro threatened the Supreme Court, attacked the legitimacy of the electoral system, and sought to dismantle Brazil's electronic voting system. This spurred business, religious and civic groups to mobilize, which produced a series of high-profile public letters in defense of democracy. In July 2022, the University of São Paulo Law School organized a letter in defense of democracy, which declared:
We know how to put aside minor differences in ... defense of the democratic order ... Regardless of individual electoral or partisan preferences, we call on Brazilians to remain vigilant in defending democracy and respecting election outcomes. In today's Brazil there is no room for authoritarian backsliding.
The letter was signed by former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, nine retired Supreme Court justices, and the heads of many of Brazil's largest banks and businesses. As one Brazilian political scientist put it, the letter "put the issue of democracy on the election agenda."
The following month, Brazil's leading business association, the São Paulo Federation of Industries, spearheaded a statement, signed by the country's Federation of Banks, its Chamber of Commerce and Academy of Sciences, the São Paulo bar association and more than 100 other organizations that defended democracy as "essential" to Brazil's future and affirmed an "unwavering commitment to the institutions and fundamental principles of the Rule of Law."
Finally, in October 2022, as Brazil headed into a second-round runoff between Mr. Bolsonaro and ex-President Lula da Silva, Catholic bishops from across Brazil published a "Letter to the People of God," which called on Catholics to reject Mr. Bolsonaro. The letter declared that "staying neutral is not an option when it comes to choosing between two visions for Brazil -- one democratic and the other authoritarian .... The Church does not have a political party, nor will it ever, but it does take a stand."
Mr. Bolsonaro narrowly lost the runoff, and his effort to overturn the election results met overwhelming public rejection.
In the United States, the civic response to the Trump threat has been tepid. For a moment, business leaders seemed poised to defend democracy. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, many leading U.S. businesses announced that they would not contribute to lawmakers who voted to decertify the results of the 2020 election.
Unfortunately, most of these companies -- including AT&T, Boeing, Comcast, G.E., General Motors, Home Depot, Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, UPS, Verizon and Walmart -- soon abandoned their pledge. Politico identified more than 100 companies and business groups that pledged to suspend or review donations to election deniers in early 2021. More than 70 of them resumed contributions to election deniers before the 2022 midterms. Overall, ProPublica found that at least 276 Fortune 500 companies have contributed to congressional election deniers.
As the 2024 election approached, many American chief executives publicly downplayed the threat posed by Mr. Trump. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, declared that "America is going to be fine ... no matter what happens in this election," while Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said his company would "survive and thrive" under either party's candidate. Mr. Dimon, who is considered influential in financial circles, has privately supported Ms. Harris but publicly declared himself undecided in the election's final weeks.
Although many individual business leaders have worked to defend democracy, leading national business associations like the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce remain on the sidelines, refusing to repudiate Mr. Trump's authoritarianism.
Many of America's religious leaders have also remained quiet. Most prominent evangelical leaders have either remained silent or endorsed Mr. Trump. To give one example, although Franklin Graham claimed to be above the partisan fray, he called on his followers to "Pray for former President Donald Trump. His enemies want to do everything they can to destroy him."
Catholic leaders have also failed to speak out. Although the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a public statement condemning the Jan. 6 insurrection, it was, in the words of the Catholic writer Thomas Reese, "remarkably silent" in the face of Mr. Trump's subsequent resurgence. In November 2023, the bishops conference issued an election-year document entitled "Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship," as it does every four years. The letter listed abortion as a "pre-eminent priority," but it did not mention the defense of democracy. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was sharply critical of the first Trump administration's immigration policies, but unlike the German bishops' response to the AfD's mass deportation plans, it has not publicly denounced Mr. Trump's own mass deportation plans.
The U.S. establishment is sleepwalking toward a crisis. An openly antidemocratic figure stands at least a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency. The Supreme Court and the Republican Party have abdicated their gatekeeping responsibilities, and too many of America's most influential political, business and religious leaders remain on the sidelines. Unable to rise above fear or narrow ambition, they hedge their bets. But time is running out.
What are they waiting for?

Full text: Germany's biggest automaker said its profit dropped 42 percent in the third quarter, as union leaders warned that workers were ready to walk out over a wage dispute.
Volkswagen reported a 42 percent drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, while emphasizing an "urgent need" to cut costs and gain efficiency in a challenging marketplace as it considers plant closures and layoffs in Germany.
The automaker's negotiator pointed to the company's weak earnings ahead of his meeting with union leaders, who warned of imminent strikes if a solution to cut costs and restructure the brand was not found.
The Volkswagen Group, which owns 10 brands, including Audi and Porsche, is Germany's largest industrial employer, with 120,000 people working for its eponymous core brand. The country's vision of itself as an economic powerhouse and automotive giant is also deeply intertwined with Volkswagen, and local economies across the country depend on the company and its well-paid workers.
Representatives from the automaker and IG Metall, the union representing most of its workers, convened for a second round of wage negotiations on Wednesday in a conference room in the Volkswagen Arena, the stadium of the company's professional soccer team, VfL Wolfsburg.
After roughly seven hours of talks, Arne Meiswinkel, the chief of personnel at Volkswagen, who is leading negotiations for the company, told reporters that the company was seeking 10 percent pay cuts and reductions in bonuses. In exchange, he floated the prospect of discussing keeping all 10 factories in Germany open.
"To achieve this financial goal, we can also imagine discussing the prospects for securing the locations and employment," Mr. Meiswinkel said.
Before the talks, Volkswagen reported that profit fell to 2.86 billion euros, or $ 3.1 billion, for the months of August to September, its lowest level in three years. The company is struggling against falling demand in China, the world's largest car market, and high costs, especially in its homeland, Germany.
Union leaders went into the round insisting that the company guarantee that all 10 of its factories in Germany remain open, or they would begin preparing for walkouts.
The union is prevented from staging any strikes until the end of November, but leaders said they would begin preparing walkouts unless their demand was met.
"We expect Volkswagen to declare its willingness to enter into negotiations with us on a viable future concept for all sites," Thorsten Gröger, chief negotiator of IG Metall union, told reporters ahead of the talks.
"Otherwise, I say quite clearly, we will have to plan the further escalation with our negotiating and bargaining committee," he said.
On Monday, the company's top employee representative said management had informed the works council that it was considering shutting down as many as three factories in Germany and laying off tens of thousands of workers. The closures would be the first in the 87-year history of the company and a further blow to Germany's stagnant economy.
Daniela Cavallo, who leads the council representing the Volkswagen's employees in Germany and took part in the negotiations, said the company's willingness to talk about avoiding factory closures was a step in the right direction, but warned that they remained far from reaching a solution.
"We are still miles apart in terms of our positions," Ms. Cavallo said.

Volkswagen May Shutter 3 Factories To Cut Costs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The auto maker's top employee representative told workers that management planned to shutter three factories in Germany to cut costs amid slumping sales.
Volkswagen could shut down as many as three factories in Germany and lay off tens of thousands of workers as it seeks to regain its edge in Europe amid slumping sales and increased competition from China, the company's top employee representative said Monday.
The closures would be the first in the 87-year history of the company, Germany's largest employer, and would be a further blow to the country's already stagnant economy.
The representative, Daniela Cavallo, who leads the council representing the company's employees in Germany, told a gathering of workers at Volkswagen's home plant in Wolfsburg that the proposed closures were part of a plan that managers had presented to the works council.
The company "wants to close at least three VW factories, downsize all remaining plants, divest itself of core areas and, on top of that, realize heavy pay cuts for the remaining employees," she said.
Volkswagen is also considering cutting the work force at the plants in Germany that would remain open, Ms. Cavallo said, adding, "In concrete terms, this means taking out even more products, volumes, shifts and entire assembly lines far beyond to what we have already done."
Volkswagen is the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche.
No other company in Germany carries the same weight as Volkswagen. Its history is intertwined with the country's economic and industrial prowess of the post-World War II era, and local economies of entire regions across the country depend on Volkswagen and its well-paid workers.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the details of the plan, saying it would do so only once the company and employee representatives had agreed to a solution. But in a statement, managers said that because of shrinking demand and growing competition, employment costs in Germany remained too high and existing structures would have to change.
"Without comprehensive measures to regain competitiveness, we will not be able to afford significant investments in the future," Gunnar Kilian, a member of the management board, said in the statement.
A spokesman for Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, suggested that "wrong management decisions" could be to blame for Volkswagen's troubles, and said workers should not have to pay the price.
"The aim now is to maintain and secure jobs," the spokesman, Wolfgang Büchner, told a regular briefing by government officials.
Mr. Scholz is under pressure to revive the flagging German economy, the largest in Europe, amid shrinking industrial output. The country is the only one of the world's seven leading economies that the International Monetary Fund is projecting will stagnate this year. The German government said this month that it expected the economy to contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from an earlier projection of 0.3 percent growth.
Volkswagen suggested last month that factory closures in Germany might be necessary for its flagship brand to remain relevant. Automobile manufacturing is Germany's most important industry, contributing 564 billion euros, or $ 610 billion, to the country's economy.
But it is also heavily dependent on exports, especially to China, where German manufacturers sold around 4.3 million cars in 2021, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry, a trade group. In recent years, however, Chinese consumers have turned to domestically produced electric vehicles, causing demand for German vehicles to fall.
Since the pandemic, the demand for cars in Europe has also dropped by roughly 500,000, as Volkswagen leaders have repeatedly pointed out. From the management's perspective, that number translates roughly to the output of two of Volkswagen's 10 plants in Germany, said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial officer.
"This is basically the magnitude of two factories," he said. "This is where we stand, and we have to look at it."
Volkswagen is also in wage negotiations with the IG Metall union, which represents most of the carmaker's workers and is seeking a 7 percent pay increase. The two sides decided to open the talks over a new pay deal several months early because of the restructuring plans.
The next round is scheduled for Wednesday, and Ms. Cavallo called on the company to present employees with a plan. Her announcement two days before the talks added to the uncertainty among workers.
"My colleagues and I, we are worried about our jobs," Britta John, a Volkswagen employee and spokeswoman for IG Metall in Braunschweig, told the German public broadcaster NDR. "The situation is really discouraging."

Michael Valentine, 74, 'One of the Great Saviors of Speed' for American Drivers: [Biography]

Full text: An engineer who loved to drive fast, he helped build an industry-altering device that made its debut after the national speed limit of 55 m.p.h. became law.
Michael Valentine, an electrical engineer, loved to drive fast in his MGB sports car. But in 1974, after a national highway speed limit of 55 miles per hour was mandated as a fuel conservation measure, he believed that a "holy war" had begun: speed-seeking drivers against police officers trying to snare them with radar guns.
"In a holy war, you can take either side and be right," he told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1981. "The problem," he said, "is that police radar is an electronic device of fallible character in the hands of ordinary human beings."
Mr. Valentine, who didn't believe that road safety was determined by finite speed limits, went into battle armed with the Escort, a radar detector that he built with Jim Jaeger, his college friend and business partner, for their company, Cincinnati Microwave.
They met with early success. In 1979, a year after the Escort's debut, Car and Driver magazine tested 12 radar detectors and ranked it the best, "by a landslide," for its ability to pick up the signals of police radar equipment.
The rave catapulted sales. In early 1981, Mr. Valentine said that Cincinnati Microwave had sold 50,000 Escorts.
He never stopped upgrading the Escort, and, after parting ways with Mr. Jaeger in 1983, he designed two generations of detectors at his own company, Valentine Research.
After Mr. Valentine's death at 74 on Sept. 16, Road & Track magazine lamented the loss of "one of the great saviors of speed."
"We all owe Michael Valentine a great thanks for his commitment to the auto enthusiast community," the magazine added. "And, probably, some of the cash we've saved on tickets, too."
Mr. Valentine's wife, Margaret (Kreutzberg) Valentine, said he died at his home in Cincinnati from an aneurysm.
Michael David Valentine was born on Oct. 28, 1949, in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up in nearby Vandalia. His father, James, was a mechanical engineer; his mother, Lillian (McPhee) Valentine, oversaw the home. Mike's father bought him a ham radio, and he got his amateur radio license at 14.
At the University of Cincinnati, where he earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1973, he met his future wife, who later became his partner at Valentine Research.
In addition to her, he is survived by his daughters, Martha Johnson and Anna Valentine; three grandchildren; and four sisters, Kathy Valentine, Cheryl Valentine, Sandra Paulsel and Nancy Lowe.
One of Mr. Valentine's first jobs was selling electronic components. He approached a few radar-detector manufacturers, including Electrolert, which made the popular Fuzzbuster radar detector, about buying a component that would enable their devices to actively seek radar signals, rather than passively receive them.
They all turned him down. Dale Smith, the founder of Electrolert, told him that the component would make the Fuzzbuster too expensive and that consumers wouldn't buy it.
"He was quite unreceptive, and that it is quite understandable," given how much money Mr. Smith was making on the Fuzzbuster, Mr. Valentine told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland in 1983.
So Mr. Valentine and Mr. Jaeger built one themselves. Car and Driver's obituary of Mr. Valentine quoted Mr. Jaeger as recalling that they had disassembled a Fuzzbuster and "were amazed at how primitive it was."
"There was almost nothing inside," he said. "Mike and I started noodling about how to build a superior, cost-no-object detector."
"We were a good team," he added, "with Mike very good at signal processing, while I was good at the radio frequency technology."
He formed Cincinnati Microwave in 1976 with his father and Mr. Jaeger.
The first Escort sold steadily until the Car and Driver review, which called it "the next best thing to buying a judge." The volume of orders ramped up so quickly that it caused a seven-month backlog in deliveries.
In 1983, a disagreement over marketing and a plan to go public, which Mr. Valentine opposed, led Mr. Jaeger to buy him out. While waiting for a five-year noncompete clause to lapse, Mr. Valentine and his wife started Valentine Research.
Mr. Valentine finally introduced the Valentine One radar detector in 1992.
"I had ideas," he told Road & Track in 2020. "I wasn't finished yet. It was like stepping off a fast-moving train. I looked at the ones going by and wanted to get back on."
Mr. Valentine made numerous upgrades to the Valentine One over three decades, including one that featured antennas for radar signals coming from ahead and behind and arrows that showed the direction of inbound police radar signals. In 2020, he introduced a new detector: the V1 Gen 2.
Mr. Valentine told Road & Track that he tested multiple prototypes of the new device on the windshield of his Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid.
Car and Driver's testing this year ranked Mr. Valentine's Generation Two the second-best overall but the top one for its detection distance. The review also called it the "most chatty" -- the detector would beep if the setting weren't activated to eliminate the alerts -- which it said could be a nuisance to some drivers, although it added that "others might appreciate the peace of mind from knowing this thing won't miss a sniff of any radar."
Mr. Valentine said he had no desire to stop improving his detectors.
"I think I was just the guy that was meant to do this," he told Road & Track in 2020, adding, "I don't know how else to say it."

L.A. Prosecutor To Seek Review For Menendezes: [National Desk]

Full text: The request from George Gascón, the Los Angeles County district attorney, could lead to Lyle and Erik Menendez being released from prison, decades after they were convicted of murdering their parents.
The Los Angeles County district attorney said on Thursday that he would request the resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who killed their parents in 1989, a step that could lead to their release from prison.
The district attorney, George Gascón, announced his decision at a news conference at the Hall of Justice in Los Angeles.
"I believe that they have paid their debt to society," he said.
Mr. Gascón, who was surrounded by members of his office and members of the Menendez family, said he would ask the court on Friday to resentence the brothers to a murder charge that comes with the possibility of parole.
It is not clear when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge will decide on the resentencing request. If a judge agrees with Mr. Gascón, the brothers would have to appear before a parole board. But the reviews by the court and the parole board could take many more weeks, and the brothers' release is far from guaranteed.
The district attorney noted that there was disagreement in his office about whether to move forward with the resentencing. He cited a recent documentary that he said "brought a tremendous amount of public attention" and requests for information.
During their first trial in the early 1990s, which was televised, the brothers said they had been sexually molested by their father and feared for their lives. At the time, their claims were met with widespread skepticism. But Mr. Gascón said that he was ultimately convinced by the prosecutors in his office reviewing the case to ask the court for reconsideration, and that he believed the molestation claims.
The brothers are currently serving sentences of life without parole in a state prison near San Diego.
Mr. Gascón said that he would ask for them to be sentenced to 50 years to life with the possibility of parole. That term would still be longer than what the brothers have already served, but they would be eligible for parole immediately under state law because they committed the crimes when they were younger than 26.
"Today is a day filled with hope for our family," Anamaria Baralt, a niece of Jose Menendez, said at the news conference. "We stand united in our hope and gratitude. Together we can make sure that Erik and Lyle can receive the justice they deserve and finally come home."
The case drew renewed attention this year after Netflix released a docudrama about it, and later a documentary in which the brothers discussed the case at length in prison interviews.
The rare request for resentencing comes at an urgent political moment for Mr. Gascón, a Democrat who is struggling to win re-election against a conservative challenger running as an independent in the left-leaning county. Mr. Gascón on Thursday deflected questions about whether his decision was politically driven, saying, "I am not going to talk about re-election."
His opponent, Nathan Hochman, said in a statement on Thursday that Mr. Gascón "has cast a cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision" by issuing it days before the Nov. 5 election.
Laurie L. Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who frequently analyzed the Menendez case for media outlets in the 1990s, said that Mr. Gascón "took the safest route: Leave it to the parole commission."
The murders grabbed the nation's attention in 1989 for their lurid nature and the wealthy milieu in which they were committed. The brothers' initial trial in the early 1990s was one of the first to be televised to a national audience, a forerunner of the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson, also in Los Angeles County.
The Menendez brothers had separate juries in their first trial, and a judge declared a mistrial after both juries had failed to reach unanimous verdicts, following weeks of deliberations. When the brothers were tried again -- this time without TV cameras present -- they were both convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Erik Menendez was 18 and his brother, Lyle, was 21 at the time of the murders.
At trial, prosecutors portrayed the brothers as unrepentant killers who murdered their parents with shotguns to get their hands on the family's assets, valued at the time at $ 14 million (about $ 32 million in today's dollars). A spending spree by the brothers in the months between the murders and their arrest, in which they bought a Porsche car, a Rolex watch and a restaurant in Princeton, N.J., was presented as evidence to support that theory.
The brothers' defense team argued that they had been sexually abused by their father, Jose Menendez, and that their mother, Kitty Menendez, knew about it. The lawyers said the brothers killed their parents because they feared for their lives. The brothers had confronted their parents about the abuse, the lawyers said, and were worried that their parents would kill them to prevent the family's secrets from becoming public.
"It's important to recognize that both men and women can be victims of sexual abuse," Mr. Gascón said this month, when he announced that his office was reviewing the case.
Mark Geragos, a lawyer for the brothers, said at that time: "If they were the Menendez sisters, they would not be in custody. We have evolved. It is time." He did not immediately offer comment in court on Thursday.
During the first trial, which ended in a mistrial in 1994, evidence was admitted supporting the brothers' contention that they had been abused. But in the second trial, the judge excluded much of that evidence -- which was dismissed at the time by some legal experts as the brothers' "abuse excuse" -- and the brothers were convicted.
"If Lyle and Erik's case were heard today, with the understanding we now have about abuse and PTSD, there is no doubt in my mind that their sentencing would have been very different," Anamaria Baralt, a cousin of the brothers, said at a recent news conference held by the family.
New evidence has come to light in recent years. A letter written by Erik Menendez months before the murders, in which he described the sexual abuse to a cousin, was brought forward by Robert Rand, a journalist who has covered the case for years and has written a book about it. In addition, a 2023 documentary series on the Peacock streaming service reported allegations that Jose, a wealthy music executive, had sexually abused Roy Rosselló, a member of the boy band Menudo.
The brothers, their legal team and their extended family believe that if the evidence and testimony about the abuse been admitted at the second trial, it would have been seen as a mitigating factor, and the brothers would have been found guilty of manslaughter rather than first-degree murder.
Nery Ynclan, one of the journalists whose reporting powered the Peacock series, "Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed," said that lawyers for years cautioned against becoming too hopeful about the brothers ever being freed.
"Today is a victory for Lyle, Erik and Roy," she said, "three men who found a way to process the pain of their horrendous childhoods by helping others deal with their traumas."
The Menendez brothers have attracted enormous support on social media, where young people who were not alive at the time of the murders have demanded their release.
Many relatives of the brothers have rallied to their side, but the family is not united. Milton Andersen, Kitty's brother, has retained a lawyer to oppose the brothers' release.
Mr. Gascón "has repeatedly disregarded the rights of Milton Andersen, a 90-year-old man who has already endured the unimaginable loss of his sister, Kitty Menendez, in a brutal double homicide," Kathy Cady, a lawyer representing Mr. Andersen, said in a statement on Thursday. "Despite numerous requests, Gascón has refused to inform Mr. Andersen of any decisions before holding press conferences. Mr. Andersen has been left in the dark."
The district attorney's resentencing petition includes several letters commending the brothers for their work in prison as hospice aides to sick inmates; for running Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and meditation groups for inmates; and for completing college courses. There are two letters in the packet from corrections officers, in favor of the resentencing and release of the brothers.
Victor H. Cortes, an official at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where the brothers are incarcerated, wrote a letter in support of Lyle Menendez that is part of the petition for resentencing.
"It is exceedingly rare to encounter an individual who, despite facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole, has dedicated himself to personal growth, the betterment of his fellow inmates, and overall stability of the prison environment," Mr. Cortes wrote.

The Endless Downfall Of a Crypto Power Couple: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was a wealthy cryptocurrency executive with a shiny white Porsche and a luxury condo in the Bahamas. She was a crypto policy expert with political ambitions, advocating for the industry in Washington.
A romance blossomed after they were brought together by an unlikely matchmaker: Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange.
Two years ago, the FTX executive Ryan Salame and the crypto advocate Michelle Bond were an industry power couple. Mr. Salame gave tens of millions of dollars to conservative politicians, who celebrated him as a "budding Republican megadonor," while Ms. Bond ran for Congress, drawing support from Donald Trump Jr.
But this tale of crypto boy meets crypto girl has turned into a legal nightmare. Mr. Salame, 31, once a top lieutenant to Mr. Bankman-Fried, is set to report to federal prison in Maryland on Friday to start a sentence of seven and a half years, after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud. In August, Ms. Bond, 45, who lives with Mr. Salame and their infant son in Potomac, Md., was also charged with campaign finance violations linked to FTX.
The two were married last month in a small ceremony in Nevada. But their $ 4 million house in Potomac, purchased in 2022 at the height of FTX's success, is set to be sold, with all the proceeds surrendered. Mr. Salame has gone from meeting with politicians to skirmishing on X with anonymous trolls. After FTX failed in late 2022, Ms. Bond resigned as the head of a prominent crypto trade group and became a target of federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same office that pursued her husband.
"Being in a relationship with me was going to be a problem," Mr. Salame said in an interview at their house in September. "It hasn't been great for her, having me in her life."
The closely linked cases against Mr. Salame and Ms. Bond show that the legal impact of FTX's implosion is still widening. The exchange fell apart after $ 8 billion in customer savings went missing -- money that Mr. Bankman-Fried was later convicted of stealing to finance venture investments, real estate purchases and political contributions. He is serving a 25-year prison sentence.
Mr. Salame was the first of Mr. Bankman-Fried's FTX colleagues to receive prison time. A second top executive, Caroline Ellison, was sentenced to two years in prison at a hearing last month, and two others are to be sentenced this fall.
Seated in his study, Mr. Salame said he was "horrifically sorry" about FTX's collapse. He has long maintained that he was unaware that Mr. Bankman-Fried was looting customer accounts.
But in the interview, Mr. Salame also said he wasn't guilty of the crimes he had admitted to committing in court -- including making campaign donations under his name that actually came from FTX's coffers. He said that lawyers at FTX had approved those donations, and that he had filed his guilty plea based on bad legal advice from the white-collar defense lawyers at the law firm Mayer Brown who represented him.
"They were more in bed with the S.D.N.Y. and the government than I think I would want," he said of his lawyers. "They're not fighters."
Mr. Salame's lawyers at Mayer Brown did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Ms. Bond, Eric Breslin, declined to comment.
A native of the Berkshires, Mr. Salame (pronounced Salem) graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a dual degree in accounting and economics. He started working for Mr. Bankman-Fried in 2019, when FTX's headquarters were in Hong Kong. Mr. Salame carved out a role as the office extrovert: He knew how to schmooze clients and would remind his perpetually unkempt boss to shower and change into fresh socks.
Mr. Salame's role at FTX put him in the same circles as Ms. Bond, who ran the Association for Digital Asset Markets, a crypto trade group. Mr. Bankman-Fried connected Ms. Bond and Mr. Salame over text to discuss a collaboration between FTX and her organization, and the pair met at a group dinner during a crypto conference in Miami in 2021.
Mr. Salame spent the evening cracking sarcastic jokes, he said. In a recent court filing, Ms. Bond said Mr. Salame had struck her as "a stereotypical young, attractive, finance-type whom I hoped I would not have to interact with much." But they met again at a crypto event in Portugal and started dating in November 2021.
The relationship became serious almost right away. That year, Mr. Salame moved to the Bahamas to help FTX open a headquarters there. Ms. Bond had been separated from her husband since 2020, and she flew down to visit Mr. Salame, bringing her two young children from that marriage. Mr. Salame said that he was attracted to her intelligence and sense of humor -- and that they had connected over their shared affection for Mr. Bankman-Fried.
At the time, Mr. Salame was becoming more politically active, pushing to "weed out anti crypto dems for pro crypto dems and anti crypto repubs for pro crypto repubs," as he put it in a text to a member of his family. As FTX grew, Mr. Salame had spent much of his growing crypto wealth on luxury purchases, like the Porsche, and invested in several restaurants in the Berkshires. With the 2022 midterm elections approaching, he also gave $ 24 million in political contributions, mostly to Republican candidates, making him one of the biggest donors in the country.
One of the Republicans he supported was Ms. Bond. In February 2022, she was preparing to run for a vacant House seat in eastern Long Island. Mr. Salame paid $ 3,000 to a consulting firm that was working with her. Ms. Bond expressed her gratitude in a text, according to court filings.
"If you're thanking me for that," Mr. Salame responded, "the expenses on you actually running going to get me so much love <3."
"You're going to get the love regardless," Ms. Bond wrote.
Around the time Ms. Bond started her campaign in May, Mr. Salame instructed an FTX colleague to create a "consulting agreement" for her -- $ 100,000 a year, plus a $ 400,000 signing bonus, according to prosecutors. When the employee asked who would oversee Ms. Bond's work for the company, Mr. Salame responded, "Me!"
Ms. Bond spent the money on her congressional campaign, the prosecutors said. She lost the Republican primary in August 2022, collecting only 27 percent of the vote.
Three months later, Mr. Salame joined Mr. Bankman-Fried in Florida for a meeting with the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Afterward Mr. Bankman-Fried flew straight back to the Bahamas, where a crisis was brewing. Within a week, FTX was bankrupt, and Mr. Salame was a target of criminal investigators. He never saw Mr. Bankman-Fried again.
According to court filings, prosecutors investigated Mr. Salame for a range of possible crimes -- distributing narcotics, bribing Bahamian officials to obtain immigration papers for FTX employees and "paying for prostitutes, including for FTX V.I.P. clients."
Ultimately, Mr. Salame pleaded guilty in September 2023 to the campaign finance violation and a separate count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. (In the interview, Mr. Salame said the other accusations were "crazy.") He was forced to forfeit the restaurants, but prosecutors allowed him to keep the Porsche -- it wasn't valuable enough to be worth seizing.
Mr. Salame's case also became a factor in Ms. Bond's divorce, according to legal papers. In court last year, her ex-husband, Daniel Bond, accused Mr. Salame of funneling "illegal campaign contributions" to Ms. Bond. In his own filing, Mr. Salame claimed that Mr. Bond had demanded more than $ 2 million in exchange for a promise that he wouldn't "write any articles/books" about Mr. Salame. (Mr. Bond declined to comment.)
Mr. Salame was sentenced in May. Prosecutors told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that Mr. Salame had withdrawn more than $ 5 million from his FTX account just as the exchange was starting to crumble.
"It was me first -- I'm getting in the lifeboat first," Judge Kaplan said as he handed down the sentence. "To heck with all those customers."
In August, the prosecutors charged Ms. Bond, saying her consulting deal with FTX was a "sham" designed to circumvent campaign finance disclosure requirements. Ms. Bond pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Salame said he couldn't discuss her case in detail. But the same month she was charged, he filed a request to void his plea agreement, claiming that he had admitted his guilt based on an "implied commitment" from prosecutors that they wouldn't pursue a case against his partner.
"It was presented to me in a way that if I played ball, Michelle was going to be fine," Mr. Salame said in the interview. (Prosecutors called that claim "outright false," and Mr. Salame eventually withdrew the request.)
Ms. Bond and Mr. Salame have tried to resurrect their lives. This summer, Ms. Bond announced that she was starting a think tank, Digital Future, to promote crypto and artificial intelligence. Mr. Salame took the law school entrance exam; he got a decent score, he said, "but it wasn't the Harvard, Yale level."
"Of the many lessons I've learned, I would have preferred a much better understanding of the law myself," Mr. Salame said. "Relying on other people didn't work out very well."
The couple's house in Potomac is cluttered with toys and books, as well as some reminders of FTX's fall. Mr. Salame owns three copies of "Going Infinite," Michael Lewis's account of the saga, and he still uses a cup emblazoned with the FTX logo.
He is apparently unable to stop talking about the company. He has posted hundreds of times on X since his sentencing, airing old grievances. At times, he has defended Mr. Bankman-Fried and attacked Ms. Ellison, who was the FTX founder's on-and-off girlfriend.
"If some crazy woman becomes obsessed with you and then destroys your company that's 100% your fault?" he wrote this month.
Mr. Salame is also reckoning with the prospect of irrelevance. He wrote a memoir of his FTX career, titled "Go Directly to Jail," but initial interest from publishers has dried up. In July, he visited Nashville during the annual Bitcoin conference, where Ms. Bond was promoting her think tank.
Mr. Salame is widely reviled in the crypto world. But no one in Nashville even bothered to heckle him.
"I didn't see anyone that seemed to care," he said.

Full text: A grenade-shaped toy with the Bitcoin logo, at Ryan Salame’s home in Potomac, Md., Sept. 6, 2024. (Caroline Gutman/The New York Times) POTOMAC, Md. — He was a wealthy cryptocurrency executive with a shiny white Porsche and a luxury condo in the Bahamas. She was a crypto policy expert with political ambitions, advocating for the industry in Washington.

Volkswagen's Troubles Reflect Wider Issues in German Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Germany's largest automaker rode a wave of strong sales for years, but lagging demand and pressure from China are forcing it to consider layoffs.
No industry is more important to the German economy than automobiles. And no carmaker is more important than Volkswagen.
Now, as the 87-year-old automaker is floating the prospect of job cuts and factory closures as it seeks to return to profitability, Volkswagen's struggles are being reflected in the overall troubles facing the country, which is grappling with a shrinking industrial sector and an economy that is forecast to contract for a second consecutive year.
"The fact that Volkswagen, Germany's largest car manufacturer, largest industrial employer and the world's No. 2 behind Japanese carmaker Toyota, is no longer ruling out plant closures and compulsory redundancies shows how deep the German industry is now in crisis," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany.
The issues dragging on profitability at Volkswagen's core brand -- high-priced labor, cumbersome organizational structures and an inability to keep up with advances by Chinese automakers -- mirror those facing Germany's overall economy.
On Monday, the German government said the economy would contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from a previous projection of 0.3 percent growth. Dragging output down is the industrial sector, which has failed to recover from the shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Germany also appears to have lost some clout in the European Union, which voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, a key trading partner of Germany.
Some economists trace the root of the problems, both at Volkswagen and in Germany as a whole, to a missed opportunity to invest in the future during what many call the "golden decade," when the country's output expanded 14 percent after the global economic downturn of 2008.
"The German economy did really well, and so did Volkswagen," said Jens Südekum, an economist at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf.
In those years, Volkswagen exported cars with combustion engines across Europe and to China, becoming the largest automaker in the world by sales in 2016. It held that position until 2019, despite a scandal over illegal cheating on emissions tests in Europe and United States, which cost the company more than 31 billion euros, or $ 34.6 billion.
The German government racked up budget surpluses from 2014 to 2019. Interest rates were negative, and Germany could have borrowed to invest in public infrastructure, digitization and the transformation to a green economy. Instead, it passed a law enshrining a balanced budget into its Constitution, a move that continues to limit investment.
"In a sense, Germany was too successful and people become complacent, thinking that success would just go on forever," Mr. Südekum said. "And now we know that's just not the case."
The same could be said of Volkswagen, which has sold millions of gas-powered cars in China since the 1990s. But it failed to take seriously the threat posed by Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and Nio, which focused on developing fully electric and hybrid cars and building a supply chain to support them.
The lack of foresight vexed IG Metall, which represents 120,000 Volkswagen workers in Germany. The union has raised mismanagement claims against Volkswagen's leaders, who have scrambled to invest billions in recent years to shift production at German plants to electric vehicles.
Thousands of workers at Volkswagen staged a rally last month ahead of the first round of wage talks with company leaders. The workers blew whistles and banged on drums, vowing to defend the 120,000 jobs at six factories in Germany and demanding a wage increase of 7 percent.
"Cutbacks are not a future concept," Thorsten Gröger, a lead negotiator for IG Metall, told the crowd, which had gathered in the courtyard of the summer palace of the House of Hanover, a former royal dynasty. He called for the automaker to reduce bureaucracy and complexity and develop a strategy for the survival.
But company representatives point to the generous benefits enjoyed by Volkswagen's workers, including the possibility for up to 36 vacation days -- six more than the industry standard.
"We must reduce our labor costs in Germany," Arne Meiswinkel, the human resources chief at Volkswagen and lead negotiator for the company, said as talks started. "We can only maintain our top position and safeguard jobs in the long term if we work more economically."
Workers are pushing back, saying that while they are being asked to make concessions, Volkswagen in the past year has paid out €4.5 billion in dividends. The automaker also said this year that it would invest up to €5 billion in Rivian, a U.S. maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit.
"Try explaining that to the workers here," said Stefan Henze, a union representative from Volkswagen's software division, Cariad. "It doesn't add up."
The Volkswagen Group, which owns 10 brands, including Porsche and Audi, is in a stronger position than its flagship brand, which reported a 5 percent drop in its profit margin in the first six months of 2024.
German media have reported that as many as 30,000 jobs could be lost -- a number that the company has so far declined to confirm. Such a move would not be without precedent. The company let more than 37,000 employees go from 1971 and 1975, a move that it credits with turning around profitability at the time.
Workers have vowed to take their fight to the streets as soon as a mandatory peace period surrounding the start of talks expires, which could happen by the end of November at the latest.
"Talking has never saved any jobs," a programmer from a Volkswagen factory that produces electric motors, who gave her name only as Anne-Marie, said at the rally in Hanover.
German politicians have weighed whether they should intervene to help shore up Volkswagen, especially in the face of the economic slowdown the country is facing. The automobile industry provides work for 773,000 people, not including jobs at hundreds of smaller companies and suppliers.
One of the largest suppliers, ZF, announced this year that it would cut up to 14,000 jobs within four years, citing a drop in demand for electric vehicles among the reasons.
Last year, the German government abruptly stopped a subsidy to encourage the sale of electric cars, causing many customers to pull back. The move not only hurt demand, but it also caused customers to question Europe's overall ambition to ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines by 2035.
In recent weeks, some politicians in Germany have called for the ban to be lifted, or at least extended, a move that economists say creates further confusion for consumers.
At the same time, the European Union is readying to increase tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, with the aim of leveling the playing field for European automakers, which they argue have not benefited from the amount of state subsidies that their Chinese counterparts receive.
But Volkswagen, which is heavily invested in China, and the German government oppose the levies, which they fear could lead to retaliation from China.
Economists also warn that duties risk further harming growth when European companies like Volkswagen need to be able to be fast and flexible if they are to remain competitive.
"There should just be an eye toward less regulation and more allowing firms to be more nimble and encouraging further investment," said Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University who grew up in Hanover and studies the Germany economy.

Volkswagen, Looking to Cut Jobs, Is Planning to End Labor Agreement: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A week after the automaker announced it was considering closing factories in Germany, the company said it was exiting a labor contract that protected workers from layoffs.
Volkswagen told union leaders on Tuesday that it was ending a labor agreement that protected workers from layoffs, a week after the automaker said it was considering closing factories in Germany amid slumping sales and rising costs.
The company warned last week that it needed to restructure its namesake brand to remain competitive in the face of falling demand in Europe and abroad and increased competition from China. The cost-saving measures could include closing one or two assembly plants in Germany, a step that would be a first in the auto manufacturer's 87-year history.
On Tuesday, Volkswagen said in a statement that the decision to quit the agreement that offered job security to some 120,000 workers, along with several other labor deals, was necessary to ensure the company's future.
"We must put Volkswagen in a position to reduce costs in Germany to a competitive level in order to invest in new technologies and new products from our own resources," Gunnar Kilian, the head of human resources and labor at Volkswagen, said in the statement.
The job-security agreement between Volkswagen and the union, IG Metall, which represents workers in the automotive and other heavy industries, has existed since 1994. It had provided protection from layoffs through 2029, but the company would be able to severe it with three months' notice.
The agreement will remain in effect until the end of the year, and through guarantees provided by other labor agreements, layoffs could begin only by June 2025, Volkswagen said.
Daniela Cavallo, who leads the works council at Volkswagen and is a member of IG Metall, vowed that the union would fight to defend the labor agreement. "We will put up a fierce resistance to this historic attack on our jobs," Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. "With us, there will be no layoffs."
Volkswagen is seeking to save 10 billion euros by 2026 to reach its earnings target of 6.5 percent. But it is losing out to electric vehicle manufacturers in China and increasingly feeling the pressure at home as those automakers expand in Europe.
New companies, many of them Chinese, have taken a 6 percent bite out of the market in Western Europe in the past four years, "leading to a smaller pie with a battle royale situation for market share," Matthias Schmidt, an auto analyst in Berlin, wrote in a note.
Volkswagen said it was also ending other labor agreements, including one that obligated it to offer permanent positions to all vocational trainees and apprentices at the company, as well as a deal that offered temporary employees wages above the standard rate in the automotive industry.
The decision to quit the various agreements reflects how dire things are for Volkswagen, which has spent decades of building its brand around the image of superior quality linked to German engineering, said Helena Wisbert, a professor of automobile economics and director of the Center Automotive Research in Duisburg.
"Volkswagen operates in a very price-sensitive market, but has so far been able to charge a premium for its higher production costs in Germany as a 'Made in Germany' markup, since Volkswagen has always been associated with quality," Ms. Wisbert said. "This calculation no longer works because the markets are not developing as expected and competition has increased significantly."
Volkswagen and the union are expected to begin negotiations on a new wage deal this fall. The union is seeking a 7 percent pay increase, along with additional demands including averting plant closures.
But ending the job protection deal means that unless the two sides can reach a new agreement, employees hired before 2005 will be eligible for wages and benefits that applied 20 years ago, which the union estimates could run into the "millions" of dollars.
Such a situation would hurt the company's efforts to return to profitability, meaning that layoffs "could not be ruled out," Volkswagen said in a statement.
The Volkswagen Group employs some 650,000 people around the globe and owns 10 brands, include Porsche and Audi. Last week, the company informed union leaders at a plant in Brussels that it had no plans to continue production of its Q8 model there beyond 2025. If the company decides not to produce a new model at the plant, it will close and 3,000 jobs will be lost.

Lloyd Ziff, 81, Visionary Magazine Art Director and Photographer, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He designed some of the most visually exciting magazines of the 1970s and '80s. But his real love, and eventually his focus, was photography.
Lloyd Ziff was not yet a celebrated art director in 1968 when he photographed an art school classmate, Robert Mapplethorpe, and his girlfriend, Patti Smith, in their tiny Brooklyn apartment. "I found them very beautiful," Mr. Ziff said years later.
The black-and-white portraits he took are tender and moving, almost heartbreakingly so; as James Danziger, the gallerist who showed them in 2013, said recently: "Youth is moving. They capture a moment in time just before Patti and Robert were going to explode. They both carried an aura, and Lloyd was drawn to that. They wanted to be photographed just as much as he wanted to photograph them."
Mr. Ziff went on to serve as an art director for some of the most influential and visually arresting magazines of the 1970s and '80s, including Rolling Stone, House & Garden, Vanity Fair and Condé Nast Traveler. Mr. Mapplethorpe and Ms. Smith, of course, would find their own fame, and tragedy, when Mr. Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in 1989. When Ms. Smith wrote of their coming-of-age in her 2010 memoir, "Just Kids," she included a few of Mr. Ziff's portraits.
"Although we weren't particularly close," Mr. Ziff said, "I believe we recognized in each other something we probably couldn't put into words at the time."
Mr. Ziff died at 81 on Aug. 1 at his home in Orient Point, N.Y., on Long Island's North Fork, his husband, Stephen Kelemen, said. He said Mr. Ziff had been in declining health.
Mr. Ziff spent the 1970s in California, between San Francisco, where he worked for Rolling Stone, and Los Angeles, where he had grown up and where he worked at Playgirl magazine and helped launch New West, New York magazine's West Coast sister publication, in 1976. New West's first cover sported a caricature of Gov. Jerry Brown by Robert Grossman, but Mr. Ziff's real love was photography, and he brought a photographer's eye to his art direction.
"There was nothing he liked more than a big, beautiful graphic photograph," said Richard Pandiscio, the longtime creative director of Interview magazine and other publications, "that one arresting picture that pulled you in."
He was always taking photographs, Annie Leibovitz, whom he met at Rolling Stone, said in an interview, "and we just connected."
"We would have endless discussions about photography and how big it was and how important it was," she added. "We would show each other our work all the time.
"I was inspired by him," she said. "We would just get in the car and go places. I remember once I was staying with him in his house in Laurel Canyon, and there was this mad flood -- it was raining insanely -- and we jumped in his Porsche and started taking pictures."
Mr. Ziff loved cars, particularly his black Porsche 914, and car culture. He also loved magazines, as Ms. Leibovitz did, and together they would haunt the Los Feliz Newsstand, now closed, in East Hollywood, driving there in the middle of the night to leaf through the new titles coming out of New York and Europe.
"We had no money, so we couldn't buy anything," Ms. Leibovitz said. "We'd just stay for hours looking at all this great work by Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin."
Mr. Ziff spent the 1970s adventuring with Los Angeles's outsize characters. Like most of his friends, he dated Eve Babitz, whose witty, lush prose chronicled the shenanigans of the era. (She died in 2021.) He lived for a time with the British-born decorator Paul Fortune in his Laurel Canyon showplace. When Mr. Ziff, along with Ms. Leibovitz; Susan Doukas, an aspiring actress; and the photographer Paul Ruscha, took a road trip to Joshua Tree National Park and dropped acid, Ms. Leibovitz photographed Mr. Ziff and Ms. Doukas in a dry gully, with their long shadows and hers, stretched out on the desert behind them.
By the end of the decade, Mr. Ziff had moved to New York, where he worked for The New York Times Magazine and then House & Garden, a Condé Nast publication that he helped transform from a crafty D.I.Y. service magazine into an elegant portfolio of luxurious interiors with essays by literary lions like Elizabeth Hardwick and Rosamond Bernier.
Within a few months, however, Condé Nast reassigned him to Vanity Fair, which had begun as a fizzy flapper-era title but had last published in 1936. Condé Nast was reviving it 47 years later in a $ 10 million makeover overseen by Bea Feitler, the Brazilian-born designer who had worked on Harper's Bazaar and Ms. magazine.
Ms. Feitler was a hero of Mr. Ziff's, and when she died of cancer at 44 just before Vanity Fair's relaunch, he was brought in to take over. One of his first covers, for the June 1983 issue, was emblematic of all his work: There were no words (besides the magazine's name), only a portrait of David Hockney's feet, taken by the artist himself, in his canvas sneakers and mismatched socks, one yellow and one red.
"Mr. Ziff, known for a style that combines intellectual flash with a dynamic color sense," The New York Times wrote in 1982 when his appointment was announced, "may have just the right kind of razzle to give the new Vanity Fair a bit of dazzle."
Before Ms. Feitler died, she left a list of five photographers she had wanted to use in Vanity Fair. One of them was Sheila Metzner, who was a fine arts photographer at the time and not yet doing commercial work. Mr. Ziff was captivated by her, as Ms. Feitler had been, and sent her to photograph Jeanne Moreau. Her painterly portrait of the French actress caught the attention of Alexander Liberman, Condé Nast's creative director, who then brought her to Vogue.
"We always say that Lloyd discovered me," Ms. Metzner said, "because through all that I became a Vogue photographer."
And like most of Mr. Ziff's photographers, she also became a lifelong friend. They loved him for his sunny personality, but also because he let them have their heads. He trusted them to bring back something marvelous.
He sent Ms. Metzner all over the world for Condé Nast Traveler, where he was the art director and Harold Evans, the veteran British newspaper editor, was the founding editor, which made its debut in 1987. He did the same with Brigitte Lacombe, the French photographer known for her classic portraits of actors and directors.
"Lloyd was absolutely exceptional because he wanted you to do what you did," Ms. Lacombe said in an interview. "He didn't impose his own ideas. He wanted to excel, and he wanted you to excel, too."
Lloyd Ziff was born on Sept. 27, 1942, in Detroit, the only child of Frances (Maimes) Ziff and Max Ziff, an upholsterer. Lloyd's father died when Lloyd was 5, and he and his mother moved to Los Angeles. He graduated from Beverly Hills High School and in 1967 earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
His first job was in the design department of McCall's magazine. He stayed there for about a year before moving to CBS Records, where he designed album covers; he was nominated for a Grammy for the 1972 reissue "Bessie Smith: The Empress."
In addition to his husband, an artist whom he met in 1979 and married in 2008, Mr. Ziff is survived by his stepchildren, Pond and Chandra Kelemen, and four grandchildren.
Among the many magazines Mr. Ziff worked at or developed in the 1990s were Travel & Leisure and Joe, a quirky but short-lived general-interest title started by Starbucks and backed by Time Inc.
In 1999, Mr. Ziff had a heart attack and quit art direction to focus on his photography. His work is in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, among other institutions.
He used a 35-millimeter Leica and, like Henri Cartier-Bresson, had a knack for capturing the "decisive moment." His Los Angeles and New York City streetscapes are love stories to each city's architecture and street life. His work grew more intimate as he grew older and turned his camera on his family and friends.
Mr. Ruscha said he once asked Mr. Ziff why he stayed so long in magazines. "'Oh,' he said, 'I'm only in it for my friends, so I can give them work."'

Ziff did the same with Brigitte Lacombe, a French photographer known for her classic portraits of actors and directors.
“Lloyd was absolutely exceptional because he wanted you to do what you did,” Lacombe said in an interview. “He didn’t impose his own ideas. He wanted to excel and he wanted you to excel, too.”
Lloyd Ziff was born Sept. 27, 1942, in Detroit, the only child of Frances (Maimes) Ziff and Max Ziff, an upholsterer. Lloyd’s father died when Lloyd was 5, and he and his mother moved to Los Angeles. Lloyd graduated from Beverly Hills High School, and in 1967 earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.
His first job was in the design department of McCall’s magazine. He stayed there for about a year before moving to CBS Records, where he designed album covers; he was nominated for a Grammy for the 1972 reissue “Bessie Smith: The Empress.”
In addition to his husband, an artist whom he met in 1979 and married in 2008, Ziff is survived by his stepchildren, Pond and Chandra Kelemen, and four grandchildren.
Among the many magazines Ziff worked at or developed in the 1990s were Travel & Leisure and Joe, a quirky but short-lived general-interest title started by Starbucks and backed by Time Inc.
In 1999, Ziff had a heart attack and quit art direction to focus on his photography. His work is in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the International Center of Photography in New York City, among other institutions.
He used a 35 mm Leica, and, like Henri Cartier-Bresson, had a knack for capturing the “decisive moment.” His Los Angeles and New York City streetscapes are love stories to each city’s architecture and street life. His work grew more intimate as he grew older and turned his camera on his family and friends.
Ruscha said he once asked Ziff why he stayed so long in magazines. “‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I’m only in it for my friends, so I can give them work.’”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 5 p.m. on Feb. 25, 2020, Bob Chapek and Bob Iger settled into matching directors' chairs on the Disney studio lot for a series of live media interviews. The company had just shocked pretty much everybody by announcing that the little-known Mr. Chapek would be replacing the wildly popular Mr. Iger as chief executive.
The bald and stocky Mr. Chapek and the graying but still debonair Mr. Iger struck an immediate contrast, even though both were dressed in navy suits and open-collar white shirts and both were named Bob. To avoid confusion, some referred to them as "Bob One" and "Bob Two," or "Big Bob" and "Little Bob" (even though Mr. Chapek was taller and heavier). And then there was "Handsome Bob" and "Boring Bob."
In an interview with Julia Boorstin of CNBC, Mr. Chapek fawned over his predecessor. "I obviously have huge shoes to fill," he said with wide eyes, hailing Mr. Iger's "magic" running Disney. Mr. Iger's 15-year tenure as chief executive had been so successful that he had considered running for president as a Democrat. Queen Elizabeth II knighted him just before she died.
Mr. Iger said he and Mr. Chapek had worked together "extremely well," but in the next breath qualified that praise: "Actually, our senior management team has worked together quite well."
Mr. Chapek listened in vain for something more effusive, more personal.
As the questions -- and the attention -- shifted entirely to Mr. Chapek, Mr. Iger's usually relaxed demeanor stiffened. His gaze shifted down, away from Mr. Chapek, and he looked increasingly uncomfortable. He crossed his arms.
Mr. Chapek was intimately familiar with Mr. Iger's body language and expressions. "This is not good," he thought.
He was right about that. But little did he realize that he and Mr. Iger were about to face off in an epic corporate power struggle with few rivals in business history.
When Mr. Iger stepped down as chief executive -- abruptly, just weeks before the coronavirus pandemic plunged Disney into the worst crisis in its history -- the company's board agreed that he could stay on as "creative director" and executive chairman of the board for another two years.
That agreement nearly fell apart over the issue of whom, exactly, Mr. Chapek would answer to: Mr. Iger or the board. A last-minute compromise, reached without a board vote, had Mr. Chapek reporting to both. That proved a recipe for conflict -- as Mr. Chapek soon began to realize.
Just weeks into his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Chapek expressed frustration. "I can't survive another two years of this," Mr. Chapek told Arthur Bochner, his chief of staff. Mr. Iger is "not going to leave. He'll be here until he dies."
Mr. Bochner worried that Mr. Chapek would quit. Mr. Chapek was ultimately deprived of even that option. The board fired him just before Thanksgiving in 2022.
As he had feared, his successor was Mr. Iger.
The New York Times has pieced together what happened inside Disney during those fateful months by talking to scores of people directly involved. Many of them talked extensively for the first time about what transpired, some only on the condition of anonymity because of their nondisclosure agreements with Disney. In each instance in which a past conversation is reconstructed in this article, the spoken words have been confirmed by multiple people with knowledge of the conversations.
Those conversations reveal how Disney's board and executive ranks were consumed by conflict and drama just as the company was facing historic upheaval in the entertainment industry. When the pandemic hit, right as Mr. Chapek took over, the company had to temporarily close its highly profitable theme parks. In spring 2022, the streaming bubble burst, causing investors to flee all media stocks, including Disney's.
But inside Disney, much of the focus was on trying to manage the tensions between Mr. Iger and Mr. Chapek.
Those problems have renewed importance now, as Disney embarks on yet another quest to find someone to succeed Mr. Iger, whose contract ends on Dec. 31, 2026.
The 'Snake Pit'
For a company that bills its theme parks as the "Happiest Place on Earth," Disney's corporate headquarters have long been anything but -- a hotbed of intrigue and power struggles. Mr. Chapek's former chief of staff told people the company's sixth-floor executive suite was a "snake pit."
Mr. Iger ascended almost two decades ago, after a power struggle between Michael Eisner, a long-serving chief executive, and Roy E. Disney, Walt Disney's nephew and a Disney board member. By that time, Mr. Eisner had already elevated and then dispatched two handpicked successors, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who became a co-founder of DreamWorks, and Michael Ovitz, once the most powerful agent in Hollywood.
Mr. Iger, who started his career as a weatherman on a cable channel in upstate New York, had vowed to never follow in Mr. Eisner's footsteps. To friends, he mocked Mr. Eisner's fears about leaving Disney -- that his calls to power brokers would go unreturned, and that he wouldn't be able to get reservations at top restaurants. He told Mr. Chapek and others that he would never stay more than 10 years.
Mr. Iger seemed well on his way to honoring that pledge. Once, while Mr. Chapek was running Disney's consumer products division, Mr. Iger paid a rare unscheduled visit to Mr. Chapek at his office several miles from corporate headquarters. Mr. Iger asked whether Mr. Chapek thought Jay Rasulo or Tom Staggs, two top lieutenants, should succeed him as chief executive.
"Do you want my honest answer?" Mr. Chapek replied. "Neither."
"That's what I thought you'd say," Mr. Iger said, according to Mr. Chapek, and then proceeded to list their respective faults.
It was Mr. Chapek's first inkling that he might be Mr. Iger's actual choice as successor.
But his hopes were dashed when, in February 2015, Mr. Iger named Mr. Staggs, then the theme park chairman, as chief operating officer and presumptive heir. Around the same time, the board extended Mr. Iger's contract two years, to 2018, with the expectation that Mr. Iger would spend much of that time grooming Mr. Staggs as his successor.
But Mr. Iger soured on him. He complained that Shanghai Disneyland, Mr. Staggs's project, was behind schedule and over budget. Mr. Iger pushed out Mr. Staggs in April 2016.
Mr. Chapek was back in the running.
He had started at Disney in 1993 in the VHS tape department, eventually rising to oversee all movie distribution. In 2011, he took over Disney's consumer products division, which soon became flush with "Frozen" merchandise sales. By 2015, Mr. Chapek had been promoted to run theme parks, overseeing at least $ 24 billion in capital investments, including new "Star Wars," "Avengers" and "Toy Story" rides.
Mr. Chapek was the consummate company man, loyal to Mr. Iger to the point of obsequiousness. Alone among Disney senior managers, he routinely called Mr. Iger "Boss" rather than "Bob," which Mr. Iger found endearing.
At the same time, Mr. Chapek lacked Mr. Iger's charisma and wasn't a natural communicator; even Mr. Chapek acknowledged that he had low "E.Q.," or emotional intelligence. Mr. Iger urged him to work on his bedside manner.
Mr. Iger told Mr. Chapek to schedule a series of one-on-one meetings with Disney's directors to build a rapport and lay out his vision for the company's future. But in late 2017, Disney reached a deal to buy the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Iger received a big bonus for consummating the deal -- stock awards of up to $ 142 million at the then-current share price -- and the board extended his contract for a sixth time. He would now retire at the end of 2021.
Mr. Chapek canceled his plans to meet directors.
Is There Life After Disney?
A Disney chief executive is an instant celebrity. He (they've all been men) presides over what are perceived as some of the most powerful and glamorous businesses in the world: the Marvel, Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm and 20th Century movie studios; the ABC broadcast network and news division; cable channels like ESPN, FX and National Geographic. Its 12 theme parks attracted a combined 142 million visitors in 2023. And even by chief executive standards, the pay is enormous. Forbes estimates Mr. Iger's net worth at over $ 700 million.
With a yacht, corporate jet, power and influence, Mr. Iger and his wife, Willow Bay, a former television anchor and the current dean of the University of Southern California's journalism school, hobnobbed with a rarefied crowd: Barack and Michelle Obama, Jeff Bezos, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey, to name just a few.
Once in the job, Mr. Iger wondered, as did Mr. Eisner before him: If stripped of his power and multimillion-dollar compensation at Disney, would his allure diminish? For several years, the license plate holder on Mr. Iger's silver Porsche posed the question, "Is there life after Disney?"
There were aspects of the job that Mr. Iger didn't especially enjoy, like earnings presentations and being grilled by Wall Street analysts. He had grown tired of budget meetings.
He often complained to Mr. Chapek (and board members) about his compensation. It was a frequent source of tension between him and Susan Arnold, who sat on the compensation committee for many years. Mr. Iger pointed repeatedly to Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, who was paid more than him even though CBS was much smaller and less complex. In 2017, Mr. Moonves made $ 69.3 million, Mr. Iger $ 36.3 million, barely half that. One Disney director called it "Moonves envy." In 2018, shareholders rejected Mr. Iger's compensation in a nonbinding vote; Disney won approval in 2019 only after Mr. Iger agreed to a smaller package.
Mr. Iger also pondered a conversation he'd had with Steve Jobs shortly before the Apple co-founder died in 2011. Mr. Jobs had urged Mr. Iger not to stay so long at Disney that he ended up depriving himself of some of the great things life had to offer.
When the company's board met in December 2019, Mr. Iger broached the idea of stepping back -- but not leaving entirely. "Why don't we accelerate the process?" Mr. Iger suggested. Mr. Chapek was his choice to succeed him. Mr. Iger told the board that Mr. Chapek knew the brand well, respected it and would do no harm. He also said Mr. Chapek had great integrity.
One of Disney's directors, Mark Parker, had recently decided to step down as chief executive of Nike and become executive chairman. Mr. Iger pitched doing the same thing. That model would allow him to stay at Disney for the remainder of his contract doing what he liked best, overseeing the company's creative endeavors. Mr. Chapek would become the C.E.O. and handle everything else. A crucial element was that all the division leaders would report to Mr. Chapek, but Mr. Chapek would report to Mr. Iger, leaving Mr. Iger ultimately in charge. There was an obvious financial incentive as well: Mr. Iger still had more than $ 100 million in unvested stock options and his leadership could help protect its value.
Safra Catz, the chief executive of Oracle and a Disney board member, pushed back. Why make Mr. Chapek chief executive rather than chief operating officer?
Mr. Iger said he didn't want a rerun of the situation with Mr. Staggs, in which people thought Mr. Staggs was merely auditioning for the top job and they could outmaneuver him by going to Mr. Iger.
But in a rare show of resistance, the board was unpersuaded. It agreed to consider the issue over the holidays.
By the time board members met in late January 2020, in Los Angeles, they had come around. Mr. Iger told Mr. Chapek the good news immediately afterward, saying an announcement would be made in just three weeks on Feb. 25.
Why the rush? Zenia Mucha, Disney's chief communications officer and a close adviser to Mr. Iger, counseled delay; she disagreed with the entire plan, including the selection of Mr. Chapek. But Mr. Iger was adamant.
By mid-February, the coronavirus was spreading widely, and the pressure it could put on the company was becoming clear. Mr. Iger had received a detailed briefing in New York from the ABC News team covering the story. Disney's theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong had already closed.
David Jefferson, a Disney spokesman, said the pandemic had nothing to do with the timing of the leadership change. Board members agree but, when pressed, offer no explanation for the haste other than that was what Mr. Iger wanted.
'Don't Step on His Toes'
When Mr. Chapek shared the good news of his promotion with his wife, Cindy, she was skeptical. "We've heard that before," she told him. But the board's lead independent director, Ms. Arnold, flew from her home in Oregon to meet with Mr. Chapek in the Rotunda, as Disney's executive dining room is known. There, she confirmed that he was the board's unanimous choice to succeed Mr. Iger as C.E.O. "This is happening," Ms. Arnold assured him.
Mr. Chapek was told there was no time for him to meet with other directors. While they had met with Mr. Chapek in his previous roles, the idea that there was no time or no need to interview him to assess his capacity to serve as chief executive, not to mention explore his vision for the future of a company in the midst of profound change, seems inexplicable.
Ms. Arnold recognized that the unusual arrangement, in which Mr. Iger would be staying on as executive chairman and chief creative officer, posed a potential for conflict. She urged Mr. Chapek to show him deference. "Give him a wide berth" on creative matters, she advised. "Don't step on his toes."
Notably, Mr. Chapek would not be joining Disney's board, which was unusual, given that nearly all chief executives also serve as board members, in many instances as chair. But the board wanted a probation period for Mr. Chapek, and wanted to emphasize that he would be reporting to Mr. Iger. It would be awkward if Mr. Chapek were also a member of the board responsible for Mr. Iger's oversight.
In the days before the announcement Mr. Iger told just a handful of top executives, among them Christine McCarthy, the chief financial officer. Like almost everyone who learned the news, she was taken aback. While pledging to help Mr. Chapek succeed, she pointed out some of his weaknesses: He knew next to nothing about the television business, he didn't know anything about sports programming, he didn't have many relationships with Hollywood talent, he hadn't dealt with Wall Street.
Mr. Iger agreed that Mr. Chapek didn't come across as especially creative. But Mr. Iger had faced the same criticism when he was named president of ABC Entertainment in 1989.
"I think he can do it," Mr. Iger insisted. "And I'll still be around."
A Last-Minute Hitch
On Feb. 24, the eve of Mr. Chapek's announcement, the succession plan nearly fell apart.
Alan Braverman, Disney's long-serving general counsel, called Mr. Iger to say that under the company's bylaws, the chief executive had to report to the board -- not to Mr. Iger. For Mr. Iger, that was a nonstarter. He wanted to retain ultimate control.
It was Mr. Braverman and Ms. Mucha who came up with a hastily conceived compromise: Mr. Chapek would report to both the board and Mr. Iger.
That was OK with Mr. Iger since, from his perspective, Mr. Chapek still reported to him. Mr. Iger insisted that the announcement be made the next morning as scheduled -- even though board members hadn't discussed as a group, let alone approved, the new dual reporting arrangement.
No one told Mr. Chapek about the change to the reporting structure. But Mr. Chapek wasn't very concerned about it, because Mr. Iger had always been such a strong supporter of his.
In another sign that Mr. Iger intended to maintain a visible presence, he decided to stay in the office that both he and Mr. Eisner had occupied as chief executives. Mr. Chapek was relegated to smaller quarters nearby. The arrangement only added to internal confusion about Mr. Chapek's new status.
Some board members weren't thrilled with the office decision or the dual reporting change. But, as it had in so many instances, the board went along with what Mr. Iger wanted.
Mr. Chapek and Mr. Iger faced the cameras as planned the next day. The company's announcement said the change was "effective immediately."
The sudden move shocked and baffled Hollywood. Paul McCartney, a close friend of Mr. Iger's, called him to ask if he was sick.
Iger's 'Lap Dog'
About two weeks later, on March 11, Mr. Chapek was scheduled to make his formal debut as chief executive at Disney's annual shareholder meeting. Mr. Chapek was nervous, all the more so because public speaking had never been his strength.
Before the meeting, Disney's investor relations personnel assembled thick briefing binders covering every conceivable data point and question that might arise. Armed with these binders, Mr. Iger and Mr. Chapek settled into the front compartment of the Disney Gulfstream jet for the four-and-a-half-hour flight to Raleigh, N.C., the site of that year's meeting, for what Mr. Chapek expected would be an extended preparation session.
Several passengers, including Mr. Chapek, recalled that Mr. Iger pulled out his iPad and started flipping through recent photographs, telling the stories behind them. There were photos of himself with Mr. McCartney and recent dinner guests in New York. Mr. Chapek said he tried to steer the discussion back to the annual meeting, but Mr. Iger interrupted: "Did you see my new yacht design?"
Flustered by Mr. Iger's digressions, Mr. Chapek got up and moved to the plane's rear compartment.
(Others on the flight said Mr. Chapek immediately went to the back of the plane and didn't recall his having any iPad chitchat with Mr. Iger.)
Mr. Chapek's extended absence was noted in the front cabin. "Does Bob want to get briefed or not?" Mr. Iger asked his fellow passengers, Ms. McCarthy, Ms. Mucha and Mr. Braverman. Finally, Mr. Iger stood up and went to find Mr. Chapek.
"Bob, do you want to sit with us so we can brief you?" Mr. Iger asked.
"Isn't it all in here?" Mr. Chapek replied, holding up the binder. Mr. Iger said the book couldn't convey the nuances. But Mr. Chapek said he'd review the book and let him know if he had any questions. He went back to his reading.
"He doesn't want to be prepped. He says the book is enough," an incredulous Mr. Iger told his fellow passengers when he returned to the front compartment. Mr. Iger suddenly felt as if he were at the wedding altar with the bride walking down the aisle. He realized he'd made a terrible mistake. But it was too late.
On the way back to California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called Mr. Iger before announcing that he would restrict public gatherings in California because of Covid. But he thought Disneyland might stay open. The governor didn't want people to panic -- and he feared they might if Disneyland closed.
Mr. Iger argued to Mr. Newsom that keeping the theme park open was a bad idea, given the health risks to both guests and employees. Mr. Newsom later publicly praised Mr. Iger's advice and cooperation.
Mr. Chapek didn't disagree with the decision to close the parks, but he was furious that Mr. Iger had excluded him. The decision had nothing to do with Mr. Iger's creative mandate.
Disney's executives worried about the shock that the park closures would have on the company's cash flow. Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Chapek made the decision to quickly furlough, albeit with health benefits, more than 90,000 employees at the theme parks.
But Mr. Iger overruled them. He decided to wait until the government passed a Covid relief bill.
Two months earlier, when Mr. Chapek and Mr. Iger had appeared together on CNBC, Mr. Iger brushed aside a question about the potential for confusion over who was in charge. "Bob is going to be running the company," Mr. Iger said. But now it seemed to Mr. Chapek that Mr. Iger was acting as though nothing had changed -- Mr. Iger was still chief executive in all but name.
Mr. Chapek's wife told him he was little more than Mr. Iger's "lap dog."
'He's Killing Me'
However marginalized Mr. Chapek felt, the two maintained at least a facade of cooperation. Because of Covid, no one went into the office, but Mr. Chapek spoke to Mr. Iger weekly by phone and sometimes went to see him at his home in Brentwood, an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood where they took walks wearing masks. Mr. Iger never went to see Mr. Chapek at his home in Westlake Village, a far-flung suburb. (A spokesman for Mr. Iger said he had never been invited.)
At Mr. Chapek's request, the two held a series of employee town-hall meetings, where Mr. Iger was supposed to reinforce the message that Mr. Chapek was now in charge. "My goal is for Bob to be successful, and to the extent that I can help him do that, I will," Mr. Iger said at the first town hall they held in February 2020. "I think it's got to be a balance between giving him the freedom to make the decisions and do things the way he wants to do them because, you know, they will feel right to him. On the other hand, I've got a fair amount of experience doing a lot of these things. And, you know, it's not quite about throwing him into a swimming pool when he's never swum. So it'll be a balance."
But nearly everything Mr. Chapek did (or didn't) do reinforced Mr. Iger's sense that naming Mr. Chapek as his successor had been a huge mistake. Mr. Iger expressed his frustration with friends in Hollywood. Word spread, and someone contacted The New York Times's media columnist at the time, Ben Smith, to say Mr. Iger was reasserting control. Mr. Smith called and spoke to Mr. Iger, too, who followed up with an email.
On Sunday, April 12, Mr. Chapek hosted a belated late-afternoon party for family and friends at his home to celebrate his promotion. A friend emailed him Mr. Smith's column, which had just appeared online. Mr. Chapek stepped out of the party and read it.
"After a few weeks of letting Mr. Chapek take charge, Mr. Iger smoothly reasserted control," Mr. Smith wrote. Mr. Chapek read with mounting disbelief.
Mr. Smith called Mr. Chapek "the new, nominal chief executive" and even speculated that the choice of Mr. Iger's successor "may be open again."
Mr. Smith quoted Mr. Iger as saying in an email that "a crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it, particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!"
Mr. Chapek immediately called Ms. Mucha, the communications executive. "What the hell is this?" he demanded. Trying to calm him, she argued the column wasn't that bad.
"He's killing me," Mr. Chapek responded.
Mr. Chapek didn't sleep that night. Early the next morning, he confronted Mr. Iger on the phone.
Mr. Iger denied that he had spoken to Mr. Smith, which only further enraged Mr. Chapek, who pointed out that Mr. Iger's quote came directly from an email. Mr. Iger said he didn't understand why Mr. Chapek was so upset. What was wrong with saying he was reasserting control in the midst of a crisis?
"You've cut my legs out from under me," Mr. Chapek said. "I've never felt worse in my life."
The conversation became heated, and both men raised their voices.
Mr. Iger told several people immediately afterward that he'd never been treated with more disrespect by anyone in his entire life.
As far as Mr. Iger was concerned, his relationship with Mr. Chapek was over.
'This Too Shall Pass'
Starting at 6 a.m. on Monday, Jayne Parker, Disney's chief human resources officer, called Disney directors to alert them to Mr. Chapek's fury. She got one out of bed to take the call.
An enraged Mr. Chapek got on the phone with Ms. Arnold, the board's lead independent director. This was the first time he'd broached the feud with a director. He hadn't wanted to call attention to something that seemed petty compared with a global pandemic, but he felt this could no longer be ignored.
Mr. Chapek, who deemed some other board members fiercely loyal to Mr. Iger, felt he'd developed a good rapport with Ms. Arnold, who had spent most of her career in the Midwest at Procter & Gamble, eventually becoming it's first woman president. Mr. Chapek, the son of a machinist from Hammond, Ind., had gotten his start in packaged goods, working in the pet-food division at Heinz and helping to market Kraft cheese.
Ms. Arnold also knew something about corporate succession: She'd been a leading candidate to become Procter & Gamble's chief executive but took herself out of the running and left the company in 2009, partly because, as a prominent gay executive, she didn't want her personal life to be publicly scrutinized, something that would most likely accompany the job.
Ms. Arnold was taken aback by the vehemence of Mr. Chapek's reaction to the column. She thought he seemed paranoid that Mr. Iger was out to destroy him. She urged him to calm down and defer to Mr. Iger, as she had advised before.
"What will be left of my reputation?" Mr. Chapek pleaded.
"This too shall pass," she responded. Mr. Iger would be gone in 20 months, and the C.E.O. prize would be Mr. Chapek's alone.
Mr. Chapek all but begged to be named to the board as a show of confidence in him. Ms. Arnold conferred with several other directors. None was aware of the depth of the hostility that had developed between Mr. Iger and his designated successor. But they agreed it could damage his standing. The board now felt it had no choice but to name Mr. Chapek a director as a show of support.
Ms. Arnold called Mr. Iger and chastised him for the column. She told him it was the worst thing that could have happened to Mr. Chapek. She pointed out that, had Mr. Iger taken the board's suggestion to initially name Mr. Chapek chief operating officer rather than chief executive, none of this would be happening. In any event, the sniping had to stop.
Mr. Iger was taken aback by both the tone and substance of Ms. Arnold's call. She seemed to be siding with Mr. Chapek -- even though he had been C.E.O. for less than two months and Mr. Iger was still ultimately in charge. She and other board members should be happy he was stepping back up during a crisis, Mr. Iger thought, especially when Mr. Chapek's leadership had been so lackluster.
On April 15, three days after Mr. Smith's column published, Mr. Chapek was named to Disney's board.
In June, the board scheduled private sessions by video call with both men to address the conflict. Mr. Iger went first. He aired his complaints about Mr. Chapek's leadership, including that he hadn't sought Mr. Iger's advice and counsel. Mr. Chapek had no standing in the creative community and hadn't made any efforts to improve it. He'd skipped creative meetings that Mr. Iger had invited him to.
Mr. Chapek said he was sorry their differences had become a board issue. But he was incensed when Mr. Parker, the board member who had led Nike, questioned Mr. Chapek's lack of contacts in the Hollywood creative community, since that was supposed to be Mr. Iger's jurisdiction. He insisted that he hadn't skipped meetings but rather that Mr. Iger had scheduled them without telling him. Mr. Chapek said Mr. Iger had ceded little authority, something Mr. Chapek said he had accepted without complaining. "I was just trying to be a good soldier," Mr. Chapek said.
The board's message to both men: The company was in crisis, and they needed to start acting like adults and work together.
Later, in an audit committee board session with Ms. McCarthy, Ms. Catz, the board member who had questioned Mr. Chapek's readiness, asked if she thought Mr. Chapek was up to the job. Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, didn't immediately answer.
"I don't like the fact that you're hesitating," Ms. Catz said.
"I'm giving you a qualified answer," Ms. McCarthy said. "If he will start to listen. If he will listen. We're all trying to help him, but he doesn't listen."
In the ensuing months, Mr. Iger seemed increasingly cranky about the board's reaction to Mr. Smith's column. "Why are you so hostile toward the board?" Mr. Chapek finally asked during one of their calls, which had continued despite the tensions.
Mr. Iger told him that he couldn't handle the truth, and then proceeded to say that before the board had agreed to name Mr. Chapek chief executive, the directors had assured Mr. Iger that, if he didn't think it was working out, he could fire Mr. Chapek and return as chief executive anytime he wanted. (Given the dual reporting structure, it is unclear whether Mr. Iger had that authority.)
Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Chapek, confirmed that account. She said Mr. Chapek "was shocked and surprised when told by Mr. Iger that he believed he could have his job back if and when he wanted it."
Immediately after the call, Mr. Chapek called Ms. Arnold. "What is he talking about?" he asked.
Ms. Arnold tried to make light of it. "Well, you know Bob," Ms. Arnold answered. "He may think so, but just let it go."
It wasn't the answer Mr. Chapek was hoping for.
Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman, said there was never any such understanding between Mr. Iger and the board. The claim that he could return at will was "not something Mr. Iger would have said," Mr. Jefferson added.
For Mr. Chapek, it was a turning point. It wasn't just paranoia: He was now convinced that Mr. Iger was trying to get rid of him and return as chief executive, and that the board might let him.
'This Is His Company to Run'
As Covid shutdowns continued into the fall of 2020, it wasn't just Disney's theme parks that bore the brunt. Disney's movie and television production had ground to a halt, just as consumers were staying home and turning to streaming services. Wall Street had been obsessed with subscriber gains, and Disney+ had delivered, surpassing 70 million, hitting its initial five-year goal after only nine months of operation. But it needed new content, which had all but dried up. Subscriber growth was slowing.
Mr. Chapek pleaded with his studio heads -- Pete Docter of Pixar, Kevin Feige of Marvel, Jennifer Lee of Disney Animation -- and encountered resistance: All of them wanted to hold back their best material for debuts in theaters with star-studded premieres. Mr. Chapek had no idea when, if ever, those days would return. In the meantime, Disney needed cash flow to meet interest payments on the enormous debt it had racked up under Mr. Iger to buy most of 21st Century Fox.
One of Mr. Chapek's perceived strengths was corporate organization. He proposed remaking the company around a new division, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, to give priority to streaming services (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) and to guarantee they received a steady flow of Disney's best content. DMED, as it became known, would now have bottom-line responsibility for all the company's entertainment, and would decide where films and programs would appear -- in theaters, on television or, as was increasingly likely, on Disney+. It would be Mr. Chapek's signature initiative as chief executive.
There was logic to Mr. Chapek's plan. But its seemingly benign, business-school rationale belied a reality: To strip Disney's creative heads of authority over spending, as well as where their movies and shows would be distributed, would be a huge loss of power and status. Moreover, Hollywood talent wanted guarantees of where projects would end up before committing to a deal. Although the division heads would still report to Mr. Chapek (and indirectly to Mr. Iger), it was a huge demotion. In many ways, their new boss would really be the head of DMED.
For that role, Mr. Chapek approached Alan Bergman, then the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, a figure both well known in Hollywood and respected by Disney's creative teams. Mr. Bergman said he'd think about it and called Mr. Iger to ask what he should do. Mr. Iger said he should tell Mr. Chapek what he really thought, which was that DMED was a terrible idea. Mr. Bergman turned down the offer.
Exasperated, Mr. Chapek turned to a loyal former lieutenant at consumer products, Kareem Daniel. A 13-year Disney veteran, Mr. Daniel was nonetheless barely known outside the company and had little experience with movies or television. Overnight, he would be running a division with more than $ 50 billion in annual revenue and would be in the spotlight as Disney's highest-ranking Black executive. Like Mr. Bergman, Mr. Daniel had his doubts about the wisdom of the proposed restructuring.
Mr. Chapek spent hours, both on the phone and in person at Mr. Iger's house, selling Mr. Iger on the idea. Mr. Iger was unenthusiastic but didn't object.
By early October, after a two-hour meeting at Mr. Iger's house, Mr. Chapek thought he'd gotten Mr. Iger's blessing. He was in his car heading back to Westlake Village when Mr. Bergman called him. "Iger just told me we're not doing the reorganization," Mr. Bergman said, according to Mr. Chapek. "He said he hates it."
Mr. Chapek was dumbfounded. He'd left Mr. Iger just 10 minutes earlier. "No, it's on. We're doing it," Mr. Chapek replied.
Mr. Chapek said he immediately called Mr. Iger, and asked if he'd said that to Mr. Bergman. "Yes, I hate it," Mr. Iger confirmed.
"Why didn't you say that to me?" Mr. Chapek asked.
Mr. Iger didn't answer.
A more seasoned chief executive might well have paused at this juncture, given the lack of internal support. At least a dozen senior Disney executives had told Mr. Chapek that the reorganization was a bad idea. But the Disney board gave Mr. Chapek its strong backing for the creation of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution after extended discussions in which Mr. Iger raised questions but said nothing to oppose it. Mr. Iger was on such thin ice with the board at that time that there was little he could say without appearing to undermine Mr. Chapek. "This is his company to run," Mr. Iger said to directors at one point. The reorganization, and Mr. Daniel's promotion, were announced on Oct. 12, 2020.
Mr. Chapek had finally accomplished something, and he was proud of it. As he later told a reporter at The Times, "It was singularly the best thing I could have done to transform this culture."
In June 2021, the board gathered at Aulani, a Disney resort in Hawaii, for its first in-person meeting since the pandemic. Few companies had been as hard hit as Disney. For a time, revenue from its theme parks and movies had all but been wiped out. But it was on a rebound. Disney World had reopened. Disney+ subscriber growth had pushed Disney's stock to near a record high.
Mr. Iger opened the board retreat with a paean to creativity, "the essence of who we are as a company." He warned that data and algorithms would never supplant creativity and that "not everyone is born with the ability to be wildly creative, and not everyone is born with the ability to manage wildly creative, or sometimes wild and creative, people." He didn't mention any names, but directors said they knew whom he was talking about.
Mr. Iger asked Ms. Arnold if she wanted to run the executive session along with him, but she told him to leave and asked Mr. Chapek to stay. Mr. Iger was taken aback, but took a seat outside the room, expecting to be called back after Mr. Chapek finished.
"We know it's been hard," Ms. Arnold told Mr. Chapek once Mr. Iger was out of the room. She complimented the stock price and his operational leadership during the pandemic. Directors nodded in agreement.
When the session with Mr. Chapek ended, the meeting adjourned and directors left the room. No one thought to tell Mr. Iger, who was left outside to fume.
For the first time since his promotion to chief executive, Mr. Chapek let himself think that Mr. Iger had been vanquished.
But trouble soon arose.
That summer, Disney was locked in negotiations over the release of "Black Widow," Marvel's big new superhero film, with its star, Scarlett Johansson. Now that DMED was up and running, Mr. Chapek wanted to see a return on the $ 350 million cost of the movie.
On July 9, a few days into the annual gathering of media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, Disney released "Black Widow" in theaters and on Disney+, even though Ms. Johansson's contract called for an exclusive theatrical release and her pay was pegged to the theatrical box office. Releasing it on Disney+ would obviously cut into ticket sales, costing her as much as $ 50 million, her agent contended. "She's not happy," her agent told Mr. Chapek when he ran into him at the conference. This was exactly the kind of problem Mr. Bergman had warned about when DMED was created.
"Black Widow" took in $ 80 million at the domestic box office during its first three days, sharply less than previous Marvel films had. A few weeks later, when Ms. Johansson sued Disney, the company took a hard line. In a statement approved by Mr. Iger, Disney called the suit "especially sad and distressing," accused Ms. Johansson of a "callous disregard" for the impact of Covid on theatergoers and said she'd already been paid $ 20 million. Talent relations fell under Mr. Iger's purview as creative head, but Mr. Chapek also contributed to the contents of the statement and signed off on it.
"Attacking Johansson so personally was a pretty spectacular unforced error," wrote Kim Masters in The Hollywood Reporter. "And many observers are laying that at the feet of C.E.O. Bob Chapek. The person who isn't getting the blame? Outgoing chairman Bob Iger."
Mr. Chapek was stunned that he -- and not Mr. Iger -- was blamed for the debacle.
'Fasten Your Seatbelts'
That fall, as his end-of-year retirement date approached, Mr. Iger said he didn't want a farewell ceremony or party at Disney. The thought of Mr. Chapek hosting such an event was too galling. Instead, he and his wife decided to host their own party at their home in Brentwood. Mr. Iger chose a date when he knew Mr. Chapek would be in Orlando, Fla., for an event.
Mr. Chapek canceled the trip.
On Nov. 19, he arrived for the party at the same time as Thomas Schumacher, the longtime president of Disney's Broadway division. Ms. Bay, Mr. Iger's wife, was outside greeting guests as they arrived. "Tom Schumacher, it's been too long," she gushed. "I can't believe you came all this way." She embraced Mr. Schumacher. Mr. Chapek stood awkwardly by until she finally turned to him. "Hi, Bob. I see you all the time," she said. She turned back to Mr. Schumacher.
A guest who witnessed the exchange recalled Bette Davis's memorable line in "All About Eve": "Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night."
About 80 guests were seated at three long tables outdoors behind the house. Mr. Iger was flanked by Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Lee of Disney Animation. Mr. Chapek was in the middle of the table farthest from Mr. Iger's.
Mr. Iger began a speech recognizing people who'd helped and inspired him. In one of his first jobs at ABC, Mr. Iger had worked as an assistant to the acclaimed sportscaster Al Michaels, who was at the party. Mr. Iger mentioned that back in the day he and Mr. Michaels had covered dirt-track racing in Terre Haute, Ind., for "Wide World of Sports." Mr. Iger looked toward Mr. Chapek and went off script: "That's your area, isn't it Bob?" he asked, referring to Terre Haute, in rural southwestern Indiana. "You'd know all about dirt tracks."
Mr. Chapek's hometown of Hammond is near Chicago. He seethed at what he felt was a put-down.
Mr. Iger pushed on, worked his way through his career thanking people and then paused when he reached the present. "I think I'll just stop there," he said. "Thank you all for coming." There was no praise, and no further mention, of Mr. Chapek.
Mr. Chapek reddened as he felt every gaze turn on him. He stood up and stalked out.
'It's Going to Get Worse'
On Nov. 30, in ABC's old board room at Disney's West 66th Street offices in New York City, Mr. Iger presided over his last meeting as chairman. He'd given considerable thought to what he'd say, discussing it with his wife and making detailed notes. He could have reflected on his accomplishments and made a graceful exit, something that he'd considered and that some board members expected.
But he didn't.
During an executive session without Mr. Chapek, Mr. Iger began by apologizing for not having had more interaction with board members since the meeting in Hawaii. Then he said, "There are things that I feel I must leave you with, that you must know because there are things that you need to watch." He then unleashed a broadside.
Mr. Iger asserted that under Mr. Chapek, the collegial culture he'd built over 15 years was crumbling. Disney was a company that depended first and foremost on creativity, and Mr. Chapek's DMED reorganization had damaged Disney's creative engines. The company, he said, had become distracted by a deep rift -- Mr. Chapek and his allies on one side, Disney's creative executives and the Hollywood talent community on the other.
Mr. Iger didn't go so far as to say the board should fire Mr. Chapek. Nor did he ask to replace him as chief executive or to remain as chairman.
Afterward, Mr. Iger seemed unusually subdued at the board's farewell lunch for him. They showed a video tribute. Mr. Parker gave him a pair of custom Nike sneakers. Mr. Chapek gave him two gold coins embossed with Mickey Mouse to be placed under the mast of his new yacht, a good-luck custom to ward off pirates.
Mr. Chapek felt a chill. "It's going to get worse," Mr. Chapek told Ms. Arnold after lunch. He worried that, once he was gone, Mr. Iger would feel more emboldened to criticize Mr. Chapek.
In conversations with allies at the company, he started referring to Mr. Iger as an "assassin."
A Mea Culpa
During Mr. Iger's tenure, the studio had greenlighted a bevy of projects with progressive social and political themes. But Mr. Chapek worried the development slate had veered too far left on social issues. Disney was being pulled into partisan political debates more frequently, a worrisome situation for a brand that was supposed to stand for everyone.
Some board members agreed. Coming up through the pipeline was "Strange World," Disney's first animated film focusing on an openly gay teenager. Ms. Catz, a board member, was so opposed to the character that she told Mr. Chapek she'd have him fired if Disney released the film. He reported the threat to Ms. Arnold.
The film was too far along for Mr. Chapek to block it, but his fears about Disney's becoming a cultural flashpoint soon materialized. In January 2022, the Parental Rights in Education bill was introduced in Florida. Opponents labeled the bill "Don't Say Gay" because it prohibited classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for young students. The Human Rights Campaign, a prominent L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization, soon had more than 100 corporate signatories to a letter opposing anti-gay legislation in various statehouses. Media companies like Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, had signed on. But Disney, one of the largest employers in Florida, was conspicuously absent.
Mr. Chapek realized that staying silent might cause controversy. He called Ms. Arnold, who had succeeded Mr. Iger as chairman, to discuss his view that Disney had become too politicized. He mentioned the Florida bill and the pressure on Disney to publicly condemn it.
Ms. Arnold agreed that Disney should stay above the fray. But she said the company should sign the Human Rights Campaign letter. Since so many companies had already signed -- including Nike, General Motors and Oracle, whose chief executives sat on Disney's board -- she didn't envision Disney's being singled out for criticism: There was safety in numbers. Mr. Chapek agreed.
On Feb. 1, at the board's first meeting with Mr. Iger no longer at the company, Geoff Morrell, the new chief corporate affairs officer, gave a presentation arguing that Disney should stay out of divisive social and political issues, especially at the state and local levels, unless necessary. Disney should fight "the wars not the battles," he said. He also said Disney's employees, accustomed to Mr. Iger making public comments supporting progressive positions, would need to be "reconditioned." The board agreed.
The Florida legislation soon vaulted to national attention. On Feb. 8, President Biden issued a statement on Twitter: "I want every member of the LGBTQI+ community -- especially the kids who will be impacted by this hateful bill -- to know that you are loved and accepted just as you are."
Disney remained silent and soon faced an internal revolt. Creative employees -- many of them gay or staunchly supportive of gay colleagues and friends -- were still seething over the DMED reorganization. And now this?
On Feb. 24, Mr. Iger put a match to kindling by reposting Mr. Biden's comment and adding: "I'm with the President on this! If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy."
A few days later, a Disney L.G.B.T.Q. employee group sent a letter to Mr. Chapek and other high-ranking executives demanding that Disney oppose the bill and denounce similar legislation pending in other states. Mr. Chapek met with the group the next week, describing the discussion as "meaningful, illuminating and at times deeply moving."
In the midst of this, Disney's board held an emergency meeting to discuss the mounting controversy. Mr. Chapek told the board that, in keeping with the company's new policy, Disney had not signed the Human Rights Campaign petition. Ms. Arnold was taken aback. "I'm confused," she said. "You told me Disney was going to sign it."
The discussion moved on, but Ms. Arnold was visibly upset. Mr. Chapek sent her a text: "My bad. We decided not to sign. I got busy and forgot to tell you."
Ms. Arnold was furious.
Despite the pressure from employees, Disney's board agreed to stay the course. Mr. Chapek and his corporate affairs team drafted a statement defending Disney's decision not to comment, which was circulated to Ms. Arnold and the rest of the board: "Corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds. Instead, they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame."
The memo, distributed to employees and the news media on March 7, backfired in spectacular fashion. Letters and calls from prominent people criticizing Disney's failure to speak out poured in to Mr. Chapek. Abigail Disney, granddaughter of the co-founder Roy O. Disney, said on Twitter that she was "deeply angered." The Los Angeles Times called Disney's policy "corporate cowardice."
With pressure on Disney increasing, Ms. Arnold advised Mr. Chapek to reverse course and condemn the bill. "You're losing the creative community," she warned him. "You have to stand with your team."
On March 9, Ms. Arnold's first shareholder meeting as chair, Mr. Chapek extolled the company's recent accomplishments in a taped video, then delivered a mea culpa. "I understand our political approach, no matter how well-intentioned, didn't quite get the job done," he said. He announced that Disney would sign the letter and give $ 5 million to the organization. The Human Rights Campaign promptly said it would take the money only after Disney demonstrated it was following through on its promises.
Two days later, Mr. Chapek went even further in another memo to employees: "You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights, and I let you down. I am sorry." Taking direct aim at Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, he also halted political contributions in the state.
There were those at Disney, including Ms. Arnold, who thought Mr. Chapek had now gone too far in the other direction. The about-face and abject apology did little to assuage Disney's outraged L.G.B.T.Q. community. And it gave Florida's governor a national platform to mock the company as "Woke Disney." "If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy," Mr. DeSantis said. Florida moved to revoke Disney World's special tax status and Disney and the state were soon battling it out in court.
Mr. Chapek thought it unfair that he was being blamed for a policy that had been endorsed by the board at every step. And he saw Mr. Iger's "assassin" fingerprints all over the ensuing firestorm, starting with his tweet. His suspicions only hardened on March 31, when Mr. Iger appeared on CNN. Mr. Iger never mentioned Mr. Chapek by name, but he didn't need to. "To me, it wasn't about politics," Mr. Iger said on the air. "It is about what is right and what is wrong, and that just seemed wrong."
As the bad press continued, Mr. Chapek insisted that his contract as chief executive, set to expire on Feb. 28, 2023, be extended as a show of board support. Terms for a new three-year contract were agreed to by late March. But Ms. Arnold declined to make the agreement public, saying the time wasn't right given the furor over the Florida legislation.
She was also trying to buy time. The board was having its first serious discussions about whether Mr. Chapek had been the wrong choice for the job. Two directors, Mr. Parker and Mary Barra, GM's chief executive, were especially critical of Mr. Chapek. The board discussed the possibility that Mr. Parker of Nike could step in to replace Mr. Chapek on an interim basis while it conducted a search, but he declined. In side discussions, a couple directors explored the idea of an office of the chairman led by Ms. Arnold, but she shut down that suggestion, saying she was happily retired from the daily slog of corporate life. The possibility of asking Mr. Iger to come back wasn't suggested.
Unnerving Calls
In most respects, Mr. Iger was pleasantly surprised by life after Disney. While a rumored appointment as ambassador to China or Britain never materialized, his calls were returned and restaurant reservations remained easy to come by. He spent time on his yacht, wrote a draft of a second book and acquired stakes in companies like Funko, a maker of pop culture collectibles, and Gopuff, the rapid-delivery start-up. He joined Josh Kushner's firm Thrive Capital as a venture partner and gave more than 20 talks at corporations seeking his wisdom.
Mr. Iger insisted he'd put Disney behind him and vowed not to talk about Mr. Chapek unless others brought him up. Evidently, many did. Mr. Chapek fielded a steady drumbeat of unnerving calls from people who had met with Mr. Iger. They told Mr. Chapek that Mr. Iger had heaped criticism on him and wanted to talk about little else.
Mr. Chapek complained about Mr. Iger's whisper campaign to Ms. Arnold and other board members, some of whom had independently heard about Mr. Iger's trash talk. But now that Mr. Iger had officially retired, the board had no leverage on him. No board member ever reached out to him, according to Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman.
Despite the board's growing reservations about Mr. Chapek, and given the lack of any alternative, Ms. Arnold agreed to announce Mr. Chapek's new contract, which allowed for a $ 20 million annual bonus, up from $ 15 million. On June 28, the board said: "Bob is the right leader at the right time for The Walt Disney Company, and the board has full confidence in him and his leadership team."
'We Have to Save Chapek'
Since becoming chief executive in 2020, Mr. Chapek's sometimes rocky tenure had been buoyed by Disney's strong share price. But since hitting a record high in March 2021, it had been falling, along with stocks of other entertainment companies grappling with the new economics of streaming and the decline of cable. In April 2022, Netflix reported it had lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, panicking Wall Street. Netflix shares lost 35 percent in just one day. Seemingly overnight, investors went from caring only about subscriber numbers to focusing on earnings and losses. The streaming honeymoon was over.
By the time the board announced Mr. Chapek's new contract, Disney shares had dropped almost 50 percent from their peak, so low that activist investors like Dan Loeb and Nelson Peltz were circling the company, seeking board seats and calling for management changes.
Mr. Peltz knew a good deal about Disney and Mr. Iger, thanks to his neighbor in Palm Beach, Isaac ("Ike") Perlmutter, who had sold Marvel to Disney in 2009 and stayed on as Marvel's chairman. The deal made Mr. Perlmutter one of Disney's largest shareholders.
The irascible Mr. Perlmutter had clashed with Mr. Iger over the years. In 2015, Mr. Perlmutter tried to fire Mr. Feige, Marvel's celebrated movie chief, amid a disagreement about budgets; Mr. Iger saved Mr. Feige and effectively demoted Mr. Perlmutter by stripping superhero movies from his oversight. In 2019, Mr. Iger further marginalized Mr. Perlmutter, taking away the television portion of his job and leaving him with only a tiny fief involving comics publishing and a few consumer products. Mr. Perlmutter had been glad to see Mr. Iger step down.
But Mr. Perlmutter had sources in the company who convinced him that Mr. Iger was plotting a return. Mr. Perlmutter warned Mr. Chapek, fanning Mr. Chapek's own anxieties about Mr. Iger's intentions.
With Mr. Perlmutter's encouragement, Mr. Chapek met with Mr. Peltz in July at Disneyland Paris and the two men forged a rapport. Soon after, Mr. Perlmutter called several board members, including Ms. Catz, lobbying them to add Mr. Peltz to the board. If not, he warned, Mr. Iger "would be back at Disney," as Disney later put it in a proxy filing.
In a call to Horacio Gutierrez, the company's new general counsel, Mr. Perlmutter told him: "We have to save Chapek. We can't allow Iger to come back."
Mr. Chapek told Ms. Arnold that he thought inviting Mr. Peltz made sense. It would spare Disney a costly and distracting proxy fight. But Ms. Arnold said the board would never offer Mr. Peltz a seat, partly because of his friendship with Mr. Perlmutter. The board was wary of Mr. Perlmutter given the antagonism between him and Mr. Iger and also because of Mr. Perlmutter's campaign against Mr. Feige, whom the board had come to view as a crucial employee.
'I Am Telling the Truth'
To prepare for that fall's earnings report, Mr. Chapek and Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, met around Labor Day to preview the numbers. They discussed a looming shortfall between Wall Street's forecasts and the actual results, but Mr. Chapek wasn't especially concerned given strong streaming subscriber growth. He told Ms. McCarthy that Mr. Daniel, the DMED chief, had assured him that streaming was "killing it."
But that changed a few weeks later when Ms. McCarthy led board members through a presentation of the expected results. The first slide disclosed that Disney's earnings per share would be 27 cents below Wall Street's estimates -- far more than what she and Mr. Chapek previously discussed, and a result sure to shock Wall Street. Disney's streaming business was still signing up subscribers at a fast pace. But soaring programming and marketing costs meant that streaming was now heading toward a $ 1.5 billion quarterly loss, up from $ 630 million a year earlier -- just when investors had been promised there would be light at the end of the tunnel.
Board members started pelting Mr. Chapek with questions. How could the results be this bad?
Mr. Chapek felt blindsided. Ms. McCarthy had distributed projected earnings results nine days earlier to the board that prominently highlighted the 27-cent miss. But Mr. Chapek hadn't read that board package -- he had assumed the material in it reflected what he and Ms. McCarthy had discussed when they met.
Ms. McCarthy continued through the slide presentation as board members appeared to grow more agitated. About an hour into the meeting, Mr. Chapek was visibly annoyed. He stared at Ms. McCarthy, tapped his watch, then took it from his wrist and began swinging it back and forth like a pendulum, signaling Ms. McCarthy to finish up.
During the ensuing break, he confronted her.
According to Ms. McCarthy's recollection, he accused her of upsetting the board. "I am telling the truth," she replied. "I never lie, and I'm not starting now. The numbers are the numbers."
Mr. Chapek said he didn't attack her, and simply asked why she'd blindsided him. He said she didn't offer any explanation.
The board met in executive session with Mr. Chapek, and then Ms. McCarthy. Ms. McCarthy said Mr. Chapek had attacked her during the break for being truthful. Ms. Catz again asked if Mr. Chapek was up to the job.
This time, Ms. McCarthy answered, "He can't do it."
Ms. Catz and others told Ms. McCarthy she had to hold the place together.
Afterward, an angry Ms. Arnold called Mr. Chapek.
"How could you attack Christine?" she demanded.
"She'd never told me the numbers!" Mr. Chapek exclaimed.
Petting a Hippo
Worried that Mr. Chapek was in denial about the gravity of the shortfall, Mr. Gutierrez, the general counsel, called for meetings during an October management retreat in Orlando. Mr. Gutierrez invited the senior leadership team, saying he wanted to ensure a common understanding of the situation and plan for what would surely be a difficult earnings call.
Mr. Chapek didn't attend Mr. Gutierrez's meetings. Instead, during one, Mr. Chapek greeted park visitors and petted a hippo at Disney's Animal Kingdom resort. (Mr. Chapek's spokeswoman said he went to every meeting he was told about, adding that the hippo encounter was part of an effort, encouraged by the board, to come across as more personable.)
Pressed by Mr. Gutierrez that a crisis was looming, Mr. Chapek offered him a meeting at 6:30 a.m. on Friday. Mr. Gutierrez declined, saying that several participants were scheduled to leave Orlando that morning.
The week before the earnings call, Kristina Schake, who had replaced Mr. Morrell as communications chief, tried to warn Mr. Chapek that the quarterly results would prompt a cascade of negative news articles. He chided her as an "Eeyore," a reference to the gloomy donkey from the Winnie-the-Pooh franchise.
Mr. Chapek unveiled the earnings as scheduled on Nov. 8. They fell short of estimates by 26 cents a share, only a penny better than the forecast. In his upbeat presentation to analysts, Mr. Chapek avoided mentioning the $ 1.5 billion in streaming losses, instead saying only that the red ink had hit a "peak." He spent more time extolling the post-Covid comeback of the theme parks.
On CNBC, Jim Cramer called the results "one of the most disappointing quarters I've ever seen at a major company."
Disney stock dropped 13 percent over the next 24 hours.
With the stock seemingly in free fall, creative personnel revolting and Mr. Chapek no longer on speaking terms with Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, Mr. Gutierrez called Ms. Arnold.
Mr. Chapek didn't have the credibility or leadership skills to continue as C.E.O., Mr. Gutierrez told her. The only person who could solve the problems was Mr. Iger.
"You aren't the first" to suggest that, she replied.
Alarm Bells
A few days later, Mr. Iger went for separate walks with Mr. Bergman, the movie chief, and Dana Walden, who oversaw television operations. Each vented their frustrations with Mr. Chapek and told Mr. Iger how bad things were.
"Don't talk to me, because I can't do anything about it," Mr. Iger said. "Talk to the board."
Each said they already had. They told him everyone had.
Ms. Walden asked Mr. Iger if he'd consider coming back. "I might," he said. "But they'll never ask me."
"Would you call Susan Arnold?" Ms. Walden asked.
Mr. Iger was still on bad terms with Ms. Arnold, partly because of the column by Mr. Smith, and hadn't spoken to her since he left. "If she wants to talk to me, she knows how to reach me," he said.
That weekend, Mr. Chapek was in Palm Beach, Fla., to meet again with Mr. Peltz, even though Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman, maintained that board members had instructed Mr. Chapek in August not to meet alone with any activist investors.
Mr. Chapek "never received any such admonition," Ms. Davis, the spokeswoman for Mr. Chapek, said. Mr. Chapek deemed communicating with activists and other large investors to be an essential part of his duties as chief executive. He "faithfully followed the board's direction on all matters," she said.
Mr. Chapek went to Mr. Peltz's oceanfront mansion, where the investor and one of his sons made their case for change at Disney. The meeting lasted about two hours. Afterward, Mr. Chapek met Mr. Perlmutter of Marvel and briefed him on the meeting.
Mr. Chapek didn't tell anyone on the board about the trip, but Mr. Iger nonetheless found out about it soon after it happened. (There appear to have been few secrets within Disney's upper ranks.) Mr. Iger assumed Mr. Chapek had been in Palm Beach solely to see Mr. Perlmutter.
On Nov. 17, the Disney board held a special meeting to discuss the Peltz situation. Mr. Chapek was in Disney's New York offices and participated by video. He mentioned that he'd had conversations with Mr. Peltz, but not that they'd met in person a couple days earlier. The board reaffirmed its decision to rebuff Mr. Peltz.
Soon after the meeting ended, Ms. Arnold called Mr. Chapek, ordering him to have no further contact with Mr. Peltz, even if other Disney executives were with him. Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Gutierrez would be the only "designated points of contact" with the investor, as Disney said in one of its proxy filings.
The order set off alarm bells for Mr. Chapek. He'd met earlier with Mr. Loeb, who had dropped his campaign to shake up Disney. The board had praised Mr. Chapek for that. Now, he was barred not only from meeting alone with Mr. Peltz but also from communicating with him at all. He sensed a growing lack of trust.
There were two Disney premieres in New York that week, the Searchlight film "The Menu" and the FX series "Fleishman Is in Trouble." Mr. Chapek, preoccupied by the mounting pressures on both him and the company, didn't show up. Ms. McCarthy stood in for him.
That Friday, Ms. Walden called Mr. Iger and canceled a walk they had planned for that afternoon. Ms Walden said Ms. Arnold would be calling him instead. Mr. Iger reported this to his wife.
"They're not asking you back," she said.
Mr. Iger agreed, but wondered, "What if they do?"
Ms. Bay said he'd have to accept. "If they're asking you to come back, they must be desperate. And second, you love the company and the people, you kind of owe it to them."
Ms. Arnold called as scheduled at 3 p.m. After brief pleasantries, she said she wanted to apologize for their rupture. That was important to Mr. Iger. Without an apology, he wouldn't consider a return. He accepted it and said they should move on.
"Would you come back?" she asked.
He accepted without hesitating, with three conditions: He wanted it to be announced immediately, no later than Monday, because it was too big a secret for him to keep. It had to be for a limited period -- they decided on two years. And he wanted to serve without pay, because he didn't want anyone to think he was doing it for money.
Ms. Arnold said she'd have to get back to him on that.
The call lasted all of 15 minutes.
Ms. Arnold told Mr. Gutierrez to convene a virtual meeting of the board's independent directors for Sunday without telling Mr. Chapek. During the meeting, Ms. Arnold asked for Mr. Gutierrez's assessment. He said that Mr. Chapek had lost the support of the senior leadership team and that there was a serious risk of losing some key creative talent. He'd become dysfunctional. He'd missed important meetings in Orlando preceding the disastrous November earnings call. In a moment of crisis, rather than charting a way forward, he was in denial. He seemed depressed.
The board voted unanimously to terminate Mr. Chapek and instructed Ms. Arnold and Mr. Gutierrez to call him.
That night, Elton John was giving a concert at Dodger Stadium that was being livestreamed on Disney+. Mr. Chapek planned to attend, but was still at home in Westlake Village when the call came.
Ms. Arnold got straight to the point: "Effective immediately, you're out." He wasn't even offered the face-saving gesture of resigning.
Despite his anxieties, Mr. Chapek was unprepared for something this sudden. "Why?" he asked.
"We lost confidence."
Iger's Last Extension?
Four hours later, the news broke about who would be replacing him. Mr. Chapek wasn't surprised.
Mr. Iger moved swiftly to dismantle Mr. Chapek's legacy and stifle any internal opposition. DMED was abolished within days of his return, its functions returned to the creative executives. Mr. Iger ousted Mr. Daniel. Mr. Perlmutter lost his job four months later. Next, Mr. Iger demanded Ms. McCarthy's resignation. Ms. Arnold left the board in March 2023, when her one-year extension as board chair came to an end. Ms. Catz left the board this July.
Mr. Iger returned to a company beleaguered on nearly every front. He soon faced a debilitating strike by Hollywood writers and actors, then a bitter proxy fight waged by Mr. Peltz. "Wish," a high-profile Disney animated film released in late 2023, became the fifth big-budget Disney film to bomb at the box office that year.
Disney shares rose immediately after Mr. Iger's return, but soon turned down again. After Mr. Peltz lost the proxy contest in April 2024, Mr. Perlmutter sold all of his 25.6 million shares, saying he had no confidence in Mr. Iger and Disney management. Disney shares this week were trading at less than $ 90, down 55 percent from March 2021.
Predictably, the board rebuffed Mr. Iger's suggestion that he work for nothing. A securities filing revealed he earned $ 31.6 million last year.
Mr. Chapek departed with over $ 20 million in severance payments (after earning just over $ 24 million for 2022), but his reputation was in shreds.
After he was fired, Mr. Chapek hired Bryan Freedman, a lawyer in Los Angeles known for handling high-profile media departures. Mr. Freedman told The Times he had advised Mr. Chapek that he had "a very strong legal claim against Bob Iger for illegally interfering with his ability to do his job." But Mr. Chapek told him that his children and grandchildren were a "Disney family" and he couldn't bring himself to file a lawsuit that might hurt the company, Mr. Freedman said.
Disney responded with a statement saying that Mr. Chapek was fired by the board because "he was no longer the right person to serve as C.E.O. during an increasingly complex period of industry transformation."
Muzzled by a severance agreement, Mr. Chapek has stayed in the background in the face of what he considers unflattering, unfair and, in some cases, inaccurate accounts of his leadership. Though he joined the board of a medical technology firm, few opportunities have come his way.
From the outset, as Disney's C.E.O., Mr. Chapek faced daunting challenges beyond his control: the onset of a global pandemic, upheaval in an industry being transformed by streaming and the overt hostility of a much admired and still-powerful predecessor.
At the same time, he certainly contributed to his own demise. Soon after he was named chief executive, he stopped ingratiating himself with Mr. Iger. And, by the end, nearly his entire executive team had turned against him, even people he'd hired and promoted. So did the board -- not just Ms. Catz, skeptical of him from the outset, but also Ms. Arnold, once his strongest defender.
Mr. Chapek, his spokeswoman said, "remains deeply proud" of navigating Disney through the "unprecedented terrain" of the Covid crisis, "all while working to transform Disney into a media company poised for future success. Mr. Chapek is confident that, absent his predecessor and ultimate successor's campaign against him, this collective vision would have been realized under his leadership."
Current Disney executives say Mr. Iger has restored morale and brought needed stability to the management ranks. Marvel and Pixar had big summer hits in "Deadpool & Wolverine" and "Inside Out 2," both started while Mr. Iger was still creative head. Though Disney stock remains in the doldrums, the streaming combination of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ eked out a profit in the quarter ending June 29, three months ahead of projections. Mr. Iger was greeted by fans with delirious applause when he appeared onstage at this summer's D23 fan gathering in Anaheim, Calif. Mr. Iger was so moved that he had to fight back tears before speaking.
In the annals of corporate governance, there are surely few failures that rival the Disney board's handling of Mr. Iger's transition. The influential shareholder advisory service ISS called it a "failed succession" and cited "major missteps" by the board. Among the more startling were the board's failure to formally interview Mr. Chapek for the job, its failure to fully consider the unworkable reporting structure in which Mr. Chapek reported to both the board and Mr. Iger, and its failure to curb the debilitating conflict that erupted between the two men.
Few feuds among top executives have ever reached the level of intensity and bitterness of the one between Mr. Iger and his handpicked successor. Mr. Iger has called hiring Mr. Chapek for the top job the worst mistake of his career. Still, the question lingers: How could Mr. Iger have so misjudged Mr. Chapek after working with him for nearly 30 years? "I've tried hard to conduct my own post-mortem, just so that we as a company don't do it again," Mr. Iger said at The New York Times's DealBook Summit last year, but declined to disclose any conclusions.
Disney said Mr. Iger had nothing further to add.
Last summer, Disney's board extended Mr. Iger's contract yet again, until late 2026. Mr. Iger is adamant that this will be the last extension.

Seeking to Cut Costs, Volkswagen Considers German Plant Closures for First Time in Its History: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For the first time in its 87-year history, the automaker is considering shuttering factories in Germany, citing the need to remain competitive.
Volkswagen warned on Monday that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history and end a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers, as it faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors.
The company said in a statement that the measures were meant to shore up its namesake brand, but it declined to provide any details.
"In the current situation, even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out without swift countermeasures," the company said. "The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures."
IG Metall, the powerful union that represents German automotive workers, responded by saying it would fight any job cuts. It added that Volkswagen managers had told it that a cost-cutting plan announced last year was not working and that additional savings worth "billions" were needed. Volkswagen declined to confirm that number.
Last year, Volkswagen and worker representatives agreed to measures that would save the company 10 billion euros, or $ 11 billion, by 2026. But those plans, which included job cuts largely based on attrition, are no longer enough, the company said on Monday.
"The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation," Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement. "Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively."
The automaker owns 10 brands, including Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, but its flagship brand remains core to its identity and that of Germany's storied history as an automobile nation. But Volkswagen has faced falling sales, amid decreased demand in Europe, especially for its electric vehicles.
Volkswagen's share of the Chinese market, its largest market, has shrunk as fast-moving domestic rivals roll out affordable electric cars. Despite plans by the European Union to introduce tariffs on imports of electric cars from China, those competitors are starting to expand into Europe.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted in the months from April to June, shrinking 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The latest figures dampened hopes that the country might be pulling out of stagnation, which analysts say is driven by high energy and labor costs.
Shutdowns of Volkswagen's German factories would be a first for the company, which was founded in Wolfsburg in 1937. But closing plants, as well as ending the agreement that provides workers with job guarantees through 2029, will face stiff opposition from union leaders and workers' representatives, who hold half the seats on the company's supervisory board.
Daniela Cavallo, a union leader and the head of the council representing Volkswagen workers, blamed company management for failing to develop a competent strategy and instead seeking to save by cutting jobs.
"We will fiercely defend ourselves against this," Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. "There will be no plant closures with us."
Clashes with unions have cost several chief executives at Volkswagen their jobs. Already the unions are gearing up for wage negotiations that are set to begin this fall. Nearly half of Volkswagen's 650,000 workers around the globe are in Germany.
"The company -- and the VW brand -- are in a very dangerous situation," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.

Full text: This article is part of our Design special section about creating space with the look and feel for one person.
These days, the Dutch entrepreneur Rick Vintage lives alone on an old boat, a 75-foot-long vessel from 1895 called "Vrouwe Jacoba" (Mrs. Jacoba, in Dutch) on a canal in a quiet corner of Amsterdam. It is moored in front of a 4,800-square-foot garden that contains a tiny house, now inhabited by his daughter Lux, 18, who comes on board mornings for coffee before dashing off to school. He lives with his dog, Moos. There are no passers-by, and he often dines alone on the deck. "I've always been a bit of a hermit," he said in a video call from the Netherlands.
But it was not always so for Mr. Vintage, whose life was strikingly different only a few years ago. He founded his wallpaper business NLXL in 2010 with his wife, Esther Vintage, starting with images of wood planks for their beach house. "I put planks on the scanner, made prints and installed it in our living room," he said. "I could smell it: This was going to be a worldwide success."
But he worried that the design was too similar to work by Piet Hein Eek, whom he described as a design hero. "So I decided to send him a message to ask if he'd be interested in working with us."
They became partners on the design, called Piet Hein Eek Scrapwood Wallpaper. "I always make sure, in advance, that with whom I work it's fun to work with and might be a friend. It turned out to be one of the most joyful collaborations till now and we're friends now," said Mr. Eek in an email.
The Vintages expanded their offerings, adding digitally printed trompe l'oeil patterns, including embossed tin and weathered concrete, and the company became an overnight success. "We acquired 3,000 resellers in 70 countries in one year and a half. And I became rich," he said. He got to meet many designers he admired, including the English fashion luminary Paul Smith, who said upon being introduced, "I know who you are. You're the wallpaper guy." (Mr. Smith would later put NLXL wallpaper in the windows of his New York store, as would Saks Fifth Avenue.)
At the time, he lived with his wife and two daughters in an 18th-century farmhouse in Voorburg, outside of The Hague. But the money and the fame turned him into, in his own words, "a bit of a prick." The orders -- and the cash -- kept pouring in, and the company won numerous awards.
The Belgian designer Job Smeets recalled the time, in 2014, his company, Studio Job, and Mr. Vintage shared an Elle Deco International Design Award for their collaboration on a hallucinatory wallpaper, called Industry, patterned with skulls, machine cogs and missiles. The awards ceremony was in a luxury hotel in Milan, and the audience was filled with design legends like Alessandro Mendini and Gaetano Pesce.
"Rick took the mic," Mr. Smeets recounted, "and instead of giving a speech, he spontaneously started to sing, in a really beautiful baritone kind of voice, a phonetic Italian song that sounded totally Italian, but all the words were made up. And the whole crowd went crazy, everybody standing ovation, and it was like the best thing ever."
In those days, many people told Mr. Vintage he was special. "And I guess I started to believe that I was," he said. He bought expensive cars -- three Porsches in one year -- and was flying around the world. It was time for a change, but not necessarily the one he had intended.
In 2016, he and Esther divorced and Mr. Vintage moved into an apartment in an ornate 1830 building in The Hague. It was boldly decorated with miles of designer wallpaper and clusters of trendy furniture, including a sleek Koen sofa by Piet Boon and Tree Trunk chairs by Mr. Eek. (Both Piets are Dutch designers and NLXL contributors.) There was also the ultimate display of bachelordom -- fake plants, dominated by a surrealist Gufram cactus. The eye-catching space was written about extensively.
"Two years later I drove to a party in Rotterdam in my brand-new Porsche 911 GTS with my 20-years-younger girlfriend next to me," he recounted. He was scared of the person he had become, he said, a man who didn't know where his own daughters were. "This is when I really pulled the plug on all the traveling and all the glamour. And I started to live a different life. That's how it all began."
He split up with the girlfriend and spent the rest of the year on his Koen sofa, alone, with occasional depression and anxiety attacks. He wondered who he was without all the applause. "Somewhere, in the back of my head, I knew that I had always been very good at being alone, but I just didn't remember how."
Meanwhile, NLXL was losing a lot of money. Not only had Mr. Vintage taken a long hiatus from work after the divorce, but big and small companies had begun copying the collections. He sold his assets -- including cars -- to pay the bills and pared down the staff to just two people: he and his ex-wife.
Then came the pandemic; he contracted Covid. But somehow the enforced isolation become a comfort. "There I was -- alone, broke, with Covid, no applause -- and feeling better than ever," he recalled.
He began to reconnect with his daughters. In 2020, Lux had just started studying music in college in Amsterdam, and he looked for a place in that city, but found everything in the central area "crazy expensive."
He spotted an ad for a houseboat with a garden on the edge of town. With Lux and his other daughter, Ella, now 21, who lives with her mother in Voorburg and studies nutrition, he went to have a look. Twenty-four hours later, he owned it.
Life on the Vrouwe Jacoba wasn't always accommodating, Mr. Vintage said: "The toilet didn't flush, the heating didn't work and there was leakage everywhere. The interior -- which I had decided not to change -- was mainly yellowish '70s wood strips, and the kitchen didn't even have a stove."
So gradually, he made adjustments. Though he aspired to live without luxury, he still wanted a hot shower. He had the plumbing fixed and installed a wood-burning stove himself. "I invested in some good tools and started working," he said. He eventually got proficient enough at DIY to build a comfortable kitchen. Because the boat is made of steel and lacked insulation, it was cold in winter. To combat this, he covered the floors with vintage rugs. There is, he said, "really an incredible difference between not having this on the floor and having these rugs on the floor."
Much of the designer furniture, including the Gufram cactus, was too big for the boat, so he put it in storage and moved the Tree Trunk chairs out to the garden. He saw no reason to part with the Koen sofa on which he had spent so many hours; he simply cut off the side and back frame to make it fit. "I took a photo and sent it to Piet Boon to congratulate him on his newest sofa design," he said.
Far from offended, Mr. Boon described Mr. Vintage in an email as "an entrepreneur who enjoys life to the fullest and has a knack for seizing opportunities. His trendsetting sensibilities mean he consistently brings fresh ideas to the table."
Mr. Vintage said he misses having a girlfriend, but conceded that it can be difficult to find someone he can be alone with.
"I am grateful for the past relationship and current friendship I have with my ex-wife, Esther," he said, "since she is the only one I can still be alone with." Because he finds working alone much more challenging than living by himself, he and Esther meet to work together two mornings a week.
Still, he is hardly antisocial. "In summer, I cook outside on the deck," he said. "Sometimes friends come over since my ship is the best place to have dinner when it's warm. If it's really hot, we jump in the water."
Lux finds her living arrangement ideal. "I make music and write my songs here," she wrote in an email about her 260-square-foot house on the shore. "I can sing as loud as I want. Living in a dorm, I wouldn't be able to sing or play guitar." In her father's apartment in The Hague, there was always a lot of city noise, she recalled. "Here, I wake up to the sounds of birds -- and I love it."
In 2022, Mr. Vintage started a new company, Dorbll, an app-driven video doorbell. In the past, he was a workaholic, going to bed at 1 a.m., getting up at various times to answer emails from different world markets. Now he works more reasonable hours.
"I need time for me, my daughters, my friends, my dog," he said. "I'm now 57, I make 10 percent of what I made before, I lead a comfortable, stress-less life, and I am very happy being by myself."

He founded a wallpaper business, NLXL, in 2010 with his wife, Esther Vintage, starting with images of wood planks for their beach house. “I put planks on the scanner, made prints and installed it in our living room,” he said. “I could smell it: This was going to be a worldwide success.”
But he worried that the design was too similar to work by Piet Hein Eek, whom he described as a design hero. “So I decided to send him a message to ask if he’d be interested in working with us.”
They became partners on the design, called Piet Hein Eek Scrapwood Wallpaper. Eek said, in an email, “I always make sure, in advance, that with whom I work it’s fun to work with and might be a friend. It turned out to be one of the most joyful collaborations till now, and we’re friends now.”
The Vintages expanded their offerings, adding digitally printed trompe l’oeil patterns, including embossed tin and weathered concrete, and the company became an overnight success. “We acquired 3,000 resellers in 70 countries in one year and a half. And I became rich,” Rick Vintage said. He got to meet many designers he admired, including English fashion luminary Paul Smith, who said upon being introduced, “I know who you are. You’re the wallpaper guy.” (Smith would later put NLXL wallpaper in the windows of his New York store, as would Saks Fifth Avenue.)
At the time, Vintage lived with his wife and two daughters in an 18th-century farmhouse in Voorburg, outside of The Hague. But the money and the fame turned him into, in his own words, “a bit of a prick.” The orders — and the cash — kept pouring in, and the company won numerous awards.
Belgian designer Job Smeets recalled the time, in 2014, his company, Studio Job, and Vintage shared an Elle Deco International Design Award for their collaboration on a hallucinatory wallpaper, called Industry, patterned with skulls, machine cogs and missiles. The awards ceremony was at a luxury hotel in Milan, and the audience was filled with design legends like Alessandro Mendini and Gaetano Pesce.
“Rick took the mic,” Smeets recounted, “and instead of giving a speech, he spontaneously started to sing, in a really beautiful baritone kind of voice, a phonetic Italian song that sounded totally Italian, but all the words were made up. And the whole crowd went crazy, everybody standing ovation, and it was like the best thing ever.”
In those days, many people told Vintage he was special. “And I guess I started to believe that I was,” he said. He bought expensive cars — three Porsches in one year — and was flying around the world. It was time for a change, but not necessarily the one he had intended.
In 2016, he and Esther Vintage divorced, and Vintage moved into an apartment in an ornate 1830 building in The Hague. It was boldly decorated with miles of designer wallpaper and clusters of trendy furniture, including a sleek Koen sofa by Piet Boon and Tree Trunk chairs by Eek. (Both Piets are Dutch designers and NLXL contributors.) There was also the ultimate display of bachelordom: fake plants, dominated by a surrealist Gufram cactus. The eye-catching space was written about extensively.
“Two years later I drove to a party in Rotterdam in my brand-new Porsche 911 GTS with my 20-years-younger girlfriend next to me,” he recounted. He was scared of the person he had become, he said, a man who didn’t know where his own daughters were. “This is when I really pulled the plug on all the traveling and all the glamour. And I started to live a different life. That’s how it all began.”
He split up with the girlfriend and spent the rest of the year on his Koen sofa, alone, with occasional depression and anxiety attacks. He wondered who he was without all the applause. “Somewhere, in the back of my head, I knew that I had always been very good at being alone, but I just didn’t remember how.”
Meanwhile, NLXL was losing a lot of money. Not only had Vintage taken a long hiatus from work after the divorce, but big and small companies had begun copying the collections. He sold his assets — including cars — to pay the bills and pared down the staff to just two people: he and his ex-wife.
Then came the pandemic; he contracted COVID-19. But somehow the enforced isolation become a comfort. “There I was — alone, broke, with COVID, no applause — and feeling better than ever,” he recalled.
He began to reconnect with his daughters. In 2020, Lux had just started studying music in college in Amsterdam, and he looked for a place in that city but found everything in the central area “crazy expensive.”
He spotted an ad for a houseboat with a garden on the edge of town. With Lux and his other daughter, Ella, now 21, who lives with her mother in Voorburg and studies nutrition, he went to have a look. Twenty-four hours later, he owned it.
Life on the Vrouwe Jacoba wasn’t always accommodating, Vintage said. “The toilet didn’t flush, the heating didn’t work and there was leakage everywhere. The interior — which I had decided not to change — was mainly yellowish ’70s wood strips, and the kitchen didn’t even have a stove.”
So gradually he made adjustments. Though he aspired to live without luxury, he still wanted a hot shower. He had the plumbing fixed and installed a wood-burning stove himself. “I invested in some good tools and started working,” he said. He eventually got proficient enough at DIY to build a comfortable kitchen. Because the boat is made of steel and lacked insulation, it was cold in winter. To combat this, he covered the floors with vintage rugs. There is, he said, “really an incredible difference between not having this on the floor and having these rugs on the floor.”
Much of the designer furniture, including the Gufram cactus, was too big for the boat, so he put it in storage and moved the Tree Trunk chairs out to the garden. He saw no reason to part with the Koen sofa on which he had spent so many hours; he simply cut off the side and back frame to make it fit. “I took a photo and sent it to Piet Boon to congratulate him on his newest sofa design,” he said.
Far from offended, Boon described Vintage in an email as “an entrepreneur who enjoys life to the fullest and has a knack for seizing opportunities. His trendsetting sensibilities mean he consistently brings fresh ideas to the table.”
Vintage said he misses having a girlfriend but conceded that it can be difficult to find someone he can be alone with.
“I am grateful for the past relationship and current friendship I have with my ex-wife, Esther,” he said, “since she is the only one I can still be alone with.” Because he finds working alone much more challenging than living by himself, he and Esther meet to work together two mornings a week.
Still, he is hardly antisocial. “In summer, I cook outside on the deck,” he said. “Sometimes friends come over, since my ship is the best place to have dinner when it’s warm. If it’s really hot, we jump in the water.”
Lux finds her living arrangement ideal. “I make music and write my songs here,” she wrote in an email about her 260-square-foot house on the shore. “I can sing as loud as I want. Living in a dorm, I wouldn’t be able to sing or play guitar.” In her father’s apartment in The Hague, there was always a lot of city noise, she recalled. “Here, I wake up to the sounds of birds — and I love it.”
In 2022, Vintage started a new company, Dorbll, an app-driven video doorbell. In the past, he was a workaholic, going to bed at 1 a.m. and getting up at various times to answer emails from different world markets. Now he works more reasonable hours.
“I need time for me, my daughters, my friends, my dog,” he said. “I’m now 57, I make 10% of what I made before, I lead a comfortable, stressless life, and I am very happy being by myself.”

At Costco, Shopping for Clues About Consumers: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The reporter Ben Ryder Howe traveled far and wide to better understand Americans' love of the membership-only retail store.
In March, Brian Gallagher, an editor for the Food section of The New York Times, texted me a question: Did I have strong feelings about Costco?
"You have found one of the few things I have no opinions on," I replied.
That wasn't exactly true. I had visited Costco once, about 20 years ago. Outside the store, a location in Brooklyn on the Sunset Park waterfront, people fought over parking spots. Inside, the aisles were so crowded that a passing shopping cart snagged my wired headphones and nearly dragged me down an aisle. It was not an experience I wanted to repeat.
But sometimes the best article ideas hide in plain sight. How many times had I passed a Costco truck on the highway, or seen a logo for Kirkland, Costco's private brand label, on a T-shirt? This is a company that influences the food we eat, the clothes we wear and the products that fill our pantries. Nearly one-third of all U.S. consumers shop at Costco. Still, I couldn't tell you more than a few basic facts about it.
Hoping to understand how the membership-only chain -- the third-largest retailer in the world -- had penetrated the American consumer psyche, I traveled around the country, visiting Costco warehouses and talking with current and former executives. My findings were published in a Times article this month.
The first step in my reporting process was to revisit that dreary Costco in Brooklyn. I had assumed the store had gotten a face-lift in the decades since I was last there. After all, over the past 20 years, Costco has nearly doubled the number of its locations, tripled its membership and increased profits by an astonishing 3,000 percent.
But when I showed up this spring, it looked almost exactly the same. Although the surrounding neighborhood had been gentrified over the past two decades -- a Porsche dealership had opened next door -- it was still the same old Costco warehouse.
As members who frequent this particular Costco will tell you, it is something of a zoo compared to other locations. (At least one shopper called it "America's worst Costco.") The parking lot is still a combat zone, overloaded with minivans where families divvy up their hauls.
Still, I began to appreciate Costco's no-frills presentation. Yes, the warehouses are austere. Yes, the shopping experience can be stressful. But it comes with a trade-off: As a consumer, you don't leave feeling exploited or bamboozled. At Costco, what you see is what you get.
I could relate to that retail approach. Twenty years ago, I owned a deli on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Deli owners can be obsessed with maintaining the trust of their customers, locals who depend on them to open their stores every day; to always stock the staples, like milk and beer; and to keep prices low. If you drop the ball, there's another store down the block. Costco had figured out that trust with customers was key.
Brian eventually encouraged me to visit a more exotic Costco location in Anchorage. Alaskans live in a harsh environment, and often travel by air or water to buy groceries. As a result, many residents stockpile food and other necessities. The fervor of Alaskans for Costco is renowned, and I wanted to see it in person.
The Anchorage store was mobbed, of course. But aside from a few Alaskan touches -- a flock of marauding ravens tried to snag a rotisserie chicken from an unattended shopping cart outside -- it looked almost exactly like the store in Brooklyn.
After my visit this summer, I began to consider a bigger question: How was Costco's retail model sustainable during an age when Americans seem increasingly fed up with big businesses?
If you trace Costco's roots, the person who most influenced the store was a lawyer from the Bronx named Sol Price, who invented the warehouse retail model in the 1950s. (He founded FedMart and Price Club, early big-box stores; Price Club eventually merged with Costco.) Like many small business owners, he hated credit cards, and liked to interact with customers. In other words, he was old school. So is Costco, which doesn't have a big media arm -- or even a public relations department -- which made reporting this article especially challenging.
I traveled this summer to a new warehouse opening in suburban Houston, hoping to speak with executives in attendance. After chasing a few down the aisles, I was finally able to speak with some, though most weren't very talkative. I left Houston with more questions than answers, including a big one: How did Costco resist going to the dark side, as in, putting profits over its members?
In a world where billions can be made on hype, here is a company with no media relations department, minimal advertising and no "How I Did It" memoirs by former chief executives.
Perhaps all of that is part of its success, and a story worth writing in the future.

A Facade of Hamptons Wealth Crumbles in Debt and Tragedy: [National Desk]

Full text: In the modern Gilded Age of New York, where Instagram is awash in unrestrained displays of wealth, Brandon and Candice Miller were royalty.
At their 10th wedding anniversary "Midsummer Night's Dream" party, they celebrated with a few dozen friends in the backyard of their 5,500-square-foot vacation home in the Hamptons.
Beautiful women in gowns watched with their handsome husbands as the couple renewed their vows near a swimming pool strewn with peonies and rose petals beneath a canopy of lights.
It was a grand public display of their perfect life and marriage. Ms. Miller told a lifestyle blogger who wrote about the party that her husband's speech "made me cry by the end with his authentic, raw emotion and romantic words."
It all culminated in the kind of envy-inducing images anticipated by the roughly 80,000 followers of "Mama and Tata," Ms. Miller's popular Instagram feed, which featured a near-constant stream of photographs and videos of her glittering life.
The Midsummer Night party was in 2019. Five years later, the glamorous image that Ms. Miller cultivated and promoted has disappeared, replaced with heartbreak, anger and a mountain of once-secret debt.
Her husband is gone. The home they so ostentatiously lived in, saddled by several mortgages, is not truly their own. Lawsuits from creditors, business bankruptcies, botched investments and even a repossessed boat -- the "Miller Time" -- indicate that the wealth needed to maintain their lifestyle had evaporated, if it ever truly existed.
Mr. Miller, 43, died on July 3 at a Southampton hospital. A suicide note indicated he had killed himself while his wife and children were on vacation on Italy's Amalfi Coast, according to a Suffolk County law enforcement official. He said Mr. Miller wrote that a business deal he had hoped would ease the family's financial strain had collapsed.
His family was stunned. When Ms. Miller was contacted for comment, a family spokesman said she and the children were overwhelmed by grief. "Candice is devastated by the loss of her soul mate, and her two young daughters' lives are forever impacted by the loss of their beloved daddy," he said.
The Millers' downfall has become the focus of obsessive talk in the Hamptons and among internet sleuths who have scoured Ms. Miller's social media presence for clues to what went wrong.
This account of the family's rise and fall is drawn from property records, legal filings and interviews with those who knew and worked with Mr. Miller. Because of the sensitivity of the subject, few agreed to be cited by name.
That Mr. Miller's death occurred in the Hamptons during the height of the social season almost certainly has added to the intrigue, said Neil J. Young, a historian who is writing a book about the Hamptons. Here, the only thing as fascinating as opulent wealth is its sudden disintegration.
"This place is predicated, for a certain set, on showing off," Dr. Young said. "It's the homes one has, the things one does out here -- from the restaurants to the workouts to the parties. But it's a place where one can get overextended really quickly, where a house of cards can suddenly collapse."
A chasm separated the Millers' shimmering public lives and painful private reality. But their fall is also a source of very real grief -- a story about trying to have it all, and what happens when you cannot.
"What people aren't discussing in all of this is the loss of my little brother, someone I have loved unconditionally," Mr. Miller's sister, Maurley Miller, said in a statement after being contacted by The New York Times. "I have a hole in my heart that will never be filled. I am completely devastated."
'Mama and Tata'
Perhaps no place in America is as perfectly Instagram-ready as the Hamptons, where striking natural beauty and extravagant wealth are juxtaposed in abundance. Lifestyle and fashion influencers spend their summers at the eastern end of Long Island, documenting their sumptuous lives.
Ms. Miller, 42, added to that canon when she and her sister, Jenna Crespi, started the "Mama and Tata" website and Instagram account in 2016 to provide fashion, shopping and decorating tips for wealthy women.
The account highlighted people in Ms. Miller's orbit, like Ivanka Trump and Ms. Miller's cousin-by-marriage, Arielle Charnas, an Instagram personality who influenced her influencer aspirations. The fitness impresario Tracy Anderson and the fashion designer Rachel Zoe made regular appearances.
But it mostly showcased Ms. Miller's personal life and tastes. "Mama and Tata" became an alter ego and self-promotional marketing machine. Ms. Miller and some friends even started a fashion label that she celebrated with a launch party at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Her followers got regular glimpses of her active social life against the backdrop of grand homes in Manhattan and Southampton, European resorts, private planes, classic sports cars and speedboats.
She was known for her vintage designer gowns and for private fitness sessions (about $ 250 per hour on top of $ 900 monthly studio membership fees) that she filmed and shared online.
The Miller children's birthdays were also an opportunity for Ms. Miller to entertain on a grand scale -- for friends and for online fans. A Coachella-themed party for one daughter spawned a torrent of Instagram posts tagging the vendors Ms. Miller hired: a party planner, a florist and a DJ. Helping to keep it all afloat were nannies, housekeepers, drivers, boat captains and personal chefs.
But while "Mama and Tata" reveled in luxury, it spent no time delving into how the splendor was being paid for.
Though Ms. Miller poured time into her Instagram feed, it did not generate much revenue. Instead, "Mama and Tata" enhanced her profile in other ways.
In a 2019 article for an online magazine about the Millers' Manhattan home -- "our townhouse in the sky," she called it -- she posed for photographs with her two young daughters. The living room was decorated in all white, down to the white-spined books on the shelves. "It is so beautiful to sit in, as long as you aren't wearing anything that bleeds, and exclusively drinking water," she said.
Mr. Miller, on the other hand, eschewed social media -- he primarily used a flip phone. Friends described him as a movie buff, basketball fan and car aficionado.
But when it came to his wife's devotion to sharing their life online, she said he was all in. "I have the most supportive husband who encourages me to do whatever I love," she told a lifestyle blog.
Off camera, they maintained traditional separations of duties, said a person familiar with their family dynamics. Ms. Miller oversaw the daily care of the children, and Mr. Miller focused on his business, which they rarely discussed.
She had visited his office only once, and she met his business partner just three times -- including, most recently, beside her husband's grave.
'People who can lose everything'
Brandon Miller developed commercial and residential projects in TriBeCa, Harlem and the Meatpacking District. He appeared to be a successful businessman in a city filled with them.
Yet by last fall, he was under so much pressure that when he attended a business meeting in a Midtown high rise, according to three people familiar with what happened, Mr. Miller sat at a conference table and began to weep.
He was in a financial free-fall that confidants are now struggling to piece together.
Mr. Miller began working in real estate a few years after graduating from Brown University, joining his father's firm. Early in his marriage, the company developed a residential building in TriBeCa, and Mr. Miller acquired Unit 3 -- the penthouse -- for his family.
He and his father also bought two connecting lots in the Hamptons, one on the water and one behind it. They built homes on both, and sold one on the open market. Mr. Miller kept the other -- a lavish home with expansive grounds that easily accommodated sit-down dinners for 60 friends.
The homes acquired from his father's firm allowed the Millers to live as if they were mega-millionaires.
But Mr. Miller's primary focus was commercial development. In a typical project, he raised money from investors to secure a long-term lease on a parcel of land before commissioning architects to plan a building. Once permits were in place, he sold the lease, the building plan and its permits to another developer for a profit, or took on more debt to cover construction costs.
Even when such projects go smoothly, the work can require developers to leverage many assets to secure loans that will carry them through the process.
"You're dealing with people who can lose everything," said Jay Neveloff, a real estate lawyer in New York.
Mr. Miller's father, Michael Miller, managed that risk for many years, but his assets were highly leveraged when he died unexpectedly in 2016. His company and survivors were hit with lawsuits.
After his father's death, Mr. Miller took over the company, alongside his father's former partner. But soon, the pandemic made a challenging business even more difficult, as the city's real estate market plunged. And while the residential market rebounded, the demand for office space did not return to prepandemic levels.
Mr. Miller found himself in a financial crunch. In 2021, near the bottom of the pandemic market, he sold the family's TriBeCa home for just over $ 9 million, according to city records. The family set their sights on living uptown, in the type of co-op building that Mr. Miller had grown up in. But buying on the Upper East Side would have required significant cash.
Instead, they rented a 4,382-square-foot, five-bedroom apartment on the corner of Park Avenue and East 71st Street, according to court records -- keeping up appearances for $ 47,000 per month. They decorated with rented furniture for which they paid $ 180,000 for one year, according to a lawsuit filed this spring, and $ 12,000 per month after the first year.
If this was downsizing, it wasn't enough.
Mr. Miller stopped paying some of the family's bills, including, according to a lawsuit, the maintenance and docking fees for their Van Dutch speedboat -- a frequent backdrop for late-night parties shared on Instagram. Such models generally sell for more than $ 1 million.
And he leveraged the family's prize asset, the Hamptons home, piling one mortgage atop another. He took out a $ 6.1 million loan from a conventional bank. Then, records show, he arranged another $ 2 million mortgage from a company that advertised cash loans that close in less than 24 hours.
The Millers continued to entertain in high style. In August 2022, they hosted a "Love Boat" party at Duryea's, a beachfront restaurant in Montauk. Ms. Miller posed for photos with friends in a sleek white dress.
But Mr. Miller's desperation was growing. A few weeks later, he borrowed yet more money against the house: a $ 2 million mortgage from a lender in Naples, Fla., facilitated by a family friend, Ryan Nivakoff, who contributed cash to the loan, according to public records and three people familiar with the Millers' finances. Mr. Nivakoff declined to comment.
None of this was apparent to Ms. Miller's online audience. In a video posted by Hamptons Magazine last July, Ms. Miller, in a strapless summer dress, answered questions about her preferred hot spots. Chicest shopping? "Chanel, East Hampton," Ms. Miller answered.
A fateful meeting
By the fall of 2023, Mr. Miller could no longer hide the strain. His friends, aware of both his family's expensive lifestyle and the sluggish real estate market, assumed he was struggling with debt.
Three of them arranged an intervention of sorts, according to three people familiar with the meeting.
The day before the meeting, the friends spoke by phone to discuss their approach. As they did, one of them searched the internet for a property that Mr. Miller was ostensibly developing in Brooklyn. The friend had invested $ 1 million in the project and had encouraged several colleagues to invest an additional $ 500,000 in all.
What he found online was alarming: The property had been purchased more than a month earlier by a developer with no connection to Mr. Miller.
Mr. Miller arrived at the meeting looking glum, according to three people familiar with what happened. He had just visited his father's grave on the seventh anniversary of his death -- an event from which those close to Brandon say he never fully recovered.
The friend who had given him money for the Brooklyn project told Mr. Miller that he felt misled and angry.
Mr. Miller broke down in tears. He insisted he had not done anything wrong but lamented that he had let his friend down.
The friend became teary-eyed and walked out. After a 15-year friendship, he and Mr. Miller never spoke again.
Reached for comment, the friend said their fractured relationship and Mr. Miller's death have devastated him, and he otherwise asked for privacy. He has told others that he believed Mr. Miller had sincerely intended to use his money as a business investment before the deal went awry. Then, he believed, Mr. Miller let his financial burdens cloud his judgment.
Mr. Miller's business troubles did not abate. He took over a land lease near the High Line in Manhattan that would require annual payments of more than $ 2 million, according to a person familiar with the transaction. He immediately borrowed $ 1.5 million against it, according to public filings and people familiar with the transaction.
Within months, Mr. Miller fell behind in making the lease payments, Benny Barmapov, the landowner, said in an interview.
The pressure intensified when a private equity firm that had lent Mr. Miller's company $ 36 million to help finance a development tried to collect on the overdue repayment.
At home, creditors were demanding money too. The marina that serviced the Millers' boat sued for $ 55,000. The furniture rental company claimed in a lawsuit that he owed $ 100,000 in fees and had refused to return $ 64,000 in borrowed furniture.
Although his friends could sense something was wrong, Ms. Miller has said she was unaware of the family's financial crisis, according to two people familiar with her thinking.
In January she was quoted in The Times, extolling the benefits of an $ 800 facial over filler injections and plastic surgery. "This makes you feel like your face doesn't need that stuff," Ms. Miller said, "if you're truly committing to going every week or every other week."
A canceled vacation
Earlier this year, the Millers were invited to spend a few days in the Bahamas at the home of Mr. Nivakoff, the friend who had helped underwrite one of Mr. Miller's mortgages. But as the trip approached, Mr. Nivakoff wanted Mr. Miller to tell his wife about the debt or forget about the trip, according to two people with knowledge of the discussion.
Mr. Miller canceled the trip, but Mr. Nivakoff did not relent.
In May, he called Ms. Miller directly, according to two people she told, and informed her that her husband owed him money. Her family, Mr. Nivakoff told her, was broke. Her house was carrying several mortgages, including one he had invested in.
Ms. Miller confronted her husband and asked to see their financial documents. He arranged a call with a lawyer to reassure her and eventually persuaded her that everything was under control.
Even then, their financial straits were growing more perilous. In early June, he borrowed $ 208,000 against the house from a company offering short-term loans. He never paid it back, according to the lender.
Later that month, the family had plans to travel to Europe, but Mr. Miller told his wife he had to stay home to close a deal that would help their financial situation, according to three people familiar with the discussion. He encouraged her and the children to go without him -- after all, he told her, the trip was already paid for.
Ms. Miller took their daughters abroad and posted photographs from Spain and Italy. Only later did they learn the trip had not been paid for; after her credit card was declined, her travel agent had to guarantee the hotel bill would be paid.
On June 28, Mr. Miller texted his wife to tell her the deal intended to ease their money crisis had closed, according to two people familiar with the situation.
But he also reached out to at least one friend that week for a loan that should have been pocket change for someone like him: $ 1,000, according to two people aware of the request. On June 29, he attended a polo match and barbecue in the Hamptons.
On June 30, the police were notified that a carbon monoxide alarm had gone off at the Millers' home. Emergency medical workers found Mr. Miller unconscious in a white Porsche Carrera that he had rigged to poison himself, a Suffolk County law enforcement official said. Rescue workers found a photo of him, his wife and their children in the car.
Mr. Miller was rushed to a hospital and placed on life support.
In an email left for his wife, Mr. Miller admitted he had lied. The business deal he hoped would save them had fallen apart, he said.
He expressed his love for his wife and children. He wrote that he believed he was doing what was best for them -- the note mentioned two life insurance policies totaling about $ 15 million. He wrote that he had struggled against dark feelings for years.
In a graveside ceremony attended by family and a small circle of friends, he was laid to rest next to his father.
The dismantling of their dream life began almost immediately. A mortgage lender sued Ms. Miller for $ 800,000 in missed payments and interest. The Miller Time was repossessed. And the "Mama and Tata" Instagram account was pulled offline.

In the modern Gilded Age of New York, where Instagram is awash in unrestrained displays of wealth, Brandon and Candice Miller were royalty.
At their 10th wedding anniversary “Midsummer Night’s Dream” party, they celebrated with a few dozen friends in the backyard of their 5,500-square-foot vacation home in the Hamptons.
Beautiful women in gowns watched with their handsome husbands as the couple renewed their vows near a swimming pool strewed with peonies and rose petals beneath a canopy of lights.
It all culminated in the kind of envy-inducing images anticipated by the roughly 80,000 followers of “Mama and Tata,” Candice Miller’s popular Instagram feed.
The Midsummer Night party was in 2019. Five years later, the glamorous image that Candice Miller cultivated and promoted has disappeared, replaced with heartbreak, anger and once-secret debt.
Her husband is gone. The home they so ostentatiously lived in, saddled by several mortgages, is not truly their own. Lawsuits from creditors, business bankruptcies, botched investments and even a repossessed boat — called Miller Time — indicate that the wealth needed to maintain their lifestyle had evaporated, if it ever truly existed.
Brandon Miller, 43, died July 3 at a Southampton hospital. A suicide note indicated he had killed himself while his wife and children were on vacation on Italy’s Amalfi Coast, according to a Suffolk County law enforcement official. He said Brandon Miller wrote that a business deal he had hoped would ease the family’s financial strain had collapsed.
His family was stunned. When Candice Miller was contacted for comment, a family spokesperson said she and the children were overwhelmed by grief. “Candice is devastated by the loss of her soulmate, and her two young daughters’ lives are forever impacted by the loss of their beloved daddy,” he said.
The Millers’ downfall has become the focus of obsessive talk in the Hamptons and among internet sleuths who have scoured Candice Miller’s social media presence for clues to what went wrong.
This account of the family’s rise and fall is drawn from property records, legal filings and interviews with those who knew and worked with Brandon Miller. Because of the sensitivity of the subject, few agreed to be cited by name.
A chasm separated the Millers’ shimmering public lives and painful private reality.
“What people aren’t discussing in all of this is the loss of my little brother, someone I have loved unconditionally,” Miller’s sister, Maurley Miller, said in a statement after being contacted by The New York Times. “I have a hole in my heart that will never be filled.”
Perhaps no place in America is as perfectly Instagram-ready as the Hamptons, where striking natural beauty and extravagant wealth are juxtaposed in abundance. Lifestyle and fashion influencers spend their summers at the eastern end of Long Island, documenting their sumptuous lives.
Candice Miller, 42, added to that canon when she and her sister, Jenna Crespi, started the “Mama and Tata” website and Instagram account in 2016 to provide fashion, shopping and decorating tips for wealthy women.
The account highlighted people in Miller’s orbit, including Ivanka Trump.
But it mostly showcased Candice Miller’s personal life and tastes. “Mama and Tata” became an alter ego and self-promotional marketing machine.
Brandon Miller, on the other hand, eschewed social media — he primarily used a flip phone.
Off camera, they maintained traditional separations of duties, said a person familiar with their family dynamics. Candice Miller oversaw the daily care of the children, and Brandon Miller focused on his business, which they rarely discussed.
Miller developed commercial and residential projects in New York City’s Tribeca, Harlem and the Meatpacking District.
Yet, by fall of 2023, he was under so much pressure that when he attended a business meeting in a midtown high-rise, according to three people familiar with what happened, he sat at a conference table and began to weep.
Miller began working in real estate a few years after graduating from Brown University, joining his father’s firm. Early in his marriage, the company developed a residential building in Tribeca, and he acquired Unit 3 — the penthouse — for his family.
He and his father also bought two connecting lots in the Hamptons — one on the water and one behind it. They built homes on both and sold one on the open market. Brandon Miller kept the other, a lavish home with expansive grounds.
The homes acquired from his father’s firm allowed the Millers to live as if they were megamillionaires.
But Miller’s primary focus was commercial development. In a typical project, he raised money from investors to secure a long-term lease on a parcel of land before commissioning architects to plan a building. Once permits were in place, he sold the lease, the building plan and its permits to another developer for a profit, or took on more debt to cover construction costs.
Even when such projects go smoothly, the work can require developers to leverage many assets to secure loans that will carry them through the process.
Miller’s father, Michael Miller, managed that risk for many years, but his assets were highly leveraged when he died unexpectedly in 2016. His company and survivors were hit with lawsuits.
After his father’s death, Miller took over the company, alongside his father’s former partner. But soon, the pandemic made a challenging business even more difficult, as the city’s real estate market plunged.
Miller found himself in a financial crunch. In 2021, near the bottom of the pandemic market, he sold the family’s Tribeca home for just over $9 million, according to city records.
They rented a 4,382-square-foot, five-bedroom apartment on the corner of Park Avenue and East 71st Street, according to court records — keeping up appearances for $47,000 per month. They decorated with rented furniture for which they paid $180,000 for one year, according to a lawsuit.
If this was downsizing, it wasn’t enough.
Miller stopped paying some of the family’s bills. And he leveraged the family’s prize asset, the Hamptons home, piling one mortgage atop another. He took out a $6.1 million loan from a conventional bank. Then, records show, he arranged another $2 million mortgage from a company that advertised cash loans that close in less than 24 hours.
The Millers continued to entertain in high style. In August 2022, they hosted a “Love Boat” party at Duryea’s, a beachfront restaurant in Montauk.
But Miller’s desperation was growing. A few weeks later, he borrowed yet more money against the house: a $2 million mortgage from a lender in Naples, Florida, facilitated by a family friend, Ryan Nivakoff, who contributed cash to the loan, according to public records and three people familiar with the Millers’ finances.
Earlier this year, the Millers were invited to spend a few days in the Bahamas at the home of Nivakoff. But as the trip approached, Nivakoff wanted Miller to tell his wife about the debt or forget about the trip, according to two people with knowledge of the discussion.
Miller canceled the trip, but Nivakoff did not relent.
In May, he called Candice Miller directly, according to two people she told, and informed her that her husband owed him money. Her family, Nivakoff told her, was broke. Her house was carrying several mortgages.
Miller confronted her husband and asked to see their financial documents. He arranged a call with a lawyer to reassure her and eventually convinced her that everything was under control.
Their financial straits were growing more perilous. In early June, Brandon Miller borrowed $208,000 against the house from a company offering short-term loans. He never paid it back, according to the lender.
Later that month, the family had plans to travel to Europe, but Miller told his wife he had to stay home to close a deal that would help their financial situation, according to three people familiar with the discussion. He encouraged her and the children to go without him.
On June 28, Miller texted his wife to tell her the deal intended to ease their money crisis had closed, according to two people familiar with the situation.
On June 30, police were notified that a carbon monoxide alarm had gone off at the Millers’ home. Emergency medical workers found Miller unconscious in a white Porsche Carrera that he had rigged to poison himself, a Suffolk County law enforcement official said. Rescue workers found in the car a photo of him, his wife and their children.
Miller was rushed to a hospital and placed on life support.
In an email left for his wife, Miller admitted he had lied. The business deal he hoped would save them had fallen apart, he said.
He expressed his love for his wife and children. He wrote that he believed he was doing what was best for them — the note mentioned two life insurance policies totaling about $15 million. He wrote that he had struggled against dark feelings for years.
In a graveside ceremony, he was laid to rest next to his father.
The dismantling of their dream life began almost immediately. A mortgage lender sued Candice Miller for $800,000 in missed payments and interest. Miller Time was repossessed. And the “Mama and Tata” Instagram account was pulled offline.

The Radical Message of 'Sweet Valley High': [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When news broke that Francine Pascal, creator of the "Sweet Valley High" universe, died last weekend at the age of 92, appreciations began rolling across the internet like a certain red Spider through a high school parking lot. "Wildly popular," "staple of my girlhood," "G.O.A.T. of publishing," readers proclaimed. Nostalgic and bereaved, I drove to the library to check out a few, only to discover they had been removed from the catalog.
"Yes, I knew they were terrible," one patron confessed in a review. "But I loved them."
This backhanded praise would have been familiar to Ms. Pascal, whose literary talents were either sneered at or dismissed for decades. Even as her franchise blanketed best-seller lists -- 200 million books and counting, thanks to teenage readers like me -- she, and they, received astonishingly little media coverage.
For those affected by the blackout, the Sweet Valley universe comprises hundreds of novels and numerous spinoffs, all set in the eponymous Southern California town and starring Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield, identical twins with blue-green eyes, shining blond hair and sky-high ambitions -- Elizabeth's literary, Jessica's social. Observing their adventures, a 2012 article in The Guardian struck a typical tone when it declared that "the story lines are, often, ridiculous."
Which is a ridiculous insult, not to mention a misreading, for to come to Sweet Valley for the story lines is to subscribe to Playboy for the articles. Criticizing the narrative arc of the books misses and, tellingly, demeans what for me was the entire point of the series: a rare portal through which we girls growing up in the 1980s and '90s could explore our erotic potential.
I don't mean erotic in the pornographic sense -- although, OK, sometimes the books pointed mildly in that direction -- but as Audre Lorde defined it, the meeting place of "our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings."
In 1983, the year both "Double Love" (Sweet Valley No. 1) and I were born, girls needed that meeting place. Back then, female desire was as terrifying as full-fat yogurt. Raised under the tyranny of Christian virtue, thanks to a minister father and prudish mother, I took solace in Sweet Valley, absconding to my room for days at a time with a tote full of library paperbacks that my mother, thank God, never skimmed for quality control. At age 10, I was free to read and reread as many PG-13 scenes as I liked, including this passage from "Playing With Fire" (Sweet Valley No. 3), where Jessica embarks on a dangerous affair with the Porsche-driving Bruce Patman:
"He responded by turning his face to hers and kissing her hard, his arms crushing her against him, his mouth demanding what his body wanted to take."
The line precedes a sultry encounter that, like Proust's madeleine, has had such staying power in my consciousness that for years I've joked it makes up the bulk of my sexual identity. As I've relayed it to friends, often in an attempt to explain my weakness for forbidden romance, Jessica puts on a tiny red bikini to swim in a lake with Bruce, who kisses her while sneakily untying the strings. Topless, Jessica is both scared and turned on, and Bruce is rough and amused. They hook up in the bushes until her twin, Elizabeth, interrupts them, horrified that her sister might take things too far.
The other night, curious how far, if at all, my memory veered from the text, I downloaded the e-book and was pleased to discover not only that my memory was impeccable but also that the scene was still hot. In fact, the writing reminded me of something I'd read in my 20s, so I ran downstairs, grabbed my copy of "Lady Chatterley's Lover" and, lo and behold, found this:
"His body was urgent against her, and she didn't have the heart anymore to fight ... a strange weight was on her limbs. She was giving way."
If you squint -- you don't even have to squint hard -- D.H. Lawrence's imagery is indistinguishable from Ms. Pascal's. Like her, Lawrence was ridiculed for writing about female sexuality. Unlike her, Lawrence was a man, and his efforts to put words to desire were, eventually, touted as genius. Unlike her, Lawrence was never an author I cottoned to. I found his prose stifling, like being trapped in an overheated room with a close talker.
But Ms. Pascal keeps her sultry scenes frank and short, and in the encounter above, she toggles back and forth between the twins' point of view. She said in many interviews that Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield could be understood as one person, the good and bad in each of us, which meant that for half of each novel, we were encouraged to identify with Jessica, our inner baddie. In "Double Love" alone, Jessica goes barhopping with an older guy, gets picked up by the police, lies to the police, identifies herself as Elizabeth and steals Elizabeth's crush for the school dance. Throughout the series, Jessica knows what she wants -- boys, popularity, besting her sister -- and pursues it with a near-sociopathic zeal. Because the two girls are twins, neither perspective dominates. There is no main character. There is complexity.
Until I encountered Jessica Wakefield, I had no idea that a girl could not only have such desires but also act them out to their natural conclusion (sex, mayhem). Ms. Pascal, in an introduction to her e-books, wrote, "Unlike the Sleeping Beauty version of romance novels, where the heroine has to wait for the wake-up kiss, in my series the girls would drive the action." This remains a radical choice. Even in the beloved "Baby-Sitters Club" universe, Sweet Valley High's chaste younger sibling, heroines may endure hardship -- the death of a parent, diabetes, racism -- but they never create it. Their desires are sweet and clean -- to be a prima ballerina, for example -- and cause no havoc for others.
Jessica was all havoc, Elizabeth protected her from it, Bruce Patman loved it, and secreted away in my childhood bedroom, my eyes flicking over the page, I got to try out the idea of being each of them. My experience correlates with research done by Marta Meana at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and her colleagues, who found that when looking at erotic and nonerotic images of heterosexual couples, straight women's eyes lingered on both sexes evenly. We want to desire, and we want to be the object of desire. For the first time, the chaste minister's daughter within me met her dream boy and her sexually adventurous alter ego, and there, curled up on my corduroy papasan chair, all three of us belonged.
"I don't know that they're all going to go on to 'War and Peace,"' Ms. Pascal modestly told People magazine in 1988, speaking of her readers, "but we have created readers out of nonreaders." As a reader who did go on to "War and Peace," I can say confidently that Ms. Pascal understood my desires more than Tolstoy ever did. Tolstoy punished female desire with suicide and "rewarded" the beautiful, virginal Natasha with a brood of children and a sexless, tanklike competence at the end of his Great Book. By the end of "Sweet Valley Confidential," Ms. Pascal's reboot, Jessica marries Elizabeth's ex-fiancé Todd, with whom she had had a torrid affair, and Elizabeth ends up with the one and only Bruce Patman. (Interestingly, Jessica is also trying to read "War and Peace.") I'm not saying it's a Great Book, but I am saying that greatness resides in many places that critics miss, and even Great Books, especially ones written by men, have plenty of limitations. Tolstoy wrote so readers could understand the world, but Ms. Pascal wrote so girls could understand themselves. Which was not only great for a girl like me but also, dare I say, an act of genius.

The Corvette's Revival Doesn't Ensure Success For Electric Versions: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Lawrence, Ulrich

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales of sports cars have been steadily declining for about three decades, but there has been one exception to that trend. The Chevrolet Corvette has recently stormed back to near-record popularity.
Like the company that makes it, General Motors, the Corvette must now slalom around a trickier obstacle: transitioning to an electrified lineup, even as most sports-car buyers insist they have no interest in switching from gas pumps to plugs.
G.M. sold 53,785 of the eighth-generation Corvettes, or C8s, worldwide last year, just 22 shy of its top sales year in 1979. Americans bought about 34,000 of those, including Stingray coupes that start from $ 66,000, nearly twice as many Corvettes as they bought in 2019.
The car's revival has been driven by a change that may not seem a big deal to the average commuter. After seven decades as a classic front-engine two-seater, Chevrolet moved its V-8 behind the passengers, a midengine design typically associated with supercars from Ferrari or Lamborghini. Engineers at G.M. chose the $ 250,000 Ferrari 458 Italia as a target in performance and technology.
Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a marketing research company, said the Corvette's more exotic recent design, relatively affordable prices and unapologetic attitude had driven its success.
"They delivered an authentic sports car, and that authenticity is such an important part of the purchase decision," Mr. Edwards said.
The Corvette's recent sales gains have bucked a broad trend of American drivers moving away from cars, especially sports cars and coupes, and toward sport-utility vehicles. Two-door cars like the Audi TT and the Mercedes SLK have disappeared. Toyota's reborn Supra sold fewer than 2,700 cars last year, less than one-tenth of Corvette's sales. Sales of what the industry calls "enthusiast cars" have fallen by half since 2000, to 223,000 last year, according to Motor Intelligence.
Even relatively affordable sports cars have struggled. The Ford Mustang, which racked up sales of 120,000 in 2015, managed fewer than 59,000 last year. G.M. has retired the Chevrolet Camaro and Stellantis has done away with the Dodge Challenger. Daniel Pund, editor in chief of Road & Track magazine, said many consumers drawn to fast, fashionable cars had shifted to luxury sport-utility vehicles or electric vehicles. Some potential buyers "are scared to drive a small, low car when everything else is a tall S.U.V.," Mr. Pund said.
Corvette appears to have avoided that fate in large part because of its decision to move the engine.
Tadge Juechter, who is retiring as the fifth Corvette chief engineer since the car's 1953 unveiling, said the median age of its buyer had been rising by roughly one year each year, topping out around 64. He knew that was unsustainable.
"It was a comfortable car for our traditional customers, but you're not going to sell a significant number to 100-year-olds," Mr. Juechter said.
A midengine Corvette, which some G.M. engineers and executives had considered since the 1960s, was meant to shake things up, including a design that could support future hybrid and electric versions. But some people at G.M. got cold feet. Mr. Juechter recalled "a strong push" to offer both the existing C7 and redesigned Corvette C8s in showrooms to keep its Bowling Green, Ky., factory humming and avoid alienating loyalists.
Executives eventually realized that when G.M. offered the C8, "we won't sell any of those old ones," Mr. Juechter said. "The midengine car was highly controversial, but in hindsight it looks brilliant," he added.
Brad Franz, Chevrolet's director of car and crossover marketing, said the C8 continued to attract boomers, while pulling a demographic coup: Its median buyer age has fallen to 55 from 64 over the last six years.
Mr. Pund recently met fanatical 'Vette owners during a driving tour from Bowling Green, where a Corvette museum sits near the factory, to North Carolina. He said G.M. had underestimated its customers' willingness to evolve with the car.
"Those owners don't think of the C8 as something radical," Mr. Pund said. "They just think of it as a new Corvette."
G.M. hopes to build on that momentum with an expanded lineup that now includes the 2024 Corvette E-Ray, the first hybrid version of the model and one of the first among mass-produced sports cars; Porsche will follow by year's end with a hybrid version of its 911 model.
Mr. Franz said G.M.'s early sales data suggested that the hybrid Corvette was attracting more college-educated, higher-income buyers.
I recently test drove the E-Ray in the Berkshires. Moving the engine -- a 495-horsepower V-8 -- behind the seats improves acceleration and handling, by keeping more weight in the car's center. It also clears room below the hood for an electric motor that sends 160 horsepower to front wheels, for a total 655 horsepower and an unfair fight against strictly gasoline-powered cars.
The result is the fastest-accelerating Corvette yet with a zero to 60 miles-per-hour time of 2.5 seconds. Its electric helping hand allows the E-Ray to run its engine in four-cylinder mode more often, bringing highway fuel efficiency to a federally rated 24 miles per gallon, versus 25 for a standard Stingray with 160 fewer horsepower.
A tiny hybrid battery slots into the center tunnel between the driver and passenger. And while the E-Ray requires no plug, the car's battery never runs dry because the car can fully recharge it in two to three miles of normal driving simply by recapturing braking energy.
Mr. Edwards said luring buyers to electrified Corvettes, or any two-seater, is not about a green pitch. "You talk about added performance, innovation or value," he said. "You don't call it an environmentally friendly sports car."
A fully electric Corvette might be next. G.M.'s president, Mark Reuss, said on LinkedIn in 2022 that the company would offer an electric Corvette "in the future," but the company has declined to provide any details.
Sports cars appear to be the final frontier for electrification. Most car enthusiasts became wedded to the signature sounds and driving character of favorite brands or models of internal-combustion engine cars from an early age, Mr. Juechter said. Many are deeply skeptical that electric versions can reproduce or replace them, despite any advantage in straight-line acceleration. A key objection is batteries that add too much weight, dulling the handling of what are supposed to be featherweight and agile cars. Finding enough space in these compact cars for batteries large enough to deliver satisfactory range is another challenge.
No automaker is mass-producing an electric two-seat sports car for the United States or Europe, although Porsche intends to replace its slow-selling gasoline-powered Boxster and Cayman models with electric versions next year. Ferrari says it will come out with its first electric car in 2026.
A survey of American car owners by Strategic Vision this year found that 56 percent were "absolutely not interested" in an electric vehicle, up from 51 percent in 2023. That rises to 60 percent for Corvette owners. Mr. Edwards said Chevrolet appears wise to keep offering gas, hybrid and, eventually, electric Corvettes.
"If you say pure E.V., a lot of Corvette people are going to walk away," he said. G.M. will "have an easier road if they have a balanced portfolio."
Mr. Edwards added that while G.M.'s electric cars were often impressive, the company had often fumbled their introductions. And G.M. hasn't done enough to persuade many of its customers to consider the new technology.
"They need to create that bridge from where they are, to where customers are going to be," he said. "Historically, G.M. has not done a good job of understanding how to talk to future and current customers without ticking everyone off."
G.M. executives said the E-Ray was expressly designed to be the most customer-friendly Corvette. Electricity is the secret sauce that allows all-wheel-drive, track-level performance and efficiency.
"Long before we announced the E-Ray, we had customers hollering at us, 'You'd better not make an electric Corvette!"' Mr. Juechter said. "But the E-Ray is a perfect mechanism to not be afraid of electricity, to show it can do great stuff for you."
Mr. Juechter said the Corvette, with its cultural familiarity and all-American image, could be an ambassador for electrification. That may be especially helpful in the Midwest and South, where the Corvette has a devoted following and electric vehicles are not as popular as they are on the coasts.
"The E-Ray is a great look at what the Corvette could become," he said.

AT&T Outage Blocked
Over 92 Million Calls
A nationwide AT&T Wireless outage in February that lasted over 12 hours blocked more than 92 million voice calls and prevented more than 25,000 attempts to reach 911, according to report released Monday.
The Federal Communications Commission's report came after a five-month investigation, which led the agency to refer the matter to its enforcement bureau for potential violations of F.C.C. rules, which could result in a fine.
The F.C.C. said all voice and 5G data services for customers were unavailable during the outage affecting more than 125 million devices.
The incident began after AT&T implemented a network change with an equipment configuration error, the F.C.C. said.
The agency added that network operators must adhere to their internal procedures and industry best practices when implementing network changes. REUTERS

AMC Creditors Agree
To Extend Debt Deadlines
AMC Entertainment said on Monday it had reached an agreement with creditors that extends up to $ 2.45 billion of debt maturities from 2026 to 2029 and beyond.
The agreement will also allow AMC to reduce debt by $ 464 million by converting exchangeable notes into equity.
The company had been grappling with the aftermath of the Hollywood strikes last year that shut down productions and affected theater chains across the country.
Under the terms of the deal, AMC will issue $ 1.2 billion of new secured term loans due 2029 in consideration for an open market purchase of senior secured term loans due 2026.
AMC and its units will also issue about $ 414 million of exchangeable notes for cash, with proceeds used to repurchase roughly $ 414 million of second-lien notes. REUTERS

Porsche Pulls Back
On Its E.V. Sales Goals
The luxury carmaker Porsche said on Monday that it expected the transition to electric vehicles to take longer than its previous aim of 80 percent of all sales by 2030.
It has now watered down that goal by tying it explicitly to customer demand and developments in the electromobility sector, saying only that it could now deliver on the 80 percent target if those factors warrant it.
Executives at carmakers from Mercedes-Benz to Renault have warned in recent months that goals they set in recent years for fully electric sales in the next decade were too ambitious, as customers remained hesitant to make the switch away from gas-powered cars.
Porsche, struggling with low E.V. sales this year so far, highlighted the disparity in its three key markets in E.V. uptake, with demand far ahead in China, slower in Europe and spotty in the United States. REUTERS

Your Driving App Is Leading You Astray: [Op-Ed]

Full text: On my way to Kennedy International Airport, I grip the wheel tightly, swerving across three lanes of expressway traffic at 50 miles per hour to reach the exit. Minutes later, still shaken from my move, I hear a cheerful, disembodied voice instructing me to re-enter the expressway I had just exited.
I curse at my phone.
If you use a navigation app, you probably have felt helpless anger when your stupid phone endangers your life, and the lives of all the drivers around you, to potentially shave a minute or two from your drive time. Or maybe it's stuck you on an ugly freeway when a glorious, ocean-hugging alternative lies a few miles away. Or maybe it's trapped you on a route with no four-way stops, ignoring a less stressful solution that doesn't leave you worried about a car barreling out of nowhere.
For all the discussion of the many extraordinary ways algorithms have changed our society and our lives, one of the most impactful, and most infuriating, often escapes notice. Dominated by a couple of enormously powerful tech monopolists that have better things to worry about, our leading online mapping systems from Google and Apple are not nearly as good as they could be.
You may have heard the extreme stories, such as when navigation apps like Waze and Google Maps apparently steered drivers into lakes and onto impassable dirt roads, or when jurisdictions beg Waze to stop dumping traffic onto their residential streets. But the reality is these apps affect us, our roads and our communities every minute of the day. Primarily programmed to find the fastest route, they endanger and infuriate us on a remarkably regular basis.
Worse, the promised time savings are often a mirage. There are so many elements included in calculating a route that the estimated time is always a guess. Yet who among us has not seen her estimated arrival time change several times while en route?
These products should be calibrated with greater acknowledgment of the uncertainties involved in predicting unexpected slowdowns and road closures. I am firmly of the belief -- which I cannot prove, as our tech overlords refuse to share data with us -- that the algorithms are often optimizing for time savings that are smaller than their margin of error.
I shouldn't dismiss the fact that digital maps have been transformational and empowering. My father, a mathematician and mapmaker, helped build the first digital maps for early GPS navigation systems. When map apps arrived on my phone, we put away paper maps with a sigh of relief.
Now, however, we have all become so reliant on online maps that we have lost the deep knowledge that allows us to make our own calculations of an optimal route. And these maps don't seem to have changed very much since Google bought its competitor Waze; the company now commands an estimated more than 80 percent of the navigation app market share. (Google has prevailed, so far, in a long-running antitrust effort claiming it abused its map monopoly.)
It doesn't have to be like this. A navigation app could consider factors such as the safety impact of changing many lanes with little notice. Imagine instructing the app to avoid jumping on and off highways, or to take the scenic route if the added driving time is under 10 percent. To be clear, this type of customization is possible. Porsche offers in its navigation app a choice of routes "tailored to your driving style," defined as "curvy," "fast" or "balanced." The open source project Valhalla offers dozens of ways to optimize routing algorithms with options such as prioritizing fewer turns or routes with car pool lanes. (Unfortunately, it's too difficult technically for most laypeople to use.)
"It would be wonderful if the primary infrastructure that drives our society was built with the right values -- it's just not," says Mikel Maron, a geographer and longtime contributor to OpenStreetMap, the so-called Wikipedia of maps, which is built by volunteers and whose data provides a base layer for many other maps and navigation apps.
On a recent trip to Chicago, I couldn't get my app to offer me the option to take the beautiful Lake Shore Drive on Lake Michigan along my route. It only offered me the Dan Ryan Expressway, a 14-lane leviathan. Sure, it was theoretically a minute or two faster, but it is also an unpleasant experience filled with 18-wheelers and prone to accidents and slowdowns.
The best hope for competition relies on the success of OpenStreetMap. Its data underpins most maps other than Google, including Amazon, Facebook and Apple, but it is so under-resourced that it only recently hired paid systems administrators to ensure its back-end machines kept running.
For a vibrant consumer navigational ecosystem to emerge, society needs to invest in OpenStreetMap as a public good. The giant corporations that rely on its maps should stop freeloading and use some of their hundreds of billions of dollars to support the project. City planners should dedicate staffers to updating their roads and bridges on OpenStreetMap. Communities should submit updates with roads and hazards in their local areas.
In addition, we can promote competition by using the few available alternatives. To navigate cities with public transit, try apps such as Citymapper that offer bike, transit and walking directions. Or use the privacy-focused Organic Maps.
And when you have to use a popular driving app, take its directions with a huge grain of salt.

As Sales of E.V.s Surge, Tesla Market Share Falls Below 50% for 1st Time: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new report estimates that the company led by Elon Musk accounted for just under half of all battery-powered vehicles sold in the second quarter of the year.
Tesla's once-commanding share of the market for electric vehicles in the United States slipped below 50 percent in the second quarter of the year even as sales of battery-powered cars surged to a record, according to new estimates published Tuesday by a research firm.
Tesla accounted for 49.7 percent of electric vehicles sales from April through June, down from 59.3 percent a year earlier as the company led by Elon Musk lost ground to General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Kia, the research firm, Cox Automotive said. It was the first time the company's market share fell below 50 percent in a quarter, according to Cox. The firm, a leading auto industry researcher, estimates market share based on registrations, company reports and other data.
The numbers are the latest sign that Tesla is losing its dominance in a market it in effect created in 2012 when it introduced the Model S sedan. Before that car, very few electric vehicles were sold in the United States. Overall, U.S. electric vehicle sales climbed 11.3 percent from a year earlier, suggesting that consumer demand for the technology remains healthy even if sales are no longer growing at more than 40 percent a year as they were last year. Americans bought or leased more than 330,000 electric cars and light trucks during the quarter, accounting for 8 percent of all new cars sold or leased in the three-month period. A year earlier, electric vehicles accounted for 7.2 percent of the market, Cox said.
A few years ago Tesla didn't have many competitors, and pretty much no other company could match its cars' driving range on a full charge or acceleration. But established carmakers have been introducing electric vehicles that can travel 300 miles or more, equaling and sometimes exceeding the capabilities of Tesla's cars.
There are well over 100 electric models available in the United States, according to a separate report published Tuesday by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group. Prices have fallen as the supply and variety of models have increased, making it possible for more people to afford one.
Intense competition "is leading to continued price pressure, helping push E.V. adoption slowly higher," Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, said in a statement.
Many consumers are now buying electric cars from established carmakers like BMW or Ford, which have large dealer networks that can provide maintenance and repairs. Tesla sells cars online and many consumers have said that it can be hard to get their cars repaired at the company's relatively small network of service centers.
Tesla sales have also suffered from an aging lineup. Its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, went on sale in 2020, making it dated by industry standards. Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, offer more electric models than Tesla, with competitive prices and newer designs.
After a slow start in the last couple of years, G.M. has recently begun rolling out vehicles designed to be electric, rather than models converted from gasoline cars. The company is also now using batteries made in the United States in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution. In a few months, G.M. is expected to start selling an electric version of G.M.'s Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle for around $ 35,000 before taking into account a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
Tesla said last week that its global sales fell 4.8 percent, to around 444,000, in the second quarter from the period a year ago. The company does not break out its sales by country, but Cox estimates that Tesla's U.S. sales fell 6.3 percent in the second quarter, to 164,000 cars.
Mr. Musk may have also hurt Tesla sales with his embrace of right-wing politics on X, the social media platform he owns. Electric vehicle owners tend to be liberal or left-leaning and electric vehicle sales are highest in states that generally elect Democrats for statewide and federal offices.
In recent quarters, sales of electric vehicles have not grown as fast as some automakers had expected, but the market is still expanding faster than the one for gasoline vehicles. The market for hybrid vehicles has lately been growing even faster than for fully electric vehicles; hybrids, which do not have to be plugged in, allow consumers to avoid a patchy national public charging network.
Not all carmakers are benefiting. Electric models including Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche and Volvo fell in the second quarter from a year earlier, Cox said. The firm said it would publish detailed sales and market share figures on Thursday.
Tesla is now facing competition from more than 100 electric models, which has driven prices down as well. (PHOTOGRAPH BY LAUREN JUSTICE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B5.

Ferrari Enters the Age of Electrification, but Will It Vroom?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Gliding on robotic haulers, a line of Ferrari frames maneuvers through a gleaming new factory in Northern Italy. At each station, engineers in cherry red uniforms add a component -- an engine block, a dashboard, a steering wheel -- as they transform the bodies into hybrid vehicles. Up next: fully electric.
A lot is riding on Ferrari's 200-million-euro "e-building," which went into operation last month and is nearly twice the size of Rome's Colosseum. The factory is intended to bring the 77-year-old sports-car maker, known for the sonorous vroom of its gas engines, into the age of electrification.
But the effort comes at a precarious time for the auto industry. The transition to electric vehicles, which was supposed to quickly usher in an era of climate-friendly transport, has instead been squeezed by costly investments and slowing global demand.
Other luxury carmakers have struggled to go electric. Mercedes-Benz and Lamborghini have reduced their ambitions. Tesla reported declining second-quarter sales on Tuesday, and Ford Motor said in April that it would shift production to more hybrids as E.V. losses piled up. A growing trade war between China and the West also threatens to stifle growth.
Despite the challenges, Ferrari sees an opportunity in the industry's inevitable march toward electrification to reach a new consumer: the wealthy environmentalist. It intends to unveil its first fully electric model in the fourth quarter of next year. As part of its strategy, the carmaker has enlisted LoveFrom -- the agency founded by Jony Ive, Apple's former design chief, and the industrial designer Marc Newson -- to hone the car's appearance.
There is plenty of mystery shrouding the yet-to-be-named car, including its battery life and what it will sound like. The company has not disclosed its look, production run or price tag. But it could be one of the most expensive electric vehicles on the market, analyst say, surpassing Porsche's $ 286,000 Taycan Turbo GT.
Ferrari's foray into electric will be notable for other reasons. Regulators may be pushing electric vehicles, but there is lingering skepticism in the marketplace. Winning over fans of combustion engines will not be easy -- even for Ferrari. And the industry is desperate for an automaker, any automaker, to prove that electric vehicles can drive big profits.
"It's worth watching whether a Ferrari E.V. can maintain the kind of price premium you'd associate with a Ferrari," said Martino de Ambroggi, an automotive analyst at Equita, an investment bank in Milan. "Often, a Ferrari purchase is also viewed as a kind of investment. Only after a few years will we see if that investment in an electric Ferrari holds up."
Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari's chief executive, is doing his best to keep the market in anticipation. In an interview last month in the new plant, he said the company would commence full-scale electric vehicle production by early 2026. By 2030, electric and hybrid cars will make up as much as 80 percent of Ferrari's annual output as the company seeks to meet stringent European Union emissions mandates.
In the meantime, the e-building will roll out two models: the SF90 Stradale, a plug-in hybrid, and the combustion engine Purosangue.
Ferrari does not need an electric vehicle to pad its bottom line. Under Mr. Vigna, a former executive at the chip maker STMicroelectronics who took the helm nearly three years ago, the company has been on a tear. The stock is one of the best performers in Europe this year, giving it a roughly $ 75 billion market valuation, higher than that of Ford or General Motors. Profits are soaring alongside prices at Ferrari, which makes some of the most expensive cars on the planet. There's a three-year waiting list for some models.
Ferrari's success over the years on the Formula 1 track has also led to a lucrative corporate sponsorship and merchandise business that has transformed it into a luxury brand with a sporty flair. Ferrari's prancing horse logo can be found on high-end apparel like a €790 cashmere sweater.
Mr. Vigna sees the electric vehicle as part of the company's growth strategy, despite the industry's slowdown. "There are some potential clients, I have them clearly in mind, who will never become part of the family unless there is an electric car," he said.
But challenges loom. Enthusiasts who had gathered outside the factory gates last month wondered: Will it look, handle and sound like the classic Ferrari growler, or have the understated whine of most electric vehicles?
"When you think of a Ferrari, it still has that kind of engine sensation, and you also think of the roar," Mr. de Ambroggi said. "I don't know how Ferrari resolves this."
Mr. Vigna fields that question often, especially from longtime customers, or Ferraristi. They seem to be channeling the deceased founder, Enzo Ferrari, who once broke down in the simplest terms how he built some of the fastest cars on the planet: "I build motors and attach them to wheels."
Mr. Vigna's E.V. pitch has a different ring. "The electric engine will not be silent," he said. "There are ways to make sure that the emotion comes through from driving an electric Ferrari that is the same as when you drive a hybrid or when you drive a thermal Ferrari."
Battery life is another puzzle piece. Because Ferraris often sell for a higher price on the secondary market, the concern about battery degradation, and its impact on the long-term value of the car, may be felt more acutely by the Ferraristi.
"The E.V. transition raises a whole lot of new issues for them in terms of how you maintain the vehicle," said Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at Bernstein.
Ferrari's longtime partner, SK On, a South Korean battery maker, will supply the components for the E.V. batteries, which Ferrari will assemble in the e-building, where it will also make the car's electric motors and axles.
And then there is the matter of price. Last month, Reuters reported that the car would cost at least €500,000 ( $ 540,000). Mr. Vigna pushed back on the speculation, saying it is too early to talk price.
Ferrari still follows its founder's principle for producing a limited number of extremely expensive cars. Ferrari made fewer than 14,000 last year; even with the e-building, production is not expected to increase much at the start.
The limited numbers may explain why fans make the pilgrimage to Maranello hoping to catch a glimpse of a Ferrari, either on the company's Formula 1 test track or near its red brick factory.
Knowing demand is high, Mr. Vigna has increased the base price of most models more than 25 percent.
"Ferrari consistently sells less than the market demands, leading to a multiyear order book," said Mr. Reitman, the Bernstein analyst. With a profit margin of nearly 30 percent, Ferrari's business more resembles that of a luxury brand like Hermes or Rolex, analysts say.
Mr. Vigna is already thinking about how to market the new electric car. The target customer probably will not be buying the car for purely practical or even planet-saving reasons, he said, adding: "The emotional part of the brain is driving the purchase."

Full text: A former hippie who chafed at wealth, she married a Chicago real estate titan and, after his death, donated hundreds of millions in her adopted city and beyond.
Ann Lurie, a self-described hippie who went on to become one of Chicago's most celebrated philanthropists, in one instance giving more than $ 100 million to a hospital where she had once worked as a pediatric nurse, died on Monday. She was 79.
Her death was announced in a statement by Northwestern University, to which Ms. Lurie, a trustee, had donated more than $ 60 million. The statement did not say where she died or specify a cause.
An only child raised in Miami by a single mother, Ms. Lurie protested the Vietnam War while in college and planned to join the Peace Corps after she graduated. In interviews, she said she chafed at the trappings of wealth even after marrying Robert H. Lurie.
Mr. Lurie had built a real estate and investment empire as a partner in Equity Group Investments, teaming up with a former fraternity brother from the University of Michigan, Sam Zell, whose portfolio came to include The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Cubs. Mr. Lurie held stakes in the Chicago Bulls and the Chicago White Sox.
He died of colon cancer in 1990 at 48, leaving an estate worth $ 425 million. By 2007, Ms. Lurie had donated $ 277 million, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.
In recognition of the care Mr. Lurie received at Northwestern University's cancer center, the couple endowed the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University to expand its treatment and research capabilities.
After her husband's death, Ms. Lurie was president and treasurer of the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Foundation and the founder and president of Lurie Investments, which helped support her charitable efforts.
Among her many projects at Northwestern, she set up professorships in breast cancer research and oncology at the Feinberg School of Medicine and helped fund the 12-story Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center.
Her $ 100 million gift helped fund the construction of Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, which replaced Children's Memorial Hospital, where Ms. Lurie had worked as a nurse starting in the early 1970s. The new hospital opened in 2012.
She was also a major benefactor of the Greater Chicago Food Depository; Gilda's Club Chicago, a cancer support organization named after Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989; and the University of Michigan. In 2004, Chicago honored Ms. Lurie by christening a four-block-long street West Ann Lurie Place.
Known for her hands-on approach to philanthropy, Ms. Lurie also made Africa and Asia a focus; for example, she founded Africa Infectious Disease Village Clinics in Kenya, which she supported for 12 years. While serving as its director, she often traveled there.
"The dictionary definition of philanthropy is to love and care about mankind," she said in a 2004 interview with The Sun-Times. "People can be philanthropists even if they never hit their checkbooks. It's about the passion you feel towards those who are living in deprived circumstances."
Ms. Lurie was born on April 20, 1945. Her parents divorced when she was 4, and Ann, an only child, grew up in a house in Miami with her mother, Marion Blue, a nurse, as well as her grandmother and an aunt.
Ms. Lurie enrolled in the nursing program at the University of Florida in Gainesville. She married an aspiring lawyer and graduated in 1966.
Her plan to join the Peace Corps was waylaid when her husband started law school; although he was from an affluent family, she later said, she insisted that they live on her salary as a nurse.
The couple later settled in Fort Lauderdale, where her husband started a law practice and Ms. Lurie worked as a nurse at a county hospital.
"His priorities were considerably different," she told The Sun-Times, adding that her husband had tooled around in a Porsche his family gave him. The couple divorced in 1971, and, Ms. Lurie said, she "vowed to myself that I was never again going to get involved with anyone who was wealthy."
Lured by the culture and diversity of Chicago, she moved there "not knowing a soul," she later said, and worked as a pediatric intensive care nurse at the hospital that would eventually bear her name.
She met Mr. Lurie that same year in an elevator to the laundry room in their apartment building. With his long red hair tied back in a bandanna, "he looked so alternative," Ms. Lurie said in 2004. "If he had on a suit and tie, I wouldn't have been interested at all."
Although she said she had misgivings when she learned of his wealth, she learned that they came from similar backgrounds -- Mr. Lurie was raised by his mother in Detroit after his father died when the boy was 11 -- and had similar values.
The couple had two children before marrying, and then four more. Mr. Lurie was diagnosed with cancer in 1988.
Ms. Lurie married Mark Muheim, a film editor and cinematographer, in 2014. He survives her, as do her six children, 16 grandchildren and two of her husband's sons.
In the 2004 interview, Ms. Lurie said she and Mr. Lurie had tried to steer their children away from a life of moneyed indolence. "We kept the kids grounded," she said.
They hired a minimum of household help. Mr. Lurie even insisted on mowing their lawn and plowing their driveway himself. "He loved that kind of lifestyle," Ms. Lurie said, "and so did I."

Volkswagen Will Invest In Rivian: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: VW and Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to increase sales and break even, will work together on software and other technologies.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, said on Tuesday that it would invest up to $ 5 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit, and that the companies would cooperate on software for electric vehicles.
The deal creates an unusual alliance between the world's second-largest carmaker and an electric vehicle start-up that has strained to live up to investors' expectations that it would achieve the kind of success that made Tesla the world's most valuable automaker.
If successful, the partnership would address weaknesses at both companies. It would provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And Rivian, in addition to cash, would benefit from the manufacturing expertise of an automaker that produces nearly 10 million vehicles a year, putting it just behind Toyota Motor in the global auto industry.
Volkswagen said it would initially invest $ 1 billion in Rivian, and over time increase that to as much as $ 5 billion. If regulators approve the transaction, Volkswagen could become a significant shareholder. The infusion represents a big vote of confidence in Rivian, which loses tens of thousands of dollars on each vehicle it sells.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received glowing reviews in the automotive press, but the company has struggled to ramp up manufacturing at its factory in Normal, Ill. In recent months, many investors have grown worried that the company may not survive long enough to become profitable.
R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's founder and chief executive, said the cash from Volkswagen would help Rivian launch a midsize S.U.V. called the R2 that will sell for about $ 45,000, and to complete a factory in Georgia. Rivian halted construction of the Georgia plant in March in an effort to save more than $ 2 billion.
"This is important for us financially," Mr. Scaringe said of the Volkswagen partnership on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.
The cheapest vehicle Rivian currently sells, the R1T pickup, starts around $ 70,000, a price that has limited its sales to affluent early adopters. Its R1S S.U.V. starts at $ 75,000. Even at those prices, Rivian lost $ 39,000 for every vehicle it sold in the first three months of the year.
Rivian's stock jumped more than 50 percent in extended trading on Tuesday after the deal was announced.
The electric vehicle market has been divided between relatively young companies like Tesla and Rivian, which make only battery-powered cars, and established carmakers like Volkswagen, General Motors and Toyota, which have often struggled to master the new technology.
Except for Tesla, none of newer U.S. carmakers specializing in electric vehicles have won significant market share. Some, like Fisker and Lordstown Motors, have ceased production and filed for bankruptcy protection.
Auto analysts have long considered Rivian among the electric vehicle start-ups most likely to survive, in part because it has raised billions of dollars in investment. Amazon is one of its largest shareholders and the main customer for the company's delivery vans.
But Volkswagen and Rivian operate very differently, and it could be a challenge for them to work together. Volkswagen, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is known for rigid, top-down management and is owned in part by the state of Lower Saxony. Rivian, based in Irvine, Calif., has the more freewheeling culture of a technology start-up. Rivian said in April that it expected to sell 57,000 vehicles this year, far fewer than Volkswagen sells in a week.
Mr. Scaringe and Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said the deal blossomed after the two met at a Porsche customer center and bonded over their love of cars.
"We have a very similar mind-set," Mr. Blume said during the conference call.
Ford Motor was for a time a big shareholder in Rivian, and the two companies once said they would build S.U.V.s together. But that plan never came to fruition, and Ford sold most of its Rivian shares. Ford and Volkswagen have a separate partnership that includes joint development and production of electric vehicles.
The Volkswagen-Rivian alliance could encourage other established carmakers to consider investments or partnerships connecting them with start-ups like Lucid Motors -- companies that have well-regarded technology but are unprofitable and struggling to establish themselves in a crowded market. Another large automaker, Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Fiat and Peugeot, has invested in a Chinese company, Leapmotor, for access to its electric car technology.
Vehicles using the software developed by the new joint venture will go on sale during the second half of the decade, Volkswagen said. Any of Volkswagen's brands, which include Audi and Porsche, could use the technology, Mr. Blume said. Scout, the American off-road brand that Volkswagen is reviving at a factory under construction in South Carolina, could also use the software.
But Volkswagen and Rivian will continue to market their vehicles separately.

From a Formula One Exit To Le Mans in 11 Months: [Sports Desk]

Full text: He lost his job in Formula 1, but was grabbed by Toyota to drive in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Last July, Nyck de Vries, a driver for the Formula 1 team AlphaTauri, was dismissed 10 Grands Prix into his rookie season.
Eleven months later, de Vries has the opportunity to win one of the most prestigious races in motorsport this weekend when he competes in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
"It is no secret that Le Mans is one of the most iconic races in the world as a single stand-alone event," de Vries said in an interview in May. "Everyone who competes in the F.I.A. World Endurance Championship is very motivated and determined to excel at that particular race.
"You could almost ask yourself the question whether Le Mans is bigger than the whole championship. I don't fully agree with that because I do really value a world championship, but Le Mans has all the history, and that makes it very special."
De Vries will drive the No. 7 Toyota GR010 Hybrid with Kamui Kobayashi and Mike Conway, W.E.C. champions in 2020 and 2021, and who won Le Mans in 2021 with Toyota. De Vries was the reserve driver, but never raced.
It was a role he relinquished last year when he joined AlphaTauri. De Vries replaced José María López, who had partnered with Kobayashi and Conway in their Le Mans victories. The opportunity has been a long time coming.
"As a driver, you want to be in the racing seat, but I think the relationship with Toyota has been great," de Vries said. "It was always the common target to prepare me to step up. I had full faith in the common intentions and also belief in my ability.
"Things still need to work out and the timing has to be right. I was fortunate after what happened with AlphaTauri. Toyota was very supportive, and they have helped me fulfill my dream. When I became available, it was very straightforward to rejoin forces again."
Kobayashi, Conway and López spent seven years together with Toyota. "In motorsport, things are constantly evolving, and it's the same with driver lineups," Kobayashi, who is also the team principal, told the team's website.
"Mike, José and I drove together since 2017, which is a long time in any category. We enjoyed some amazing moments together, but also some tough times, particularly at Le Mans."
Kobayashi said de Vries was "quick and consistent." The trio won their first race, the 6 Hours of Imola, in April. It was de Vries's first victory in any category since he won in Formula E with Mercedes in May 2022.
De Vries said he would have accepted third place that weekend, "but the execution from the whole team, including my teammates, was just flawless. Everyone delivered 100 percent. It shows you can outperform your competitors when they are quicker, but you're better in execution."
The season is unusual for de Vries. He is dovetailing his commitments in the W.E.C. with Toyota with driving in Formula E with Mahindra Racing.
De Vries, who was Formula E champion with Mercedes in 2021, was offered a multiyear contract by Mahindra after he left Formula 1.
In contrast to Toyota, Mahindra is uncompetitive. De Vries has scored only six points from 10 races, with his best finish seventh in Shanghai. He sat out the race in Berlin in May because it took place on the same weekend as the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.
"They are two very different teams and championships," de Vries said. "Fortunately, with Toyota, which is a very successful team with a lot of success over the past decade in W.E.C., it's great to be fighting at the front and challenging for the top positions.
"With Mahindra, the project has a different approach. The team had a difficult year last year, and the hardware," referring to the powertrain, "hasn't changed from last year to this year, so we can't expect miracles. But with all the changes that are happening, the team is on the right trajectory."
De Vries is aware he is part of a long-term project as Mahindra "builds a foundation for the future," he said. With Toyota, "the expectations are much higher."
Toyota won the Le Mans from 2018 to 2022. Its run ended last year when Kobayashi, Conway and López failed to finish, and the Toyota sister car of Sébastien Buemi, Ryo Hirakawa and Brendon Hartley was second.
"Obviously, we experience more disappointment at Toyota when we're not competitive and fighting for victories," de Vries said. "But that balance across the two series is really cool and encouraging to experience."
De Vries is no stranger to Le Mans. He competed in the LMP2 category with Racing Team Nederland in 2019 and 2020, G-Drive Racing the following year and TDS Racing x Vaillante in 2022 when he was fourth in class and eighth over all.
Toyota is expected to challenge for victory in the top Hypercar class this year, but it faces strong opposition from Porsche, Alpine, BMW, Peugeot and Ferrari, last year's winner.
"It's hard to have clear expectations," de Vries said. "It depends on what I want to base my expectations on. If purely on the first couple of events [in the W.E.C.], I would say some of our competitors have the edge over us. If I base it on pure historical numbers, I have faith that we are competitive.
"I don't have a crystal ball, and I don't know what we can expect, but I would like to think and hope we are quick enough to fight for the main victory."
De Vries knows the Circuit de la Sarthe, where the race is held, can bite a driver at any time and quickly wreck ambitions. "Obviously, you have to be quick, and execution is key, making sure that individually and collectively we are on top of our game, not making any mistakes," he said.
"But Le Mans always has something unexpected for you. Hopefully, Le Mans chooses us to win."

Actor Powered by Coffee, Tea and Cars: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Mr. Rainey starts his day with tea, and then it's time for fancy cars, making beats and Call of Duty with his friends.
Michael Rainey Jr. had looked up to the rapper 50 Cent since he was 8 years old. So when he landed the opportunity to work with him (real name: Curtis James Jackson III) on the Starz crime drama "Power," he couldn't have been more excited.
"Once I heard 50 Cent, my eyes just lit up," Mr. Rainey said.
For the past 10 years, he has been an actor in the "Power" universe -- first in the original series, which ran for six seasons, and now as the star of the spinoff "Power Book II: Ghost." He plays Tariq St. Patrick, the student-turned-drug-dealer son of the original series' lead character, Ghost.
"He's basically raised on lies, so he really grew up with trust issues," Mr. Rainey, 23, said of his character. "He has the smarts, but I feel like he's just a product of his environment, of where he grew up and the kind of family that he was raised in."
In the fourth, and final, season of "Power Book II: Ghost," which premieres on June 7, Mr. Rainey says fans can expect "nonstop, high-stakes action." "It's like no other season of 'Ghost,"' he said.
Like his character on "Power," Mr. Rainey grew up in New York. An only child, he was born to Shauna Small and Michael Rainey Sr. in Louisville, Ky., and raised on Staten Island.
"The environment and culture of New York have always been a part of my life growing up here, and made it easier to relate to my character in 'Power' and bring my genuine experiences to my performance," Mr. Rainey said.
He landed his first role at 11 years old in the Italian film "Un altro mondo," which led to appearances in the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black," Ice Cube's "Barbershop: The Next Cut" and Lee Daniels's "The Butler."
Mr. Rainey Jr. lives alone in a loft in Jersey City, N.J., although he often has family members staying with him.
FRESH CUT I got a haircut in the morning to start the day. I woke up, brushed my teeth, and then I just got straight in the chair. My barber came to my house. I was half asleep when that was happening. I got a little shape-up, crew cut. I have to look professional for you guys.
TEA TIME I get up, wash the face, brush the teeth, pop in the shower, then I get me a cup of tea. For some reason I love tea. Tea just makes me feel good. For the most part, I really like ginger tea, like honey, ginger and lemon.
CRUISING AROUND I'll just go in my car, drive around and enjoy the weather and the sound of my car. I love my car, so I be spending a lot of time in my cars. I have multiple. I have a BMW M5, an Audi R8, a Porsche 911 Turbo S, and then I have an old-school E30 BMW. It's like an '89, I believe.
CAR CAFE Sunday Motor Co., it's like a super cool little restaurant-cafe, and every Sunday they have a car-meet thing. People come with their cars, and then they eat food. I had super fire chili eggs. Then there was this guy, and I always see his car when I go to Sunday Motor Co., but I never see him. So, I finally saw him and put a face to the car, and we had a pretty good conversation. He has a BMW-only car club, and I'm part of it now because he thinks I'm cool.
STUDIO SESSION We went to the studio, but I forgot my laptop at home. For the most part, when I'm in the studio, I'm just chilling with my friends, making beats, recording music with my friends. Then I have other producer friends that make beats, so we'll be collaborating, making beats together. It'll be four or five of us just making one beat, just going crazy, adding a million sounds, just seeing what works.
COFFEE BREAK When I am filming, I love coffee. The amount of coffee I drink when I'm filming is bad. You get a fire latte with oat milk. That's fire. I ain't going to lie to you. I'll be going to Gregorys, and the coffee is pretty all right.
KNICKS NIGHT I went to the Knicks [Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers]. The Knicks lost. I was so sad. But at halftime, I got me a good burger. I had my Daily Burger. Yo, Daily Burgers are so good. I don't know why they're so good, but they're so simple and so good. After the game, I didn't have an appetite because we lost.
VIDEO GAMES I mostly play video games over watching TV. I love playing Call of Duty on Sundays. It's a great way for me to get to hang out virtually with all of my friends, because we all play together. It's not just about the game itself, but the social aspect of connecting and spending time with my friends, even when we can't be together in person.
SHOWER HOUR I'll be in the shower forever. Maybe an hour and 20 minutes, maybe an hour and a half. I like the steam and just feel like I'm in a cloud of relaxation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ryan Salame, the head of FTX's subsidiary in the Bahamas, was the first of Sam Bankman-Fried's deputies to be sentenced since the crypto exchange collapsed in November 2022.
Ryan Salame, a top executive at the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on Tuesday, making him the first of Sam Bankman-Fried's circle of advisers at FTX to receive prison time.
Mr. Salame, 30, a trusted lieutenant of Mr. Bankman-Fried, the exchange's founder, pleaded guilty last year to a campaign finance law violation and a charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He is one of four top deputies in the FTX empire who have pleaded guilty to crimes since the company imploded in November 2022.
Mr. Salame's sentence exceeded the five to seven years that prosecutors had recommended. Defense lawyers had asked for 18 months.
Wearing a blue suit and socks emblazoned with the Bitcoin logo, Mr. Salame stood facing Judge Lewis A. Kaplan as the sentence was read aloud in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Judge Kaplan called Mr. Salame's crimes "astonishing."
"The state of our political life in this country is in jeopardy," he said. "Efforts like that undertaken by Mr. Salame and Bankman-Fried only make matters worse."
Mr. Salame is set to surrender on Aug. 29. His lawyers requested that he serve his sentence at the federal prison in Cumberland, Md., near his home. Mr. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence, after he was convicted of fraud and conspiracy at a trial last year.
Before FTX failed, Mr. Salame was a key figure at the exchange, overseeing its subsidiary in the Bahamas, where the company was based. As FTX grew into a $ 32 billion business, Mr. Salame spent lavishly. He enjoyed expensive cars and private jets, and bought restaurants in the Berkshires in Massachusetts. He was also a prolific political donor, giving more than $ 24 million in the 2022 midterm elections, mostly to Republicans.
When FTX imploded, Mr. Salame became a target of federal prosecutors, who searched his home in Maryland. Mr. Bankman-Fried was charged with stealing $ 8 billion from FTX's customers and using the money to finance political contributions, venture investments and luxury real estate purchases. Three top FTX executives -- Gary Wang, Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison -- pleaded guilty to financial crimes and agreed to cooperate with the government. They all await sentencing.
In September, Mr. Salame also pleaded guilty, admitting that he had acted as an illegal "straw donor" who made political contributions at the direction of Mr. Bankman-Fried to evade federal disclosure requirements. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors called it "one of the largest ever" campaign finance offenses in American history.
As part of his plea deal, Mr. Salame agreed to pay a $ 6 million fine and more than $ 5 million in restitution, and to forfeit two properties in Massachusetts, as well as his Porsche.
In the memo, prosecutors argued that Mr. Salame had been motivated by a desire for money and influence. Even as FTX crumbled, he withdrew $ 5 million from the exchange, using the funds to pay off personal expenses and hire a public-relations firm. Hours before the bankruptcy, the prosecutors wrote, Mr. Salame withdrew another $ 600,000 from his account on FTX's U.S. platform.
Judge Kaplan invoked those withdrawals at the hearing on Tuesday. "It was me first -- I'm getting in the lifeboat first," he said of Mr. Salame. "To heck with all those customers."
In their own memo to Judge Kaplan, Mr. Salame's defense lawyers said he had not been aware that Mr. Bankman-Fried was stealing billions of dollars from customers. That news "was as shocking and dismaying to Ryan Salame as to everyone else in the world," the lawyers wrote.
They said that Mr. Salame's life had been "decimated" and that FTX's demise had brought "shame and instability" to his family. Mr. Salame is in a long-term relationship with Michelle Bond, a former crypto industry lobbyist who also supported Mr. Bankman-Fried. In November, Ms. Bond gave birth to the couple's first child, the memo said. Mr. Salame has also begun to grapple with a substance-abuse problem, his lawyers wrote, and is planning to attend law school.
Addressing the court on Tuesday, Jason Linder, a lawyer for Mr. Salame, described his client as "merely a tool" of Mr. Bankman-Fried's. Unlike Mr. Wang, Mr. Singh and Ms. Ellison, Mr. Salame did not testify against Mr. Bankman-Fried in court last year. But his lawyers said he had voluntarily produced documents and "offered assistance and cooperation" to the government as it prepared for the trial.
At Tuesday's hearing, Mr. Linder pointed to rows filled with friends and family members who had accompanied Mr. Salame, including Ms. Bond and Mr. Salame's mother and aunt.
Before the sentence was announced, Mr. Salame briefly addressed the court, apologizing to FTX's customers and his family. "Mom, I can't imagine how this feels for you," he said, his voice breaking.
But Judge Kaplan said a long sentence was necessary to send a message to wealthy people about "the consequences of perverting our electoral system and its rules."
Mr. Salame "knowingly and willfully assisted in destroying the limited transparency that the laws of the United States provide in this area," he said.

When 'Mom's Money' Becomes Your Money: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A sudden windfall while grieving can be an emotional minefield, particularly for younger adults. Experts share ways to handle it wisely.
Michael Hay knew his mother was financially secure, but he didn't fully know her situation until she was admitted to a hospital in August and he was granted her power of attorney. Even then, it wasn't until his mother's unexpected death, about a month later, that Mr. Hay understood that he and his two sisters were about to inherit a sum that would make a real difference in their lives.
Nine months later, Mr. Hay, 47, says he's still processing the shock of suddenly losing his 78-year-old mother while gaining an inheritance he wasn't prepared to receive.
"I still call it 'my mom's money' even though it's legally in my name," said Mr. Hay, who works at a tech start-up and lives in Madison County, N.Y.
Mr. Hay's reaction to his sudden wealth is not unusual. "It is a big shock both emotionally and financially, and I don't know that anyone is ever prepared," said Kathryn Kubiak-Rizzone, founder of About Time Financial Planning in Rochester, N.Y. She recommends that beneficiaries not make any financial decisions for the first six months because they're likely to still be grieving.
Research shows that more adult children may find themselves unexpectedly inheriting wealth over the next two decades. The silent generation, or people born roughly between 1928 and 1945, and its successors, the baby boomers, are expected to transfer significant wealth to members of Generation X and millennials over the next 20 years, according to the Wealth Report, a publication from Knight Frank, a London global property consultant.
Federal Reserve figures show that half of all inheritances are less than $ 50,000, but with boomers reaching 80 and beyond, members of their family may begin to inherit more wealth. More than half of millennials who are anticipating an inheritance from their parents or another relative expect to gain at least $ 350,000, according to a survey by Alliant Credit Union in Chicago. (Whether they actually receive that much is another question.)
An inheritance can feel like a gift, but it can also create stress, particularly for younger heirs. Many millennials lack the financial education to manage a large inheritance, said Katherine Fox, founder and adviser at Sunnybranch Wealth in Portland, Ore., and they typically don't have a financial adviser to help them.
"I see a wide variety of preparedness levels, but an overwhelming majority are totally unprepared to inherit and, when money actually comes, don't know what to do," said Ms. Fox, who works exclusively with inheritors between the ages of 25 and 55. In these cases, millennial heirs are essentially trading one set of stressors -- not being able to save money, not being able to buy a home and not preparing for retirement -- for a new set of stressors related to managing the money.
"I've seen people become paralyzed by the money they inherited and burden of it because they want to make sure they steward it and grow it," Ms. Fox said. Inheriting significant wealth at a relatively young age can give someone an incredible advantage that few people have -- but for many inheritors, there is a fear of failure and losing something they didn't earn.
Occasionally the opposite occurs and an early inheritance -- before age 50 -- gives a false sense of financial security.
"Sometimes it can have an adverse effect where folks take their foot off the pedal in terms of their goals and ambitions," said Noah Damsky, a principal at Marina Wealth Advisors in Los Angeles. It depends on the person, he said: Some view the money as a cushion for a rainy day rather than an opportunity to buy a new Porsche and take a long vacation.
The reality is that few people inherit enough money to allow them to stop working. "Think of it more as a safety net and not the answer to everything," Ms. Kubiak-Rizzone said.
Mr. Hay and his wife plan to use his inheritance to achieve several goals. Some of the funds will help send their three children to college, while a portion will go to their retirement savings. The inheritance also enabled the couple, who had wanted a new home, to buy a larger one than they had planned, and more seamlessly -- the extra funds meant they didn't have to rely on selling their current house, Mr. Hay said.
How to tackle a sum
Most inheritors use their windfall to buy or upgrade a home, set up college funds for their children or pay off a large debt, Ms. Fox said. Any leftover money is typically saved for retirement.
Ms. Fox recommends that her clients follow certain guidelines, regardless of the size of the inheritance.
Spend 3 to 5 percent on something you really want. "This is free money, so do something that makes you happy and is fun," she said. If you were close to the person who died, consider buying something that reminds you of him or her or that you know the person would have liked for you to have.
Give 3 to 5 percent to charity. "Recognize your privilege and pay it forward," Ms. Fox said. Consider donating to a charity that would honor your loved one. Mr. Hay and his sisters donated to the Massachusetts Audubon Society because their mother was an avid birder.
Think carefully about what you do with the remaining 90 to 94 percent. "You need to focus on your greatest financial needs," Ms. Fox said, such as paying off a student loan or making a down payment on a house.
It's important to take a long-term view, Ms. Fox said. For instance, if you use the bulk of the money to pay off a large debt, that will free up money to save for retirement. "Whatever you spend your inheritance on could change your life decades into the future," she said.
Molly Ackerman-Pulliam, 33, unexpectedly inherited $ 74,000 after her father died of cancer seven years ago. She and her husband were expecting their first child, so she used some of the funds to pay off her student loan. Ms. Ackerman-Pulliam said her father had always supported her education, so she believed he would have advised her to follow that course.
"What an incredible turn of events to be able to do that, to be free and clear and not have the burden, but for such a sad reason," said Ms. Ackerman-Pulliam, who lives in Fresno County, Calif.
She also used some of the money for a large down payment on a new Subaru Forester, which replaced a car that had been her father's.
Ms. Ackerman-Pulliam's advice to other young inheritors: "If there's a big financial obligation, take care of it."
Veering off track
Beneficiaries might start out with good intentions but then go astray. Chris Diodato warns against what he calls "sudden money" syndrome. "Many people have not seen this amount of money or assets under their name until this moment," said Mr. Diodato, founder of Wellth Financial Planning in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
For some heirs, seeing six figures in their bank account can be overwhelming. "Suddenly you realize in addition to your salary, you have half a million dollars in the bank," he said. Without a plan for how to invest, save and spend the money, it often just disappears over time, Mr. Diodato said.
He worked with a client who received a life insurance settlement unexpectedly. When they first met, the client was an unemployed millennial who said over and over, "I need to find a job right away." He talked about using the money to pay off some debt, save up for a house, maybe take a vacation and then put the rest in a retirement account.
As time passed, though, the client's desire to find work became less urgent because his inheritance provided enough money to pay all of his expenses, and in less than a year, he spent about 30 percent of his inheritance.
"If he doesn't make a change soon, he could easily spend all his money in about four years," Mr. Diodato said. Sometimes it takes seeing the account value drop from six figures to five figures for the client to get serious about financial planning, he said.
Another of Mr. Diodato's clients inherited a little over $ 100,000. Initially the plan was to save for retirement, but the client started using the money to travel. After spending down about $ 15,000 of the total, the client reached out to develop a structure for saving, investing and spending the money. Since then, the inheritance has grown instead of shrinking.
"An inheritance is not a silver bullet," Ms. Kubiak-Rizzone said. "It is a tool, and it can be a key to unlocking more possibilities."

The Chevy Malibu Was So Uncool, It Was Cool: [Style Desk]

Full text: An unassuming car had a surprisingly large cultural footprint.
If you asked a child to draw a car, the result would probably be something that looked like the Chevrolet Malibu.
For decades, this dependable midsize vehicle was a stalwart of the American road. Because that kind of thing is no longer in demand, it came as no surprise when General Motors announced on Wednesday that it would discontinue the model as it shifts its focus to sport utility vehicles and electric cars.
The Malibu never had the back-alley glamour of the Chevrolet Camaro or the brute force of the Chevrolet Impala. It was the ultimate normcore-mobile, made for a time when Americans were content to drive simple, gas-powered sedans, rather than rugged S.U.V.s, high-riding pickup trucks or electric vehicles that cruise along in near silence.
The Malibu originally appeared in the 1960s as part of Chevrolet's Chevelle line. It was a consistent seller through the 1970s. For a time, it was used as a patrol car by police departments across the country. General Motors took it off the market in 1983 and brought it back in 1997.
Upon its return, the critics were not exactly kind. "Ah, Malibu," Car and Driver magazine wrote in a 1997 review. "The word evokes images of surf bunnies, movie stars and languid decadence by the sea. Not the sort of vision that comes to mind on first sight of this new Chevrolet sedan. Maybe Chevy misspelled it. Mallibu sounds more like it."
But the very basicness of the Malibu was what made it so appealing to the more than 10 million people who bought one. And perhaps surprisingly for a vehicle so unassuming, it had a large cultural footprint. Again and again, filmmakers and songwriters created scenarios centered on the Malibu that seemed to comment on its plainness.
A customized version of a gray 1973 Malibu Coupe is the main vehicle for the protagonist of the moodily violent 2011 action film "Drive," according to the automotive publications SlashGear and Car & Classic. Ryan Gosling, the film's star, is said to have found the car in a junkyard and worked on it himself.
The Malibu was the right vehicle for a new kind of antihero. Mr. Gosling's nameless character, a stunt driver for movies who works as a getaway driver on the side, is mild and taciturn. Like his prized Chevy, he is not a show-off.
Seventeen years before "Drive," the director Quentin Tarantino gave a Malibu a key supporting role in "Pulp Fiction."
Vincent Vega, the good-natured hit man played by John Travolta, is behind the wheel of a red 1964 Malibu when he takes his boss's wife, played by Uma Thurman, on a date that goes horribly awry. Like the 1950s-style restaurant where they form a bond, the vintage Malibu harks back to an idealized America that is just a fantasy for these two characters, given how deeply they are mixed up in a life of drugs and murder.
A Malibu is a focal point of the 1984 cult film "Repo Man." Like other filmmakers, the writer and director Alex Cox played against the car's blandness. In the trunk of this unremarkable car is something remarkable indeed -- perhaps a nuclear bomb. (Whatever is in the trunk is never explained.)
More recently, Lana Del Rey, who often comments on all-American tropes in her modern-day torch ballads, name-checks the Malibu in "Shades of Cool," a 2014 song about a woman's love for a tragic sort who seems lost in a haze of substance abuse and self-absorption.
Like Vincent Vega and the unnamed loner in "Drive," the unreachable fellow in her song has only one thing that seems to bind him to the workaday world: "He drives a Chevy Malibu," she sings.
But the car was used to best effect in Cameron Crowe's 1989 romantic comedy-drama "Say Anything."
The protagonist, Lloyd Dobler, an underachieving Everyman played by John Cusack, drives a 1977 Malibu sedan. The car sets him apart from the strutting yuppies of other 1980s films -- think of the teenage cad played by James Spader in "Pretty in Pink," who has his own Porsche, or the stockbroker played by Charlie Sheen in "Wall Street," who drives a BMW.
Dobler embodies the slacker ethos that typified much of Generation X. When he is grilled by the father of the girl he loves, he explains that his main goal is to spend as much time with her as he can. When he is asked how he plans to make a living, he says, "I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career."
For this kind of guy -- proudly unambitious, except when it comes to love -- the unflashy Malibu was the perfect car.

Lesley Hazleton, 78, Who Wrote About Faith and Fast Cars, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Born in England and raised Jewish, she became agnostic, writing books about her own lack of faith, the prophet Muhammad and her time as a car columnist.
Lesley Hazleton, a British-born, secular Jewish psychologist turned journalist and author, whose curiosity about faith and religion led her to write biographies of Muhammad, Mary and Jezebel and examine her own passions in books about agnosticism and automobiles, died on April 29 at her home, a houseboat in Seattle. She was 78.
Ms. Hazleton announced her death herself, in an email that she scheduled to be sent to friends after she died. She had been diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer and chose to take her own life, as Washington State's Death with Dignity Act allowed her to do legally, with the assistance of hospice volunteers.
"Yes, this is a goodbye letter," she wrote, "which is difficult for me, because as many of you know, I'm lousy at saying goodbye."
"I've been a pro-choice feminist for over six decades, so it should come as no surprise that I'll be exercising choice in this, too," she said, adding, "I'm experiencing an unexpected but wonderfully bearable lightness of being. Not a sad feeling of saying goodbye to life, but one of joy and amazement at how great it's been. And of immense gratitude. I truly have had the time of my life. In fact, it sometimes feels like I've managed to live several lives in this one."
Ms. Hazleton was a formidable figure, with a deep, husky voice -- care of Philip Morris, her friend Olivier D'hose said, noting her devotion to its tobacco products -- and an appetite for physical and intellectual risk. She moved to Jerusalem in 1966, at age 20, and lived there through two wars and one peace treaty, working as a journalist for The Jerusalem Post and as a stringer for Time magazine.
She covered the complex state of feminism in Israel in her first book, "Israeli Women: The Reality Behind the Myths," published in 1977, at which point she announced that she had no plans to marry and did not want children.
She left Israel for New York in 1979, six months after the Camp David Accords, "exhausted by the constant high level of tension and drama there," she wrote in The New York Times in 1986, in the long-running column Hers, to which she was a regular contributor. "After too many wars -- and the ecstatic high of one peace -- I hungered for normality."
But instead she began driving racecars and embarked on a career as a car columnist, first for Lear's magazine and then for The Detroit Free Press.
She had fallen in love with speed while driving a Porsche 911 on a spring day in Vermont, though her favorite car was her doughty Citroën Deux Chevaux, sometimes known as the Duck, which she had driven in the Middle East, dodging tanks on her way to Mount Hermon and surviving a mined desert track because the car was too light to set them off.
During her years on the car beat, Ms. Hazleton attended racing school (the only woman in a class of 12), apprenticed to a mechanic, worked the assembly line at a Saturn plant in Tennessee and nearly died when she lost control on a track. She also visited the spot near Cholame, Calif., where James Dean met his own end, in a Porsche 550 Spyder.
"Perhaps as a writer, I place too much faith in catharsis, in the idea that by describing and exploring the obsession with speed that began that fine spring day in Vermont, I can drive it out of me," she wrote in "Confessions of a Fast Woman," a 1992 book about her automobile adventures. "The trouble is, I'm still not sure if I really want to do that."
Her book, the automobile columnist Marshall Schuon wrote in his review for The Times, "delivers what the title promises, double entendre included, in glorious prose."
Later, Ms. Hazleton got a pilot's license and moved to Seattle.
"Fearless and irreverent" is how the author Pico Iyer described Ms. Hazleton, whom he met about a decade ago at a TEDGlobal conference, where both were popular speakers. "I felt to a striking degree she held to no orthodoxies," he said in an interview. "She was full-throated in a liberating way."
Fourteen years ago, Ms. Hazleton began writing a blog, Accidental Theologist, about faith and religion. "I never meant for this to happen," she wrote. "Perhaps the 13 years I lived and worked in Jerusalem have a lot to do with it -- a city where politics and religion are at their most incendiary."
Ms. Hazleton was deeply affected, and unsettled, by her time in the Middle East and wrote often about its complicated ancient history. "Mary: A Flesh-and-Blood Biography of the Virgin Mother," appeared in 2004, followed by "Jezebel: The Untold Story of the Bible's Harlot Queen," in 2007. She explored the roots of the Shia-Sunni branches of Islam, and how they split, in her 2009 book, "After the Prophet." Then she tackled Muhammad.
Ms. Hazleton wanted to get a sense of the prophet as "a complex, multidimensional human being," she said, "instead of the two-dimensional figure created by reverence on the one hand and prejudice on the other." (She had already given a TEDx talk debunking the many myths about the Quran, including the one about 72 virgins awaiting martyrs in heaven.)
"The First Muslim: The Story of Muhammad" (2013) was well-received, and to her delight Ms. Hazleton became a sought-after speaker at cultural events and conferences about Islam.
"In today's febrile cultural and religious climate, what project could be more fraught than writing a popular biography of Muhammad?" Hari Kunzru wrote in The New York Times Book Review, noting that Ms. Hazleton had handled her subject with "scrupulous respect."
Ms. Hazleton examined her own beliefs in her last book, "Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto" (2016).
"I stand tall in my agnosticism," Ms. Hazleton wrote in "Agnostic," "because the essence of it is not merely not-knowing, but something far more challenging and infinitely more intriguing: the magnificent oxymoron inherent in the concept of unknowability."
Lesley Adele Hazleton was born on Sept. 20, 1945, in Reading, England. Her parents, Sybil (Silverman) Hazleton and Jessel Hazleton, a general practitioner, raised Lesley and her brother, Ian, her only survivor, in an Orthodox, but not strict, Jewish household. Lesley attended the Roman Catholic St. Joseph's Convent School (now St. Joseph's College) in Reading. As the only Jew there, she once wrote, she developed "a deep sense of mystery but no affinity for organized religion."
She earned her B.A. in psychology at the University of Manchester, where she worked on the student newspaper, and her master's degree in psychology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She was a counselor and a teacher in an experimental high school there before turning to journalism.
"What's wrong with dying?" Ms. Hazleton asked in a 2016 TEDx talk in Seattle. She had met a Silicon Valley type who was working on his immortality. (Many, many supplements were involved.) What could be more awful, more boring, she thought, than immortality? The exchange led her to develop the talk, which was her last.
"We need endings," she said in that talk, "because the most basic ending of all is built into us."
"Our ability to die, our mortality, is a defining part of what it is to be human," she added. "We are finite beings within infinity. And if we are alive to this, it sharpens our appreciation of the fact that we exist. Gives new depth to the idea of life as a journey. So my mortality does not negate meaning; it creates meaning."
"Because it's not how long I live that matters -- it's how I live," she concluded. "And I intend to do it well, to the end."

China's E.V. Innovations Worry Rivals Elsewhere: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More capable autonomous driving is just one way Chinese automakers are threatening to pull ahead -- their E.V.s are also becoming bigger and roomier.
Automakers in China are building a new generation of bigger, more technologically advanced and competitive electric cars, threatening to leap further ahead of their global rivals as they step up exports around the world.
The dozens of car companies operating in China plan to put 71 new battery electric models on sale this year. Many new models have taller hoods for a bolder appearance and more storage space. The cars have bigger tires that improve braking. The seats are thicker and more comfortable. The batteries are ever smaller, more powerful and quicker to recharge.
The changes are aimed at making the cars even more appealing for customers in China and more competitive abroad. Along with plug-in hybrid cars, battery electric cars are taking sales away from gasoline-powered cars and their manufacturers.
China is also moving ahead with the technology and regulations for self-driving cars. The authorities approved data security arrangements this week for more capable autonomous vehicles. They approved cars from Tesla, the American electric vehicle company that also builds and sells cars in China, as well as five Chinese manufacturers, including BYD, Tesla's principal global rival, and Nio, a longtime player in China's auto sector.
The approvals show the Chinese government's eagerness to push the development of self-driving vehicles, which are widely seen as central to future competitiveness in the car industry. The technology is more compatible with battery electric cars than with plug-in hybrids or gasoline-powered cars, and Chinese companies are trying to catch up with Tesla, the leader in these systems.
In the United States, Tesla's so-called Autopilot feature has been the subject of a series of government safety investigations. But in China, regulators and the general public have tended to see the technology as safer than relying on human drivers.
Chinese automakers have been investing heavily in driver-assistance software. An electric car "is becoming a robot on wheels," said Frank Wu, the vice president of design at Jiyue. The company is a joint venture of Zhejiang Geely, a Chinese automaker, and Baidu, one of China's main artificial intelligence companies and Tesla's partner in its self-driving efforts in China.
Better batteries and falling costs underpin China's push in electric cars. CATL, based in southeastern China and the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, announced last week at the Beijing auto show that a 10-minute charge of its newest battery would give a range of 370 miles. A 30-minute full charge would give a range of 620 miles, the company said.
Achieving these distances involves extremely high-precision chemistry and engineering and "putting each nano-particle in the right place," said Gao Huan, the chief technology officer of CATL's electric car business.
The advances have meant automakers can use smaller batteries, freeing up space in cars' interiors, or they can keep the battery the same size and achieve greater range.
Much of the extra space is going into larger back seats with more legroom.
"We're going to put more focus on the backseat -- we want to make it more appealing," said Wang Tan, the general manager of design at XPeng Motors, a Chinese electric car manufacturer.
Manufacturers of electric vehicles used to put a priority on keeping cars as light as possible, because weight is what mostly matters for how far a car can go before needing a recharge. But more powerful batteries now allow electric vehicles to be taller and heavier.
Bigger front ends create a luxurious appearance that taps into many buyers' admiration of sport utility vehicles, said Kris Tomasson, vice president of design at Nio.
"A higher front has that prestige," he said.
Chinese automakers are also embracing designs with more edges, like a blue-green Denza Z9GT sedan displayed at the show by BYD. They are shifting away from lightweight but costly aluminum and building cars with a higher proportion of slightly heavier but cheaper steel alloys.
Aluminum body panels need to be more curved and do not allow for the sharper lines possible with a return to steel, said Stefan Sielaff, Geely's vice president of global design. The effect is to make the cars more visually striking as automotive fashions shift away from the rounded shapes on previous electric cars.
Customers overseas as well as in China are getting pickier. Many are buying plug-in hybrids instead of cars powered only by batteries, although the markets for both are still growing in China.
Not all the electric cars at the Beijing show are bigger and roomier. Xiaomi, a Chinese producer of inexpensive smartphones, displayed its first electric car, the SU7 sports sedan. The tech company has made a move into the car market that Apple has mulled for many years without undertaking.
The SU7 looks almost identical from the outside to a Porsche Taycan electric car. But it costs less than a fifth of a Taycan, which ranges in China from $ 140,000 to $ 275,000.
Lei Jun, the chief executive of Xiaomi, was followed by a crowd of admirers as he walked around the auto show.
He exuded confidence in a speech at the SU7 introduction while still expressing worry about one rival. "Except Tesla, there seems to be hardly anyone better than us," he said.
Chinese auto executives consistently express a mixture of respect and fear of Tesla, an automaker that did not introduce any new cars at the show. Last week, Tesla announced a 9 percent fall in sales and a 55 percent drop in profits in the first quarter of this year, and plans to lay off more than a tenth of its worldwide employees, or 14,000 people.
Long-established Western automakers, by contrast, lag in autonomous driving and are struggling to catch up in electric cars.
General Motors and Ford Motor have lost much of their market share in China over the past five years. Ford introduced the most-talked-about car at the Beijing auto show in 2020, the Mustang Mach-E electric car. But administrative problems led to more than a year of production delays, and public interest evaporated.
Ford decided this year to emphasize very different Mustangs, equipped with hulking five-liter V-8 gasoline engines and four exhaust pipes.
Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China who is now an electric car industry consultant in Shanghai, said Tesla had emerged as the sole strong global contender from the United States in the electric vehicle market.
"If they ever died, the whole E.V. market dies with it in the United States," he said.
Established companies in Europe also face formidable challenges. China's electric car exports to Europe are climbing, prompting a European Union investigation into whether they are unfairly subsidized.
Ralf Brandstätter, the chief executive of Volkswagen China, called for Chinese manufacturers to buy car parts in Europe and assemble them there using European workers.
"Then they have to handle a European labor force, European enterprises, and they have to compete in the same environment as we are competing," he said. China has used steep tariffs and other measures to require that multinationals make cars in China for the Chinese market.
Chinese E.V.s are going next to the United States.
Geely is exporting its Polestar 2 to the United States from China, and paying a 27.5 percent tariff to do so. It is also beginning to export its new Polestar 3, before a planned shift of production to an assembly line being completed this summer in South Carolina.

Are E.V.s Too Quiet and 'Boring'?: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Electric Cars Are Boring," by Ezra Dyer (Opinion guest essay, April 13):
If E.V.s are boring, I guess I am OK with being bored. As an E.V. owner, I no longer have to stop at the gas station to fill up in all kinds of (Chicago) weather. No more oil changes, no more antifreeze concerns, no muffler or fuel pump problems. Boring is good.
No key or fob to carry, and I can preheat or precool my E.V. in various types of inclement weather.
Now for full disclosure. I bought my first E.V. 10 years ago when I was 73. I am now at the age where simpler (boring) is better. I still drive my grandson's stick shift from time to time, but find it requires too much effort.
I was wondering if Mr. Dyer would like to go back to the horse and buggy. Just think of the road noise and the sound of real horses.
Ron Thomas
Glencoe, Ill.
To the Editor:
The slowdown in E.V. sales is not because they are boring. It's because they are 1) too expensive; 2) take too long to charge; 3) don't go far enough on a single charge.
I will happily buy a medium-size S.U.V. E.V. when it goes 500 miles on a five-minute charge and costs about the same as the hybrid version. Until then I will settle for the Toyota RAV4 hybrid.
John Aitken
Salt Lake City
To the Editor:
Sitting on the back deck of my house, I can hear the faint roar of traffic from the town center, about a mile away. I console myself that when more people are driving E.V.s, quiet and the sweet cacophony of bird song will prevail.
Now, Ezra Dyer tells us that E.V. manufacturers are designing speaker systems that will mimic the sound of "loud exhaust" because E.V.s are too boring.
What's next, E.V.s equipped to spew the nostalgia-inducing "not entirely unpleasant" smell of gas, oil and diesel?
The genius of human invention never fails to amaze and horrify.
Janet Buchwald

To the Editor:
What an unexpected and incredibly refreshing surprise to see the essay on electric cars by Ezra Dyer, a Car and Driver columnist. As a longtime Car and Driver subscriber and past and present owner of three Alfa Romeos, I agree wholeheartedly with his observations.
And given the fact that the Porsche 911 GT3 is one of the most coveted cars by my 25-year-old son, there is hope for the next generation. We just need the car manufacturers to listen to the roar.

Living With Roommates in College
To the Editor:
Re "Living With a Stranger Is Hard. College Students Should Try It," by Pamela Paul (column, April 23):
I had the unique privilege of having roommates for my first two years of college who were radically different from me. I learned an awful lot because of the experience. But there was plenty I wish I hadn't too.
The move to college is hard enough -- academically, socially, mentally -- that sharing that with another person places a needless burden on new students.
Ms. Paul is quite right that students benefit from learning from those around them, and schools should emphasize this in the classroom. But if there's one place that ought to be sacred and free from the trials of starting college, it should be one's room.
James J. Bernstein
New York
To the Editor:
When I arrived at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a freshman in 1972 as a Jewish New Yorker in a distant land, I met my new roommate, a Muslim from the Philippines. Two people could not have been more different. And it worked out magically.
While we have lost touch over the years, I still remember his glowing smile and warmth and am glad we were selected as roommates. It helped me to grow and appreciate people from vastly different backgrounds.
Randomness in roommate selection can generate growth and learning, which is what I always thought college is supposed to do.

Tech in the Classroom
To the Editor:
Re "Tech in Schools Needs 'a Hard Reset,"' by Jessica Grose (Opinion, April 28):
Over the past 15 years of having school-age kids, I have been deeply frustrated by how our schools have adopted technology without enough scrutiny. It is depressing to realize how many hours my kids are required to spend in front of the computer screen daily -- and all without any body of evidence pointing to its positive effect on learning.
How I dreamed about running the iPad over with my van after four years of my high schooler reading everything -- even novels! -- on his device.
Though I've heard noble rationales for tech in the classrooms -- "It will save the trees!" -- I agree with Ms. Grose that schools need to re-evaluate what tech companies decide the schools need.
Not only are standardized tests at every level revealing faltering learning outcomes, but the human-to-human interaction is also clearly suffering the most. Out with Google Slides; in with teaching!

'Unpleasant Truths' About Russia
To the Editor:
Re "How Do I Talk to My Son About a War I Don't Understand?," by Sasha Vasilyuk (Opinion guest essay, April 28):
The war in Ukraine is not "Russia's betrayal," as Ms. Vasilyuk writes, but Russia's business as usual. For generations, Moscow has violently suppressed the freedoms of surrounding nations.
Rather than withhold unpleasant truths, Russian parents must teach their children what Ukrainian, Polish or Latvian children learn from theirs: Historically Russia is an aggressor.
Russia's imperialism relies on the unquestioned belief among countless ordinary Russians that their state has a virtuous right to dominate its neighbors. Without much hard work by parents and teachers, Russia's noxious record will continue unchallenged.

Water and Politics
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats See Water as Issue to Win Over Rural Arizona Voters" (news article, April 24):
This article points out the difficulty that Democrats face in winning over conservative voters. For these desert communities, water is a life and death issue. But even though they admit that Republican policies hurt them and Democratic policies help them, these people will vote for Donald Trump.
And it's not as if they don't realize which side is which. They may agree that on this crucial issue the Democrats are right and are helping them, and the Republicans are wrong and are hurting them, but it doesn't matter. They will still vote for Mr. Trump. There could be no clearer example of people voting directly against their own interests.
If nothing else, this discouraging story shows how much stronger is the fear of migrants, of change, of big government -- all abstract fears really -- than the drastic reality staring these people in the face.

Black Entrepreneurs on the Fence: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kimberly Jolasun, a 32-year-old entrepreneur in Atlanta, has never voted for the Republican candidate for the presidency. That may be about to change.
Her company, Villie, is an online platform that lets new parents share photos and updates about their babies with friends and relatives and register for gifts like strollers and playpens. Not yet profitable, her company needs financing to grow. But venture capitalists struggle with her untraditional profile, she said. Technology is dominated by white men in places like Silicon Valley and Austin, Texas. She is a Black woman in Georgia.
Banks want to charge her interest as high as 14 percent for business loans. The interest rate on the credit card debt she used to start the company has spiked to 25 percent, tripling her monthly payments.
Ms. Jolasun knows that borrowing costs are driven by the Federal Reserve. She does not blame President Biden. But she assumes that his Republican opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, is more in tune with the needs of business owners. So she is seriously contemplating giving him her vote.
"For the first time in my life, the ball's in the air," she said. "I haven't made my decision."
Despite indications of vigor in the economy, higher borrowing costs are a source of financial anxiety that could prove pivotal in the 2024 presidential election -- especially in Georgia, one of six battleground states expected to determine the outcome.
Black voters are a crucial bloc in Georgia; four years ago, they made up 27 percent of the electorate. By many indications, Black Americans are disproportionately affected by higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, student loans and business debts. Start-up companies owned by people of color -- especially Black Americans -- confront substantial barriers in raising funds, making them more vulnerable to increased borrowing costs, according to a survey of minority-owned small businesses by the Federal Reserve. Though their companies are typically smaller and less profitable, Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs tend to be rejected on applications for financing even after accounting for differences in credit ratings, suggesting that racial profiling is an issue.
"It's hard for people like me to raise capital," said Veronica Woodruff, the founder of Travelsist, a company in Atlanta that pairs travelers who need help navigating airports with support from companions. "I'm an African-Latina woman, and I'm in the South. It just makes it hard to get in front of people who are writing checks."
Ms. Woodruff, 40, has already raised $ 1.1 million, including a $ 250,000 grant from the Fearless Fund, a nonprofit that seeks to address the shortage of capital for businesses owned by women of color. The organization has been hamstrung by a lawsuit from an activist group that says directing funds to minority women is racial discrimination.
Ms. Woodruff is seeking $ 8 million in additional investment to expand her business. Rising costs have forced her to increase wages to $ 20 an hour from $ 15. Venture capitalists are demanding sweeter terms for their investments.
Raised in California, she considers herself a liberal who values civil rights. But as the overseer of a business, she is struggling to decide how to vote.
"I'm taking a lot of risk here," Ms. Woodruff said. "It's for everyone, for all of my employees, for everyone who has equity in this company and the communities that we operate in."
The significance of the Black vote in Georgia is hard to overstate. From 2000 to 2019, the number of eligible voters in the state increased by 1.9 million, with Black people making up nearly half that number, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center.
Mr. Biden captured 88 percent of the Black vote in Georgia in 2020 and is expected to win over that bloc again by a whopping margin in this year's election. Yet in a state decided by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago, even a slight reduction of support could be decisive.
Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Monday at the start of an economic tour of battleground states to underline the administration's efforts to support Black business owners and entrepreneurs and narrow the racial wealth gap.
Mr. Trump was the chosen candidate for 16 percent of Black voters nationally in a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College. The same poll found that 81 percent of Black voters rated the economy "fair" or "poor."
By headline indicators, Georgia appears in robust economic shape. In March, the unemployment rate was 3.1 percent, below the national level, 3.8 percent. Inflation is down from its heights. Atlanta has gained jobs by turning itself into a venue for filming Hollywood movies and by attracting multinational companies that have established corporate headquarters there.
Northwest of the city, Hyundai, the South Korean auto giant, is joining forces with another company, SK On, to pour $ 5 billion into the construction of an electric vehicle battery plant. A $ 2.3 billion solar panel factory is going up nearby, the work of Hanwha Qcells, another South Korean business. And the state has seen a surge of food processing factories.
"We've been landing lots of new projects, setting new records," said Jeffrey M. Humphreys, an economist at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia. "They all kind of build on each other."
On the state's coast in Savannah, expansion is underway at what is already one of the country's largest container shipping ports. The docks are gaining cargo diverted from the port of Baltimore after a container vessel ran into a major bridge there, causing the bridge to collapse and halting cargo traffic.
But the effect of higher borrowing costs is not directly captured in official measures of inflation, and increased debt payments tend to erode the benefits of economic growth.
A recent paper by economists at Harvard and the International Monetary Fund concluded that larger payments for mortgages, credit cards and other forms of debt largely explained the gap between rosy economic assessments from experts and glum prognoses from ordinary people.
"Everybody feels like they are stagnant or struggling," said John Lawson, who sells hip-hop-related shoelaces online and coaches small businesses in the Atlanta area. "The cost of living has skyrocketed. Everybody's got jobs and still hustling at the same time."
Black Americans typically suffer rates of unemployment twice those of white Americans. In Georgia, that gap has widened: Black unemployment reached 5.7 percent at the end of last year, while white unemployment was at 2.2 percent, according to an analysis of federal data by the Economic Policy Institute.
Part of this increase appears to reflect how Black-owned businesses have responded to higher borrowing costs: by slowing hiring, reducing hours and cutting jobs, according to a report by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.
Many Black entrepreneurs flock to Atlanta, a city where Black Americans are prominently represented in the ranks of business, government and culture. But start-ups in Atlanta typically struggle to secure adequate financing, local entrepreneurs said.
"Silicon Valley types, they have so much capital that they will throw money at any absurd idea," said Charles Wright, the chief executive of Mechanized AI, a start-up that is building robots powered by artificial intelligence. Venture capitalists in the Southeast are more conservative, he added. "They don't believe in fairy tales."
Mr. Wright has abundant finance for his next venture, given the sale of his start-up data management company for $ 22 million in 2018. He drives a red electric Porsche, one of four cars parked in front of his home in Stone Mountain, a leafy, majority-Black suburb alongside a park that is an enduring monument to the Confederacy. He exudes certainty that Mechanized AI is on the verge of being worth billions.
"I'm sitting on what I know is going to be a unicorn," he said. "There's no precedent for what we're doing."
He is also confident that Black voters will turn out dutifully, if not enthusiastically, for Mr. Biden, whom he credits with returning stability to the economy after the tumult of the Trump administration.
That may prove so. Yet conversations with Black entrepreneurs in Atlanta revealed an overarching sense of uncertainty.
Right after pandemic restrictions were lifted, Omar Whilby saw a considerable surge of business at his nightclub in East Atlanta Village, a hive of bars and music venues.
"Everyone was tired of being at home," Mr. Whilby said. People had money in their pockets, courtesy of the pandemic relief programs established under President Trump.
But last year, with interest rates spiking and prices for gas, groceries and rent climbing, Mr. Whilby's club, iLounge Atlanta, saw business drop by one-third.
In response, he is slowing the development of his technology business, Sound Capsul, which streams music shows online and allows independent artists to upload and share their music.
"We've had to shrink our growth strategy," Mr. Whilby said.
Ray Woods, 34, an Atlanta-area real estate entrepreneur, distills the electoral choice as one between a Republican Party that does not care about Black people and a Democratic Party that takes Black voters for granted.
He voted twice for Barack Obama as president and admires Denmark, where high taxes finance a comprehensive and generous social safety net. He supported the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist, in the Democratic presidential primary in 2016. Then, he cast his ballot for Mr. Trump in the general election.
Mr. Woods is set to vote for Mr. Trump again this time, seeing him as the best way to advance the interests of business.
"America has been built on capitalism," he said. "We need somebody who understands business."

Despite indications of vigor in the economy, higher borrowing costs are a source of financial anxiety that could prove pivotal in the 2024 presidential election — especially in Georgia, one of six battleground states expected to determine the outcome.
Black voters are a crucial bloc in Georgia; four years ago, they made up 27% of the electorate. By many indications, Black Americans are disproportionately affected by higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, student loans and business debts. Startup companies owned by people of color — especially Black Americans — confront substantial barriers in raising funds, making them more vulnerable to increased borrowing costs, according to a survey of minority-owned small businesses by the Federal Reserve. Although their companies are typically smaller and less profitable, Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs tend to be rejected on applications for financing even after accounting for differences in credit ratings, suggesting that racial profiling is an issue.
“It’s hard for people like me to raise capital,” said Veronica Woodruff, the founder of Travelsist, a company in Atlanta that pairs travelers who need help navigating airports with support from companions. “I’m an African Latina woman, and I’m in the South. It just makes it hard to get in front of people who are writing checks.”
Woodruff, 40, has already raised $1.1 million, including a $250,000 grant from the Fearless Fund, a nonprofit that seeks to address the shortage of capital for businesses owned by women of color. The organization has been hamstrung by a lawsuit from an activist group that says directing funds to minority women is racial discrimination.
Woodruff is seeking $8 million in additional investment to expand her business. Rising costs have forced her to increase wages to $20 an hour from $15. Venture capitalists are demanding sweeter terms for their investments.
Raised in California, she considers herself a liberal who values civil rights. But as the overseer of a business, she is struggling to decide how to vote.
“I’m taking a lot of risk here,” Woodruff said. “It’s for everyone, for all of my employees, for everyone who has equity in this company and the communities that we operate in.”
The significance of the Black vote in Georgia is hard to overstate. From 2000 to 2019, the number of eligible voters in the state increased by 1.9 million, with Black people making up nearly half that number, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center.
Biden captured 88% of the Black vote in Georgia in 2020 and is expected to win over that bloc again by a whopping margin in this year’s election. Yet in a state decided by fewer than 12,000 votes four years ago, even a slight reduction of support could be decisive.
Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Monday at the start of an economic tour of battleground states to underline the administration’s efforts to support Black business owners and entrepreneurs and narrow the racial wealth gap.
Trump was the chosen candidate for 16% of Black voters nationally in a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College. The same poll found that 81% of Black voters rated the economy “fair” or “poor.”
By headline indicators, Georgia appears in robust economic shape. In March, the unemployment rate was 3.1%, below the national level, 3.8%. Inflation is down from its heights. Atlanta has gained jobs by turning itself into a venue for filming Hollywood movies and by attracting multinational companies that have established corporate headquarters there.
Northwest of the city, Hyundai, the South Korean auto giant, is joining forces with another company, SK On, to pour $5 billion into the construction of an electric vehicle battery plant. A $2.3 billion solar panel factory is going up nearby, the work of Hanwha Qcells, another South Korean business. And the state has seen a surge of food processing factories.
“We’ve been landing lots of new projects, setting new records,” said Jeffrey M. Humphreys, an economist at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia. “They all kind of build on each other.”
On the state’s coast in Savannah, expansion is underway at what is already one of the country’s largest container shipping ports. The docks are gaining cargo diverted from the Port of Baltimore after a container vessel ran into a major bridge there, causing the bridge to collapse and halting cargo traffic.
But the effect of higher borrowing costs is not directly captured in official measures of inflation, and increased debt payments tend to erode the benefits of economic growth.
A recent paper by economists at Harvard University and the International Monetary Fund concluded that larger payments for mortgages, credit cards and other forms of debt largely explained the gap between rosy economic assessments from experts and glum prognoses from ordinary people.
“Everybody feels like they are stagnant or struggling,” said John Lawson, who sells hip-hop-related shoelaces online and coaches small businesses in the Atlanta area. “The cost of living has skyrocketed. Everybody’s got jobs and still hustling at the same time.”
Black Americans typically suffer rates of unemployment twice those of white Americans. In Georgia, that gap has widened: Black unemployment reached 5.7% at the end of last year, while white unemployment was at 2.2%, according to an analysis of federal data by the Economic Policy Institute.
Part of this increase appears to reflect how Black-owned businesses have responded to higher borrowing costs: by slowing hiring, reducing hours and cutting jobs, according to a report by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.
Many Black entrepreneurs flock to Atlanta, a city where Black Americans are prominently represented in the ranks of business, government and culture. But startups in Atlanta typically struggle to secure adequate financing, local entrepreneurs said.
“Silicon Valley types, they have so much capital that they will throw money at any absurd idea,” said Charles Wright, the CEO of Mechanized AI, a startup that is building robots powered by artificial intelligence. Venture capitalists in the Southeast are more conservative, he added. “They don’t believe in fairy tales.”
Wright has abundant financing for his next venture, given the sale of his startup data management company for $22 million in 2018. He drives a red electric Porsche, one of four cars parked in front of his home in Stone Mountain, a leafy, majority-Black suburb alongside a park that is an enduring monument to the Confederacy. He exudes certainty that Mechanized AI is on the verge of being worth billions.
“I’m sitting on what I know is going to be a unicorn,” he said. “There’s no precedent for what we’re doing.”
He is also confident that Black voters will turn out dutifully, if not enthusiastically, for Biden, whom he credits with returning stability to the economy after the tumult of the Trump administration.
That may prove so. Yet conversations with Black entrepreneurs in Atlanta revealed an overarching sense of uncertainty.
Right after pandemic restrictions were lifted, Omar Whilby saw a considerable surge of business at his nightclub in East Atlanta Village, a hive of bars and music venues.
“Everyone was tired of being at home,” Whilby said. People had money in their pockets, courtesy of the pandemic relief programs established under Trump.
But last year, with interest rates spiking and prices for gas, groceries and rent climbing, Whilby’s club, iLounge Atlanta, saw business drop by one-third.
In response, he is slowing the development of his technology business, Sound Capsul, which streams music shows online and allows independent artists to upload and share their music.
“We’ve had to shrink our growth strategy,” Whilby said.
Ray Woods, 34, an Atlanta-area real estate entrepreneur, distills the electoral choice as one between a Republican Party that does not care about Black people and a Democratic Party that takes Black voters for granted.
He voted twice for Barack Obama as president and admires Denmark, where high taxes finance a comprehensive and generous social safety net. He supported the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist, in the Democratic presidential primary in 2016. Then, he cast his ballot for Trump in the general election.
Woods is set to vote for Trump again this time, seeing him as the best way to advance the interests of business.
“America has been built on capitalism,” he said. “We need somebody who understands business.”

Electric Cars Are Boring: [Op-Ed]

Full text: We're at an inflection point in electric-car optimism. Over the past few years, as electric vehicle sales increased substantially and car companies announced an onslaught of new battery-powered models, it seemed that electric cars were a near-term inevitability. But for all the heady promise, E.V. enthusiasm seems to be cooling.
Ford recently announced that it's cutting production targets for the Lightning, its electric truck. Brag-and-bluster Tesla projected that sales growth in 2024 would be "notably lower" than in recent years. Hertz is selling off about a third of its electric cars and Audi is slowing its transition to E.V.s. There are plenty of obvious headwinds for E.V.s -- cost, range, and charging infrastructure (or lack thereof). But there's also a more subtle issue at play, one that won't be easily resolved: Electric cars are too boring.
I know this seems like a preposterous complaint, and I agree. On the list of things wrong with the world, "electric cars are dull" isn't in the Top 5. I revel in being able to charge my plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica with my solar panels, and believe that E.V.s are the answer to humanity's long-term transportation needs. However, I also believe that the anesthetic experience of driving an electric car is a real hurdle to the technology's widespread adoption, given that nearly every potential E.V. buyer grew up with the rich sensory experience of internal combustion.
Driving, as we all knew it before the arrival of mass-market electric cars a little more than a decade ago, involved familiar rituals that carved out a place in our collective psyche. You'd turn a key or push a button, feel a rumble of vibration through the seat and steering wheel, put a transmission in gear and listen to the revs rise and fall with upshifts and downshifts. Maybe you learned to drive with a manual transmission, with your feet dancing between clutch and accelerator as you chose your gears, herky-jerky at first but eventually tilling a furrow into muscle memory. There might be smells, oil and gas or diesel, not pleasant but not entirely unpleasant, either.
For people who love cars, and even those who don't, this flood of visceral sensory feedback becomes associated with freedom and road trips, first dates and dashes to the grocery store.
Electric cars make a clean break from all of that. Climb into an electric car, and there's often no key to turn or start button to push -- it's just on. There's little noise except for the legally required pedestrian warning tone, which often sounds like Trent Reznor composing a creepy-synth Nine Inch Nails tune somewhere behind the front bumper. Some of them have a "one pedal" mode that doesn't even require touching the brake pedal most of the time. It's like driving a sensory deprivation chamber. For passengers, it's luxurious. For drivers, it's dull.
Sure, some versions of the Lucid Air and Tesla Model S can hit 150 m.p.h. in less than 10 seconds, but that's important the same way it's important for watches to be waterproof to a depth of 1,000 feet -- as a brag for tedious rich people. The Tesla Cybertruck, with its polygon-meme shape and stainless-steel skin, is essentially the world's most visible riposte to the boring-E.V. problem. Squeeze the accelerator, though, and it behaves like every other electric car, which is to say quick and coldhearted.
Powerful acceleration used to be a thrill in its own right, but E.V.s commodified and muffled that aspect of performance. A quick electric car is as common as a sunny day in Los Angeles, a pleasant base-line normal that's mostly taken for granted.
Perhaps it's true that many cars are generally boring regardless of how they're powered, deliberately inoffensive in the name of mass appeal. And griping about sound and character might sound like the futile whining of a demographic raised on muscle cars and four-speed manuals -- "OK Boomer" on wheels. But I've got some bad news for car companies hoping that the next generation will become E.V.-native.
My kids are 11 and 13 years old and they are manifestly unexcited about electric cars. When they play Forza on Xbox, I hear the shrieks of Lamborghinis and the roar of Ford Raptors emanating from the room. I test cars for a living, and the kids' favorite car from the past few years was the Dodge Challenger Black Ghost, an 807-horsepower resource-pillager that represents the last gasp of supercharged V-8 thunder for Dodge. It's a stupid car, really, peak mouth-breather, screaming of wretched excess. But its analog mechanical brutality activates some primal lobe deep in our brains, the one that catalyzes noise into adrenaline. The final V-8 Challenger rolled off the line on Dec. 22 last year, another dinosaur obliterated by the E.V. asteroid.
Car companies are trying to figure out how to recapture the distinctive personalities of cars like the Black Ghost in the E.V. era. Dodge envisions a booming speaker system for its future electric muscle cars, mimicking loud exhaust. BMW is going futuristic, with a soundtrack developed by Hans Zimmer -- floor the accelerator, and the iX model fills with the noise of a synth-spaceship warp. Toyota is developing a manual transmission emulator for electric cars, to return some of the driving engagement. Or so we can hope.
Building a simulated manual transmission that's not really connected to anything might sound a little bit pathetic, but I have reason to be optimistic, because I've seen how quickly technology can change. Twenty years ago, I went to Michelin's alternative-fuel vehicle conference in Shanghai, and at that point nobody saw lithium batteries and electric cars on the horizon. Now we have electric pickup trucks that are as quick as a Corvette, and wind and solar power are the fastest growing and cheapest new means of producing electricity. The Biden administration aims to hasten E.V. adoption with new rules and tax incentives. And it seems logical that, after conquering their objective goals, car companies will turn to the subjective ones, the noises and nuances that make driving fun.
Look, all I want is an E.V. that sounds like a mountain lion keening at your bedroom window, the way a Porsche 911 GT3 does at full throttle. The GT3 -- and many of our favorite cars -- could easily be made much quieter. But Porsche understands that sometimes, to make a car better, you've got to make it a little worse.
The electric future is clean, smooth and refined. But we might get there sooner if we can figure out how to rough it up a little bit.

A Screenwriter and Her Tragic Tale: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Diane Thomas was a waitress when she made headlines for the script sale of what would become a box office smash. But the Cinderella story had a sad ending.
Each day, before her waitressing shift began, Diane Thomas would plop herself onto the floor of her tiny Malibu studio apartment, in front of a low-slung desk, and begin typing. Throughout late 1978 and early 1979, she worked daily, hours on end, conjuring the tale of Joan Chase, a mousy romance novelist suddenly thrust into a life-or-death adventure.
"I wanted to write about a woman who became her own heroine," Thomas would offer of her inspiration. "The notion that we can be whatever we imagine ourselves to be interested me."
Forty years ago, Thomas's story, "Romancing the Stone" -- and its heroine, renamed Joan Wilder -- reached big screens, becoming one of the top box office hits of 1984 and an enduring classic, owing to a perfectly measured blend of action, comedy and romance. "It's still the most well-rounded script I've ever read," Michael Douglas, the film's producer and co-star, said in an interview. "In many ways, it was a reflection of Diane -- she wasn't quite as shy as Joan Wilder, but she poured a lot of herself into this story of a writer who experiences a metamorphosis."
During a golden era of action-adventure pictures, the novice Thomas turned the genre on its head. "A woman being the impetus for that kind of movie hadn't been done, certainly not in that way," said Kathleen Turner, who played Wilder. "I mean, the girls in those types of movies were just that -- they were always sidekicks or scenery."
Thomas's friends, like her fellow writer Betty Spence, said the sweep of the story -- which moved from the posh Upper West Side of Manhattan to the raw jungles of South America -- was the product of a fertile imagination. "Diane was a pure storyteller," Spence said. "She could sit there and spin a tale out of nothing, and it would have a perfect beginning, middle and end."
When Thomas sold her script in the summer of 1979, she went from minimum-wage worker to one of the highest-paid screenwriters in Hollywood. It was the start of a meteoric career that would include a pair of major movie hits and multiple projects with Steven Spielberg. Yet "Romancing the Stone" would be the only film to ever bear a Thomas writing credit because her life was tragically cut short.
At the height of her success, in late 1985, Thomas, just 39, was killed in a car accident. As Spence would note later, Thomas "strove to make her life the stuff of fantasy" -- and, for a little while, anyway, she succeeded.
LONG BEFORE DIANE THOMAS became part of Hollywood's dream factory, her life had been shaped by it. Born in 1946 in northern Michigan, she attended the University of Southern California business school and worked for years in advertising. "That came out of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movies," Thomas once told a journalist, "where advertising was always this glamorous profession."
She eventually tired of writing ad copy. She went on to study with the Actors Studio sage Jack Garfein, write short sketches, perform with an improv troupe, attend grad school for clinical psychology and work at a halfway house. "What made Diane such an interesting writer," Douglas said, "was that she'd done a lot of different things before she ever got to the movies."
In her mid-30s, Thomas finally decided to channel her storytelling instincts into screenwriting. To pay the rent, she began waitressing at the Corral Beach Cantina, a Mexican cafe on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, while she developed "Romancing the Stone."
She'd gleaned the title -- a bit of jewelry industry jargon referring to the mythmaking surrounding precious gems -- from an old boyfriend, but the premise was all hers: Joan, a romance writer is shaken out of her staid world after her sister is kidnapped in Colombia. She sets out to save her sibling while pursing the film's titular stone, dodging a small army of villains, finding both herself and romance with a charming rogue, Jack Colton. "The best part for her was conjuring that character," Spence said, "coming up with the man of her dreams."
The screenwriter John Hill, a friend of Thomas's, read her script and called his agent, Norman Kurland, raving about it. In a long career, Kurland had read thousands of spec scripts. "But Diane's was unique," he said, and he agreed to represent her. "Actually, I had one other experience that was similar, and that was a script sent to me by an ad copywriter from the Midwest, who turned out to be Larry Kasdan. And it was the screenplay for 'The Bodyguard."'
In August 1979, Kurland was about to shop the script when Sherry Lansing, an executive at Columbia Pictures, suggested he funnel the project to Douglas, who'd just brought his production company to the studio. Douglas had given up a successful TV career (as co-star of "The Streets of San Francisco") to produce films, winning a best-picture Oscar for "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and earning accolades for the political drama "The China Syndrome."
Douglas was searching for a different kind of project, and was wowed by "Romancing" and the bravura of its first-time author. Thomas "was not cautious," Douglas said at the time. "Unlike so many screenplays by people who have had material rejected, there was a total lack of fear to the writing." He persuaded the Columbia studio head Frank Price to pre-empt the sales process and buy the script outright for a hefty $ 250,000 (roughly $ 1.1 million today). "People criticized me for paying so much for a first-time screenwriter," Douglas said in an interview. "My feeling was, first time or 10th time, the script is the script, and hers was wonderful."
Still, The Los Angeles Times noted that she had become "something of a symbol to the legion of would-be writers" waiting for their big breaks. Suddenly everyone in Hollywood was inundated with scripts from amateur writers who all thought they were the next Diane Thomas. Among the many inquiries Kurland received was a call from another service-industry worker with a screenplay. "Get it over here right away," he told her, "this is my week for waitresses." The script wasn't any good. "Which just goes to show," Kurland said, "how unusual Diane and 'Romancing the Stone' were."
THE SALE HAD BEEN EASY, but bringing "Romancing the Stone" to the screen would prove to be a challenge. Douglas struggled to get the film off the ground for years while Thomas -- along with other writers -- continued to refine her script. (She would also contribute to another Douglas project, "Starman.") Further complicating his effort was the 1981 release of a vaguely similar treasure-hunting adventure, "Raiders of the Lost Ark." ("Romancing" would later occasionally be dismissed as a "Raiders" ripoff, even though Thomas had written her script years before.)
In 1983, "Romancing the Stone" fell apart at Columbia, but Douglas managed to revive the project at Fox, tapping Robert Zemeckis to direct. Zemeckis's only credits were a pair of comedies that had underperformed, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and "Used Cars." But, Douglas said, "I thought he would be a great match for the tone that Diane had set, given the tongue-in-cheek thing that Bob did so well."
For the principal role of Joan Wilder, the studio suggested the up-and-comer Kathleen Turner, who'd made a memorable debut as the femme fatale in "Body Heat" (1981). Turner met with Thomas, who thought she was right for the part, but the actress still had to persuade Douglas and Zemeckis. "There was a question of whether I could play this wilting wallflower of a woman," Turner said in an interview. "So I put on some sloppy old clothes, went in and stumbled around during the test, and that seemed to reassure them."
After offering the Colton role to his friend Jack Nicholson, who passed, Douglas got further rejections from Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood -- largely because the part was secondary to that of Wilder. Out of options, Douglas cast himself. "After all the better-known actors had turned us down, Fox was open to me doing it," he recalled.
The cast -- which included Douglas's old pal, Danny DeVito, as a comic baddie -- set out for Mexico in the summer of 1983 for an arduous shoot, plagued by apocalyptically bad weather and production mishaps. Rumors from the set were so bad that Zemeckis was fired from his next project, "Cocoon," because that film's producers were convinced that "Romancing the Stone" would bomb. (Ron Howard eventually directed "Cocoon," which became a 1985 hit.) "We weren't even sure we were going to be allowed to finish the film, honestly," Turner said. After some last-minute reshoots the film wrapped that fall.
Expectations were decidedly low when "Romancing the Stone" arrived in theaters in the spring of 1984, but the picture would become the surprise hit of the season, earning $ 115 million on a budget of just $ 10 million and going on to become a Top 10 release in a year filled with iconic blockbusters ("Ghostbusters," "Beverly Hills Cop").
The unexpected success elevated the careers of everyone involved. Thomas was immediately tapped by Steven Spielberg to adapt Jeno Rejto's 1939 novel, "The Blonde Hurricane," and to script a remake of the 1943 fantasy "A Guy Named Joe." (That remake was eventually released in 1989 as "Always," with several writers listed in the credits, but not Thomas.). Thomas also found herself being courted by top directors like George Lucas and Sydney Pollack. "She was a hot writer," Douglas said, "and I was very happy for her."
Thomas was so in demand that she was unavailable when Fox prodded Douglas to turn out a quick sequel to "Romancing the Stone." Instead, he hired Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner to pen the follow-up, "The Jewel of the Nile," but Turner balked at their story. "They'd turned Joan into a figurehead," she said, refusing to take part, and was promptly slapped with a $ 25 million breach of contract suit by Fox.
Douglas hired another team, Ken Levine and David Isaacs, to rewrite the script, but the story's opening act still needed work. Thomas agreed to spend a long weekend with the new writers, helping strengthen the first 30 pages of the screenplay. "She'd created those characters and had an incredible feel for them," Levine said, "which made it very easy to do the work." (He added that much of what he and Isaacs wrote ended up getting thrown out during the film's chaotic shoot in Morocco, though Thomas's contributions remained intact.)
As a thank you for her time, Douglas offered to buy Thomas a new car. Spence urged Thomas to pick something practical, a Mercedes sedan -- but she opted for a Porsche Carrera instead. "The last time I saw Diane," Douglas said, "was when I took her out to the parking lot to show her the Porsche."
That fall, Thomas was dating a young actor named Stephen Norman. On Oct. 21, 1985, Thomas, Norman and another friend, Ian Young, attended an evening writing workshop at Pepperdine University, then stopped off at a bar. Afterward, Norman got behind the wheel of Thomas's Porsche and headed down Pacific Coast Highway. On a rain- slicked stretch near Topanga Canyon, the car spun out of control when Norman misjudged the accelerating power of the Porsche, striking a wooden power pole at 80 mph, and shearing it at the base. Norman survived with only minor injuries. Young was airlifted to U.C.L.A. Medical Center and died a short time later. Thomas, who had been in the back seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. Although Norman was not legally drunk, he was cited for gross negligence and was later convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of Thomas and Young, receiving five years' probation. (Norman did not respond to requests for an interview.)
Thomas didn't live to see the release of "Jewel of the Nile" a few weeks later. The sequel would become another hit, grossing nearly $ 100 million worldwide, though critics would note that the screenplay lacked the inventive spark Thomas had brought to the original.
In the wake of her death, Spielberg established a memorial writing award in Thomas's honor at the University of California, Los Angeles, but "Romancing the Stone" would become her legacy. Over the years, another sequel, a remake and TV adaptation have all been discussed but never materialized. Meanwhile, several recent movies like "The Lost City," "Argylle," even "Wonder Woman," have attempted to copy the premise of "Romancing" and recreate its alchemy with varying results. "When you try and imitate something, it's never going to be as enticing as the original," Turner said. "Diane broke ground with that film."
Four decades on, the pain of Thomas's passing lingers with Douglas. "Her death is still one of the biggest losses of my life," he said. "Diane was a lovely woman and a great writer, who would've gone onto a wonderful, magical career. She would have been right up there with the best."

Thwarted Buyers Pursue Elusive Prey With a Lawsuit: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: But fans of the famed Hermès accessory say that the exclusivity is the whole point.
If you want to buy a Birkin bag, the pièce de résistance from the French luxury retailer Hermès, you should know that you probably can't.
Vogue delivered this tough-love message to readers in a recent article that described the quest for an Hermès bag as "daunting." The magazine cautioned that customers "might wait months or years for the right style to become available" and further dashed hopes by noting that "waiting lists at Hermès stores no longer exist."
The exclusivity of the item is very much part of its appeal -- but a pair of California residents who have struck out in their attempts to buy the bags have decided that enough is enough.
On Tuesday, the two shoppers in question, Tina Cavalleri and Mark Glinoga, filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Hermès in San Francisco. In the complaint, they accuse the company of holding back the coveted bag for all but the highest-spending customers, a practice that, the plaintiffs argue, violates antitrust law.
Hermès did not reply to requests for comment.
Ms. Cavalleri, who is identified in the lawsuit as a California resident, is already the owner of at least one Birkin bag, according to the legal complaint. But she was thwarted in her attempt to buy a second.
The lawsuit says that Ms. Cavalleri "has spent tens of thousands of dollars at Hermès, and had been coerced into purchasing" other Hermès items, described as "ancillary products," before she was given a chance to buy a Birkin bag.
Mr. Glinoga, who is also identified as a California resident, had no luck when he tried to buy a Birkin bag, the suit says. An Hermès sales associate instructed him "to purchase other items and accessories" at the store before he would be considered as a potential customer for the much sought-after item, according to the suit.
Hermès introduced the bag in 1984. It is named after Jane Birkin, the late French film star, singer and muse, who supplied the idea of its general design to the Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas while seated beside him on an Air France flight. In the origin story, she is said to have sketched her idea on a paper emesis bag.
The process of creating a Birkin, as the handbag is known among connoisseurs, takes a reported 18 to 20 hours and is said to be completed by a single craftsperson. Hermès does not disclose how many it produces annually.
A new one retails for upward of $ 10,000; vintage examples have fetched as much as $ 450,000 at auction. Another popular Hermès bag, the Kelly, is named after the film star (and Princess of Monaco) Grace Kelly.
At the heart of the lawsuit is the practice of "tying" -- that is, the selling of a certain item to customers on the condition that they buy another product from the same business.
"The law says it's illegal," Shaun Setareh, a lawyer involved in the suit on behalf of the two plaintiffs, said. "They're preconditioning buying other products -- scarves, belts, shoes, perfume, jewelry -- before they give you the opportunity to buy a Birkin or a Kelly."
Douglas Hand, a lawyer in New York who works with fashion brands including Stella McCartney and Rag & Bone, said in a phone interview that the definition of "tying" was somewhat amorphous, and that the law allowed some room for goods to be sold in a bundle.
A judge, he said, is also more likely to rule that a sales practice violates the law when the item in question can be deemed a necessity. An example might include a drug company that predicates access to lifesaving medication only to those who buy it along with other products.
"There's not as many reasons for why every consumer needs access to a Birkin bag or any specific luxury item," Mr. Hand continued. "What the consumer wants out of that is access to class, access to exclusivity and access to a club that you gain entry into."
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the distinction between bundling and illegal tying could be tricky to parse.
"That's why the outcome will be very, very important to Rolex, Porsche and every luxury brand that has predicated access to the most exclusive items on purchasing less exclusive, unrelated items," Mr. Hand said.
After all, so much of the demand for luxury goods -- whether it is a Ferrari SF90 or a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona -- results from their being in short supply.
"It makes the shopping experience exciting and alluring," said Jacek Kozubek, a luxury watch dealer, whose site, Tropical Watch, is devoted largely to vintage Rolexes.
During the pandemic, Mr. Kozubek decided that he wanted to get a Birkin for his wife.
"I spent $ 60,000 on stuff at Hermès before I could get one," he said, listing purchases that included shoes, scarves and home goods.
Toward the end of his spree, Mr. Kozubek said he went into the Hermès store on Grant Avenue in San Francisco and heard his salesperson utter the magic words: "Would you like to see a Birkin?"
Moments later, he found himself in a private room, nodding approvingly at a midsize Birkin in classic black with gold hardware. He said that he had walked away from the store with the belief that his previous purchases had helped him obtain the grand prize.
Unlike the plaintiffs in the suit, Mr. Kozubek said that he believed there was nothing untoward about how the sale had come about, given that Birkins trade on the secondary market at far above their list prices.
"Hermès is keeping the prices low compared to the market value," he said, "so when they allocate a bag, they want to give it to someone who loves it and supports them."
"You don't get the coolest things in the world right away," Mr. Kozubek continued. "If a Birkin was super accessible, there would be no demand for them. If you could just buy it, it wouldn't be fun. No one would care. No one would want them."
So the thing that makes a Birkin a Birkin is the fact that most people can't get one?
"Hell, yeah!" he said, inserting a coarser descriptive.

Ukrainians Aid Military Effort By Chipping In: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fund-raisers are borrowing heavily from business techniques to keep donations flowing to the military. The latest trend? Broad approaches that rely on networks of friends and acquaintances.
Earlier this year, Daria Chervona, a photo retoucher from Kyiv, was busy trying to raise 78 million Ukrainian hryvnia, about $ 2 million, for Ukraine's army, posting daily on social media to urge friends and acquaintances to chip in. That was a high bar, but after a few weeks she announced she had cleared it, reaching her target.
"You did it," she told her followers on Instagram in late January, in a post displaying the eight-figure sum raised in large black characters.
Ms. Chervona attributes her success to a system she adopted last summer: dividing the work among dozens of people, each tasked with collecting money from friends, in a process that she said can yield large sums. Each fund-raiser is then highlighted in a social media post with their picture, tapping into civilians' desire to be recognized as active participants in the war effort.
"They need to be able to tell themselves, 'I'm doing something, I'm helping,"' Ms. Chervona, 28, said in a recent interview. "I simply understood that any reasonably active person on Instagram could pull in 50K," she added, referring to 50,000 Ukrainian hryvnias, about $ 1,300.
Since the early days of the war, thousands of volunteers have led crowdfunding efforts that have been crucial in supplying the Ukrainian military with critical equipment. They have become part of Ukraine's social fabric, with nearly 80 percent of the population now donating, according to a recent survey.
But as the conflict drags on, and with momentum on the battlefield shifting to Russia, fund-raisers say it has become harder to raise money. That has prompted people like Ms. Chervona to borrow heavily from sales and marketing techniques to keep donations flowing. They have held auctions, organized raffles and invited influencers to participate in promotional clips.
Though sophisticated weaponry donated by the West gets much of the attention, the items raised through Ukrainian crowdfunding -- like warm clothing, bulletproof vests and drones -- are things soldiers need and help lift morale.
The most ambitious crowdfunding campaigns have raised enough money to buy not just small items like gloves but heavy battlefield equipment as well. Ms. Chervona's latest operation, for instance, was devoted to securing money to give to the military brigade to buy five armored personnel carriers. The Ukrainian government said in September that crowdfunding had accounted for 3 percent of Ukraine's total military spending since the war began.
The key, said Oleg Gorokhovskyi, the co-founder of Monobank, Ukraine's largest online bank, is to adopt techniques that have worked in other fields. "You should do it like a business," he said, adding that his bank has processed nearly $ 1 billion in donations since the start of the war.
He and Ms. Chervona provided copies of financial documents to The New York Times that they said showed their fund-raising totals.
People have embraced the broader approaches they use, which Ukrainians call "team fund-raising," for its potential to scale up operations and reach untapped donors. In December alone, nearly $ 115 million was donated through campaigns using that system, according to data from Monobank -- about as much as Germany's latest short-term military aid package to Ukraine.
Ukrainian crowdfunding for the army dates to 2014, when civilians began raising money to help an outgunned military fight off Russian proxies who had instigated a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.
But it dramatically took off after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and has since become "by far the most popular way of participating in civic resistance," among Ukrainian civilians, said Kateryna Zarembo, an associate fellow at the Kyiv-based New Europe Center.
Today, any Ukrainian with a social media account comes across daily calls to help buy a pickup, walkie-talkies of some other necessity for a brigade fighting on the frontline. Unit commanders sometimes reach out directly to their followers, urging them to help them buy new attack drones.
"You scroll your news feed and you see your friends collecting money and you think, 'OK, I'll donate. OK, I'll donate a second time. Well, I can donate a third time as well,"' said Illia Pavlovych, a 28-year-old designer.
Simply tapping into Ukrainian spirit and patriotism -- and anger at President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia -- worked at the beginning of the war because of the wave of solidarity that swept over the country. But as the fighting continued, fatigue set in and people's ability to donate has decreased.
"I was trying to raise money using the classical methods," said Valeriy Tkalich, a product manager who recently organized a crowdfunding effort to buy a jeep for the army. "And it was giving me smaller and smaller results."
Trying to circumvent the issue, fund-raisers got creative: a famous Ukrainian performer adapted the song "Just the Two of Us," changing the chorus to "Just Drop the Donation." A former Kyiv City Council member opened a raffle, with his Porsche as the top prize.
But perhaps no initiative has been as successful as the one that creates a ladder of giving by friends and acquaintances.
Ms. Chervona, who leads fund-raising efforts while pursuing jobs as a retoucher, said she and some friends decided to try the system while looking for a way to expand the donor base, so that they could continue to raise large sums through smaller donations.
Last July, she published a post on Instagram saying she was looking to assemble a team of 100 people, each tasked with raising about $ 1,300 among their friends to buy drones for the 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov, a unit that is part of the Ukrainian National Guard and has a nationalist heritage -- aiming for a total of $ 130,000.
Team members were called "Azov's rear people," their photos were published on social media, and they were promised a token resembling a military plate upon completion of the crowdfunding.
Within a month, the operation far exceeded its target, raising a total of $ 860,000, Ms. Chervona said.
"So effective," Mr. Tkalich, who participated in Ms. Chervona's crowdfunding, said of the method. "I wondered why we hadn't done it sooner."
Mr. Tkalich said the process mimicked the marketing techniques he uses in his job in the gaming industry: the "virality" that pushes participants to enroll others; the "social approval" that people seek when buying popular products; the desire to emulate your friends.
Soon, multiple crowdfunding campaigns applying the same techniques appeared in Ukraine. Data from Monobank shows that individual donations more than doubled between July and December 2023.
By highlighting participants on social media, the crowdfunding operations have played on a growing sentiment in Ukraine: the desire to be recognized as active actors in the war effort, amid calls for civil society to become more involved.
"Donating is a social etiquette now," Ms. Zarembo said. "It's about highlighting one's reputation."
Ms. Chervona has created stickers with pictures of the participants, highlighting them as contributors, along with a QR code that can be scanned to make a donation. On a recent afternoon, several stickers could be found in a trendy neighborhood of central Kyiv, plastered in cafes. Participants sometimes post photos of their stickers on social media.
She said that many Ukrainians now wonder, "After two years of war, am I still a volunteer?"
Mr. Tkalich, who has launched dozens of crowdfunding campaigns since the war began, said the donations "act as small life buoys" to cope with the guilt of not fighting in the army.
"Although I don't participate in direct combat, I engage in these other meaningful actions," he said in a recent interview, wearing around his neck the token he had received from Ms. Chervona. "You're either fighting in the war, or you're helping end the war."

Full text: "I have to go get a photo of Adam!"
A young woman in dark glasses, a tan trench coat and a lavender bucket hat darts into the street and runs after the white Porsche convertible in which Representative Adam Schiff and his wife are slowly being driven through Chinatown as part of the Lunar New Year's parade in Los Angeles. Planting herself several feet in front of the car, the woman snaps some pics and then calls out to the passing House member, "Thank you for all that you do!"
As she heads back toward her friends, I try to stop her, asking why she is a fan of Mr. Schiff, who is running for the Senate to succeed Dianne Feinstein, who died in office last September at age 90. The woman keeps moving but gushes, with a hint of perplexity suggesting I'm an idiot for having to ask: "Everybody loves him! My mother-in-law in Madison, Wisconsin, loves him! He's done so much!"
And with that, she melts back into the crowd, not bothering to elaborate on what it is that Mr. Schiff has done. Not that she needs to. Around his home state -- and beyond -- the 12-term Democrat has achieved bona fide celebrity status thanks to his emergence as a prime antagonist of Donald Trump.
As the House member who spearheaded Mr. Trump's first impeachment, who played a key role in the Jan. 6 select committee and who has served as a top Trump critic on cable news, Mr. Schiff has been vilified across the MAGAverse. He has earned no fewer than three puerile nicknames from the former president: Pencil Neck, Liddle' Adam Schiff and, my favorite, Shifty Schiff. More seriously, House Republicans booted him from the intelligence committee early last year and later censured him for his role in the Russia investigation, claiming he advanced politically motivated lies about Mr. Trump that endangered national security. All this, in turn, has made Mr. Schiff a hero to the anti-Trump masses.
At multiple points along the parade route, in fact, people yell their gratitude and encouragement. "Keep it up!" urges Chris (first name only!), a tour guide visiting from Tampa, raising a fist in salute.
When I ask what people like about Mr. Schiff, they overwhelmingly cite his fighting spirit. "He's a trench warrior," says Steven Alexander, a local, longtime fan. "Adam Schiff stands up when too many stand down," he adds. Multiple supporters express particular admiration that the congressman has been "willing to put his face out there" in battling Mr. Trump, despite the personal and professional fallout.
His reputation as a leader of the resistance may have cost Mr. Schiff a committee seat in the House. But it has given his Senate candidacy a major boost, propelling him to a solid lead over the rest of the pack. This notably includes his Democratic House colleagues Katie Porter and Barbara Lee, both of whom, in various ways, would seem more representative of California's Democratic electorate. (We'll get to that a bit later.)
Mr. Schiff is, after all, a 63-year-old straight white man who, for much of his House career, identified as a centrist. In ordinary times, he probably would be dismissed as too conservative, too establishment, too vanilla to rep California in all its unconventional glory in the Senate. (The last time the state elected a white guy to the chamber was 1988.)
But these are Trump times, meaning ordinary is out the window. And a different form of progressivism -- the fierce, fundamental defense of democracy against Trumpism -- has for, many voters, overshadowed the traditional policy-based definition, along with concerns about identity politics or ideological purity. And in this category, it is hard to outshine Mr. Schiff.
"I think the term progressive, particularly this cycle, means more about protecting what we have fought so hard for," said Betty Yee, the vice chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. People are thinking hard about "who they want in Washington fighting to keep our values intact," she said. And while she sees all the Democratic candidates as fighters, Ms. Yee acknowledged that democracy protection was central to Mr. Schiff's brand.
Thanks to his entanglement with the MAGA King, Mr. Schiff has serious political juice, along with the widespread name recognition that is invaluable in a sprawling state that is both exhausting and expensive to run in.
By whatever measure you choose -- polling, campaign cash, endorsements -- Mr. Schiff is the front-runner heading into Tuesday's "jungle" primary, from which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to the general election. Count it as just one more way in which Mr. Trump has upended the political landscape, shifting voters' moods and priorities even in places and races where Trumpism holds little sway.
Even a few years in, Mr. Schiff finds this whole celebrity thing "surreal" and vaguely ironic: "If you asked people in the House pre-Trump, 'All right, one of these members is going to become this liberal lightning rod. Who do you think it will be, this bane of the right wing?' They probably would not have picked me," he said. "I was not the face of the resistance."
The higher profile, he said, "has come at a cost." The vitriol from MAGA world "takes a lot of different forms" -- calls, texts -- some of which go directly to his wife's phone. "The worst was when someone sent two bullets to my office with the names of my kids on them. That was pretty awful," he said, with an understatement that would be comic if the topic weren't so horrifying.
As the Senate race has ground on, the Republican attacks have heated up. The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently sent out a "STOP SCHIFF" fund-raising plea, proclaiming him "the MASTERMIND of the Trump-Russia hoax." And in a Feb. 13 tantrum on Truth Social, Mr. Trump went extra hard, dubbing him "SLIMEBALL ADAM 'SHIFTY' SCHIFF, one of the true lowlifes in the history of politics in America." With every attack, the congressman's anti-Trump street cred grows.
Mr. Schiff is a more reserved character than you might imagine from his polarizing reputation. The former prosecutor is cautious and deliberate, low-key and even-keeled. "He doesn't rise with the highs or go down with the lows," says Dan Goldman, a Democrat House member from New York who, before winning his seat in 2022, worked for Mr. Schiff as an investigator on the Intelligence Committee. He is less an anti-establishment revolutionary than a work-within-the-system pragmatist -- more Nancy Pelosi than The Squad.
The congressman has a quirky streak. A film buff -- as befitting a lawmaker representing Hollywood -- he once aspired to be a screenwriter and still dabbles in standup. His humor tends to be wry and self-deprecating. As we sat down to breakfast one Sunday in February at a restaurant near his home in Burbank, I mentioned that I'd been quizzing voters about his appeal.
"They all told you it was my Ryan Gosling good looks, undoubtedly," he fired back. Mr. Schiff is reputed to have a rich repertoire of dad jokes -- though he stubbornly refused to tell me one -- and is prone to quoting the 1998 cult comedy, "The Big Lebowski," which he often cites as his favorite movie.
For most of his tenure in the House, Mr. Schiff was known as a thoughtful, not especially partisan workhorse. He spent his time on foreign policy and national security issues. He was, in short, a not-so-charismatic lawmaker whom most Americans -- including many in his own district -- would have had trouble picking out of a lineup.
His ideology wasn't especially electrifying either. Elected in 2000 in what was then a Republican district, he rolled into Congress as a solid centrist. Until 2013, he was a member of the moderate Blue Dog Democrats, and he remains a member of the moderate New Democrat Coalition. His voting record is more pro-military and pro-law enforcement than some progressives are comfortable with, and The American Prospect magazine did a deep dive last year into the less-progressive aspects of his early votes on economic policy.
For more than a decade now, Mr. Schiff has been easing leftward. He supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and his ties to organized labor have grown stronger. In this race, he has been endorsed by unions ranging from the Actors' Equity Association to the Teamsters to the United Farm Workers. At this point, there is little daylight between his voting record and those of his main Democratic competitors, Ms. Porter and Ms. Lee, both of whom are more identified with the party's progressive wing.
This shift has drawn charges of opportunism and inconstancy from some on the left, and Mr. Schiff abandoned an effort last year to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus after his application caused turmoil among the members. As Mr. Schiff frames things, he has simply learned and evolved with the times.
"I think the challenges facing the country have changed, the challenges facing California have changed," he said, and by extension, his views on what policies are needed have changed. He added, "And I think that's true of the whole party."
There are certainly policy danger zones where Mr. Schiff is out of step with his left wing. Notably, he has upset some progressives with his refusal to call for a cease-fire in the war in Gaza, a problem he shares with President Biden. The tension bubbled into view during the Lunar New Year parade as the congressman was periodically met with scattered boos and chants of "cease-fire now!"
This intraparty rift has not yet risen to a level among California Democrats where it is seen to be roiling the Senate race. But Mr. Schiff later voiced concern to me that it could ultimately prompt some younger people to sit out the election. This could prove devastating in other races, including the presidential.
Trying to convey the high stakes of this election writ large without freaking out voters to the point they tune it out is a constant balancing act, says Mr. Schiff, adding that he tries to end all his events on a note of reassurance and hope. "I talk about what a resilient country we are" and that "this too shall pass," he said. "Because the gravity of all this is just so heavy that it would be easy to lapse into despair. And we don't have the luxury of despair."
California political watchers pretty much all agree that Mr. Trump's return to the ballot is making voters twitchy.
"The backdrop to this race is the fight for democracy," said former Senator Barbara Boxer, who has endorsed Mr. Schiff -- as have former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the bulk of the California congressional delegation. "It is about the fact that a lot of people in California, may I say, are very worried about Trump and his dictatorial ways. And so Adam comes to the top" as "the go-to person to take on Trump."As you might imagine, the Senate race's other Democrats disagree with this take. Strongly. And it is clear that they cannot quite believe they are losing to this guy.
"I'm the candidate who has shown that she knows how to win and motivate voters in the very kinds of districts that are going to become very important if we have Trump on the ballot or, God forbid, a Trump presidency," Ms. Porter said in a phone interview. This is about more than just a Senate seat, she told me. "If we have a race primarily focused on Adam Schiff and more of the same, we're not going to engage the voters we need to have the turnout we need to win seats in California" up and down the ballot.
In many ways, Ms. Porter does seem the more intuitive fit with today's Democratic electorate -- especially with California's diverse swirl of coalition politics. She is: 1. A single mom, 2. More than a decade younger than Mr. Schiff and 3. Brimming with the kind of economically populist, outsider energy that resonates with the party's activist base. She and her trademark whiteboard, which she employs to devastating effect in grilling the corporate bosses who come before her in Congress, have become the scourge of big business and a darling of social media. She is a prolific fund-raiser and plays particularly well among younger voters, who like her promise to shake things up.
Bringing her no-more-politics-as-usual intensity to this race, Ms. Porter has slammed Mr. Schiff as the complacent, compromised creature of a broken system. She has gone after him for taking corporate PAC money in previous campaigns and accused him of fighting for his big donors rather than regular Californians.
During the final debate of the primary, she went after Mr. Schiff hard, accusing him of being too cozy with big corporations and taking "dirty money." He, in turn, dinged her for imposing rigid "purity tests," slyly noting that he had donated some of the money in question to her campaign. "And the only response I got," he quipped, as the audience chuckled, "was, 'Thank you, thank, thank you."' Then he pivoted: "Look, at the end of the day, it's about what have you gotten done. I didn't hear anything from Representative Porter about anything she has actually accomplished."
A House newcomer by comparison with her Democratic opponents, Ms. Porter, elected in 2018, is quick to point out all the big things that Congress has failed to accomplish during their tenures, from reforming immigration to lowering child care costs to banning stock trading by lawmakers. She tells me that people are hungry for change and that she is the contender with a proven record of "being willing to push our party to live up to its values." Her frustration that this message has not gotten more traction is clear.
But, here again, Ms. Porter's efforts to paint Mr. Schiff as a do-nothing establishment tool are muddled by the one big thing that a big chunk of America knows he has done and continues to do: take the fight to the MAGA king. Polls consistently show her stuck several points behind him and, more recently, fighting for second place with the Republican candidate Steve Garvey, a former baseball star.
The even more poignant figure in this contest may be Barbara Lee, a progressive icon who has represented the Oakland area since 1998. Ms. Lee has the most formidable progressive record of anyone in the field, including being the lone House member to vote against the war in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. On the Senate campaign trail, she has stressed her longstanding skepticism of the military, and she has come out in support of a cease-fire in Gaza. She has also claimed the mantle of anti-Trump fighter, reminding voters that she is a plaintiff in a civil suit seeking damages from the former president and others in relation for the Jan. 6 attack.
More personally, Ms. Lee is the only major candidate of color in the field, and her campaign has been pushing the value of her lived experience and "the unique intersectional lens" she brings to her work.
"The perspective, the lens, the representation, the experience of a Black woman from California is badly needed," she said in a recent interview with the local NBC News affiliate, "because not only do Black women fight for our communities, and for the marginalized and vulnerable people, lifting people out of poverty, for children, for criminal justice reform. We fight for everybody, to lift everybody up."
In her appearance at a Univision candidate forum last month, Ms. Lee said that "diversity matters," that "representation matters." Afterward, I asked her why those issues don't seem to be of much concern to voters in this race. She simply tightened her smile and brightly insisted that, in fact, she was hearing a lot from voters about those precise topics. Maybe. But with Mr. Trump on the ballot, the electorate appears to have other priorities. Polls show Ms. Lee languishing in the single digits, well behind Mr. Schiff, Ms. Porter and Mr. Garvey.
For his part, Mr. Schiff is sticking with a safe, restrained campaign. During his portion of the Univision event, he spoke in smooth, soothing tones about his plan to tackle whatever issue the moderators raised, whether homelessness, crime, inflation, taxes, jobs, student debt or immigration. He pointed to the many millions of federal dollars he has secured for California and promised to bring home billions more from the Senate.
Let's be clear. Mr. Schiff is not a shoo-in, especially if Ms. Porter makes it to the general election. Without Ms. Lee splitting the progressive vote, a Schiff-on-Porter cage match promises to be bloody and expensive, draining resources from races both inside and outside the state on which control of the House and the Senate could turn. (The Golden State, it bears noting, functions as a golden goose for the entire Democratic Party.)
Clearly, Mr. Schiff would rather face Mr. Garvey in the general election. No one seriously thinks a Republican, even a former sports star, has a shot at winning. And Mr. Garvey has thus far proved to be a not-so-dazzling candidate. For weeks, Team Schiff has been running ads denouncing him as " too conservative for California." That is widely seen as a cynical, if not uncommon, bit of campaign jujitsu in which a candidate tries to raise the profile of the primary opponent he thinks will be the easiest to beat in a general election.
Mr. Schiff has insisted he is simply drawing attention to the threat Mr. Garvey poses. But his Democratic opponents aren't buying it. "What is discouraging, what is wrong, I think morally, what is inconsistent with the rhetoric of Representative Schiff about democracy and being a hero for democracy, is to lift up a Republican in order to eliminate a Democrat," Ms. Porter tells me. "That's not consistent with what California is as a state, and I think that has been frustrating and should be of concern to California voters. Like, do we want to send someone to Washington who is so willing to win at all costs?"
It's a rhetorical question. But, with the specter of a vengeful MAGA king looming over the state, the matter of what Californians want most from their elected champions is far more complicated than it once was.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Internal disagreements over the direction of the Apple car led the effort to sputter for years before it was canceled this week.
For the last decade, many Apple employees working on the company's secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google's Waymo.
By the time of its death -- Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence -- Apple had burned more than $ 10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla's, according to a half dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project's demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
"When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on," said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. "A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain."
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn't want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project's origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $ 2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $ 200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple's chief executive, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $ 100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.
Apple, which by then had $ 155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company's culture.
The car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed racecars for Porsche.
The group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.
To bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Mr. Ive and the head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several start-ups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.
Mr. Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.
One day, in the fall of 2015, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook met at the project's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for a demonstration of how the car might work. The two men sank into the seats of a cabinlike interior. Outside, a voice actor read from a script of what Siri would say as the men zoomed down the road in the imaginary car. Mr. Ive asked Siri what restaurant they passed and the actor read an answer, said two people familiar with the demonstration.
But by 2016, it was clear that the car effort was in trouble. Mr. Zadesky left Apple, and his successor, Mr. Mansfield, told the team working on the project that they would be shifting their focus from building a car to building self-driving car software, said three people familiar with the shift.
Apple secured permits from California to begin test-driving Lexus sport utility vehicles outfitted with sensors and computers. It held discussions with car makers such as BMW, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz before striking a deal with Volkswagen to provide Transporter vans for self-driving shuttles on Apple's campus.
Two more leaders took over the car effort in the years that followed. Doug Field, a former Tesla executive, laid off more than 200 employees on the project as he leaned into efforts to build its self-driving system. Then Mr. Lynch, who succeeded him in recent years, reversed the company's plans and went back to its original idea of making an electric vehicle.
Mr. Mansfield and Mr. Field didn't respond to requests for comment.
At the start of this year, Apple's leadership decided that it was a better use of the company's time to work on generative A.I. rather than the car, the company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday. The company said some members of the Project Titan team would be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence.
In interviews on Wednesday with The New York Times, people who worked on the project praised the decision to shutter it, saying the technology behind generative A.I. could be invaluable to the future of the company's all-important iPhone business.
Apple's dead car project will be survived by its underlying technologies. The company plans to take what it has learned about artificial intelligence and automation and apply it to other technologies that are being researched, including A.I.-powered AirPods with cameras, robot assistants and augmented reality, according to three people briefed on the projects.
Though the engineers working on automation software will get to work on artificial intelligence projects, others on the car team have been told they will need to apply for different roles at the company.

VW Pushing E.V.s to Lift Sales in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It and other foreign automakers are trying to exploit upheaval caused by new technology to gain market share from their dominant rivals.
Probably only Americans of a certain age remember when the Volkswagen Beetle was the best-selling imported car in the United States and the hippest ride to a Grateful Dead concert was a Volkswagen Microbus.
Volkswagen is trying to tap some of that nostalgia in its latest push to regain the status and sales it enjoyed in the United States during the Beetle's and Microbus's heydays in the 1960s. But this time it hopes its top models will be electric.
The German carmaker is second only to Toyota globally but is a niche player in the United States. Part of its plan to revive its fortunes here is to lean on a new electric model that resembles the Microbus, the ID.Buzz, and to revive the Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles.
Last week, as giant earth movers kicked up clouds of dust, Volkswagen executives and local officials gathered near Columbia, S.C., to inaugurate the site of a factory that will build vehicles bearing the Scout badge for the first time since 1980.
Volkswagen is one of several foreign automakers that see electric cars and the upheaval they are causing as a way to challenge the dominant players in the United States. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini, is aiming to at least double its market share in the United States by the end of the decade from a meager 4 percent now.
"This market is turning electric, and everybody's starting from scratch," Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, said in an interview. "This is our unique opportunity to grow."
Electric vehicles have already shaken the industry rankings, emboldening Volkswagen and other foreign automakers. Battery-powered S.U.V.s and sedans helped Hyundai Motor and its sister brand Kia overtake Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, as the fourth-largest carmaker by sales in the United States last year.
"Electric vehicles are helping our brand to be seen as a technology leader," said José Muñoz, chief operating officer of Hyundai. They also attract a better-educated, more affluent customer than has been the case for the South Korean company's gasoline vehicles, he said in an interview.
The list of companies that dominate electric car sales looks a lot different from the top rankings for overall U.S. sales, hinting at a future when a different group of companies rule.
The top five companies in the United States for all engine types are General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Stellantis. In electric cars, Tesla is No. 1 by a wide margin, followed by Hyundai, G.M., Ford and Volkswagen. Toyota is a minor player in electric cars.
"Just because you've been around for 120 years doesn't mean you're going to have anything in this new market," said Steven Center, the chief operating officer of Kia America.
Volvo Cars is another company hoping to take advantage of the changes wrought by electric vehicles. The Swedish carmaker, which is majority owned by Geely Holding Group of China, reported a 26 percent increase in U.S. sales last year.
Much of that growth came from hybrids that have a gasoline engine and can travel shorter distances on batteries. But Mike Cottone, president of Volvo Car for the United States and Canada, said he saw hybrids as a pathway to fully electric vehicles.
Later this year, Volvo will begin selling a Chinese-made, all-electric compact S.U.V., the EX30, which will start at $ 35,000. The company will also begin delivering the EX90, a seven-seat S.U.V. that is made in South Carolina and will start around $ 80,000.
Especially for luxury car buyers, Mr. Cottone said, "there's a lot of room for growth in the E.V. segment over the next few years."
Volkswagen has tried and failed since the 1970s to become a bigger presence in the United States, and analysts are skeptical that this time will be different. "I've seen Volkswagen set these goals before," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.
The established carmakers will not be pushovers. G.M. and Ford are also investing heavily in electric vehicles, while Toyota has said it will start producing a large electric S.U.V. in Kentucky next year.
Ms. Krebs pointed out that auto sales in the U.S. were growing slowly, making the fight for market share largely a zero-sum game. "There's this little bit of growth that everybody is going after," she said.
Volkswagen's last big push in the United States ended in scandal. In the early 2000s, the company tried to sell Americans on cars with "clean diesel" engines. It advertised the fuel, which was used in European passenger cars much more than in American cars, as more environmentally friendly than gasoline.
But the campaign collapsed in 2015 when U.S. regulators discovered that Volkswagen had used software in the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. In reality, the cars polluted as much as long-haul trucks.
The scandal had one benefit for Volkswagen. It prompted the company to invest early in electric vehicle technology and build cars that were designed from the ground up to run on batteries, rather than make awkward modifications to gasoline models. In Europe, Volkswagen's various electric brands together outsell Tesla, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
The person responsible for doubling Volkswagen sales in the United States is Pablo Di Si, president of Volkswagen Group of America. Mr. Di Si, originally from Argentina, said he planned to use the same strategy he deployed while overseeing the company's operations in Brazil, where Volkswagen's market share rose to more than 16 percent from 9 percent.
"You look at the segments that you think are going to be successful 10 years from now," Mr. Di Si said in an interview. "What are your gaps in the product portfolio? And then you start adding products for those particular markets."
In the United States, he said, that is likely to include gasoline cars and hybrids as well as all-electric vehicles. Volkswagen plans to import the ID.7, an electric sedan, and the ID.Buzz. Mr. Di Si hinted that there might also be a new electric vehicle that references the design of the Beetle. The last version of that car sold in the United States was the 2019 Beetle.
Volkswagen is building a $ 5 billion factory in Ontario to supply batteries to its factories in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Puebla, Mexico, which together will produce at least 80 percent of the company's cars sold in North America. That will help buyers of cars from its Volkswagen, Audi and other brands qualify for federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 per car.
Scout will fill a major gap in Volkswagen's portfolio: pickups, among the most popular vehicles in the United States. By reviving Scout, which was one of the first passenger vehicles that could navigate rough dirt tracks as well as city streets, Volkswagen hopes to attract buyers who typically buy off-road-capable vehicles from U.S. brands like Chevrolet, Ford and Jeep.
The South Carolina factory will underscore the made-in-America vibe when the first Scouts go on sale in late 2026. Volkswagen inherited the Scout brand when the company's truck subsidiary, Traton, acquired Navistar, a U.S. company previously known as International Harvester, in 2021.
The new Scouts may borrow some parts used in other Volkswagen vehicles, company executives said, but the design will be distinct from existing vehicles like the electric ID.4 S.U.V. made in Chattanooga. Scout plans to reveal prototypes this year.
A stronger presence in the United States is "a strategic necessity," Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Volkswagen's Scout Motors division, said in South Carolina last week.
Outside the United States, Volkswagen is a behemoth, with a 26 percent share of the European market and 15 percent in China. But the company is under severe pressure in China, where sales of electric vehicles have been growing fast, allowing BYD and other Chinese carmakers to gain market share from foreign automakers. Volkswagen needs growth in the United States to compensate.
Volkswagen "wants to have a strong global footprint," Mr. Keogh said, "not have an isolated footprint, where it's only sitting strong in one region."

Volkswagen Leans on Electric Vehicles and Nostalgia to Grow in U.S.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Probably only Americans of a certain age remember when the Volkswagen Beetle was the bestselling imported car in the United States and the hippest ride to a Grateful Dead concert was a Volkswagen Microbus.
Volkswagen is trying to tap some of that nostalgia in its latest push to regain the status and sales it enjoyed in the United States during the Beetle’s and Microbus’ heydays in the 1960s. But this time it hopes its top models will be electric.
The German carmaker is second only to Toyota globally but is a niche player in the U.S. Part of its plan to revive its fortunes here is to lean on a new electric model that resembles the Microbus, the ID.Buzz, and to revive the Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles.
This month, as giant earth movers kicked up clouds of dust, Volkswagen executives and local officials gathered near Columbia, South Carolina, to inaugurate the site of a factory that will build vehicles bearing the Scout badge for the first time since 1980.
Volkswagen is one of several foreign automakers that see electric cars and the upheaval they are causing as a way to challenge the dominant players in the U.S. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini, is aiming to at least double its market share in the U.S. by the end of the decade from a meager 4% now.
“This market is turning electric, and everybody’s starting from scratch,” Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer of Volkswagen, said in an interview. “This is our unique opportunity to grow.”
Electric vehicles have already shaken the industry rankings, emboldening Volkswagen and other foreign automakers. Battery-powered SUVs and sedans helped Hyundai Motor Co. and its sister brand Kia overtake Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, as the fourth-largest carmaker by sales in the U.S. last year.
“Electric vehicles are helping our brand to be seen as a technology leader,” said José Muñoz, chief operating officer of Hyundai. They also attract a better-educated, more affluent customer than has been the case for the South Korean company’s gasoline vehicles, he said in an interview.
The list of companies that dominate electric car sales looks a lot different from the top rankings for overall U.S. sales, hinting at a future when a different group of companies rule.
The top five companies in the U.S. for all engine types are General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor Co., Hyundai and Stellantis. In electric cars, Tesla is No. 1 by a wide margin, followed by Hyundai, GM, Ford and Volkswagen. Toyota is a minor player in electric cars.
“Just because you’ve been around for 120 years doesn’t mean you’re going to have anything in this new market,” said Steven Center, chief operating officer of Kia America.
Volvo Cars is another company hoping to take advantage of the changes wrought by electric vehicles. The Swedish carmaker, which is majority owned by Geely Holding Group of China, reported a 26% increase in U.S. sales last year.
Much of that growth came from hybrids that have a gasoline engine and can travel shorter distances on batteries. But Mike Cottone, president of Volvo Cars for the U.S. and Canada, said he saw hybrids as a pathway to fully electric vehicles.
Later this year, Volvo will begin selling a Chinese-made, all-electric compact SUV, the EX30, which will start at $35,000. The company will also begin delivering the EX90, a seven-seat SUV that is made in South Carolina and will start around $80,000.
Especially for luxury car buyers, Cottone said, “there’s a lot of room for growth in the EV segment over the next few years.”
Volkswagen has tried and failed since the 1970s to become a bigger presence in the U.S., and analysts are skeptical that this time will be different. “I’ve seen Volkswagen set these goals before,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.
The established carmakers will not be pushovers. GM and Ford are also investing heavily in electric vehicles, while Toyota has said it will start producing a large electric SUV in Kentucky next year.
Krebs pointed out that auto sales in the U.S. were growing slowly, making the fight for market share largely a zero-sum game. “There’s this little bit of growth that everybody is going after,” she said.
Volkswagen’s last big push in the U.S. ended in scandal. In the early 2000s, the company tried to sell Americans on cars with “clean diesel” engines. It advertised the fuel, which was used in European passenger cars much more than in American cars, as more environmentally friendly than gasoline.
But the campaign collapsed in 2015 when U.S. regulators discovered that Volkswagen had used software in the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. In reality, the cars polluted as much as long-haul trucks.
The scandal had one benefit for Volkswagen. It prompted the company to invest early in electric vehicle technology and build cars that were designed from the ground up to run on batteries, rather than make awkward modifications to gasoline models. In Europe, Volkswagen’s various electric brands together outsell Tesla, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
The person responsible for doubling Volkswagen sales in the United States is Pablo Di Si, president of Volkswagen Group of America. Di Si, originally from Argentina, said he planned to use the same strategy he deployed while overseeing the company’s operations in Brazil, where Volkswagen’s market share rose to more than 16% from 9%.
“You look at the segments that you think are going to be successful 10 years from now,” Di Si said in an interview. “What are your gaps in the product portfolio? And then you start adding products for those particular markets.”

Di Si hinted that there might also be a new electric vehicle that references the design of the Beetle. The last version of that car sold in the United States was the 2019 Beetle.

Hollywood Lawyer's Largess Toward Biden's Son Draws Ire: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Hollywood lawyer's support of the president's son is under scrutiny from House Republicans while his aggressive tactics are rankling the White House.
He found a house for Hunter Biden's new family, paid divorce costs to Mr. Biden's ex-wife and helped resolve a paternity lawsuit from a third woman. He footed the bill for Mr. Biden's security, back taxes and car payments, facilitated the publication of a memoir and the launch of an art career, and provided emotional support as Mr. Biden dealt with scrutiny from prosecutors and political adversaries.
In recent years, no one has been more influential in helping Hunter Biden rebuild his life after a devastating battle with addiction than the Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris.
But Mr. Morris's role has now become a flashpoint of its own.
His influence in shaping an aggressive legal and public relations defense for the president's son against criminal indictments and Republican attacks has rankled President Biden's advisers inside and outside the White House.
While they see the relationship as helping the president's son avoid relapse, they also grumble that Mr. Morris's generous financial backing, confrontational counsel and conspiracy theorizing has only drawn attention to Hunter and the impeachment push against his father by allies of former President Donald J. Trump.
"I'm not very popular at the White House," Mr. Morris said in congressional testimony last month.
Although Mr. Morris says he has never had more than a few brief interactions with President Biden, his involvement has stoked investigations by House Republicans. They have been asking whether Mr. Morris is using the relationship with Hunter to further his own interests or provide backdoor financial help to the Biden 2024 re-election campaign.
The story of Mr. Morris's support for the president's son, as laid out in new detail in interviews, documents and congressional testimony, is a tangle of good intentions, deep pockets, family tragedy and legal and ethical issues. It comes amid scrutiny of payments that Hunter Biden received from previous wealthy patrons who could have benefited from access to his father or just the perception of it.
Mr. Morris has undoubtedly helped stabilize Hunter Biden's life. But the defiant legal and public relations defense he shaped has so far failed to resolve Mr. Biden's problems, and in some ways has called more attention to them.
As his father battles for re-election, Hunter Biden faces federal tax and gun charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, a congressional deposition later this month, mounting debt and the prospect of continuing to be a punching bag until at least Election Day.
Mr. Morris, who earned a fortune representing screenwriters and actors, has been visited by federal agents, received a grand jury subpoena, been referenced in the indictment of Mr. Biden and testified for hours before congressional committees. He has also been the subject of a bar complaint, death threats, cyberstalking and paparazzi photos of him smoking a bong on his balcony.
He has in some ways courted the spectacle. A documentary film crew from a production company he owns with five partners has trailed him and Mr. Biden in public, including recent surprise appearances at the Capitol, lending a reality television aura to the scenes.
Mr. Morris has spent more than $ 6.5 million to help Hunter Biden, money that both men now consider loans, including $ 1.2 million that was added to the tab just weeks ago, according to a letter from Mr. Morris's lawyer. He has paid for the documentary filming and has agreed to pay nearly $ 900,000 for Mr. Biden's art in an arrangement that appears to flout ethics policies endorsed by the White House.
Mr. Morris has not been accused of wrongdoing by the authorities, or of seeking favor from the Biden family. Nor has President Biden been accused of taking any action to benefit Mr. Morris.
Still, the question of what's in it for Mr. Morris has only loomed larger as the attention on him has intensified.
But there also appears to be a genuine human element to the relationship, with the two men professing a deep fraternal affection.
Mr. Morris filled some small part of a vacuum created by the death of Mr. Biden's beloved brother, Beau, in 2015; his divorce; and the fraying of personal relationships during his drug-fueled descent. And he has been a loyal confidant in a period in which Hunter's foreign business entanglements and behavior during his addiction have been examined by prosecutors and exploited by Republicans.
'Hunter, Kevin'
It started with a fleeting encounter at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles for Joe Biden's presidential campaign in the fall of 2019.
Mr. Morris -- who had made his only donation on record to the Biden campaign around the time of the fund-raiser -- was heading for the exit when he bumped into Hunter Biden.
The host, a film and music video producer named Lanette Phillips, made the briefest of introductions -- "Hunter, Kevin" -- Mr. Morris recalled in congressional testimony. Ms. Phillips followed up days later, arranging a meeting for Mr. Morris at Hunter Biden's rental home overlooking the San Fernando Valley, ostensibly to view his art and to discuss some entertainment-related issues.
"We hit it off right away," Mr. Morris, now 60, testified of Mr. Biden, 54.
While Mr. Morris's family once relied on food stamps while he was growing up, he saw parallels between his life and that of the privileged son of a powerful politician.
Mr. Morris and Hunter Biden were both lawyers, art lovers and recovering addicts who grew up in large Irish Catholic families in the Philadelphia suburbs. They cheered for the Phillies and harbored nostalgia for hometown delicacies like Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets and cheesesteaks.
Their meeting stretched to four or five hours as Mr. Biden described the toll of years of drug and alcohol abuse. Newly sober, he was trying to pull his life together to provide for his new wife and the baby they were expecting.
But he was facing serious financial, political and potentially criminal repercussions from his years of reckless living, lavish spending and big paydays from foreign interests accused of corruption.
As Mr. Biden detailed his problems, Mr. Morris filled a yellow legal pad with plans for how to fix them.
"That was a very profound meeting, and it was, you know, one of the most important meetings of my life," Mr. Morris later testified. "I basically found him like a guy getting the crap beat out of him by a gang of people. And, you know, where we come from, you don't let that happen. You get in and you start swinging."
'A client that needed 24/7'
He quickly signed a retainer to serve as a lawyer for Mr. Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen.
Mr. Morris had represented celebrities with complex legal, financial and public relations needs, including the actors Matthew McConaughey and Minnie Driver, and the "South Park" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. And he had experience helping people struggling with personal problems, including addiction.
He began talking to Mr. Biden almost daily.
"It was, you know, a client that needed 24/7," Mr. Morris testified.
"People were coming up to his door with cameras, saying, 'We just want to talk to him.' People were yelling from outside of the bushes, 'Hunter Biden, come out. Hunter Biden, come out,"' he added.
Mr. Morris, who during his congressional testimony suggested that he had assets of more than $ 100 million, helped Mr. Biden and Ms. Cohen move into a house on a canal in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, closer to Mr. Morris's home in Pacific Palisades with expansive views of the ocean.
Mr. Morris paid the $ 17,500 monthly rent for nearly a year, and began footing the bill for security. He paid off $ 11,000 in past-due payments on a Porsche that Mr. Biden wanted to return. He flew Mr. Biden on his private jet to attend to various obligations around the country.
He helped renegotiate Mr. Biden's contract to push back the release of his memoir, and he bought two pieces of Mr. Biden's art for $ 40,000.
He acquired Mr. Biden's stake in a Chinese private equity fund that had proved politically toxic but difficult to unload, assuming the $ 157,000 in debt that Mr. Biden had incurred to purchase it.
Within weeks of meeting Hunter Biden, Mr. Morris convened a crisis meeting in what he called "a war room" in his home.
About 10 people who had varying roles in Mr. Biden's nascent resurrection gathered with Mr. Biden and Ms. Cohen around a long table in an open living room with views of a lush backyard and swimming pool.
Mr. Morris delivered a pep talk and began offering the broad contours of plans to restore Mr. Biden's finances and counter his critics.
'I want the money back'
Days later, a court filing indicated that Mr. Biden had agreed to pay child support to an Arkansas woman with whom he had a daughter. Mr. Morris fronted the cash.
Shortly after that, Mr. Morris emailed a tax accountant and others who were at the crisis meeting about finishing Mr. Biden's overdue tax returns.
"We are under considerable risk personally and politically to get the returns in," Mr. Morris wrote. He was concerned Republicans might seize on the tax issues if they succeeded in calling Hunter Biden to testify in Mr. Trump's first impeachment, which was unfolding at the time, Mr. Morris later explained during his congressional testimony.
Mr. Morris paid millions of dollars to settle Mr. Biden's tax bill.
It wasn't until October 2021 -- nearly two years after Mr. Morris started footing bills for Mr. Biden -- that they formalized an agreement under which the money would be treated as a loan. While unsecured, the loan agreement includes a 5 percent interest rate and calls for Mr. Biden to start making payments in October 2025.
It was the first of five similar loan agreements between Mr. Morris and Mr. Biden.
"Hunter wouldn't accept it as a gift, and I want the money back," Mr. Morris told the congressional committees, though he conceded he could forgive the debt or find ways to reduce it, including by deducting the cost of purchases of Mr. Biden's art.
Helping Mr. Biden began consuming more of Mr. Morris's time and money. He left the law firm he had started, partly to focus on Mr. Biden and partly to build a documentary production company he had co-founded. The endeavors would quickly intertwine. For Mr. Morris, who had separated from his wife in 2018, life came to revolve around Mr. Biden.
In an interview, Mr. Morris said that others "were afraid to help Hunter not just because of what he was accused of, but because of fear of political violence, the threat of physical retaliation against them and their families."
That, he said, "only intensified my commitment to him," adding "that fear cannot be accepted in any way if America is going to stay America."
Mr. Morris's patronage seemed in one instance to defy ethics guidelines created partly by Mr. Biden's initial criminal defense lawyer, Christopher J. Clark, with input from the White House. The guidelines were intended to shield the identities of buyers of Mr. Biden's art to avoid the perception that their purchases could curry favor with the Biden administration.
Mr. Morris ignored the guidelines, agreeing to buy 11 additional pieces of Mr. Biden's art for a total of $ 875,000 through a New York gallerist who was showing the collection, Georges Bergès. Hunter Biden was aware of the purchase.
The White House declined to comment on the relationship or the art purchases.
Mr. Morris, who had previously purchased two other pieces, became the largest buyer of Mr. Biden's art, Mr. Bergès testified to the House committees.
Mr. Morris told the committees that he bought the pieces because "the art is, in my view as an art collector, very good. I probably have over 200 pieces of art over the years. I take art collecting seriously."
Valuable footage
Mr. Morris has published three books of literary fiction that received some positive reviews. He produced a critically acclaimed documentary in the late 1990s about contestants vying to win a pickup truck by keeping one hand on it longer than their rivals. His company is working on others, including one about Adam Kinzinger, the former Republican House member from Illinois who became a leading anti-Trump voice.
For about four years, a crew from Mr. Morris's documentary company has been following Mr. Biden almost everywhere. They filmed as he painted and showed his art, conducted an off-the-record interview and held strategy sessions with Mr. Morris and lawyers. They even flew to Serbia to capture behind-the-scenes footage of the production of a movie that presents a fictionalized depiction of a debauched and corrupt Hunter Biden.
Mr. Morris told congressional investigators that he was considering producing a commercial documentary after Mr. Biden's legal problems are resolved.
A person familiar with the project said Mr. Morris was exploring options for self-distribution using a combination of online pay-per-view streaming and a limited theatrical release for which Mr. Biden might do publicity. The documentary team envisions a series of episodes building on the redemption story in Mr. Biden's memoir, and depicting him as the victim of an unprecedented invasion of privacy and a barrage of political attacks.
Mr. Biden would have neither editorial control over the documentary, nor any financial interest in it, the person said. If it does not become a commercial project, the person said, filming expenses could be included among Mr. Biden's legal costs, and added to the growing tab of debts to Mr. Morris in an effort to keep the footage privileged and protect it from subpoena.
Expanding influence
After the 2020 presidential race, the Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden heated up, with subpoenas issued to associates including Mr. Morris, who was compelled to produce documents to a grand jury.
Mr. Morris also became heavily involved in the pushback against embarrassing disclosures about Mr. Biden drawn from data linked to a laptop Mr. Biden was said to have abandoned in a Delaware computer repair shop.
Mr. Morris retained forensic analysts to study the data. He also quietly pushed a complex theory under which the repair shop was a front and the information had been made public through a cast of characters including a psychiatrist who had treated Mr. Biden's addiction using ketamine therapy and the Trump-allied operative Roger J. Stone Jr.
Mr. Morris promoted this theory to reporters and others, initially using a rough hand-drawn timeline, and later professional-looking graphics.
Prosecutors subsequently poured cold water on the theory, stating in a court filing that Mr. Biden left the laptop at a computer store, and that its contents "were largely duplicative" of data they had subpoenaed directly from his Apple iCloud account.
Mr. Morris's unconventional tactics were discouraged by two lawyers recommended to Hunter Biden by his father's personal attorney, Bob Bauer: Mr. Clark, the criminal lawyer, and Joshua A. Levy, who had been retained to respond to congressional investigations. They consulted with Mr. Bauer about Hunter Biden's issues.
President Biden's brother James Biden also questioned Mr. Morris's political acumen and his motivations for helping Hunter, concluding that it may have been because of "ego," according to notes of an interview of James Biden by federal agents and prosecutors. The president's brother reportedly told the agent that Mr. Morris bristled when he felt his advice was being ignored by Hunter Biden's lawyers.
Mr. Morris urged dispensing with the traditional Washington scandal playbook and embracing tactics like those used in celebrity public relations.
"We're not going for a tie; we have to win this," he told others.
Mr. Morris started to gain more control when Mr. Levy parted ways with the team after clashing with him.
To replace him, Mr. Morris facilitated the hiring of the veteran Washington scandal lawyer Abbe Lowell, who is known for bare-knuckle tactics more akin to what Mr. Morris was advocating. Within months, with Mr. Morris fronting the costs, Mr. Lowell had filed suits against the computer repair shop owner, the I.R.S., Rudolph W. Giuliani and others.
After the collapse last summer of a plea deal that would have resolved tax and gun investigations without Hunter Biden serving any prison time, Mr. Clark, who was the last impediment to Mr. Morris's no-holds-barred approach, resigned from the legal team.
Embracing the spectacle
On the December day that Hunter Biden had been subpoenaed to testify to Republican-led House committees, he instead appeared at a surprise news conference outside the Capitol.
Accompanied by Mr. Morris and Mr. Lowell, who helped plan the appearance, Mr. Biden was defiant. He accused Republicans of pursuing "illegitimate investigations of my family" to "dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father, who has devoted his entire life to service."
(Mr. Lowell later agreed to have Hunter Biden appear before the investigating committees on Feb. 28.)
Channeling her perception of the sentiment inside the administration, President Biden's former press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a television appearance a few days after the news conference: "Please, Hunter Biden, we know your dad loves you. Please stop talking in public."
Yet, when Republicans convened hearings last month to vote on contempt of Congress charges against Mr. Biden, he and Mr. Morris crashed the session, surprising, among others, President Biden's advisers.

WASHINGTON — He found a house for Hunter Biden’s new family, paid divorce costs to Biden’s ex-wife and helped resolve a paternity lawsuit from a third woman. He footed the bill for Biden’s security, back taxes and car payments, facilitated the publication of a memoir and the launch of an art career, and provided emotional support as Biden dealt with scrutiny from prosecutors and political adversaries.
In recent years, no one has been more influential in helping Hunter Biden rebuild his life after a battle with addiction than Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris.
But Morris’ role has become a flashpoint of its own.
His influence in shaping an aggressive legal and public relations defense for the president’s son against criminal indictments and Republican attacks has rankled President Joe Biden’s advisers inside and outside the White House.
They grumble that Morris’ financial backing, confrontational counsel and conspiracy theorizing has only drawn attention to Hunter Biden and the impeachment push against his father.
“I’m not very popular at the White House,” Morris said in congressional testimony last month.
Although Morris says he has never had more than a few brief interactions with the president, his involvement has stoked investigations by House Republicans. They have been asking whether Morris is using the relationship to further his own interests or provide backdoor financial help to the Biden 2024 reelection campaign.
The story of Morris’ support for the president’s son comes amid scrutiny of payments that Hunter Biden received from previous wealthy patrons who could have benefited from access to his father or just the perception of it.
As his father battles for reelection, Hunter Biden faces federal tax and gun charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, a congressional deposition this month, mounting debt and the prospect of continuing to be a punching bag until at least Election Day.
Morris, who earned a fortune representing screenwriters and actors, has been visited by federal agents, received a grand jury subpoena, been referenced in the indictment of Biden and testified before congressional committees. He has also been the subject of a bar complaint, death threats, cyberstalking and paparazzi photos.
He has in some ways courted the spectacle. A documentary film crew from a production company he owns with five partners has trailed him and Biden.
Morris has spent more than $6.5 million to help Hunter Biden, money that both men now consider loans. He has paid for the documentary filming and has agreed to pay nearly $900,000 for Biden’s art in an arrangement that appears to flout ethics policies endorsed by the White House.
The White House declined to comment on the relationship or the art purchases.
Morris has not been accused of wrongdoing by authorities or of seeking favor from the Biden family. Nor has the president been accused of taking any action to benefit Morris.
There also appears to be a genuine human element to the relationship, with the two men professing a deep fraternal affection.
It started with an encounter at a fundraiser in Los Angeles for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in the fall of 2019.
Morris — who had made his only donation on record to the Biden campaign around the time of the fundraiser — was heading for the exit when he bumped into Hunter Biden.
The host, a film and music video producer named Lanette Phillips, made a brief introduction, Morris recalled in congressional testimony. Phillips followed up days later, arranging a meeting for Morris at Hunter Biden’s rental home overlooking the San Fernando Valley, ostensibly to view his art and to discuss some entertainment-related issues.
“We hit it off right away,” Morris, now 60, testified of Biden, 54.
Morris saw parallels between their lives.
Morris and Hunter Biden were both lawyers, art lovers and recovering addicts who grew up in large Irish Catholic families in the Philadelphia suburbs.
Their meeting stretched to four or five hours as Biden described the toll of years of drug and alcohol abuse.
He was facing financial, political and potentially criminal repercussions from his years of reckless living, lavish spending and big paydays from foreign interests accused of corruption.
As Biden detailed his problems, Morris filled a yellow legal pad with plans for how to fix them.
“I basically found him like a guy getting the crap beat out of him by a gang of people,” Morris later testified. “And, you know, where we come from, you don’t let that happen. You get in, and you start swinging.”
He quickly signed a retainer to serve as a lawyer for Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen.
Morris, who during his congressional testimony suggested that he had assets of more than $100 million, helped Biden and Cohen move into a house in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.
Morris paid the $17,500 monthly rent for nearly a year and began footing the bill for security. He paid off $11,000 in past-due payments on a Porsche that Biden wanted to return.
He bought two pieces of Biden’s art for $40,000.
He acquired Biden’s stake in a Chinese private equity fund that had proved politically toxic but difficult to unload, assuming the $157,000 in debt that Biden had incurred to purchase it.
Within weeks of meeting Hunter Biden, Morris convened a crisis meeting in what he called “a war room” in his home.
About 10 people who had varying roles in Biden’s nascent resurrection gathered with Biden and Cohen.
Days later, a court filing indicated that Biden had agreed to pay child support to an Arkansas woman with whom he had a daughter. Morris fronted the cash.
Shortly after that, Morris emailed a tax accountant and others who were at the crisis meeting about finishing Biden’s overdue tax returns. He was concerned Republicans might seize on the tax issues if they succeeded in calling Hunter Biden to testify in Trump’s first impeachment, which was unfolding at the time, Morris later explained during his congressional testimony.
Morris paid millions of dollars to settle Biden’s tax bill.
It wasn’t until October 2021 — nearly two years after Morris started footing bills for Biden — that they formalized an agreement under which the money would be treated as a loan. The loan agreement includes a 5% interest rate and calls for Biden to start making payments in October 2025.
It was the first of five similar loan agreements between Morris and Biden.
After the 2020 presidential race, the Justice Department investigation into Hunter Biden heated up, with subpoenas issued to associates including Morris, who was compelled to produce documents to a grand jury.
Morris also became heavily involved in the pushback against embarrassing disclosures about Biden drawn from data linked to a laptop Biden was said to have abandoned in a Delaware computer repair shop.
Morris retained forensic analysts to study the data. He also quietly pushed a complex theory under which the repair shop was a front and the information had been made public through a cast of characters including a psychiatrist who had treated Biden’s addiction using ketamine therapy and Trump-allied operative Roger Stone.
Prosecutors subsequently poured cold water on the theory, stating in a court filing that Biden left the laptop at a computer store and that its contents “were largely duplicative” of data they had subpoenaed directly from his Apple iCloud account.
Morris’ unconventional tactics were discouraged by two lawyers recommended to Hunter Biden by his father’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer: Christopher Clark, a criminal defense lawyer, and Joshua Levy, who had been retained to respond to congressional investigations.
Morris urged dispensing with the traditional Washington scandal playbook and embracing tactics like those used in celebrity public relations.
“We’re not going for a tie; we have to win this,” he told others.
Morris started to gain more control when Levy parted ways with the team after clashing with him.
To replace him, Morris facilitated the hiring of veteran Washington scandal lawyer Abbe Lowell. Within months, with Morris fronting the costs, Lowell had filed suits against the computer repair shop owner, the IRS, Rudy Giuliani and others.
After the collapse in the summer of a plea deal that would have resolved tax and gun investigations without Hunter Biden serving any prison time, Clark, who was the last impediment to Morris’ no-holds-barred approach, resigned from the legal team.
On the December day that Hunter Biden had been subpoenaed to testify to Republican-led House committees, he instead appeared at a surprise news conference outside the Capitol.
Accompanied by Morris and Lowell, Biden was defiant. He accused Republicans of pursuing “illegitimate investigations of my family” to “dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father, who has devoted his entire life to service.”
When Republicans convened hearings last month to vote on contempt of Congress charges against Biden, he and Morris crashed the session.
With the documentary crew in tow, Biden, Morris and Lowell filed into the Oversight Committee’s hearing room and sat in the front row.

Tesla Price Cuts Take Toll On Profits From Car Sales In Fierce E.V. Competition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.
Tesla's profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead.
Profit in the fourth quarter nearly doubled to $ 7.9 billion, up from $ 3.7 billion a year earlier. But $ 5.9 billion of that profit came from a tax benefit. Without that one-time accounting effect, profit would have fallen.
Tesla has slashed prices for the two cars that make up the bulk of its sales -- the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle -- as automakers like BYD, in China, and General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen, in the United States and Europe, have begun selling more electric vehicles.
The price cuts have helped Tesla sell more cars and forced other carmakers to respond, helping to make electric vehicles more affordable. But the cuts have weighed on Tesla's profit. In 2022, Tesla was one of the most profitable carmakers in the world, but its margins from vehicle sales have fallen by almost one-third in the last year and are now comparable to those of other large rivals.
Because of the price cuts, sales revenue from cars last quarter rose just 1 percent from a year earlier, to $ 21.6 billion -- even though Tesla sold 1.8 million cars in 2023, a 35 percent increase from 2022. Tesla made up some of the difference by reducing manufacturing costs.
Tesla shares slumped about 6 percent in after-hours trading after the company said it expected sales growth to be "notably slower" in 2024 as it developed a budget-priced vehicle. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said during a conference call Wednesday that the vehicle, whose design is still a secret, might be available by late 2025.
"That will be a challenge," he cautioned, because of new technology being developed to manufacture the car at a lower cost.
At Wednesday's close, Tesla stock was 17 percent below where it started the year and down more than 25 percent from its 12-month high in July.
The carmaker faces an array of challenges this year, including economic uncertainty in all of its major markets and questions about the future role of Mr. Musk. He surprised investors this month when he said on X, the social media site he owns, that he wanted the Tesla board to raise his stake in the company to 25 percent, from 13 percent, effectively giving him shares worth more than $ 80 billion.
If he doesn't get his wish, Mr. Musk said, he will develop new artificial intelligence products "outside of Tesla." Tesla's board has not responded publicly.
Mr. Musk said Wednesday that he needed 25 percent to protect him from being ousted "by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm." He added, "There's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have, you know, strange ideas about what should be done."
Mr. Musk did not clarify how Tesla's board could grant him a stake worth $ 80 billion without diluting the value of Tesla shares.
The automaker commands more than half the electric vehicle market in the United States, and it has more models than any other manufacturer that qualify for $ 7,500 tax credits under rules that took effect Jan. 1. Plummeting prices for lithium, cobalt and other materials essential to battery production should help lower manufacturing costs.
Tesla has begun selling the Cybertruck, a pickup that is the company's first new model since the Model Y in 2020. But Tesla remains dependent on the Model 3 and Model Y for sales. BYD and Volkswagen, along with its Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, offer larger selections of vehicles.
Tesla said Wednesday that the cost of ramping up production of the Cybertruck had weighed on profit, and that it would take longer than usual to produce the vehicle in large volumes because of a complex manufacturing process. The truck's body is made of stainless steel, which resists rust and is more durable than the steel used in most cars, but is also harder to shape and weld.
Slowing sales growth for electric vehicles is another challenge. Surveys show that many people are interested in electric vehicles but hesitant to buy because of high prices and concern about finding enough places to charge the cars.
In a setback, Hertz said this month that it would sell some of its fleet of Teslas because they were less profitable than expected, and because some customers struggled with the unfamiliar technology.
Election-year politics add another element of uncertainty for all electric vehicle makers. Former President Donald J. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has called electric vehicles a hoax, and his supporters have vowed to roll back Biden administration policies intended to promote the cars and encourage domestic manufacturing.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who has endorsed Mr. Trump, recently portrayed electric vehicles as a subsidy for rich liberals at the expense of "hardworking families in my home state."

One Cinematographer but Two Very Different Looks: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Erik Messerschmidt worked with the directors Michael Mann and David Fincher to create cohesive worlds that feel nothing alike.
Michael Mann's new drama "Ferrari," about several important weeks in the life of the racecar driver and manufacturer Enzo Ferrari, is many things: biographical drama, thriller, period costume film, and also a story about business rivalries, domestic disputes and personal grief. Adam Driver plays the automotive magnate as a man divided between his obsessive pursuit of professional glory and his straining responsibilities as a husband and father. Accordingly Mann approaches these two worlds with different, even diametrically opposed styles. There are intense, breakneck racing sequences and dark, elegiac domestic scenes, and little in between.
"There's really two distinct aesthetic sensibilities in the film," Erik Messerschmidt, the film's director of photography, said in a recent interview. "Michael wanted the interpersonal drama parts of the film to be more classically made than the racing."
Messerschmidt said that for the heavier moments Mann "wanted to reference Italian Renaissance paintings," with their pronounced shadows and dense compositions; the racing scenes, by contrast, made use of cutting-edge technology and contemporary techniques.
Messerschmidt also served as the cinematographer on "The Killer," David Fincher's recent thriller about a hit man dealing with the fallout of a job gone wrong, now streaming on Netflix. Looking at the two films side by side reveals the marked contrasts in the directors' approach.
"Their use of the camera, in particular, is very different," Messerschmidt said. "Michael is often looking for those spontaneous moments, and I think he's a little more shoot-from-the-hip than David is. Whereas David is a very precise, methodical filmmaker -- he's one of a kind that way."
Here, Messerschmidt explains how the look of "Ferrari" was achieved on and off the track and how it compared with his work on "The Killer."
Vintage Speed
"Ferrari" opens with a brisk montage of grainy black-and-white newsreel footage that shows Enzo in his youth racing for Alfa Romeo. Mann, who had been trying to make "Ferrari" since the early 2000s, spent a lot of time poring over archival footage of motor racing from this era, and he and the crew watched it often to help faithfully capture the look. While shooting an early racing sequence, Mann had the idea to open with Enzo himself on the track, to remind the audience that he used to be a racer.
The scene is "a combination of actual archival footage and visual-effects compositions of Adam driving a period-correct racecar from the '20s," Messerschmidt explained. Driver had to actually get on the track: it's not a sound stage or a green screen but footage of him that's been rotoscoped, which accounts for why this shot looks so realistic.
By contrast, Messerschmidt and Fincher spent a lot of time adjusting images for "The Killer" in postproduction to hone the look of key locations in Paris, the Dominican Republic and Chicago, which they wanted to differentiate aesthetically. "All of those places have a unique look, in terms of architecture, design and how the light falls," the cinematographer said. Paris, for instance, was depicted with "this kind of split-tone color palette of cool shadows and warm highlights."
While each location had its own visual identity, Messerschmidt said he was conscious of "still keeping them within one cohesive world."
"I didn't want it to feel like a ransom note of color palettes," he joked.
Racing Along
The second half of "Ferrari" focuses on his efforts to win the 1957 Mille Miglia, a wildly competitive race that covers almost 1,000 miles on public roads. To capture its blistering intensity, Mann got extremely close to the vehicles, as in this shot of two cars speeding neck and neck on a winding mountain overpass. The camera team, Messerschmidt said, was following just behind in a Porsche Cayenne. "We were driving these cars at the actual speeds," Messerschmidt said. "Michael was not interested in faking it or undercranking the camera."
As in this shot, many of the driving scenes have a rawness that emphasizes just how fast and dangerous the racing is. The style, Messerschmidt said, "has a very vérité feel to it," which adds to the sensation of raw power. "These cars are visceral, they are loud, and the engines shake, and the suspension is stiff. That was something we wanted to show from very beginning."
Night Drive
Part of the Mille Miglia race takes place on an open stretch of road in the dead of night. The only sources of light are the cars' headlights, which illuminate the rain-slick road and reflect off one another. Shooting this sequence without conventional movie lighting, Messerschmidt said, was a matter of necessity, because there was no obvious place to put up lights. "I had a lot of anxiety about that scene," he said. "I didn't really know what I was going to do."
Eventually, he said, he "decided to roll the dice and just do it with the headlights."
"The Killer" makes striking use of nighttime as well, in part because the movie is about a man who "lives and lurks in the shadows," Messerschmidt said. "We wanted to work in this murky world. It felt like an appropriate thing to lean into that in the film."
Up Close and Personal
When "Ferrari" is not on the track, the camera has a tendency to probe the characters closely, sometimes getting right up in their faces. In this sequence on the factory grounds, the lens gets so near Enzo that his features become almost a blur. "When Michael really wants to get the audience into a character and bring you close, he will put you literally close to the actor," Messerschmidt said.
To achieve this "very odd point of view," Messerschmidt employed a "skater scope," which extends the lens about 10 inches from the body of the camera. That extension "means we can get very close to the actor without the Steadicam itself hitting the actor's knees," he explained.
Fincher also wants to use the camera to understand his characters in "The Killer," but "the camera has no personality in the way that Michael's camera does," Messerschmidt explained. "Ferrari" has "a very subjective camera," while Fincher "is working with a conversation between subjectivity and objectivity." The camera "reinforces" the unnamed executioner played by Michael Fassbender.
This is clear in the many precise frames and symmetrical compositions -- an aesthetic that mirrors the hit man's meticulousness. "When the killer is in control and confident, the camera is extremely confident, in terms of how we operate it and how the shots cut together," Messerschmidt said. "When the killer loses control and starts to fall apart, the camera falls apart as well."
Memories at Sunset
A centerpiece of "Ferrari" takes place at an opera, where Enzo has an intense emotional reaction. Mourning the loss of his son, he thinks back to their time together, as the film cuts to brief, gauzy flashbacks, including this one, in which the two are playing in a field. The camera is very low to the ground, and the sun is just setting over the horizon; the delicate style is reminiscent of the work of Terrence Malick.
"I think I get now maybe how Malick works," Messerschmidt said. For this flashback, he and Mann started "working with the actors and the camera, improvising a bit," he said, adding that they just happened to catch this interaction. "It was very spur of the moment. It wasn't previsualized."
Small and Agile
At times during the racing sequences in "Ferrari," the camera is fixed to the body of the car itself, stuck alongside as the vehicle zooms at extraordinary speeds. In this shot, we see the bold Ferrari logo against a whooshing blur of grass and road. Because they were sticking a camera onto a car that was pushing its technical limits, "we had to be very conscious of weight distribution and aerodynamics," Messerschmidt said. Their choice for these shots was a Red Komodo camera, "which is about the size of a Rubik's Cube." As Messerschmidt noted, "This would have been a very challenging film to make with a large, cumbersome motion picture camera."

Whether your holiday season comes with flight delays, a long road trip or a rare day with space on your calendar, it's likely you're about to have some free time.
If you'd like to use it to get a little smarter about deals and the economy -- and perhaps even enjoy yourself in the process -- you're in luck: Here are our favorite books and podcasts from this year (plus one game) that will help you do just that.
An investigative reporter unpacks the crypto industry
"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall" by Zeke Faux
Cryptocurrency has its detractors, including the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who told a congressional hearing this month that the government should ban digital assets. But few crypto critics have been as committed to trying to understand the technology and to thoroughly exploring the industry -- which has seemed at times to make money from nothing -- as the Bloomberg investigative reporter Zeke Faux. In his book, "Number Go Up," he travels around the world for two years meeting the people fueling the enthusiasm for digital tokens -- and uncovering corruption, greed and exploitation along the way.
The book was released about a month before the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto exchange FTX, who was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy last month. Faux begins by admitting that he did not see through Bankman-Fried's billionaire wunderkind facade when they met. But Faux did have his suspicions about the crypto industry and promises from digital asset enthusiasts that blockchain would democratize finance, and he met many of the people peddling these ideas. "From the beginning, I thought that crypto was pretty dumb. And it turned out to be even dumber than I imagined," he writes.
Global trade, the online game
Tradle
Quiz time: Which country's outbound trade was roughly $ 597 billion in 2021? A hint: Its top export categories were cars, refined petroleum, wine and valves.
A. Japan
B. Argentina
C. United States
D. Italy
The answer is D, Italy.
That's according to Tradle, the Wordle-style game about world trade that has become a daily habit for economics buffs, global policy geeks and at least one DealBook editor.
Developed by the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a trade data visualization specialist, Tradle takes gamers across the globe each day. The hints could lead to a developing island economy whose chief exports are recreational boats (the Cayman Islands, for example) or to a Group of 7 giant like Canada (Spoiler: chief exports include crude oil, sawed wood and fertilizers).
Gilberto García-Vazquez, an economist whose firm is behind the game, told Marketplace this summer that Tradle's global popularity was a big surprise. The site was attracting "close to a million visits per month," he said, another sign that everyone likes a good game -- even ones about global trade.
If Hollywood had a sports podcast
"The Town"
Who's up in the media business and who's down? Tinseltown's chief industry has an image built on art and glamour, but Matt Belloni's podcast about its inner workings treats it like sports, with an A.M. talk-radio vibe (no surprise, given its roots in The Ringer podcast network) and an informed casual approach to the subject. Belloni rose up through the Hollywood trades and is the author of Puck's flagship newsletter, What I'm Hearing, but on the podcast he adopts an approach that welcomes in more casual followers of media news. Close watchers of the industry, however, will still appreciate the interviews with newsmakers like Ted Sarandos, a Netflix chief executive, and Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, on hot topics like the streaming wars, the actors' and writers' strikes and why superhero movies are stumbling.
A glimpse into a climate apocalypse
"Fire Weather: A True Story From a Hotter World" by John Vaillant
Wildfires were all over the news in 2023. Burning Canadian forests smothered New York in smoke, there were deadly blazes in Maui, and extreme heat caused Greece's worst fires on record. In "Fire Weather," the reporter John Vaillant writes about an earlier wildfire that provided a hint of what was to come.
In 2016, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was engulfed in flames, forcing 90,000 people to evacuate. The city is the center of Canada's oil sands industry, which means it relies on the production of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Vaillant calls it a "bifurcated reality," with executives acknowledging the threat posed by carbon dioxide emissions but still making money from the industry despite the damage it evidently causes.
The contradictions won't end soon. Some of the world's biggest energy companies signaled this year that they are doubling down on fossil fuels via a series of deals in the shale oil patch. July was the hottest month ever recorded. And the United Nations' climate conference in United Arab Emirates -- a petrostate -- was the first to publicly state that the world needs to move away from fossil fuels.
We aren't done producing and using fossil fuels, and our world is heating up. Those two trends are inevitably going to bang into each other again, and Vaillant's book is a useful look at how that might unfold.
A warning about the geopolitical challenges threatening market democracy
"The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism" by Martin Wolf
Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, is a believer in the marriage of liberal democracy and market economics. The combination, he argues, has created the most successful societies in history, generating prosperity and freedom.
In "The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism," he argues that's changing because the system is failing to deliver economically and politically, leading to the rise of populists and self-defeating political movements. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump as president and the rise of rentier capitalism are all bad for democratic societies and the institutions upon which they rely, he writes. And that has worrying consequences for free societies and the businesses that operate within them.
The case is personal for Wolf. He is an economist and his parents were refugees from the Nazis, who were able to gain power partly because of the Great Depression. History, he says, is a warning that political mistakes can be hugely destructive when combined with economic disasters.
A podcast that profiles the drama of big deals
"The Closer"
Reporting about deals often centers the numbers. That approach can miss the drama behind them and the effect afterward. "The Closer," a podcast hosted by the journalist Aimee Keane, unfolds rich stories behind the headlines, often revealing unexpected consequences.
In its first episode, it explored the 2013 merger between American Airlines and US Airways, which created the world's largest airline, and the role that labor unions played in the deal. Since then, the podcast has explained how an action from the Department of Justice led to Modelo's rise to become the top beer in the U.S.; why a failed deal in 2018 led to WeWork's bankruptcy this year; and how private equity investors and Walmart killed Toys "R" Us (an episode that features DealBook's Lauren Hirsch, who broke the story that the company was considering bankruptcy).
The show's trick is showing the continuing relevance of old deals, and how the cascading events they unleash can reshape industries.
A podcast for true deal nerds
"Acquired"
The tech investors Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal take listeners behind the scenes of some of the world's most famous companies: Costco, LVMH, Porsche. Their extensively researched episodes run several hours long (one on Nike was about four hours) and explain the strategies and strange turns of fortune that allowed the founders of these companies to build enduring businesses. Gilbert and Rosenthal devote some episodes to guests, including the Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and the Berkshire Hathaway executive Charles Munger, who was interviewed about a month before his passing in late November.

A Synth-Pop Mastermind's Solo Turn: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Tannenbaum, Rob

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He's made irresistible hits with Depeche Mode, Yazoo and Erasure. But going alone for the first time at 63, his inspirations were more sober, and more personal.
"Do you want to see it?" Vince Clarke asked.
For the previous few minutes, Clarke, one of the most successful electronic musicians from the 1980s, had tried to explain Eurorack, the system he used to create "Songs of Silence," his deeply personal first solo album, due Friday.
"It's like having a Porsche engine glued together with a reliable Volvo car, and the wheels are the best ones from Dunlop, but they all join together. Does that make any sense?" he asked with a laugh.
"I'm very nerdy," he added.
Clarke's nerdiness, along with his sterling pop sensibility, has contributed to lots of great music. He wrote the three hit singles on Depeche Mode's 1981 debut album, then quit the band and formed a duo, Yazoo, with the singer Alison Moyet. They had hits, too, including "Situation," which is currently the song in a ubiquitous TV commercial for Truly Hard Seltzer. Clarke also had a side project, the Assembly, which produced one great track, "Never Never," before he formed a new duo, Erasure, with the British singer Andy Bell. Erasure has placed 28 singles in the Top 20 of the U.K. pop chart, and three in the United States.
"He's an important pioneer in making synthesizers more prominent in pop music," Danz CM, an electronic musician and synth historian, said in a phone interview. "He has a knack for writing synth-pop songs with catchy, complex melodies." (See: Depeche Mode's "Just Can't Get Enough," Yazoo's "Don't Go," Erasure's "A Little Respect" and "Chains of Love," his biggest U.S. hit.)
Clarke, 63, lives with his wife, Tracy Hurley Martin, and their 18-year-old son Oscar, a musician, in a sprawling Manhattan triplex loft in a part of TriBeCa where the streets are still cobblestone. He's thin and smallish, with big eyes and a ready laugh sparked by a dry sense of humor. As we sat at a long dining table, we were watched carefully by an enormous red cat, whom Clarke addressed as "Cat," even though his name is Dio, after the heavy metal singer Ronnie James Dio.
Clarke is a pop guy, but "Songs of Silence" isn't a pop record. The music is mostly ambient and drone, with no hooks or key changes. Since the start of the pandemic, ambient music seems to have found a new purpose and audience, as a salve for anxiety or sleeplessness. It's been a balm for Clarke, too. In an interview last month with The Quietus, he said that making the album had been "very therapeutic." The article mentioned that his wife had been seriously ill; asked to add more details, he said "No," firmly. There was a pause, then he leavened the moment with a punchline: "That's the end of the interview then! See ya!"
In May 2022, Andy Fletcher, a founding member of Depeche Mode, died. Four months later, Clarke's best friend from childhood, the singer Robert Marlow, did too. Clarke's sadness, and his concern for his wife, all leaked into the record.
Did he compose "Songs of Silence" out of a need for solace? "I don't know if it's a need, no. I'm not thinking, Oh, if I add another keyboard, I'll feel much better," he quipped. "But it did fulfill that function."
Could Clarke, hypothetically, walk over to the upright piano in a corner of his living room and play something? He shook his head no.
"I used to play guitar, but I was terrible at it," he said. "When synthesizers came along, I realized I could get a great sound just by hitting one note with my forefinger. It didn't require any skill, which was a huge attraction!"
Clarke started out, with Depeche Mode, using a monophonic synthesizer -- a keyboard that could play only one note at a time. "It was horrible, the Kawai S-100F. And it cost 400 pounds, which was a huge amount of money."
He still uses only monophonic synths, and constructs his tracks one finger at a time, layering sounds on top of each other, which is a big part of why he called himself "a crappy keyboard player." What, then, is his skill?
"I would put him in the Mozartian category," said Martyn Ware, an original member of the Human League who has become Clarke's close friend and frequent collaborator. "He's prolific, and he understands melody lines and counterpoint, as well as how to create an emotional connection to the audience. Vince is like an orchestral arranger, but for synthesizers."
Clarke's family came from the East End of London, which is still evident in his accent, but the area was heavily bombed by Germany during World War II because of its proximity to the country's shipping docks. So they moved to Basildon, one of many "new towns" Britain built quickly to create new housing -- in some cases, too quickly. "Cracks would start appearing in walls, and they'd have to flatten the houses and start again," he said.
His father was a tic-tac man who relayed betting odds to bookies at the dog track using an intricate set of hand signals, and his mother worked as a factory seamstress and also made clothes for Vince, his sister and his two brothers: "Three brothers, and we all looked the same because she used the same piece of cloth. It was naff."
Musically, his first love was Simon & Garfunkel, after he discovered he could play their songs on a guitar. Then in 1979, synth-pop hit the charts. He fell under the sway of "Video Killed the Radio Star" by the Buggles, which he pronounced "the greatest pop song ever written," and Visage's "Fade to Grey," as well as more industrial things, like Fad Gadget's "Back to Nature" and "T.V.O.D." by the Normal.
It felt to him like electronic music was the genuine punk rock. A guitarist needed to learn at least three chords, but a synth player could create a whole track even with nine broken fingers. "The Sex Pistols were real musicians," he said. "The early electronic musicians weren't. All they could do was" -- he tapped on the dining table -- "which is still all I can do," he finished with a roar.
He and three friends formed Depeche Mode, a band with no drummer or guitarist. They played weekly at a Basildon disco, "but we only had eight songs, so the set was pretty short," he recalled.
A local newspaper wanted to write about the group, and as the main songwriter, he became the mouthpiece. After the interview, he began to worry that if his real name appeared in the story, he'd no longer qualify for unemployment benefits. So he asked the writer to change it from Vince Martin to Vince Clarke, after the American D.J. Dick Clark -- whose name, he found out later, doesn't have an E at the end.
Depeche Mode had immediate success in England, but Clarke wasn't happy. "Egos were flying around, mine especially," he said. There was too much squabbling, so he quit. He figured he'd go back to one of his earlier jobs, which included emptying chemical toilets on airplanes, and make music as a hobby.
He wrote a beautiful ballad called "Only You" and needed a singer to demo it, so he replied to a newspaper ad by Moyet, a big-voiced, soulful singer whom he'd known distantly since childhood. But their personalities clashed -- she was combative, he hates conflict -- and the partnership ended quickly.
In a period of only five years, he made the first Depeche record, two Yazoo albums, the Assembly hit and the first Erasure single, "Who Needs Love Like That." This hot streak, he said, happened because he spent almost all his time in recording studios. "I couldn't soak it up fast enough."
Near the end of our two-hour conversation, he proudly showed off his Eurorack, which is upstairs in the bedroom. "Ta-da!" he exclaimed. A Eurorack isn't a machine, but a format, developed by the German company Doepfer in the mid-1990s, that allows users to link individual modular devices, made by small, specialty manufacturers, to create elaborate DIY super-synthesizers. Clarke has two Euroracks, and each has at least 30 different devices: oscillators, filters, envelope generators, sequencers, and more.
"It's an infinite learning and discovery process," Clarke said. "That's what got me hooked." The nerd in him was ecstatic.

German E-Bikes Gain Power as the Car Industry Falters: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: E-bikes sales in Germany have jumped, as drivers, suppliers and even automakers embrace their role in the future of transportation.
Germany's automakers are facing steep challenges as they convert to battery-powered lineups and confront rising competition from China. But business is booming in another corner of the German transport industry: e-bikes.
Sales of bicycles in Germany reached a record 7.36 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in 2022, with e-bikes accounting for nearly half of sales, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association. The group is forecasting that this year, for the first time, Germans will buy more e-bikes than conventional models.
Electric bicycles and scooters are the backbone of what's known as micromobility, seen as crucial to cutting the carbon emissions of transportation and helping to ease pollution and congestion in European cities. Analysts at EY cite e-bikes as the factor behind predicted annual growth of 4.6 percent in Europe's bicycle market in the coming five years, as more people adjust their lifestyles to cut emissions. At the same time, the number of privately owned cars could drop by as much as 25 percent, according to a study by PWC, as consumers shift to car sharing and alternative mobility models.
Germany's auto industry has noticed. Porsche offers a sporty, all-terrain e-bike -- with the carmaker's familiar gold-and-red crest under the handlebars. Audi has a similar model.
"Demand for micromobility is growing," said Sandra Wolf, the chief executive of Riese & Müller, a leading German bicycle maker with a wide range of electric models. "E-bikes play an important role in that."
Germany is Europe's largest overall market for bicycles, and in recent years German bike makers have seen a growing demand for their e-bikes abroad, especially within Europe. China is the world's largest producer of e-bikes, but duties imposed by the European Union on Chinese imports have helped to shield producers in Europe.
Several German firms are among the leading e-bike manufacturers in Europe, along with rivals in France, Italy and the Netherlands. In the first quarter of this year, exports of battery-powered bicycles made in Germany jumped 56 percent from a year earlier, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association.
That sort of growth has attracted investors. Last year LRMR Ventures, the investment firm of the National Basketball Association star LeBron James, led a group investing €30 million in Canyon, a German bicycle producer based in Koblenz, with an eye to expanding its e-bike offerings and presence in the United States.
Germany's largest automobile show, in Munich, was rebranded as a "mobility" fair in 2021. During a panel discussion at the show this month, Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, explained how his company was working on technology to reduce the cost of the batteries for electric vehicles.
Ms. Wolf, who was also on the panel, said cycling was already filling the space for more affordable, sustainable transportation. "It is one of the cheapest transport modes and one with easiest access," she said.
Still, the average e-bike in Germany sold for €2,800, or nearly $ 3,000, last year, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association, a high price point that has made leasing popular. Across Europe, some companies are offering employees a perk of leasing an e-bike for commuting. Delivery firms are also renting electric cargo bikes -- the larger models capable of carrying heavy or bulky loads -- for their drivers.
Automakers are getting into this market, too. "Bike leasing is booming," said Christian Dahlheim, the chief executive of Volkswagen's Financial Services division, which handles leasing of the company's cars. Volkswagen recently teamed up with Pon, a Dutch company, in a venture focused on leasing bicycles to workers via their employers, with an eye to expanding in Europe and the United States.
Companies known for auto parts also see opportunities in e-bikes. Bosch, long a leading supplier of powertrains and other technology for German automakers, is now a major supplier of the batteries, motors and brakes for e-bikes. Technology originally developed for cars, such as anti-lock breaks, are now being used in e-bikes.
Increasingly, customers are looking for more nimble, lighter e-bikes that can carry cargo loads of up to 140 pounds. Such models are growing in popularity, with families seeking a car-free way to transport children and groceries.
Older riders who want to remain mobile and active, but are looking for what William Kraus, 67, called "a little boost," are another growing target market. Mr. Kraus, who tried several models on display at the show in Munich, said he hadn't decided on the right one yet for himself and his wife.
But he was convinced that the next vehicle he bought would be an e-bike.
"They take the strain out of riding and make it more fun," he said. And while prices ranging from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 were still high, they were a fraction of the $ 35,000 starting price for a new electric car.

Used E.V.s Becoming A Good Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Nerkar, Santul

Publication info: Nerkar, Santul.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The prices of used battery-powered models have fallen sharply, as the supply of cars and trucks has improved.
If you're in the market for an electric vehicle, the time might be right to consider a used one.
The high cost of electric vehicles has long dissuaded many people from buying one. Last year, for example, electric cars and trucks were so popular and supply so limited that waiting lists were common. And some lucky individuals found they could sell their ride for more than they paid for it.
But over the past year, prices of used electric vehicles have fallen significantly. In addition, climate legislation passed in 2022 includes a tax credit to encourage more people to buy used electric cars and trucks.
Auto inflation has eased
Used cars as a whole are around 7 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But used battery-powered models are 28 percent less expensive than a year ago, according to Recurrent, a research firm that specializes in the used electric vehicle market.
Shortages of new cars during the pandemic made new and used cars more expensive, as strong demand for new vehicles spilled over into the used market. Now, supply chains and inventories have improved, and new electric vehicles -- and new cars generally -- have become more available.
Tesla, which sells most new electric cars, has cut prices several times this year to attract buyers, forcing other automakers to lower prices and offer promotions. Those cuts have helped to push down used car prices.
Some analysts think used electric car prices could fall further, though perhaps not as fast. Higher interest rates and a strong supply of new vehicles ought to continue driving prices down, according to J.D. Power, a market research firm.
Are electric cars a bad investment?
Most cars depreciate over time. That said, electric cars and trucks are holding their value better today than they did before the pandemic. That's because there are more places to charge these cars and people have become more familiar with them, said David Paris, director of market intelligence at J.D. Power Valuation Services.
If you bought, say, a used BMW i3 in 2019, Mr. Paris said, it retained only around 30 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail prices after three years. But now the i3 retains more than 50 percent of its value, suggesting that buyers have fewer concerns about the cars and specifically the health of their batteries, the most expensive part of those vehicles.
Liz Najman, a researcher at Recurrent, said most used electric cars were still new enough that their batteries should be covered under warranty. "Most used E.V.s in the country have at least an eight year, 100,000-mile warranty on their battery," she said.
You should still check the health of a car's battery before buying because replacing it can be expensive. Recurrent provides reports on the health of a car's battery, and apps like Leaf Spy and MyGreenVolt allow car owners to monitor their batteries, depending on the model.
You might be eligible for a tax credit
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's climate bill, grants a tax credit of up to $ 4,000 for buying used electric vehicles that cost no more than $ 25,000.
The credit is available to individuals who earn up to $ 75,000 a year and couples who make $ 150,000 or less. According to Recurrent, around 27 percent of the used electric car inventory is eligible for the credit, up from 17 percent last year.
To qualify, a used vehicle has to be at least two years old. Buyers cannot claim the credit more than once every three years. But, unlike with the tax credits for new vehicles, there are no restrictions on where a used electric vehicle is assembled or where the materials in its batteries come from.
More options are available
Before the pandemic, some of the most popular electric vehicles had been on the road for only a few years at most. Among the few electric models often found on the used car lot, many were luxury models like the Tesla Model S, a large sedan, or the Tesla Model X, a three-row sport-utility vehicle.
The market is much bigger and more diverse now. The number of used electric cars for sale has tripled over the past year, according to Recurrent. A recent scroll through used car listings in the New York area showed a wide range of cars, including a Porsche Taycan listed for more than $ 80,000 and Chevrolet, Hyundai and Nissan models selling for less than $ 25,000.
Buying a used electric vehicle might not be right for everyone, especially if you have to drive long distances or live somewhere where charging stations are few and far between. But if you have a place to plug in and don't frequently drive several hundred miles a day, you can get a good deal.

Full text: After emigrating to New Jersey from Egypt, Wael Hana faced a string of business and legal problems. Then his friend started dating a powerful U.S. senator.
Just five years ago, Wael Hana was reeling from a string of bad business deals in New Jersey, having tried to launch a truck stop, an Italian restaurant, a limousine service and other companies without ever hitting it big.
Then, his friend started dating Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, one of the most powerful Democrats in the United States Senate. Soon, Mr. Hana introduced Mr. Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to a growing circle of Egyptian officials, and Mr. Hana's fortunes took a remarkable turn: He won sole control over certifying all halal food being imported into Egypt, earning enough money to bribe Mr. Menendez with gold bars and wads of cash, prosecutors said.
Mr. Hana, Mr. Menendez and others are now facing charges in what prosecutors have described as a wide-ranging corruption scheme -- one that threatens to put an end to the senator's five decades in politics. But the allegations, if true, also raise a pressing question about Mr. Hana: Was he an agent of the Egyptian government all along, or just a lucky opportunist who stumbled into a position of international influence?
The F.B.I. is investigating this very question. But a New York Times examination of hundreds of pages of court filings, business records and interviews with nearly a dozen people who knew or dealt with Mr. Hana offered insights into the path he traveled during his bumpy start -- and meteoric rise.
Within the span of a few years, he would transform from a debt-laden businessman who could not afford even a $ 2,000 emergency room bill to an international power broker who boasted about his Rolex watch collection to a diplomat in Cairo.
In addition to the corruption investigation into Mr. Menendez, the F.B.I. has been conducting a parallel counterintelligence inquiry, according to four people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation. The review, first reported by NBC News, is seeking to determine whether Egypt's intelligence service sought to obtain information from Mr. Menendez through Mr. Hana's friend Nadine Menendez, who married Mr. Menendez in 2020.
Federal agents are also seeking to determine Mr. Hana's relationship with Egyptian intelligence agencies and when that relationship may have started, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Hana said in a statement that he was innocent of all charges and that he has cooperated with federal prosecutors by providing them "unfettered access to documents and to his employees." She added that he voluntarily booked a flight to New York from Egypt "within minutes of learning about this indictment," leaving his wife and three young daughters behind.
"Wael Hana's background is a classic immigrant story," the spokeswoman said. "He has been an entrepreneur who has built several businesses, and he has always acted ethically and legally."
Mr. Hana, an American citizen, has been on law enforcement's radar for at least four years. In November 2019, the F.B.I. raided his home and office in New Jersey with a search warrant indicating prosecutors were gathering evidence of potential crimes, including illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government, according to a court filing.
However, Mr. Hana, 40, was not charged with that offense. In the indictment unsealed this September, prosecutors said he was the broker who helped to orchestrate an agreement for Mr. Menendez to steer more American aid and weapons to Egypt. Mr. Menendez is also accused of sending sensitive information about U.S. Embassy employees in Cairo to his wife, who forwarded it to Mr. Hana, who sent it on to an Egyptian government official.
In return, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana and his circle of business associates showered the Menendezes with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars, and bribes that included a mortgage payment for Ms. Menendez, a "low-or-no-show" job for her at Mr. Hana's halal company and a new Mercedes-Benz convertible.
Mr. Hana, the Menendezes and the others charged in the case have pleaded not guilty. Last week, Mr. Menendez rebuffed calls for his resignation and predicted he would be exonerated.
In August, a month before their arrest, Mr. Menendez and his wife traveled to Egypt, where the senator met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The Egyptian government has not commented publicly. On YouTube, some pro-government influencers praised the facts of the investigation, saying that it showed how Egypt was doing a good job of protecting its own interests.
A humble beginning
Mr. Hana was 22 when he arrived in the United States through the visa lottery system in 2006, a few years after the death of his father, according to a person familiar with Mr. Hana's background. He started working for a cleaning company and enrolled in English language classes at a community college, the person said.
Right away, he showed an entrepreneurial hustle, creating a trucking business called Elmanhry LLC -- the first in a long list of businesses that would appear under his name.
He bought a home in Bayonne, N.J., for $ 450,000 from a seller who attended the same Egyptian church as he did, the seller said. He appeared to buy the home without a down payment, securing a mortgage for the full purchase price, property records show.
By 2011, Mr. Hana had moved on to the luxury car business, and he approached a Chinese businessman with a proposal. Mr. Hana would negotiate with Porsche and Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Jersey to purchase new cars on behalf of the businessman, who would then sell them to customers in China. They hashed out the details over dinner at a seafood restaurant in Flushing, Queens, according to court records.
But after the businessman's company, Bosto New York, wired $ 3.6 million to Mr. Hana and his partners, they provided only $ 2.9 million worth of cars, the businessman said in a lawsuit filed in 2012.
Bosto New York won a judgment against Mr. Hana and his partners for the missing $ 705,000, but Mr. Hana never appeared in court or paid off what he owed, records show.
Soon, Mr. Hana's legal troubles began to snowball. He was accused in lawsuits of writing bad checks, among other things, eventually racking up a total of at least $ 890,000 in judgments, court records show.
In 2014, Mr. Hana was charged with driving while intoxicated after police officers said they found him passed out in the driver's seat of a parked car in Oradell, N.J. When Mr. Hana was taken to the hospital, the police said he threatened them several times, according to a local police blotter.
The lawyer who represented him in court, Andy Aslanian, would eventually introduce Mr. Hana to the tangled web of friends and business associates that would give rise to the indictment against Mr. Menendez.
In interviews, Mr. Aslanian said he took Mr. Hana under his wing after learning that Mr. Hana was alone in the country. At one point, Mr. Aslanian shared his office space with him, and they spent some holiday dinners together.
"I considered him my No. 1 son," Mr. Aslanian said of Mr. Hana.
At that time, Mr. Aslanian had cause for concern. A hospital had sued Mr. Hana in 2017 for thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. And he had missed years of mortgage payments and taxes, according to court records, ultimately resulting in the loss of his Bayonne home to foreclosure in 2018.
Although he struggled financially in the United States, Mr. Hana appeared to have a close tie with the government in Egypt.
He recommended Mr. Aslanian for a job representing Egypt in a 2016 zoning dispute over a building -- intended as a residence for Egyptian military representatives and their families -- in East Rutherford, N.J., Mr. Aslanian told The Record, a newspaper in Bergen County.
Mr. Aslanian, who met Mr. Hana around 2009 and introduced him to the future Ms. Menendez, Nadine Arslanian, soon after, also made other connections for Mr. Hana. Mr. Aslanian said the three of them would often hang out after work at a French restaurant owned by the developer Fred Daibes -- who would also be charged in the corruption case alongside Mr. Hana and the Menendezes.
In November 2017, Mr. Aslanian and Mr. Hana created a company called IS EG Halal, whose purpose was to certify meat as halal, or prepared in adherence with Islamic law. Mr. Daibes would lend financial backing to the project.
Three months later, according to the indictment, their friend Nadine began dating Mr. Menendez.
A sudden rise
Douglas Anton first met Mr. Hana in 2017 through Ms. Menendez, who was dating Mr. Anton at the time. She introduced Mr. Hana as someone who was a relative of "somebody high up in the Egyptian government," Mr. Anton recalled.
Mr. Anton was never quite sure what Mr. Hana did for work, other than that "he was some kind of liaison with Egypt," Mr. Anton said.
Behind the scenes, according to prosecutors, Mr. Hana was texting directly with Egyptian military and government officials. Throughout 2018, Mr. Hana was busy setting up meetings to introduce them to Mr. Menendez. The senator began to use his position to benefit Egypt's interests, the indictment said, including by ghostwriting a letter for an Egyptian official who was trying to persuade other U.S. senators to release a hold on $ 300 million in military aid to Egypt.
Mr. Hana's efforts came as Egyptian officials were aggressively lobbying members of Congress to lift restrictions on the aid, which lawmakers imposed in response to the government's poor human rights record. Officials in Cairo viewed the restrictions as an affront to a nation that has been a partner to the United States on counterterrorism, trade and regional security for years.
Mr. Hana's connections paid off handsomely in the spring of 2019.
The Egyptian government abruptly awarded his company, IS EG Halal, the exclusive right to certify all American food imported into Egypt as halal, prosecutors said.
The decision caused concern throughout the industry. Mr. Hana, a Christian, had no experience in halal certification. By his own admission, the company was not even operating until it was awarded the monopoly.
In a court filing in 2020, Mr. Hana explained that he won the approval because the Egyptian government wanted to take any halal certification power away from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that Egypt has vilified as a terrorist group, to deprive it of financial resources.
Because he had no expertise in Islamic law, Mr. Hana wrote, the Egyptian government provided him with imams and veterinarians to train him.
Before securing the monopoly, Mr. Hana wrote, he had another company that was already shipping goods into Egypt on the government's behalf, taking bid requests from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense's office in Washington. Mr. Hana said he was also in the process of starting another company that would handle the shipping of everything sold by the U.S. Army to Egypt.
Mr. Menendez would later be accused by prosecutors of calling a high-level official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop the U.S.D.A. from interfering with Mr. Hana's import business, which had raised prices for meat suppliers worldwide. Previously, the certification in the United States had been performed by a handful of companies.
Prosecutors allege that the senator was motivated to help Mr. Hana because Mr. Hana was using his halal company to wire bribe money to Ms. Menendez.
After the monopoly, Mr. Hana was living large. The company was headquartered in Edgewater, N.J., down the street from Mr. Hana's new luxury apartment overlooking the Hudson River, in a building owned by the family of Mr. Daibes.
The man who had just lost his home to foreclosure now had enough money to help his friends with their mortgages. In July 2019, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana used his halal company to pay about $ 23,000 to bring Ms. Menendez current on her mortgage during her own foreclosure proceedings.
But soon, an F.B.I. raid threatened to torpedo it all. In November 2019, federal agents searched Mr. Hana's home and office, seizing electronic devices, papers, notepads, a photo album and even a gold cigarette.
During the search, federal agents questioned Mr. Hana about contacts he had in Egypt, including with an embassy employee, Mr. Hana said in a court filing. He said his entire family lived in Egypt.
Federal agents also discovered that Mr. Hana's cellphone contained thousands of text messages with Ms. Menendez, prosecutors later said.
After a few months, with no criminal charges in sight, Mr. Hana asked the prosecutors to return his belongings. Among the seized items were a chain he bought in Italy, two Rolex watches that he said were gifts and a pair of earrings he said he designed for his mother that were worth about $ 15,000.
"I do not understand why the government would take my jewelry, which I would like to wear," he wrote in a court filing. It was unclear whether he got his jewelry back.
Under indictment
By 2020, federal officials said Mr. Hana's halal company had essentially become an Egyptian state entity, winning an expanded monopoly to control the certification process for all food and beverages shipped to Egypt from anywhere in the world.
As his business prospered, prosecutors said, Mr. Hana made time to ensure that Ms. Menendez was placated. In June 2021, he bought 22 gold bars with unique serial numbers, valued at a total of about $ 40,000, according to prosecutors. Two of the gold bars were later found in the Menendez home by federal agents, prosecutors said.
The rapid expansion of his business led Mr. Hana to travel frequently, opening offices in Uruguay, India, Brazil, Egypt and New Zealand. Photos posted on the internet show him meeting with ambassadors and dignitaries around the world to discuss trade with Egypt.
Last year, Mr. Hana made a memorable impression on one former Western diplomat in Cairo. The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Hana was an hour late to their lunch with no explanation or apology. They discussed the halal certification process, and Mr. Hana mentioned countries that were complaining about the prices he was charging.
The diplomat thought Mr. Hana was such a character that he wrote about it in his diary: He was "wearing an absurdly expensive suit, gold Rolex, gold rings. Spoke confidently, but softly, so you had to really listen."
"In our second lunch," he added, "he spent about twenty minutes telling me about his Rolex collection."
After he was indicted, it was a decidedly less flashy Mr. Hana who appeared before a judge in Federal District Court in Manhattan this past week, dressed in a baggy blue shirt and slacks.
He was released the same day after securing a $ 5 million bond -- and agreeing to wear a GPS monitoring device.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chart a 10-mile path down the Miami coast, and the options for luxury shopping are endless. But from Fendi to Missoni to Porsche to Bentley, the branded products many shoppers are buying aren't items you can take home. They are homes.
Branded real estate is surging: The market for name-brand luxury condominium units is projected to grow 12 percent each year between now and 2026, according to a report from the global real estate consultants, Knight Frank. Like blue jean makers and handbag designers, developers have long understood the power of a label, and today in nearly every major city, homeowners can shop residences from well-known hospitality brands like Four Seasons, Aman and Ritz-Carlton. Now more surprising brands are getting in on the trend, with purveyors of both luxury cars and couture looking to condos for their next frontier.
In Sunny Isles Beach, a sleepy, resort-heavy city within Miami-Dade County, the towers with boldfaced names include a Porsche Design Tower, Residences by Armani Casa and the forthcoming Bentley Residences, which by 2026 will stretch toward the sky with an exterior of recessed glass in Bentley's signature diamond-in-diamond quilted design, instantly recognizable to devotees of the British automaker.
All of them were the brainchild of the same man: Gil Dezer, who for more than a decade has been quietly betting on this moment, expanding his brand partnerships as Miami's housing values climbed. "The car brands of today want to be not just car brands, but also lifestyle brands as well," said Mr. Dezer, who partnered with Porsche in 2012. "The same goes for everything from golf clubs to sunglasses. And we were fortunate enough to be able to get in on it for real estate."
Mr. Dezer's father, Michael Dezer, is the founder of Dezer Development, the South Florida-based real estate giant that owns nine towers on nearly 30 oceanfront acres of Miami. He is also a fervid car collector, with at least 1,800 vehicles -- many of them housed in a privately owned museum. The younger Mr. Dezer, whose own 32-car collection is significantly more modest, joined the company nearly three decades ago, ready to take his place at the altar of a church that prayed to two gods: real estate and automobiles.
While Armani is slightly out of their comfort zone, auto-branded buildings made sense for the company. The Dezers are also well versed in branded real estate. Gil Dezer was the first developer to license Donald Trump's name, and Dezer Development eventually built six Trump-branded towers. He's open in his support for the former president and even held his 2007 wedding ceremony at Mar-a-Lago. But in the early 2010s, the company shifted gears, announcing a licensing agreement with Porsche -- the company's first.
Mr. Dezer knew that for the project to be a success, he'd have to think outside of the box.
"Porsche doesn't exactly correlate with real estate," Mr. Dezer said.
The building, which broke ground in 2014 and opened in 2017, has the same sleek, souped-up masculine energy of the car shows Mr. Dezer frequented as a child with his father. There is no dedicated pedestrian access. Visitors arrive beneath a graphite-hued archway bearing the words "Porsche Design" in the automaker's trademark 911 Porscha font. They can park and enter the airy lobby done up in the same bronze, red and black of Porsche's logo, or continue in their vehicles into the building's patented car elevator, called the Dezervator, which whisks both cars and drivers up 60 stories to units with sky-high garages.
That elevator -- which deposits cars behind a glass wall in front of each unit -- is "a highlight" of the building, said Stefan Buescher, the chief executive of Porsche Lifestyle Group, in a statement. "It was a natural continuation to transfer our unique design principles to the world of real estate," he said.
Mr. Dezer spent $ 480 million to build the Porsche Design Tower, where 132 units run between $ 4 and $ 32 million. Ten percent of his outlay, he estimates, was on the production of the Dezervator alone. He calls it money well spent.
"I initially did it because I thought, 'How cool would it be to have your Porsche or your Lamborghini or Bugatti in your living room?"' he said. "But what really happened is people starting buying units for the privacy. Because if you live in a condo, especially if you're famous, the most annoying thing is driving through the front entrance or dealing with the valet. We avoided that."
Brand recognition sealed the deal for Juan Pablo Verdiquio, 46, a Miami-based real estate developer who moved into a three-bedroom unit in the Porsche Design Tower in 2017. He now counts Lionel Messi, as well as Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, among his neighbors. As someone who owns a few Porsche cars -- he drives a Taycan; his wife prefers a Panamera Turbo -- he felt this condo purchase came with a preapproved stamp of quality in Miami's crowded market.
"There are thousands of new apartments built each year here, so going with a brand I knew felt like a way to preserve the long-term value," said Mr. Verdiquio. "From a financial sense, I really liked that it was branded with Porsche."
Carlos Rosso, a luxury Miami developer, said that home buyers are increasingly embracing logic like Mr. Verdiquio when buying real estate, elevating the power of legacy brands that cross over into the residential space.
"We are all in the same market for buyers, and we are all trying to differentiate our products," he said. "Every residential building needs to tell a story, and branding is a way to not have to explain what a building is all about. You're associating yourself with a brand that's already familiar."
As the head of Rosso Development, Mr. Rosso is currently focused on The Standard Residences, Midtown Miami, a 12-story condominium tower looking to lure buyers by tapping the unabashedly rakish vibe of the Standard Hotels, perhaps best known for their West Hollywood iteration, where lithe, spray-tanned models lounged in a plexiglass box behind the front desk.
In 2014, Mr. Rosso also partnered with Mr. Dezer on Residences by Armani Casa, a 56-story condo tower just a stone's throw from the Porsche Design Tower. The building opened in December 2019. Giorgio Armani himself designed the tapestries, textiles and hand-selected the furnishings, and the result is an extreme yin to Porsche's yang. Whereas the Porsche Design Tower has a millionaire-meets-man-cave vibe, all sharp edges and bold primary hues, Residences by Armani Casa is feminine and lush, with muted floral wallpaper and curved furnishings in taupe and gold.
Now Mr. Dezer is turning his attention to Bentley Residences Miami, scheduled to break ground later this year on the site of Miami's Thunderbird Motel, which was built in the 1950s and was demolished in June. The 62-story oceanfront building, he said, will take the amenities offered in the Porsche Design Tower and supercharge them: There will be four Dezervator elevators, garages that can house three or four cars and private outdoor swimming pools attached to each of the 216 units. Ocean-view residences will also have outdoor showers. Common spaces will include a Macallan Whisky Bar, a restaurant by Todd English, and a cigar lounge. Units are priced between $ 5.5 million and $ 35 million.
"People are looking for something unique," said Ian Reisner, vice president of Dezer Development. "There's not a million Porsches up and down the block -- there's only one. Now we're going to do even better with Bentley."
For serious car collectors looking to translate horse power to housing, Miami offers other options. In downtown Miami, the 391-unit Aston Martin Residences, currently under construction and scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, is nearly completely sold out.
The 66-story tower is shaped like a gleaming curved sail, with units starting at $ 6.5 million and climbing to $ 59 million for the triplex penthouse, which comes with your very own Aston Martin Vulcan, a rare $ 2.3-million hypercar. The building, which calls itself "A car made into a skyscraper" on its website, is meant to embody a timeless, James Bond-approved, zeitgeist. When it opens, said the developer, German Coto, "It will be appreciated by those who value a unique luxury lifestyle."
Miami is the current epicenter of crossover luxury branded real estate: In addition to Porsche, Bentley, Armani and Aston Martin, there's a 58-unit Fendi Chateau building tucked between Miami Beach and Sunny Isles in Surfside; the Missoni Baia residences, offering 249 units ranging from one-bedrooms to five-bedrooms, opened earlier this year on a colorful, resort-like campus overlooking Biscayne Bay.
But the movement is global. Overlooking the Persian Gulf on Jumeira Bay Island in Dubai, the Bulgari Lighthouse -- a whitewashed 27-story tower with a branched, undulating facade meant to imitate coral -- is under development from the luxury watchmaker. Lamborghini, whose first attempt at branded residential property in Dubai never got off the ground, is now in the construction fast lane, with planned developments in Egypt, Brazil, China and Spain. The Lebanese fashion designer Elie Saab, known for his slinky, ethereal evening gowns, has put his stamp on residences in London and Dubai, and the house of Karl Lagerfeld, who single-handedly defined some of fashion's most recognizable iconography of the 20th century, is translating his eye for design into five villas on Marbella's Golden Mile.
All of these developments, said Clelia Warburg Peters, managing partner of Era Ventures, a tech-based real estate venture fund, are name-brand playgrounds for the wealthy, and we should expect to see more of them as the housing market remains tight.
"We're living in a new Gilded Age and there's a lot of rich people," she said. "In the past, the primary way to differentiate high-end assets was with location. But there are only so many truly prime locations."
Developers, she said, shouldn't be surprised if more nontraditional brands try to inch their way into the residential real estate space in the near future, as well.
"I don't think anyone wants to live in the Coca-Cola building," Ms. Peters said. "But would I be surprised if Restoration Hardware brought out their own line of homes? Absolutely not. This is one of the most significant areas of growth in the real estate industry."

4th Leader Pleads Guilty In FTX Case: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive, pleaded guilty to charges linked to the sweeping fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange.
Ryan Salame, a former top executive at the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, pleaded guilty on Thursday to criminal charges linked to the sweeping fraud case against FTX's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, a move that raises the pressure on Mr. Bankman-Fried ahead of his trial next month.
In a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Salame pleaded guilty to a campaign finance law violation and a charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.
Mr. Salame said he had made millions in political contributions at the direction of Mr. Bankman-Fried. The contributions were labeled loans from FTX's sister company, the crypto hedge fund Alameda Research.
"I understood that the loans would eventually be forgiven, and that I would never have to repay them," Mr. Salame said. Asked whether he was pleading guilty to the counts, he said, "Yes, Your Honor."
Mr. Salame (pronounced SALEM), who appeared in court in a blue suit, a striped tie and blue socks designed with orange Bitcoin logos, will pay a $ 6 million fine and more than $ 5 million in restitution to FTX, and will forfeit two properties in Lenox, Mass., along with a Porsche automobile. He could be sentenced to up to 10 years in a federal prison.
Mr. Salame, 30, who ran FTX's subsidiary in the Bahamas and was a prolific donor to Republican politicians, is the fourth executive in Mr. Bankman-Fried's circle of close advisers to admit to criminal conduct since FTX collapsed in November. Three others -- Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang -- have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate against Mr. Bankman-Fried. A representative for federal prosecutors said Mr. Salame was not cooperating with the investigation.
FTX filed for bankruptcy last year in a stunning collapse that has become a symbol of crypto industry hubris. With the help of Mr. Salame, Mr. Bankman-Fried had turned FTX into a household name, endorsed by celebrities and politicians. Then the company imploded over a few days, and customers lost more than $ 8 billion in deposits.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, 31, was arrested in December and charged with seven criminal counts, including wire fraud and securities fraud. He is accused of using billions of dollars in FTX's customer funds to finance lavish real estate purchases, political donations and investments in other companies.
He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 3. Last month, Mr. Bankman-Fried's bail was revoked and he was sent to jail after a judge ruled that he had twice tried to interfere with witnesses in the case.
A spokesman for Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Mr. Salame's illegal campaign contributions had been part of an unlawful political influence campaign that "helped FTX grow faster and larger by operating outside of the law."
Mr. Salame's lawyer, Jason Linder, said, "Ryan looks forward to putting this chapter behind him and moving forward with his life."
Mr. Salame also took part in a scheme that enabled FTX to take money from U.S. customers through accounts that Alameda had with a few U.S. banks, according to the charging document. The accounts were opened as trading accounts and were not approved to accept deposits from crypto customers.
For years, Mr. Salame was one of Mr. Bankman-Fried's top advisers. A native of the Berkshires, Mr. Salame started working at Alameda, which Mr. Bankman-Fried ran in Hong Kong at the time. When Mr. Bankman-Fried moved FTX to the Bahamas, Mr. Salame was the point person who communicated with the local government.
As FTX grew, Mr. Salame became one of crypto's wealthiest executives and used some of his wealth to buy popular restaurants in the Berkshires. He received $ 87 million in bonuses and loans from Alameda, according to court records, and was known for his taste for private jets and expensive cars.
Mr. Salame also became active in the Washington political scene, styling himself as a "budding Republican megadonor." He donated $ 24 million in the 2022 midterm elections, mostly to Republicans, and started dating Michelle Bond, a crypto lobbyist who made a losing bid for Congress as a Republican from Long Island, N.Y.
The implosion of Mr. Bankman-Fried's business turned Mr. Salame into a target for federal prosecutors. In April, the F.B.I. searched the Potomac, Md., home he shared with Ms. Bond. Agents seized phones belonging to Mr. Salame and Ms. Bond.
Mr. Salame was also directly implicated in the charges against Mr. Bankman-Fried. In legal documents, prosecutors have claimed that Mr. Bankman-Fried enlisted his executives in a "straw donor" scheme to avoid limits on campaign contributions. They said Mr. Bankman-Fried had recruited the executives as proxies to donate tens of millions of dollars to both parties, effectively on behalf of the company. A revised indictment against Mr. Bankman-Fried identified Mr. Salame's donations as part of the scheme.
Prosecutors eventually dropped the campaign finance charge against Mr. Bankman-Fried, citing procedural issues with his extradition from the Bahamas. But in a court filing last month, the prosecutors said they would use the campaign finance allegations to support the other charges that Mr. Bankman-Fried faces.

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

This Tank Is Very Old, But Ukraine Believes It Can Be Very Useful: [Correction]

Author: Schuetze, Christopher F

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Cold War-era Leopard 1A5 may be old, but it is still effective, Germany says. The country is now training Ukrainian troops to operate the weapons.
Their old diesel engines roaring, the Cold War-era battle tanks bobbed through the verdant Germany countryside as the Ukrainian commander radioed an order to his unit to fire. The gunners' task was to aim and shoot the 105-millimeter cannon at green pop-up targets as far as 1,500 yards away.
"Fifteen of 17 is a very good result," said Lt. Col. Marco Maulbecker, who oversees the tank training, referring to the number of targets hit by the crews on the first attempt. "Now we have to work on getting those targets faster."
The exercise -- a coordinated attack -- was the culmination of a six-week course for the Ukrainians on how to use one of the latest additions to their country's wartime arsenal -- the Leopard 1A5s, the decommissioned German-made battle tanks that Germany and its NATO allies promised to Kyiv early this year after weeks of hesitation.
At the time, Germany was criticized for its dithering when it came to sending German-made tanks to Ukraine. The reluctance reflected Germany's ambivalence about taking a military leadership role in Europe after World War II, but also the burdens on a German military that was chronically underfunded.
After the United States and other allies said they would send tanks, too, Germany agreed to send up to 18 modern Leopard 2A6 battle tanks to Ukraine. But ultimately, the bulk of its commitment -- more than 100 additional tanks -- were an obsolete model, the Leopard 1A5, the first 10 of which arrived in Ukraine last month.
The Leopard 1A5 is so old, in fact, that the German trainers had to rely on soldiers from the Dutch and Danish armies -- where the model was used for longer -- and former German tank drivers who trained back in the 1980s and 1990s. The last time the German army actually taught recruits on the system was in 2000.
Some of the trainers were civilians in their 50s or 60s who took a break from their day jobs to help. "They were really important in getting us going from a cold start," said Colonel Maulbecker, who normally commands a battalion of modern tanks.
Despite its age, some experts and German officials say the Leopard 1A5 can be a useful stopgap. Its modern descendant, the Leopard 2A6, is vastly more expensive and even the small number donated to Ukraine had to be taken directly from the ranks of the German military, where the tanks are badly needed.
And just because the Leopard 1A5 is old does not mean that it can't be effective, once the decommissioned stock is refurbished. It is comparable with but superior to the Soviet-built T-72 tanks, which Ukrainian forces also use.
It has night-vision capability, a weapons stabilization system and it can drive backward, which cannot be said for all of the older battle tanks currently seeing action in Ukraine, according to Lt. Gen. Andreas Marlow, who oversees Germany's training program for the Ukrainians.
When the tank is used in the right context and on the right terrain, it can be highly effective in combat, said General Marlow, who was trained on the tanks as a young soldier.
Despite being generations behind the modern tanks Kyiv had asked for, the Leopard 1A5 has other advantages: It is easier to master, maintain and fix, and, General Marlow said, "Quantity plays a role, too."
Given its slow planning and underfunding, the German army really had no other option when it came to donating significant number of tanks, noted Christian Mölling, a military expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
"Those Leopard 1 tanks are really not a bad option," he said.
Many of the tanks had sat unused in warehouses around Europe until the German government gave the approval earlier this year for them to be donated to Ukraine. They were bought up by arms manufacturers, who are refurbishing the tanks at the expense of Germany and its allies.
Large spray-painted numbers identify the tanks, whose years of wear and decades of storage are evident from their scratches and dents. The insulation on the barrel of one of the tanks shown on a recent tour of the training area was held together by zip ties.
The Leopard 1A5 was an upgrade of older Leopard tank models, some of which were built as early as the 1960s, designed by a consortium that included Porsche. They were converted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, just as the German army was shrinking following the end of the Cold War.
The recent training, held at a former East German army base in Klietz, just 30 miles from what was the NATO border during the Cold War, is a key part of the European Union's military assistance to Ukraine.
Germany, which is the second biggest donor of direct military aid to Ukraine, has trained 6,300 of the 10,000 Ukrainian troops it plans to train this year. The courses include infantry, sharpshooting, artillery and operating the various major weapon systems that Germany has provided. The German commitment is part of an E.U. program that aims to train 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers by end of next year.
In the current session, the Ukrainian tank commander was identified only by his call sign, Bassist, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocols. He said he wasn't surprised when he saw older men among his trainers.
"In the end, if someone is a professional, it doesn't matter how old he is," he said.
The refurbished tanks that he and his colleagues trained on -- a single cohort consists of roughly 50 soldiers and their commanders -- were brought to Klietz by the Danes, who also cofinanced the donation of the Leopard 1A5s. Another 132 tanks, including specialized Leopard 1A5s used for salvage and instruction, will be sent to Ukraine in the coming year.
"Ukraine cannot grant us more than six weeks of training for understandable reasons, and we just try to make the best of it," General Marlow said.
That means the Ukrainian tank crews train six days a week, but they hardly seemed to mind.
"It's safe place and it's quiet," Bassist said after climbing out of the tank. "Just what you need when learning."

Full text: For around 14 years, the Detroit hardcore collective has kept its members' identities secret. For "Perfect Saviors," it's breaking with its longtime sound -- and opening up.
There are bands that are challenging to get into, and then there is the Armed.
The Detroit-based punk outfit has operated largely pseudonymously for roughly 14 years, preferring renegade one-off shows at gas stations or rec centers to tours. Its self-produced, highly weird music videos have a "Jackass"-meets-David Lynch aesthetic, with surprisingly advanced production values for an obscure Midwestern hardcore group. Its rare interviews read more as absurdist gonzo journalism than traditional profiles: The Armed has shown up with blunt-smoking bodybuilders or driving a $ 200,000 Porsche, handed out false or even stolen identities, and provided Hegelian philosophical tangents in response to basic questions like, "Who, exactly, is in the Armed?"
For the better part of the group's history, keeping the answer to that question as obscure as possible has been part of the point. The Armed considers itself more of a collective or an art project than a band, with dozens of rotating members. The goal was to tamp down their egos and refocus the audience's attention on the music, which has been about as challenging to understand as their identities: blast beats, screeching guitars, screaming vocalists and layer upon layer of dense, maximalist and oftentimes dissonant noise rock.
Now, the Armed has a grand opportunity to capitalize on its years of toiling in relative obscurity. Modern, guitar-heavy rock is going through something of a renaissance, with young people looking to packed clubs and circle pits to find the type of release that no Zoom call could provide. Harder acts like Scowl, Gel and Zulu are thriving, and Turnstile, the Baltimore-based hardcore group, has found a way to bridge hardcore to the mainstream.
So members of the Armed are doing what might be their most punk-rock move yet: revealing themselves and taking a hard-right turn away from their signature sound. The result is a larger-than-life, anthemic stadium rock album due Friday called "Perfect Saviors," a near-complete break from their past that will likely alienate some of their biggest fans. But for those who know them well, it is a classic Armed move.
"A lot of what we're doing was a function of everyone in the hardcore scene hating us," Randall Lee, 39, one of the four core members of the band, said in a recent interview. (The others are Kenny Szymanski, 34; Dan Greene, 35; and Tony Wolski, 38.) "We weren't touring, and we got a lot of [expletive] for it from the gate-keeping crowd, so we made our own scene."
For years, many thought the group was secretly run by Kurt Ballou, a revered record producer and guitarist from the hardcore band Converge. Others believed it was backed by the skateboarding legend Tony Hawk.
Much of the group's lore centered around a persona called Dan Greene -- based on the actual band member Dan Greene, who is preternaturally shy and preferred to stay out of the limelight. Greene was portrayed publicly by Trevor Naud, a longtime friend and collaborator, while the real Greene worked largely in the background, providing elements of potential song ideas to other band members who would build on them to produce full-length tracks. Greene works a day job stocking shelves at Meijer, a Midwestern grocery chain, though he also hid in plain sight: He was photographed and placed on the cover of one of the band's early albums, "Untitled."
Some of the other members of the band began calling themselves "Dan Greene" in press interviews; fans started calling themselves "Daniels."
"It's an exquisite corpse of a band," Naud said, referencing the Surrealist parlor game of making artistic works out of disparate, oftentimes contradictory pieces.
If the music turned on new listeners, the saga of Dan Greene and the music videos hooked them in. Naud became something of an avatar for the entire group, often playing a disaffected man trying to break out of corporate life, or running into crowded bars with a hacked-together karaoke system strapped to his back and screaming his lungs out. The Armed pulled in the voice actor David Hayter, who played Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series, in one of its most Lynchian visual pieces, for the single "An Iteration."
"Everything is art-forward with them," said Troy Van Leeuwen, a multi-instrumentalist for Queens of the Stone Age who acted as "guitar czar" on the Armed's two most recent albums. (Ben Chisholm, a producer and frequent Armed collaborator, passed him some early demos.) "They were mysterious, super impressive and what they were doing would just suck you in."
Much of the skill put into polishing the Armed's slick-looking videos stems from its adjacency to Worldfare, a production company created and run by multiple band members. Six partners, including Wolski -- the charismatic frontman who is ostensibly the band's leader, as much as the Armed can even have one -- built Worldfare into a creative studio housed inside a 5,000-square-foot, three-story mansion near downtown Detroit. The compound has floors dedicated to filming, editing and entertaining, and a basement converted into a band practice and recording space. Worldfare has done advertising work with clients as big as Ford and McDonald's, as well as video shoots for bands like Tegan and Sara, Metz and Converge.
The Armed's fourth and biggest album yet arrived in 2021: "Ultrapop," a cultural critique on how subversiveness itself has been subsumed into modern pop culture. "When you can buy a skull T-shirt at Walmart, how subversive is that?" Wolski asked. "When Black Flag tattoos have been commoditized and made into an aesthetic, what even is punk anymore?"
To make their point, band members spent time during Covid lockdowns trimming down and bulking up, altering their diets and bodies to align with the maximalist sound of the record. Lee, the longhaired, Viking-sized guitarist and vocalist, shed 100 pounds to maintain a six-pack. Along with Wolski and his cousin Szymanski, who plays bass in the group, Lee hired a professional nutritionist; Wolski now subscribes to a mail-away chicken service and eats at least five meals a day of lean protein. Buzz began circulating after the group showed off its new look at the Pitchfork Festival in 2022 backed by Cara Drolshagen -- a longtime collaborator and the band's screamer-in-chief -- and two carbon copies of her, all made up in Juggalo face paint.
For "Perfect Saviors," the band is unmasking even further. Wolski and others sat down with the Fader writer Dan Ozzi and introduced some of the group's newer additions, like the saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi and the drummer Urian Hackney of Rough Francis.
"We wanted to be a reliable narrator for this album," Wolski said. "We really believe in this. There's no 'wink' in it." He said he thought the band was becoming a "mystery to be solved," distracting people from actually caring about the music.
Fans are still working their way through what it means to know the actual identities of the Armed -- even if some of them don't fully believe it. (A LexisNexis search for Wolski returned a phone number matching the cellphone he used when communicating for this profile.)
That lack of certainty, it turns out, collides with some of the central themes of "Perfect Saviors." Wolski noted how confusing the world has grown in an age of continuous connection; how information overload has made people stupid; and how social media's need for us to constantly perform turns everyone into celebrities. "Our world is confounding and terrifying because of all of this, but it is still beautiful," he added.
The result is the group's most polished -- and likely most accessible -- record to date. "Sport of Form," the album's lead single, features heavy synths and harmonies interspersed with gentle acoustic guitars and a guest spot from Julien Baker, of boygenius fame. (Iggy Pop stops by to play the role of "God" in the music video.) There are even piano solos and ballads.
"They have this subversive plan to absolutely steamroll their way through conventions," noted Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Nine Inch Nails, M83), who played bass on a handful of the new tracks.
But Wolski and company still don't want to fully escape their roots. Before setting out on tour supporting Queens of the Stone Age in early August, the Armed sent out a notice to its loyal devotees: The group was throwing one last renegade, unlicensed house show at a secret location in a Detroit suburb, free of charge.
More than a hundred fans packed into a century-old, three-story mansion in Detroit's Boston-Edison district 10 days later as the Armed played a blistering half-hour set inside a living room. The crowd was a mass of young, sweating bodies, moshing and crowd-surfing while trying to avoid kicking out the light fixtures on the ceiling.
Jezzy Maloney, a 24-year-old Detroit native, knew she had to attend the show after diving into the band's catalog and embracing its buff makeover last year.
"Literally the day after I watched that video, I started going to the gym again," she said of "All Futures." At the house show, Maloney and five others got tattoos of the Armed's logo -- an angular play on an infinity symbol -- in a parlor room adjacent to where the band was playing. They left at five o'clock in the morning the next day.
"There's just nothing like them that I've ever encountered," Maloney added. "It really has changed my life."

Full text: Friday
5:30 p.m. | Rev around town
Hop on the back of a motorbike for a whirlwind street food tour with XO Tours, in which the expert, female driver-guides in traditional áo dài tunics navigate through five of the city's 24 districts. The tours steer clear of the conventional banh mi and pho, instead rolling up for dishes like grilled goat at a hot-pot hub in District 8, and scallops on the half shell in the boisterous seafood street in District 4 (XO Foodie Tour, 1,872,000 Vietnamese dong, or about $ 79). Or head on your own to District 10's Ho Thi Ky food street, a long and narrow lane with carts serving dishes like sticky rice cooked in a bamboo branch, and bot chien, fried rice-flour cakes with egg (street-food dishes, 15,000 to 35,000 dong).
10 p.m. | Try a sphere cocktail
Find passionate Vietnamese mixologists in leather aprons using fire, foam and liquid nitrogen at Summer Experiment, the softly lit cocktail bar three stories up in an old apartment building in District 1, the central area with many major tourist attractions, including the nearby Reunification Palace. Try the Heaven Tears, a jiggly sphere that explodes in the mouth with vodka, melon purée and mint (100,000 dong). And ask for one of the homegrown gins like Song Cai, Lady Trieu or Ve de di in the Spiced Plummy Gimlet, blended with a local plum spirit and rimmed with a chili shrimp salt (180,000 dong). If you hear music on the way back down, follow it to COI Saigon (one floor below), which often has free live jazz on weekends until 11 p.m.
Saturday
9 a.m. | Count the Buddhas
At the end of a lane in the Cholon area, or Chinatown, is one of the city's most astonishing Buddhist temples: Chua Van Phat, the Ten Thousand Buddha Temple. Climb the stairs to the fourth floor and step into a gilded, towering chamber lorded over by a 23-foot tall Buddha in a gold robe, serenely seated on a lotus flower. Little Buddha statues sit on each of the sculpture's 1,000 gold-painted petals, and in the thousands of niches in the walls up to the ceiling. Locals kneel and pray, incense wafts and a robed devotee chants and taps a wooden drum and singing bowl. If you encounter the temple's head monk, Thich Truyen Cuong, he may answer your questions about the upper chamber's decade-long construction. Admission free; donations welcome.
11 a.m. | Trace history in a cafe
Have a coffee break steeped in history at Ca Phe Do Phu in the Tan Dinh neighborhood in District 1. During what the Vietnamese call the American War, communist operatives for the north plotted undercover in haunts and homes across Saigon, as the city was then named (many locals still refer to it as such), like this wooden shophouse. Order a coffee with condensed milk (30,000 dong) or a tea with canned peach wedges (40,000 dong) and climb the ladderlike steps to a room with wartime artifacts like transistor radios and American munitions boxes. Opposite an ornamented family altar stands a wooden closet with a drop panel concealing a ladder that led to tunnels. Under a floor plank, you'll find dangling metal cans that once held cash and documents to be secreted north via the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
1 p.m. | Have a vegetarian lunch
Many Buddhists in Vietnam turn vegetarian each month on the 1st and 15th days of the lunar calendar, but a number of new plant-based restaurants are serving innovative takes on ancestral dishes daily. One standout is Hum Cafe & Restaurant, which opened its three-story, villa-like space with wooden ceilings, lotus flowers and brightly colored drapes, in District 3 in 2012. The thinly sliced and fried lotus root with sesame salt (160,000 dong) are as addictive as potato chips, and don't miss the winged bean salad with tofu (200,000 dong), the skillet of banana flower in a tomato sauce (190,000 dong), and mango with sticky rice for dessert (80,000 dong).
3 p.m. | Browse painted dresses
Visitors with an impulse to shop often head straight to Dong Khoi, one of the oldest streets in the city and a hub of fashionable boutiques like Gia Studios, Lam Boutique and Ha Linh Thu House of Silk. But you can also find hidden gems across the city including Tiny Ink, a small boutique at the end of an alley in District 1. A regular on the runway at Vietnam International Fashion Week, the brand is the creation of the designer Hoang Quyen. The boutique displays an explosion of brightly colored gowns and dresses made with silk, satin and organza fabric, and hand painted with floral art and abstract splashes (dresses range from 3.5 million to 24 million dong).
6 p.m. | Opt for fine dining
When the Michelin Guide debuted in Vietnam in June, Ho Chi Minh City netted just a single star, for Anan Saigon, a restaurant that opened in 2017 and transforms classic dishes into contemporary triumphs, like a bone marrow pho with Wagyu beef. The Michelin guide recommended 55 restaurants in the city, including Nen Light. Opened in 2022 in District 1 and set in an intimate, single room with black ceilings and dark cloths on the eight tables, the restaurant serves creative Vietnamese dishes with seasonal produce. Highlights of a recent nine-course "Journey" menu (about 2.6 million dong, minus alcohol pairing; reservations recommended) included a dollop of minced river eel and roe in a bouquet of sliced plum, and slow-cooked duck from the north with vegetable purée and purple rice.
8:30 p.m. | Stroll the center
The city is hardly known for pleasant strolls, given that sidewalks double as motorbike parking lots, and even as ad hoc traffic lanes. But you can find entertaining people-watching on Nguyen Hue Street, a half-mile pedestrian boulevard surrounded by French Colonial landmarks and the Saigon River. Start at the top in the glow of the grand People's Committee headquarters, then continue through the Le Loi intersection for a view of the palatial Saigon Opera House. Head toward the gleaming towers and the river, wading through the chattering couples and families noshing dried squid or cotton candy, and stopping to join the crowds encircling people crooning ballads or dancing for TikTok videos. Pull up tyke-size plastic stools for a coconut ice cream (15,000 dong) from a cart and watch young locals play da cau, a game that involves kicking a weighted shuttlecock high into the air.
10 p.m. | Head to a hipster street
One of the city's trendiest nightlife enclaves is Pham Viet Chanh Street in the Binh Thanh District, a gritty quarter crammed with eateries and drinking spots in narrow shophouses that has mushroomed from a couple of bars less than a decade ago. If you still have a taste for dessert, try the caramelized fried bread with cinnamon ice cream (100,000 dong) at Captain Phook. Then head across to Nong Trai Khoai, where vintage shop meets dive bar, to try a beer cocktail (70,000 dong) mixed with a brew from Quy Nhon, a coastal city in Central Vietnam, and passion fruit from Dalat, in the mountains. At RetroSaigon you'll find a multistory warren with a wood-paneled karaoke lounge and a dimly lit rooftop. Drink in the District 2 skyline with a Mangotango, a cocktail with fresh mango, rum and coconut (179,000 dong).
Sunday
9:30 a.m. | See a museum on war
The abandoned and captured U.S. tanks, planes and helicopters displayed on the grounds of the War Remnants Museum (admission, 40,000 dong) is the first indication that the victors will be telling the story of the wars in Vietnam. The museum is filled with photographs depicting the brutalities that the French and later the Americans committed in their losing campaigns against the Vietnamese. In addition to photos of rows of bodies in open pits, burning villages and instruments of torture, the harrowing displays are heavy on graphic shots of Vietnamese deformed by U.S. chemicals like Agent Orange, with hardly any mention of the atrocities the North and South committed against each other. The museum can trigger a surge of emotions, especially for visiting American veterans, who, 50 years after the United States pulled combat troops out of Vietnam, mostly are in their 70s.
11:30 a.m. | Relax in comfort
The Thao Dien area, across the river from the Binh Thanh District, is home to forests of condo and commercial high rises. Popular with expats and affluent Vietnamese, the area has all the accouterments of the city's upturn, from chic boutiques to gourmet eateries. For brunch, visit Laang, a stylish, vegetarian-friendly Vietnamese restaurant that may be a welcomed alternative to the multitude of uncomfortably warm, open-air eateries. You can't go wrong with a platter of wraps and rolls, including succulent grilled chicken and veggies wrapped in fresh leaves (239,000 dong), sweet and savory grilled eggplant stuffed with shiitake mushrooms (109,000 dong) and the refreshing pomelo, lime and butterfly pea juice (79,000 dong).
1:30 p.m. | Buy souvenirs
A short walk from Laang brings you to OHQUAO Concept Store, the brainchild of Simon Phan and Hoa Pham, who created the space for local artists to sell alternative souvenirs to the typical lacquer bowls and conical hats found in tourist markets. Mr. Phan designs cartoonish magnets with quips like "Falling Pho You" (110,000 dong) and illustrated greeting cards (80,000 dong). Their Thao Dien store, which opened in 2022, is filled with products by dozens of local artists, including funky T-shirts (530,000 dong) and hats (430,000 dong) from the Saigon designer Dang Khim's street fashion brand easybadwork; as well as Ruou Can Y Mien fermented rice alcohol (630,000 dong), Lacaph coffee (from 190,000 dong), both from the Central Highlands; and a wide selection of art prints (150,00 to 300,000 dong).
2:30 p.m. | Tour a gallery
If you have time for one last stop, see what's on at the Lotus Gallery in District 7, a fast-developing area of wide boulevards and glossy malls, universities and condo complexes. The long-established private gallery moved into a new warehouse-like space in 2022, just down the road from the Mercedes and Porsche dealerships. Exhibits rotate every couple of months and center on Vietnamese themes, like the "Soul of the Street" show (through Aug. 31), which features works by 10 artists that include watercolors of fish markets and oil paintings of cyclo pedalers. Admission is free.

Testimony Rejects Claims Of Wrongdoing by Bidens: [National Desk]

Full text: The testimony of Devon Archer, a Hunter Biden associate, paints an unflattering portrait of Hunter's business dealings, but contradicts reports of bribes or material involvement by the president.
Republicans who for months have accused President Biden without proof of crime and corruption thought that a former business partner of his son's could be the key to finally substantiating their most serious allegations.
"Hunter's ex-business partner, Devon Archer, could blow the lid off Joe Biden's phony claims of innocence," blared an email on Friday from former President Donald J. Trump's campaign.
Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky, told Fox News that Mr. Archer could become a "hero" of the House G.O.P.'s investigation into what they call the "Biden crime family," delivering the damning evidence they need to impeach Mr. Biden.
But the testimony this week of Mr. Archer, a former Yale lacrosse player who has been convicted of federal tax charges, fell well short of that, shooting down a bribery allegation Republicans have long promoted and generally rejecting the idea that the elder Mr. Biden had any material involvement in his son's business dealings. It was the latest instance of House Republicans promising far more than they could produce in terms of proof of their allegations against the president.
"Are you aware of any wrongdoing by Vice President Biden?" Mr. Archer's lawyer asked him at one point during the closed-door testimony before the House oversight committee, a transcript of which was released on Thursday.
"No, I'm not aware of any," Mr. Archer replied.
Mr. Archer offered a wholly unflattering portrait of the actions of Mr. Biden's son Hunter, providing an account that raised ethical questions about the way he conducted business. It also suggested questionable judgment on the part of President Biden, who, according to Mr. Archer's testimony, repeatedly allowed himself to be in the presence -- either physically or by phone -- of business associates of his son's who were apparently seeking connections and influence inside the United States government.
But the elder Mr. Biden never actually got involved, he told the panel.
In particular, Mr. Archer debunked an anonymous, unverified allegation that Republicans have trumpeted for months that Mr. Biden, while vice president, and Hunter Biden each accepted a $ 5 million bribe from an official with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.
Mr. Archer, who sat on the Burisma board along with Hunter Biden and handled his payments from the company, told lawmakers that he had never heard of any such transaction, and said the claims were most likely false boasting.
That testimony was consistent with evidence put forth recently from Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who served as the personal lawyer to Mr. Trump and who was assigned to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine.
House Democrats released an interview Mr. Parnas conducted with Mykola Zlochevsky during his investigation in which the Burisma co-founder wrote in all caps: "NO ONE FROM BURISMA EVER HAD ANY CONTACTS WITH VP BIDEN OR PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM DURING HUNTER BIDEN'S ENGAGEMENT."
Mr. Archer also undercut another Republican argument that the elder Mr. Biden had pressured Ukrainian officials in 2016 to fire Viktor Shokin, the former prosecutor general of Ukraine, because he was investigating the company.
On the contrary, Mr. Archer said, he heard from associates in D.C., that Burisma had Mr. Shokin "under control" and that his replacement could be more damaging to the company.
Although Mr. Archer's testimony did not live up to Republican expectations, it also did not produce a clean political win for Democrats.
Mr. Archer testified that he could recall about 20 times when he and Hunter Biden were meeting with business associates, and Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone. The conversations, Mr. Archer said, were only about niceties -- "How's the weather? How's the fishing?" -- but he said the signal from Hunter Biden was clear.
"There was not business content in these conversations," Mr. Archer told the conservative pundit Tucker Carlson in an interview after his testimony. "The idea of signals and influence -- the prize is enough in speaking or hearing or knowing you have that proximity to power."
At one point, Mr. Archer told Mr. Carlson, "In the rearview, it's an abuse of soft power."
Mr. Archer also said he believed it was false for defenders of President Biden to say that he had no knowledge of his son's business activities. "He was aware of Hunter's business," said Mr. Archer, who played golf with both Bidens. "He met with Hunter's business partners."
Mr. Archer described the high-flying lifestyle he and Hunter Biden engaged in thanks to the wealth they had flowing in from overseas. He confirmed that he had received a wire from Kenes Rakishev, a Kazakh businessman, of $ 142,300 to pay for a pricey car for Hunter Biden.
"I believe it was a Fisker first and then a Porsche," Mr. Archer testified.
Mr. Archer also said he believed Burisma as a company stayed in business through tough times through its associations with influential figures in Washington, and the "brand" that Hunter Biden brought to the board.
Asked what he meant, Mr. Archer said, "Because people would be intimidated to mess with them."
He also said Hunter Biden attempted to get credit at Burisma when his father traveled to Ukraine as vice president.
"He was getting paid a lot of money, and I think, you know, he wanted to show value," Mr. Archer said, adding: "It's clear that he's not bringing his dad, but he's saying, you know, 'I'm going to get credit for it."'
Mr. Archer concluded that Hunter Biden was attempting to wield the appearance of influence beyond what he was actually delivering.
Asked by Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York, whether it was "fair to say that Hunter Biden was selling the illusion of access to his father," Mr. Archer responded, "Yes."

Full text: Friday
3:15 p.m. | Sail like a champ
Next to Bowen's Wharf, board a 12-meter America's Cup boat for a two-hour, family-friendly sail ( $ 90) up Narragansett Bay. The America's Cup Charters fleet includes the US 22 Intrepid, known for winning the cup in 1967 and 1970. Cruising through the harbor, you may spy a white egret coasting off the bow and catch a fishy whiff in the warm breeze. Guests can pitch in, taking the wheel or trimming the sails, or simply relax with a can of sparkling water. The knowledgeable crew sprinkles in tales about points of interest such as the 1870 Rose Island Lighthouse (where you can spend the night) and a red-roofed Victorian mansion where Jacqueline Bouvier grew up and where, in 1953, she and Senator John F. Kennedy held their wedding reception.
5:30 p.m. | Walk the wharf
Back on land, Bowen's Wharf and Bannister's Wharf mark the unofficial starting line for exploring Newport. Along the historic brick and granite quay, you'll find moored schooners, seafood restaurants and 18th-century buildings. Grab a stool at the oyster bar at Clarke Cooke House, built by a sea captain in 1780, and pair a glass of Sancerre with freshly shucked oysters ( $ 3.50 each) from Nova Scotia, Maine and Rhode Island. Make time to locate the first Rhode Island Slave History Medallion on the Chandlery building behind the Bowen's Wharf anchor, installed in 2020. Scan the QR code to read about the port's history as a major hub in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
6:30 p.m. | Enjoy a local feast
In a sea of tourist-driven fast-casual restaurants, Thames Street Kitchen is an ever-classy farm-to-table buoy. The chefs Tyler Burnley and Chad Hoffer take full advantage of the small-scale agriculture on Aquidneck Island (home to the towns of Portsmouth, Middletown and Newport), where farmers are known to deliver produce off the back of a moped. Reserve a seat in advance at the bar to watch supper being prepared in the open kitchen. Order warm salted bread with cacio e pepe butter ( $ 4) to soak up the yolky sauce of the cavatelli with serrano ham and ricotta ( $ 18). Early reservations also mean top pick of shareable cuts of rib eye and strip steak ( $ 3 an ounce).
8 p.m. | Raise a glass to the past
New bars seem to open with each regatta season, such as the speakeasy-styled Bar 12 and the tiki charmer Wharf Fish House. But the White Horse Tavern, a National Historic Landmark believed to be the oldest tavern still operating in the United States, is toasting its 350th anniversary. It was a meeting place of the colony's General Assembly and Criminal Court for nearly 100 years (and was also run for a time by a rich pirate). Under the big wood beams, patrons sip vanilla-infused, smoked old-fashioneds ( $ 17). Across from the tavern, in Liberty Square, a Newport Middle Passage monument has been proposed to honor the Africans who died on slave ships and the enslaved workers who helped build the city.
Saturday
10 a.m. | Learn the ropes
The Sailing Museum, which opened last year in the historic Armory building, is a high-tech interactive voyage. You'll design your own sailboat and race alongside fellow museumgoers. Exhibits cover ocean conservation and barrier-breaking seafarers like Bill Pinkney, the first African American to sail solo around the world, and Maureen McKinnon, the first woman to win gold in the Paralympic Sailing Olympics in 2008. Check out the America's Cup Hall of Fame, which displays models of the winning boats, and use the touch screen to discover sailing organizations nationwide.
11 a.m. | Explore on two wheels
The first national bike organization, the League of American Wheelmen, was born in Newport in 1880. Newport, which is mostly flat, remains a bike-friendly town, ideal for breezy cruising. Pick up a rental at Ten Speed Spokes, then pedal away from downtown and out along peaceful roads, past mansions and the Ida Lewis Yacht Club on Lime Rock, where Lewis, a lighthouse keeper, rowed out to rescue more than 18 people between 1842 and 1911, including soldiers from a nearby military compound, now Fort Adams State Park. Fort Adams, which offers expansive bay views and guided walking tours ( $ 20) and will celebrate its 200th anniversary next year, is home to the public sailing center Sail Newport and annual summer concerts like the Newport Folk Festival and Newport Jazz Festival.
Noon | Lunch on a lawn
Pedaling two miles past Fort Adams along Newport's bucolic southwestern edge, turn right at the sign for the Castle Hill Inn, built in 1875 as a summer home for the pioneering deep-sea oceanographer Alexander Agassiz. While locals prize the hotel's grassy knoll for sundowners, a midday reservation on the patio at the Lawn restaurant brings plenty of close-up boat watching. Enjoy Point Judith calamari ( $ 19) and a large gratin pan of rigatoni al forno ( $ 32) with eggplant confit, tomatoes, olives and goat cheese. If it rains, the floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining room beautifully frame Narragansett Bay. On a sunny day, recline post-feast in white Adirondack chairs as boats tack across the water. Afterward, follow the hotel's short private trail that leads to the Castle Hill Lighthouse, tucked into a cliff and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
1 p.m. | Ride into the Gilded Age
Pedal south on Ocean Avenue, along breathtaking bluffs and past Brenton Point State Park, until you reach the secluded Bailey's Beach. There's powdery white sand, few, if any, people and no place to park a car. From there, a four-minute spin north on Bellevue Avenue will bring you to the Beaux-Arts style Marble House (entry, $ 25), which cost $ 11 million to build between 1888 and 1892 ( $ 7 million was spent on marble). It was William Vanderbilt's 39th-birthday present to his wife Alva, who would make this home an unofficial command post of Rhode Island's suffrage movement. The free self-guided audio tour offers information about rooms like the Versailles-inspired grand salon. Suffragists drank tea from "Votes for Women" chinaware in the Chinese Tea House, which, today, serves a $ 35 prix fixe afternoon tea on weekends.
3:30 p.m. | Take In Exhibitions
Ride north a couple of miles (or hop on the bike-friendly #67 trolley) along Bellevue Avenue until you arrive at the Newport Art Museum, a wonder founded in 1912. Newcomers like CUSP Gallery and the Matriarch store are keeping the community's creative soul afloat, as well as the longtime art co-op Spring Bull Gallery and the local artist Chris Wyllie. Also make time to see the "Pride: In Retrospect" exhibition, showcasing 50 years of queer history, at the Newport Pride Center, a new inclusive space and resource for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
6 p.m. | Level up for dinner
Bypass the crowd outside Scales & Shells, an Italian seafood institution since 1987. Instead, enter a door on the corner of Thames and Goodwin Streets that leads you to its new sister restaurant upstairs, Upscales. Neither restaurant takes reservations, but an early arrival at Upscales, which is the more laid-back of the two, may grant you the coveted balcony table overlooking Thames, where a hungry horde may still be huffing by the time you've finished the Lavender Bees Knees cocktail ( $ 14) and started on the lobster ravioli ( $ 29).
7:30 p.m. | Hit the high notes
Move west on Thames past the booming Midtown Oyster Bar until you reach a little-known historic site on Pelham Street, the first street in the United States to be illuminated with a gaslit lamp, in 1805. Above the lamppost is a sign for Dueling Pianos, a rollicking piano bar show with roots in the ragtime era of the 1890s. On the building's third floor, grab a drink with sparkling harbor views from the lounge area. At 8 p.m., two singing pianists will perform requested songs. (Standing-room tickets range from free to $ 20. Tables for five start at $ 100.)
Sunday
9 a.m. | Rêve up for the day
Beaucoup, a new cafe and boutique on Thames Street with a bright-yellow striped awning and robin-egg-blue Fiat parked out front, emits an irresistible joie de vivre, despite the neighboring gas station. The person responsible for turning a dingy old liquor shop into Beaucoup is Cheryl Guibone, the owner of the nearby home goods store Guibone Living. While you eat a warm spinach and feta feuilleté pastry and a cinnamon sugar scone (each $ 5.50), your eyes may travel across the tables topped with surf magazines and a Porsche photography book, over the gingham settee and up to the giraffe sconces, colorful striped beach bags and handmade palm hats: a snapshot of Ms. Guibone's travels to places like Marrakesh, Cartagena, Marbella and Paris.
10 a.m. | Travel through time

Volkswagen Seeks Edge In the Chinese Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, is scaling back its forecast for deliveries in 2023 as it grapples with lagging sales of its electric vehicles, but the company said on Thursday that it hoped to bolster its position in China through increased collaboration with local technology companies.
Financial targets for the year remain unchanged, the company said in its half-yearly financial report, but it expects deliveries of between nine million and 9.5 million vehicles for the year, widening the range from the 9.5 million previously forecast.
For decades, Volkswagen was the leading automaker in the Chinese market, which contributed nearly half of its earnings. But failure to understand Chinese customers' appetite for electric vehicles has cost the German carmaker market share, and deliveries in China fell for the first half of the year.
Shares fell more than 3 percent on Thursday.
The Numbers
Volkswagen said its after-tax earnings in the first half of the year fell 20 percent from a year earlier, to 8.5 billion euros, or $ 9.45 billion. But overall revenue increased 18.2 percent as the company stemmed some of its losses in China, where deliveries were down 1.2 percent.
Western Europe provided the company with its strongest business, with 1.65 million vehicles ordered in the first half of the year, and 200,000 of them -- or 12 percent -- were electric, the company said. It expects shorter waits by the second half of the year, when constraints on supplies and transport as well as logistics tangles will ease.
The company also confirmed that it had sold its Russia operations, including a manufacturing plant, for €125 million. The sale of Volkswagen Group Rus to Avilon, a Moscow-based dealership, was announced in May.
The China Strategy
As part of an effort to claw back ground lost in the Chinese market, Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would invest $ 700 million for a nearly 5 percent stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles.
Last year, the Chinese automaker BYD overtook Volkswagen as the leading brand in the country. BYD widened the gap in the second quarter of the year, selling more than 595,000 hybrid or fully electric models, compared with 544,000 vehicles sold by Volkswagen, only 23,400 of them electric.
Volkswagen hopes that its investment in XPeng will help advance the German automaker's electric vehicle software to the standards produced by Chinese manufacturers. Analysts say German companies have yet to match the technological advancements in phones, homes and vehicles as well as in-car entertainment that drivers in China expect.
The company also said its Audi division would expand its relationship with SAIC, a Chinese automaker that sells cars under the British brand MG.
Some analysts interpreted the move as a concession that Volkswagen was unable to compete with Chinese companies on the latest technology.
"The automobile of the future is coming from China. The Chinese are the leaders in important technology sectors," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany. "Without the know-how of the Chinese, Volkswagen would lose customers in China and, in a few years, in the rest of the world."
What's Next
Unlike Tesla, which has become the world's most popular electric-car company partly by producing relatively few models in a limited palette of exterior and interior colors, Volkswagen Group offers dozens of models from its 10 brands, which include Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini. Analysts have increasingly questioned whether such a complex offering can remain competitive in today's market.
But Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive, expressed confidence that VW customers, including those in China, wanted more variety in their vehicles.
"People love brands -- people love design and individuality," Mr. Blume said on Thursday. "We think that is our specialty."

Judge Considers Revoking Crypto Entrepreneur Bond
A judge is weighing whether to revoke Sam Bankman-Fried's bail after prosecutors said Wednesday that the FTX founder used the news media to harass a key witness against him and should be locked up until trial.
Judge Lewis A. Kaplan didn't immediately decide whether to put the cryptocurrency entrepreneur behind bars, instead giving defense lawyers and prosecutors several days to submit written arguments and more information.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, 31, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he cheated investors and looted FTX customer deposits. He has been free on $ 250 million bond since December, and is scheduled for trial on Oct. 2 in Manhattan.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said Mr. Bankman-Fried should be jailed because he gave The New York Times some personal correspondence by Caroline Ellison. She was the C.E.O. of Alameda Research, a hedge fund that was an offshoot of FTX.

AUTOMAKERS
Porsche to Keep Only One Combustion-Engine Model
Porsche has a plan to electrify its car lineup so that electric vehicles make up 80 percent of sales by 2030, and it aims to make its iconic 911 the only internal-combustion engine model left standing, a top executive said.
The German luxury automaker's plans have been closely watched, including by environmentalists, because of its investment in e-fuels and push for the European Union to allow sales of such vehicles after 2035.
Porsche is seen as closely associated with e-fuels because of an investment in HIF Global, a Chilean energy company.
The automaker will electrify its compact S.U.V. Macan, followed by the 718 sports car and then the best-selling Cayenne, Porsche e-fuels team leader Karl Dums said. The 911, accounting for 13 percent of sales in 2022, is the exception.
"Our strategy in the first place is switching to electric mobility and ... we will produce the 911 as long as possible with a combustion engine," Dums said. REUTERS
RAILROADS
Union Pacific Hires C.E.O. To Streamline Operations
Union Pacific on Wednesday hired the C.E.O. recommended earlier this year by a hedge fund pressuring the railroad to improve, as the company cut its outlook after reporting disappointing results driven by weakening consumer demand and higher labor costs.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said its former chief operating officer Jim Vena will take over as C.E.O. next month. The Soroban Capital Partners hedge fund that holds a $ 1.6 billion stake in Union Pacific had been urging the railroad to hire Mr. Vena because of his expertise in streamlining operations.
The hedge fund said the railroad lagged behind its peers during Lance Fritz's 8-year tenure in all key measures. Soroban declined to comment on the hire on Wednesday, but investors endorsed it by sending Union Pacific's stock soaring more than 9 percent to $ 235.63 in afternoon trading. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: "I think it was a particular ripple in the universe that allowed it to happen," the director said on Tuesday of her highly anticipated movie making a staggering $ 162 million in its first weekend.
It's a "Barbie" world. We're all just living in it.
After a year and a half of hype, a whirlwind press tour and stellar advance reviews, Greta Gerwig's "Barbie" finally hit theaters this past weekend, smashing box-office records with a $ 162 million debut, the biggest of the year. That's the highest-grossing opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman, and though Gerwig had high hopes for "Barbie," she can't quite believe how well her unique spin on the Mattel doll has connected with a mass audience.
"I wanted to make something anarchic and wild and funny and cathartic," a gob-smacked Gerwig told me over the phone on Tuesday, "and the idea that it's actually being received that way, it's sort of extraordinary."
Few blockbusters these days have as much on their minds as "Barbie"; it is actually, to borrow a quote from "Clueless," "way existential." Underneath its candy-coated exterior, "Barbie" tackles issues like sexism and self-determination with aplomb, while never forgetting to supply its stars Margot Robbie (as Barbie) and Ryan Gosling (as Ken) with surprisingly witty jokes, some of which border on the arcane. (Who would have expected a punchline about the '90s rock band Pavement in the "Barbie" movie?)
Gerwig is just happy she got away with all of it. "I think it was a particular ripple in the universe that allowed it to happen," she told me from her home in New York City, where Harold, her 4-year-old son with Noah Baumbach, her co-writer on "Barbie," interrupted the call to bring Gerwig's press cycle to a definitive close. "He made a cake for me that was pink and had a 'B' on it, and he said, 'This is how we say goodbye to Barbie,"' Gerwig said with a laugh. "I thought, 'Oh, you're done."'
Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.
This interview contains spoilers for "Barbie."
You just had one of the most consequential weekends of your life. How are you feeling?
I'm so grateful. I'm so amazed. I'm at a loss for words, really. I've been in New York City and spent Thursday and Friday just spot-checking different theaters, listening to the levels and making sure the picture looked nice and trying to relinquish control, which is difficult. But honestly, it's been amazing to walk around and see people in pink. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine something like this. It's just ... it's ... sorry, I'm just disintegrating into noises.
What specific things helped you get a grasp on how much the film was resonating?
I think part of the reason I was so fixated on volume levels was because it was a thing I could concentrate on. But mostly, it's been running into people on the street who are excited and happy and exuberant, because so much of this movie was an attempt to create something that people would want to experience together. So it's the little things.
My producer David Heyman sent me an email from someone who lives in a tiny Scottish town, and there's a movie theater there that has been struggling, and they had sold-out shows all weekend for "Barbie." He was like, "The town is showing up!" And my brother and his sons and his wife all went in Sacramento and sent a picture, then they sent a text saying their oldest son was going back the next day with his friends. These 15- or 16-year-old boys from Sacramento are sending me texts saying, "It was great! We loved the Porsche joke!" Those are the things that feel so amazing. I've never quite had anything like this.
The thing I keep hearing from people in Hollywood is "I don't know how she got away with it." When a theatrically released movie is made at this budget level, anything idiosyncratic or challenging often gets whittled down by studio notes. How were you able to preserve your sensibility the whole way through this process?
I was originally meant to just write it with Noah, and then we finished the script and that was the thing that made me want to direct it. It felt so clear to me: If they didn't want to make that [version], I didn't need to make it. Margot, as the producer and star, was really the first person to line up and say, "I want to do it her way." And then as we started adding collaborators and gathering more cast, suddenly there was a large number of people who were excited to do something that was this, excuse the pun, out of the box.
Part of me thinks that because it was all so idiosyncratic and so wild, it was almost like no one really knew where to start taking it apart. Like, where are you going to start hacking away at how strange it was? Maybe because there was this sense of sheer joy behind it, it was this hard thing to say, "Oh no, we don't want that thing that's sheer joy." People wanted it to exist, in all its weirdness.
Even the movie's inciting incident is pretty heady. I'm trying to imagine how the executives reacted when you told them, "Well, things really kick off when Barbie starts having irrepressible thoughts of death."
I know! We had the idea of the movie starting off like this whirligig, and that line becomes something where she almost breaks the movie. And what do you do after you've broken the movie? Her character tries to just keep the movie going normally again, but there's no way to do it. But yeah, I don't know that anyone totally knew what the tone of this was going to be until it was all done. I mean, within the group of people who were deeply making it, we knew, but it was truly an act of faith for everyone else.
The first time I ever screened the movie for an audience, that line -- "Do you guys ever think about dying?" -- got a big laugh, and everybody who had been holding their breaths for a year and a half finally exhaled. The way it played was something I could always kind of hear in my head and see in my mind's eye but outside that group that was there, it was a little bit of white-knuckling.
It's been reported that Mattel executives flew to the London set to try to convince you to take out the scene where Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), a teenage character from the real world, calls Barbie dolls sexist and fascist. True?
I will say, that's always sounded so dramatic: They were coming anyway, so it wasn't like, "Stop everything, we all have to go to London!" But with that scene in particular, my awareness of Barbie as a thing in the world completely corresponded with me knowing the arguments against Barbie. I didn't think there was any way to do this without giving that real estate and having well-articulated, correct arguments from a really smart character given to Barbie against Barbie. Also, I grew up with a mom who was kind of against Barbie, so that's how I knew all that. If you don't give voice to that, then you're nowheresville.
It wasn't like I ever got the full seal of approval from [Mattel], like, "We love it!" I got a tentative, "Well, OK. I see that you are going to do this, so go ahead and we'll see how it goes." But that's all you need, and I had faith once it was in there and they saw it that they would embrace it, not fight it. Maybe at the end of the day, my will to have it in was stronger than any other will to take it out.
That scene leads to one of my favorite unexpected jokes, when Barbie protests that she can't be a fascist because she doesn't control the railways or the flow of commerce.
There were several jokes where I was like, "This might be for three or seven people, but I will keep it in for them!" Here's something else that will stick with me: When I was checking in on different screenings this weekend, there was another joke like that: "Remember Proust Barbie? That did not sell very well." And there were, like, two people in this screening who died at that joke. I was like, "Yes! It was for you, and you got it. I'm so glad that I was here to see that work in the wild."
When people ask whether "Barbie" is for kids or adults, those lines remind me of how when I was young, if I didn't understand a joke that my parents laughed at, it sparked my curiosity.
I've never had such a sharp delineation in my mind between things that were made for adults and things that were made for children. I had parents who, blessedly, took me to and showed me lots of things, and sometimes there was even a double pleasure in things that were beyond me because it felt like a window into a world I was just starting to piece together. I always liked that feeling, so I thought it didn't seem like a hindrance to a younger audience enjoying it.
One of the scenes that gets the biggest audience reaction is America Ferrera's monologue about the tightrope that women have to walk in this society. What did you want out of that moment?
I always hoped that America would do this part, and I feel so lucky that she said yes. Over the course of a long time prepping it, we really embroidered it with her own specificity and talked about her experiences and her own life, and three takes in, I was crying. Then I looked around, and everyone was crying -- even the men were tearing up. I suddenly thought that this tightrope she's explaining is something that is present for women in the way that she's describing it, but it's also present for everybody.
Everybody is afraid they're going to put a foot wrong and it's all going to come crashing down, and in that moment of doing that monologue, she was giving people permission to step off that tightrope. I don't think I realized until then that's what that moment was for. She had a piece of the puzzle in her as an actor and collaborator and artist that explained it back to me.
Did you anticipate the degree to which right-wing pundits are bashing the movie as being "woke" and burning their Barbies?
No, I didn't. Certainly, there's a lot of passion. My hope for the movie is that it's an invitation for everybody to be part of the party and let go of the things that aren't necessarily serving us as either women or men. I hope that in all of that passion, if they see it or engage with it, it can give them some of the relief that it gave other people.
When did you know you'd figured out the final scene of the movie, where the now-human Barbie marches up to a real-world receptionist and announces that she's there to see her gynecologist?
I wasn't really certain until I was in rehearsals and reading it with Margot. I had a feeling of what I wanted it to be, but then she did it, and there was something so incredibly winning and hilarious and empathetic about the way she said that last line. I was like, "That's it!" It's so utterly sincere and silly at the same time.
In your mind, is this movie the start of a franchise, or do you feel "Barbie" is a complete story with a definitive ending?
At this moment, it's all I've got. I feel like that at the end of every movie, like I'll never have another idea and everything I've ever wanted to do, I did. I wouldn't want to squash anybody else's dream but for me, at this moment, I'm at totally zero.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the May evening before Aimé Leon Dore was set to make its grand return to Mulberry Street following eight months of construction on an extravagant new storefront, Teddy Santis, the brand's founder, was walking around the shop floor, sweating the details.
The sneakers on the table near the register were "a little too choked," he said, urging someone to loosen the laces just a tad. The mannequins near the entrance, dressed for a night that might start at Lovely Day and end at Zero Bond, needed an additional layer of zhuzhing. Overnight, a mystery stain had appeared on a slab of marble flooring near the ALD-customized 1960 Porsche 356B that sits in the front of the store, an unpurchase-able trinket of the brand's reach. A contractor looked at it sternly and promised to whip up a poultice.
The old Aimé Leon Dore -- ALD, colloquially -- was open from 2019 to 2022 and rapidly became NoLIta's gravitational center, perpetually choked by sidewalk crowds. This new one felt less like the headquarters of a trend-savvy men's wear brand with a rabid fan base than a members-only midtown social club or an Upper East Side gentleman's atelier.
The walls are dark wood, the lighting is muted, the clothes are displayed museumlike, with plenty of space to linger and take in the details. Art hangs throughout, including a Rene Ricard painting in the back room and a Tyrrell Winston installation in the front.
"When you're buying into ALD, you're buying into a world -- you're buying into a perspective more than a garment," said Mr. Santis, 37, a couple of weeks later, in the nameless private clubhouse the size of a shared secret that adjoins the store.
Outside, things were hectic. At any given moment, a few dozen people or more were lining up to get into the shop. On opening day, that number had been consistently well over 100. Mr. Santis loitered outside for hours, greeting well-wishers and taking pictures with fans. He was, as always, dressed in head-to-toe ALD, a prim and inconspicuous brand billboard. At one point in the afternoon, the chief executive of LVMH North America showed up for a walk through, wearing ALD New Balance 550s, and Mr. Santis ushered him in for a private tour.
Even though he audaciously created a personal sanctuary quite literally within arms' reach of the scrum, the scrum is very much the thing, and Mr. Santis is its mayor. More than with any brand since Supreme, the ALD experience extends beyond clothes into how to navigate acquiring those clothes, and what worlds wearing those clothes will associate you with.
ALD sold its first items in 2014, but over the last four years has become men's wear's most visible and promising bridge between streetwear and luxury, making clothes with a striking blend of Mediterranean machismo, prep classicism and outdoorsy sturdiness, all with a sprinkle of hip-hop flair.
Its garments are swarthy and a little sensual, displaying a clear affection for Ralph Lauren but also for how hip-hop appropriated Ralph Lauren in the 1990s. It is a brand that's both mindful of the role heritage plays in men's wear and also actively reconstituting what a heritage brand might look like to the buyers of a few generations from now.
"When we reference something, we'll know automatically if it feels gimmicky, if it's a reach, and if we even have a right to touch it, with how much respect we have for it," Mr. Santis said. If you get the references, ALD's garments function as refined, updated nostalgia pieces. But they also stand on their own, landing at the intersection of slick bruiser and around-the-way gentleman.
"I'm super-inspired by Ralph, but I feel like there was a void that didn't exist within Ralph that I thought I could speak to, which was my starting point," Mr. Santis said. Supreme, too, was a huge influence: "I built a case study around that brand for two years straight -- not the product, more so how they spoke to their consumer."
The style Mr. Santis landed on has struck a nerve, creatively and commercially. He declined to provide revenue figures for ALD. The company is private, but early last year, LVMH announced it had acquired a minority stake.
The LVMH scion Alexandre Arnault, who now sits on ALD's board, began shopping at ALD as a customer several years ago, and met Mr. Santis in the store. What LVMH finds study-worthy in ALD covers three areas, Mr. Arnault said: the brand's complete avoidance of runway shows and the fashion week calendar, instead relying on seasonal (and occasionally off-season) drops; its avoidance of all paid marketing and advertising; and the power of its Mulberry flagship, "a store on a kind of a no-name street that nobody really cares for in their sector, that draws a line around the corner whether it rains, snows or overheats."
Before the pandemic, ALD was sold in 160 stores worldwide, but that model collapsed. Instead of waiting for retail to reopen, ALD recalibrated by taking back its exclusivity. Now, it is a purposefully cloistered brand. You can buy it only at one of its two stores -- London, opened last year, is the other -- or online.
The shift to scarcity and distribution control, combined with design and quality improvements, conspired to give ALD an air of impromptu luxury. Having no retail partners allowed Mr. Santis to control the company's narrative from the inception of design to the point of sale. To see, touch or buy the clothes, you have to go through him.
"Teddy's been able to make people feel, you know what I mean? And in today's world, that, to me, is a designer," said Ronnie Fieg, the founder of the sneaker and streetwear retail empire Kith. "He's designing feelings."
Mr. Santis met Mr. Fieg in Kith's early years and became fast friends while Mr. Santis was working on an earlier retail venture, an upscale eyewear shop in Chelsea named Tina Catherine. The two remain profoundly close. When Mr. Fieg was recently announced as creative director of the Knicks, Mr. Santis bought him a Knicks pendant with one of their shared phrases on the back: "Only one of us has to make it."
Through Mr. Fieg, Mr. Santis was introduced to Sam Ben-Avraham, a longtime fashion business insider who made an early investment in ALD in 2016.
"When Sam invested, Sam didn't invest because I had this profitable business," Mr. Santis said. "He just believed in the point of view. And he's like, 'Yeah, I know you and you're a worker.' I was a diner kid."
He continued, "I'm going to outwork everyone. And while everyone's out there trying to be famous, trying to be a celebrity designer, they're trying to gain clout and following and all this crazy [expletive], I'm going to do the complete opposite."
Working the Morning Shift
Much of Mr. Santis's approach to business, and relationships, was forged in the Midnight Express Diner, on the corner of East 89th Street and Second Avenue, which was owned by his father and of which he took over operations in 2006. "I built amazing relationships with customers," Mr. Santis said in April, sitting at a window table in the diner, picking at a medium well cheeseburger. "I learned what it was to host and serve. Til this day I run my whole business that way, you know?"
Mr. Santis was born in 1986 and grew up in Flushing and Astoria. Both of his parents had emigrated from Greece. As a teenager, he attended five different high schools, but he found a home in local nightclubs, where he was DJing house music. Many nights, he'd leave his club gigs and head straight to morning shift at the diner.
At the same time, he was beginning to learn about clothes from downtown stores like Yellow Rat Bastard, David Z and Michael K., as well as noting how older friends in the neighborhood dressed, particularly those who collected Polo pieces like art.
The earliest prep-leaning ALD collections were ravenously received by the online men's wear media of the day, but Mr. Santis, working out of an office behind the diner, struggled with the basics of making clothes. At the time, he said, "People thought the brand is beautiful, but the product is absolute trash."
As he was building out ALD -- the brand's name includes nods to his father's nickname and his own name -- Mr. Santis consistently turned to nontraditional people to form the core creative team. He met Anthony Bigio, now vice president for design, when Mr. Bigio was designing custom Air Force 1s for clients at Nike's Mercer Street location. Joe Bavasso, now ALD's vice president for product, had a job at Todd Snyder but sought out Mr. Santis in hopes that ALD would sponsor his summer basketball team in the Rockaways.
What links everyone is disposition. In the office, and in the store, and out in the world, most of the staff speaks in a gentlemanly, conspiratorial hush, as if letting each other, and you, in on something lightly startling that you should be grateful to know. The clothing becomes something of a memento, a token of inclusion.
Over the last couple of years, though, that sense of intimacy has been playing out on an ever-growing stage. ALD logo hoodies, Yankees and Mets caps with ALD script logos embroidered on the side, New Balance 550s: In corridors downtown, there has been an inescapability to what ALD has wrought.
A few years ago, Mr. Santis discovered the New Balance 550, a low-top lifestyle sneaker, in an old New Balance catalog and revived it as a collaborative release with ALD. Since then, the 550 has become in "a staple iconic franchise for New Balance," said Chris Davis, the New Balance chief marketing officer and senior vice president for global merchandising. "It was one of those phenomenons in sneaker culture that only comes around once every few years."
Matt Powell, a longtime footwear industry analyst, said that the speed of the 550's spread was unusually rapid: "New Balance figured out the real key here is to have the limited shoe, make the sneakerhead really happy that they got a rare shoe, and at the same time, trade off of whatever buzz there is out there by having a more commercialized version in the marketplace right away."
But the ubiquity causes Mr. Santis some light anxiety, too. "We had this moment where it was like everybody had the New Era hat and 550s on in SoHo, you know? It was incredible, the brand's at a pinnacle," he said. "But then you have to be aware. You have to ask yourself, does this play in to the longevity of what we're trying to do?"
Maturing the Audience
Where ALD flaunts its patience is in its store, and in its lookbooks. To the extent that ALD has peer brands, they are far less sophisticated when it comes to physicalizing their storytelling.
The Mulberry store's design is fully narrativized. The first room is vast and breathable, with almost no clothes, a foyer of sorts. The second room has the most clothing, displayed beatifically. And the third room has some of the most expensive pieces, along with deep chairs for relaxation and huge fitting rooms. It's a literal manifestation of ALD's arm-around-the-shoulder, you're-with-us-now spirit.
For a brand so intentional about its pacing and tone, the limitations of the original store were a real distraction. The store itself was postcard size. People loved lingering outside by the cafe. If you simply wished to buy clothes, these were serious deterrents.
"It was the kind of place where people would come to actually spend their whole day," Mr. Santis said of the crowds. "There's businesses and brands that would cut their left arm off to have this. But the community that inspires me felt intimidated by how busy it became."
He continued, "Our business is not selling coffee, so I can't let what is an experiential moment behind the brand hurt the brand."
The new store is far more breathable, and the crowds outside the revamped cafe have largely been tamed. After some line supervision experiments, store access is now managed by a text message alert system.
Mr. Santis wants to be a good neighbor but also wants to avoid burning too hot. "I was also extremely self-aware of the fact that growing up here, there's always a scene," he said. "And historically in New York, scenes die. So I was really more frightened by that than anything else."
Now, in between the store and the cafe sits the clubhouse, Mr. Santis's personal fief, which has no official name, and is not officially open, and never will be. Access to it is another unpurchaseable trinket: you might catch the Los Angeles nightlife guru Zack Bia slyly name-drop it in a TikTok, or perhaps see a blurry photo online from a low-key Drake concert after-party.
The aesthetic of ALD photo shoots has become signature. A stoically cool model dressed as a sporty flâneur blending technical and tailored garments, often with an unexpected accessory. The backdrops are warm, lived-in, somewhere between Northeastern and European. One of the brand's staple colors is a forest green that evokes royalty and money. ("A perfect substitute to navy," Mr. Bavasso said.)
In addition to the seasonal lookbooks, ALD also semi-regularly shoots friends and family campaigns. One shoot early last year featured both the Knicks legend John Starks and the hip-hop hypeman Big Body Bes, cost-effectively turning them into brand ambassadors.
"It's rare that lookbooks make you feel," said Clint419, the founder of the bleeding-edge London streetwear brand Corteiz, who recently appeared in one of ALD's short campaign films. "How can someone lay clothes on someone and make you feel an emotion?"
ALD lookbooks, he said, "felt like a breath of fresh air in terms of the way in which things were shot, in the way the products were articulated. And how, say, a sweatshirt, usually you just kind of slap it on the model and then that's that. But when they do it, it's almost like when you go to a restaurant and the guy comes out with that little flame gun and he puts the flame on the dessert."
The ALD looks are signature enough that elements of the shoots, including even ALD's primary model, have sneaked into campaigns from more established brands like Abecrombie & Fitch.
The looks have also inspired a seemingly endless supply of memes, a suite of online punchline discourse. Many of the most viral ones were created by Alex Hartman, ALD's de facto antagonist-in-chief, who posted them to his (then anonymous) Instagram page NoLIta Dirtbag.
"Someone needed to put a name on what was going on there -- it seemed almost cultish," Mr. Hartman said of the crowd that would loiter outside the store. An early hit: a mock New York Post headline reading "Man stands outside Aimé Leon Dore store in NoLIta for 48 hours straight, dies."
ALD is a romantic brand but not a playful one. "People are always going to throw rocks at the throne," Mr. Santis said. "Misery loves company. It took us a long time to join in, to be able to laugh at it ourselves, because we were so serious about what we were building."
As for the meme ecosystem, he has become sanguine: "The meme thing drove a ton of eyes to our business, right? Because the majority of the memes you saw were memes about how busy we were."
Mr. Hartman added, "If you're getting a massive investment from LVMH, hopefully you're not letting some bozo making memes about you get under your skin."
Over the last few years, as the luxury market has reckoned with the rise of streetwear, and the streetwear market has wrestled with saturation and creative vacancy, ALD has stepped into a void that perhaps could have been filled by Supreme but wasn't ever quite.
Nevertheless, maturing the audience toward something slightly more refined (and likely less meme-able) is one of ALD's goals. Many ALD garments feel transitional between buttoned-up and casual, austere and loose. Sometimes a proletarian garment will be made in ostentatious fabric -- say, a cashmere sweatsuit. Sometimes, there will be a peacocking pivot: "We never design anything to tell someone, 'Hey, we think everyone should wear berets right now,"' Mr. Santis said. "No, there's a character in our season that wears a beret."
Assessing how to get its customer "a little bit more grown, into suiting and finer tailoring and dress trousers, silk shirts and cashmere shirt jackets" is a priority, Mr. Bavasso said. Or, he added, "taking these finer fabrics and bringing them down a bit more into the sport world." The goal, he continued, was "foreshadowing how they're going to dress in the next X amount of years."
'We're so far from the ceiling'
Beginning in 2021, ALD began working with Aaron Levine, a design star of the #menswear generation known for his work at Hickey Freeman and Abercrombie & Fitch.
"Aaron in the beginning would come in and be like, How do you want me to help?" Mr. Santis recalled. "And I'd be like, 'Yo, I don't think you understand that we don't know much about clothes. Let me tell you what we're great at. We have an amazing point of view, we're good people and we work extremely hard."'
Mr. Levine consults on each season. "When I talk to the team, we talk about this idea of tension, right?" he said. "Your one aspect might come from humble origins, and another aspect might come from a truly luxury-derived origin. That sounds simple enough. But what's hard is to do it with a taste level and restraint so that when you walk in here, it doesn't feel like either thing is out of place."
Can there be a truly American contemporary luxury brand? Maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the right one is whether the concept of luxury has been so irrevocably changed by the rise of hip-hop -- the truest American luxury milieu -- and the absorption of streetwear into European houses that the forward direction for luxury resides somewhere in the still-unwritten space in between those worlds.
ALD is catering to, and possibly creating, a new kind of luxury gentleman -- a self-made sophisticate, familiar with hip-hop and maybe also indie rock, mixing jeans with Belgians, or Timberlands with a beret, unafraid to be a little frisky.
Once every couple of years, Teddy Santis sits down and writes a letter to Ralph Lauren -- a thank-you note, essentially. A nod of appreciation. "It's an emotional connection that we have to what we do because of him," Mr. Santis said. For a few years as a teenager, he wore only Polo. "I fell in love with Ralph because you aspired not only to wear the product, but to live that life."
ALD aspires to inherit that mantle. "If you walk into Ralph today and you walk into my store, there's a lot of products that someone who doesn't spend a lot of time with the product won't see the difference on," Mr. Santis said. "But then there's certain products that you're like, 'Oh, he's been making this shirt for 40 years.' That's just a time thing. We'll get there."
The most limited resource is Mr. Santis, who until recently had personally supervised every lookbook shoot since the beginning. "At his scale, he sees every visual, every product, every supplier. He oversees every tile of stone on the floor of the store," Mr. Arnault said. "Which is great, but one day, people need to have his creative brain and execute for him."
The ALD office, currently in Queens, is relocating to a huge space on Mercer Street, just a few blocks from the Mulberry store. An ALD-branded powerboat, made with the Greek company Technohull, will be available next year. He's also planning to create a soccer pitch in London in partnership with New Balance, similar to the open-to-the-public basketball gym ALD opened on the Lower East Side last year.
"We're so far from the ceiling," Mr. Santis said. "There's so much for us to get better at."
On the day of the store opening, he walked up to the checkout counter, pointed at some boxer briefs and joked, "We selling underwear?!" It was a new extension for the company into a staple product and another place for the logo to be flaunted on the streets of downtowns around the world.
Then he leaned in close, as if to share a piece of information so confidential it could destabilize markets: "By accident, we made the best underwear in the world."

NEW YORK — On the May evening before Aimé Leon Dore was set to make its grand return to Mulberry Street after eight months of construction on an extravagant new storefront, Teddy Santis, the brand’s founder, was walking around the shop floor, sweating the details.
The sneakers on the table near the register were “a little too choked,” he said, urging someone to loosen the laces just a tad. The mannequins near the entrance, dressed for a night that might start at Lovely Day and end at Zero Bond, needed an additional layer of zhuzhing. Overnight, a mystery stain had appeared on a slab of marble flooring near the ALD-customized 1960 Porsche 356B that sits in the front of the store, an unpurchaseable trinket of the brand’s reach. A contractor looked at it sternly and promised to whip up a poultice.
The old Aimé Leon Dore — ALD, colloquially — was open from 2019 to 2022 and rapidly became the gravitational center of Manhattan’s NoLIta neighborhood, perpetually choked by sidewalk crowds. This new one felt less like the headquarters of a trend-savvy menswear brand with a rabid fan base than a members-only midtown social club or an Upper East Side gentleman’s atelier.
The walls are dark wood, the lighting is muted, the clothes are displayed like museum works, with plenty of space to linger and take in the details. Art hangs throughout, including a Rene Ricard painting in the back room and a Tyrrell Winston installation in the front.
“When you’re buying into ALD, you’re buying into a world; you’re buying into a perspective more than a garment,” Santis, 37, said a couple of weeks later in the nameless private clubhouse the size of a shared secret that adjoins the store.
Outside, things were hectic. At any given moment, a few dozen people or more were lining up to get into the shop. On opening day, that number had been consistently well over 100. Santis loitered outside for hours, greeting well-wishers and taking pictures with fans. He was, as always, dressed in head-to-toe ALD, a prim and inconspicuous brand billboard. At one point in the afternoon, the chief executive of LVMH North America showed up for a walk-through, wearing ALD New Balance 550s, and Santis ushered him in for a private tour.
Even though he audaciously created a personal sanctuary quite literally within arm’s reach of the scrum, the scrum is very much the thing, and Santis is its mayor. More than with any brand since Supreme, the ALD experience extends beyond clothes into how to navigate acquiring those clothes and what worlds wearing those clothes will associate you with.
ALD sold its first items in 2014, but over the past four years has become menswear’s most visible and promising bridge between streetwear and luxury, making clothes with a striking blend of Mediterranean machismo, prep classicism and outdoorsy sturdiness, all with a sprinkle of hip-hop flair.
Its garments are swarthy and a little sensual, displaying a clear affection for Ralph Lauren but also for how hip-hop appropriated Ralph Lauren in the 1990s.
It is a brand that’s both mindful of the role heritage plays in menswear and also actively reconstituting what a heritage brand might look like to the buyers of a few generations from now.
“When we reference something, we’ll know automatically if it feels gimmicky, if it’s a reach, and if we even have a right to touch it, with how much respect we have for it,” Santis said. If you get the references, ALD’s garments function as refined, updated nostalgia pieces. But they also stand on their own, landing at the intersection of slick bruiser and around-the-way gentleman.
“I’m super inspired by Ralph, but I feel like there was a void that didn’t exist within Ralph that I thought I could speak to, which was my starting point,” Santis said. Supreme, too, was a huge influence: “I built a case study around that brand for two years straight — not the product, more so how they spoke to their consumer.”
The style Santis landed on has struck a chord, creatively and commercially. He declined to provide revenue figures for ALD. The company is private, but early last year, LVMH announced that it had acquired a minority stake.
LVMH scion Alexandre Arnault, who is on ALD’s board, began shopping there several years ago and met Santis in the store. What LVMH finds study-worthy in ALD covers three areas, Arnault said: the brand’s complete avoidance of runway shows and the fashion week calendar, instead relying on seasonal (and occasionally offseason) drops; its avoidance of all paid marketing and advertising; and the power of its Mulberry flagship, “a store on a kind of a no-name street that nobody really cares for in their sector, that draws a line around the corner whether it rains, snows or overheats.”
Before the pandemic, ALD was sold in 160 stores worldwide, but that model collapsed. Instead of waiting for retail to reopen, ALD recalibrated by taking back its exclusivity. Now it is a purposefully cloistered brand. You can buy it only at one of its two stores — a London store opened last year — or online.

Santis met Fieg in Kith’s early years, and they became fast friends while Santis was working on an earlier retail venture, an upscale eyewear shop in Chelsea named Tina Catherine. The two remain profoundly close. When Fieg was recently announced as creative director of the New York Knicks, Santis bought him a Knicks pendant with one of their shared phrases on the back: “Only one of us has to make it.”

Santis was born in 1986 and grew up in Flushing and Astoria, Queens. Both his parents had emigrated from Greece. As a teenager, he attended five high schools, but he found a home in local nightclubs, where he was a DJ playing house music. Many nights, he’d leave his club gigs and head straight to his morning shift at the diner.

Nevertheless, maturing the audience toward something slightly more refined (and most likely less meme-able) is one of ALD’s goals. Many ALD garments feel transitional between buttoned-up and casual, austere and loose. Sometimes a proletarian garment will be made in ostentatious fabric — say, a cashmere sweatsuit. Sometimes, there will be a peacocking pivot: “We never design anything to tell someone, ‘Hey, we think everyone should wear berets right now,’” Santis said. “No, there’s a character in our season that wears a beret.”
Assessing how to get its customer “a little bit more grown, into suiting and finer tailoring and dress trousers, silk shirts and cashmere shirt jackets” is a priority, Bavasso said. Or, he added, “taking these finer fabrics and bringing them down a bit more into the sport world.” The goal is “foreshadowing how they’re going to dress in the next X amount of years.”
‘We’re So Far From the Ceiling’
Beginning in 2021, ALD began working with Aaron Levine, a design star of the #menswear generation known for his work at Hickey Freeman and Abercrombie & Fitch.
“Aaron in the beginning would come in and be like, ‘How do you want me to help?’” Santis recalled. “And I’d be like: ‘Yo, I don’t think you understand that we don’t know much about clothes. Let me tell you what we’re great at. We have an amazing point of view, we’re good people and we work extremely hard.’”
Levine consults on each season.
“When I talk to the team, we talk about this idea of tension, right?” he said. “Your one aspect might come from humble origins, and another aspect might come from a truly luxury-derived origin. That sounds simple enough. But what’s hard is to do it with a taste level and restraint so that when you walk in here, it doesn’t feel like either thing is out of place.”
Can there be a truly American contemporary luxury brand? Maybe that’s the wrong question. Maybe the right one is whether the concept of luxury has been so irrevocably changed by the rise of hip-hop — the truest American luxury milieu — and the absorption of streetwear into European houses that the forward direction for luxury resides somewhere in the still-unwritten space between those worlds.
ALD is catering to, and possibly creating, a new kind of luxury gentleman: a self-made sophisticate, familiar with hip-hop and maybe also indie rock, mixing jeans with Belgians, or Timberlands with a beret, unafraid to be a little frisky.
Once every couple of years, Teddy Santis sits down and writes a letter to Ralph Lauren — a thank-you note, essentially. A nod of appreciation.
“It’s an emotional connection that we have to what we do because of him,” Santis said. For a few years as a teenager, he wore only Polo. “I fell in love with Ralph because you aspired not only to wear the product but to live that life.”
ALD aspires to inherit that mantle.
“If you walk into Ralph today and you walk into my store, there’s a lot of products that someone who doesn’t spend a lot of time with the product won’t see the difference on,” Santis said. “But then there’s certain products that you’re like, ‘Oh, he’s been making this shirt for 40 years.’ That’s just a time thing. We’ll get there.”
The most limited resource is Santis, who until recently had supervised every lookbook shoot.
“At his scale, he sees every visual, every product, every supplier,” Arnault said. “He oversees every tile of stone on the floor of the store. Which is great, but one day people need to have his creative brain and execute for him.”
The ALD office, currently in Queens, is relocating to a huge space just a few blocks from the Mulberry store. An ALD-branded powerboat, made with the Greek company Technohull, will be available next year. Santis is also planning to create a soccer field in London in partnership with New Balance, similar to the open-to-the-public basketball gym ALD opened on the Lower East Side of Manhattan last year.
“We’re so far from the ceiling,” he said. “There’s so much for us to get better at.”
On the day of the store opening, he walked up to the checkout counter, pointed at some boxer briefs and joked, “We selling underwear?” It was a new extension for the company into a staple product and another place for the logo to be flaunted on the streets of downtowns around the world.
Then he leaned in close, as if to share a piece of information so confidential it could destabilize markets: “By accident, we made the best underwear in the world.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He turbocharged high-end vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet and others, and in 1988 a Corvette he had modified reached over 254 miles per hour, breaking a record.
Reeves Callaway, who started out driving fast cars and then focused on creating them, including one that set a speed record of 254.76 miles per hour in 1988, died on July 11 at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 75.
His company, Callaway Cars, said the cause was injuries from a fall.
Mr. Callaway and his company were well known in the world of high-performance automobiles custom-made for deep-pocketed clients. He began by modifying cars out of his garage, then established his company in Old Lyme, Conn., with the goal of challenging European manufacturers like Porsche and Ferrari, which were then making the world's fastest vehicles.
Soon the modified cars coming out of his small shop were drawing attention in motor magazines and in speed competitions. A key moment came in the mid-1980s, when Alfa Romeo, the Italian auto company, sought him out.
"They came to us," he told the Truck Show Podcast in 2021, "and they said, 'Look, could you, within one year's time, develop an Alfa twin-turbo system for us that we could use to compete against the Maserati?"'
He did, making about three dozen modified vehicles, but then Alfa Romeo lost interest in the project. Yet somehow one of those modified Alfas found its way to General Motors' Black Lake testing ground in Michigan, and soon GM was asking if Mr. Callaway could do the same thing to its Chevrolet Corvette.
"This was a huge opportunity, to become associated with Corvette," he said. "So we saluted and said, 'Yes, sir; immediately, sir; may I have another, sir?"'
The result was an unusual agreement that made Mr. Callaway's company an authorized "aftermarket tuner," as news accounts put it at the time -- customers could order a limited-edition Callaway-modified Corvette at select Chevrolet dealers, and the car would be shipped to Old Lyme and outfitted with turbochargers and other modifications. The first version, in 1987, added about $ 20,000 to the price, putting the starting price that year at about $ 51,000 (the equivalent of about $ 140,000 today).
Automobile journalists were impressed.
"The awesome power of the turbos is revealed in three ways," Brock Yates wrote in Playboy in 1989, "a faint shriek of impellers as they pump gobs of fuel into the combustion chambers, the whisk of the gauge on the dash toward maximum boost and, most vivid of all, the G-force that seems to want to compress the driver and the passenger into the luggage compartment behind the seats."
John Hicks of The Orlando Sentinel ended a 1988 review of the car by saying, "It's enjoyable to imagine standing on a street corner telling the driver of a smoked-out Euro rod that the Callaway went that-a-way."
In the podcast, Mr. Callaway said Chevrolet had estimated that demand worldwide for the Callaway Corvette would be about 25 cars. In 1988, the second year of production, The New York Times reported that output that year could reach 400 vehicles. The car, which Mr. Callaway produced through 1991, could hit speeds of more than 200 miles per hour, though it was made for driving on ordinary roads.
"People who buy these cars don't go that fast," Mr. Callaway told The Times in 1988. "What they're buying is a configuration capable of doing that. Why do people buy a 400-watt stereo when 99 percent of the time they're listening to music at much lower levels?"
In late 1988, he and his engineers tweaked the Corvette some more, taking aim at 250 miles per hour with a version of the car that they called the Sledgehammer.
"We basically decided that 250 m.p.h. was a reachable goal," Mr. Callaway told the McClatchy News Service. "But if it was to have any meaning, the car had to be docile at low speeds as well. It had to retain all the things that make a car usable on the street, such as air-conditioning."
To prove the point, his team drove the car from Connecticut to a seven-and-a-half-mile oval track in Ohio. (It got 16 miles per gallon, they said.) At the track, it hit 210 m.p.h. on its first run, 223 on its second. After more tweaking, it reached 254.76 on its third attempt, a record for a car made for normal driving. Mr. Callaway's company, in its announcement of his death, said the record stood for more than 20 years.
Ely Reeves Callaway III was born on Nov. 22, 1947, in Bryn Mawr, Pa. His father, Ely Reeves Callaway Jr., was a textile executive who in the 1980s founded the Callaway Golf Company, the maker of golf equipment; his mother, Jeanne Delaplaine (Wiler) Callaway, was a homemaker.
He grew up in the Philadelphia area and in Connecticut, where he graduated from New Canaan High School in 1966. In 1970, he earned a fine arts degree at Amherst College; for his senior project he restored a Ferrari that had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France in 1954.
Mr. Callaway, a self-taught tinkerer, started out racing dune buggies and other vehicles he had modified, having some success, including on the Formula Vee circuit. But it wasn't a lucrative profession. The Gazette-Telegraph of Colorado Springs noted in 1971 that he had spent about $ 2,000 to bring a buggy to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb that year, for the prospect of winning barely more than $ 2,000. (He won nothing; his vehicle broke down during the race.)
"I decided I couldn't earn a living as a driver," he told The Times in 1994. Instead he turned to making souped-up vehicles.
Though the Callaway Corvette was perhaps his best-known car, Mr. Callaway and his company worked on many types of cars, adapting to computerization and other new technologies and opening locations in California and Germany.
"Dad's passion for making beautifully designed and crafted machines can be seen in each and every project," his son Peter, president of the company, said in a statement.
Mr. Callaway's marriages to Dale Vosburgh, Sue Zesiger and Nicole Jones ended in divorce. In addition to his son Peter, from his marriage to Ms. Vosburgh, he is survived by a daughter from that marriage, Augusta Boone Callaway; two children from his marriage to Ms. Zesiger, Sebastian and Walker Callaway; a sister, Louise Wiler Callaway; a brother, Nicholas; and two grandchildren.
In the Truck Show Podcast, Mr. Callaway noted that he wasn't an engineer, though he'd worked with some good ones.
"I'm still the guy who loves building stuff more than anything else," he said. His philosophy? "Just put your mind to it, sit down, build stuff, learn what's wrong with it, fix it and get on with life."

He was eventually sought out by Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet and other automakers. (PHOTOGRAPHS VIA ERCIII TRUST) This article appeared in print on page B10.

E.V. Prices Fall as Automakers Raise Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Ford, Tesla and other automakers are having to lower prices to lure buyers as the supply of battery-powered models begins to exceed demand.
After struggling to find enough batteries and other parts for the past couple of years, automakers are finally beginning to churn out large numbers of electric cars and trucks. More than 30 new models will arrive in showrooms this year.
What they need now are more customers.
While sales of electric vehicles are increasing -- they climbed about 48 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier -- they are not rising fast enough to keep pace with the number of vehicles rolling off assembly lines. And inventories of unsold vehicles are starting to pile up.
More than 90,000 battery-powered cars and trucks are sitting on dealer lots, four times as many as a year ago, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. That's enough to last 103 days at the current rate of sales, compared with about 50 days for the industry as a whole.
Manufacturers "are having a 'Field of Dreams' moment," said Jonathan Gregory, a senior manager of economic and industry insight at Cox. "They have built E.V. inventory, but now they wait for buyers to come."
In view of this unbalanced supply and demand, automakers are cutting prices and offering more incentives. On Monday, Ford Motor reduced prices of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck by $ 6,000 to nearly $ 10,000, or as much as 17 percent on some versions. The company is also offering discounted interest rates of 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent on certain loans for Lightning purchases.
These moves follow several rounds of price cuts by Tesla, the dominant seller of electric cars. Tesla's price reductions earlier prompted Ford to lower prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle, although that hasn't brought Mach-E inventory back in line with sales.
At the end of June, Ford dealers had 16,400 of that model in stock -- about 2,000 more than they sold in the first six months of the year.
While many consumers express interest in electric vehicles, they are often not ready to go through with a purchase. Many people have been put off by high prices of electric cars and are waiting for them to cost no more than comparable gasoline models -- something that could be hastened by recent price cuts.
Other car buyers have concerns about how far these cars and trucks can travel on a full charge. Many models now available need to be recharged after traveling 200 to 250 miles. Uncertainty about finding charging stations and how long it takes to charge the vehicles can put off some people.
Glenn Staub, a personal trainer from White Plains, N.Y., said he wanted to buy a hybrid or fully electric car because of the potential environmental benefits and the savings on fuel costs. But he's not going to be in the market until his 2014 Toyota Corolla conks out.
"My policy for keeping cars is I drive it until it's not serviceable anymore," he said. That might not be for a few years; his Corolla has been driven just under 100,000 miles and runs fine.
Sales have become particularly sluggish for high-priced luxury models -- a segment of the market that has a surfeit of options from the likes of Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lucid Motors. Many of these cars cost $ 75,000 to $ 160,000.
"I think there was a lot of hype about E.V.s, and people did their research and realized these are premium vehicles and they're not cheap," said Rick Ricart, president of Ricart Automotive, which owns nine new-car franchises in Dublin, Ohio. "And there's been some pullback."
Mr. Ricart said his family's Ford store had a top-of-the-line F-150 Lightning Platinum truck on sale for $ 92,000 for more than two months. "A year ago, it would have been sold by now," he said.
Another group of electric vehicles that are struggling to find buyers are those that no longer qualify for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's ambitious climate change law. The credit is available only on cars that are assembled in North America and that include a certain percentage of battery materials from the region or from U.S. trade partners.
In addition to those restrictions, electric sedans have to sell for $ 55,000 or less to be eligible for credits, and S.U.V.s, pickup trucks and vans have to sell for $ 80,000 or less.
Purchases of Ford's Lightning trucks can make buyers eligible for the $ 7,500 credit, and the company is planning to sell a lot more of the pickups in the coming months. The company temporarily halted production this year to upgrade its assembly line and increase output. By the fall, the company expects its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near Detroit to be able to churn out 150,000 Lightnings a year, triple its current production capacity.
The company's decision to lower prices may also have something to do with the growing competition in the electric vehicle business. Tesla said on Saturday that it had started producing its much-delayed Cybertruck pickup, and General Motors is expected to soon begin delivering an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado truck.
Ford began making the Lightning in spring 2022 and raised prices several times by a total of around $ 20,000, citing increasing cost of raw materials for its batteries. At the time, demand far outstripped Ford's production, and some dealers were charging thousands of dollars more than the company's suggested retail price.
"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the E.V. truck for Ford and our customers," Marin Gjaja, the chief customer officer for the automaker's electric vehicle division, said in a statement. "We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility to help lower prices for our customers and shorten wait times."
The company's decision to cut prices unnerved investors who feared it would hurt Ford's profits, and its stock price fell 6 percent on Monday.
Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $ 49,995, a reduction of $ 9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $ 8,879, to $ 69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $ 91,995, or $ 6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $ 80,000, making them eligible for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.

Ford said the Pro model of the F-150 Lightning now had a list price of $49,995, a reduction of $9,979. The XLT 312A model with an extended range battery was cut $8,879, to $69,995. The top-of-the-line Platinum extended-range model will sell for $91,995, or $6,079 less than its price last week.
As a result of price cuts, most Lightning models will cost less than $80,000, making them eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe you've heard there's a Barbie movie coming out?
Well, this isn't about that. It is, however, about the 11½ inches of intellectual property that inspired all the madness: the doll itself.
You know the one. Often blond, always smiling, occasionally naked and neglected at the bottom of a toy chest? Chances are you do: According to Mattel, more than 100 dolls are sold every minute, and quite a few minutes have elapsed since Barbie made her debut, at a toy industry trade show, in 1959.
Just as remarkable as the ways the doll has changed since then are the ways it hasn't. Like the characters on "Sesame Street" or "South Park," Barbie exists alongside us without quite aging with us -- reflecting our times, but not our wrinkles.
That adaptive consistency may play a role in maintaining her cultural ubiquity (alongside her literal ubiquity), for while the things that make Barbie Barbie may get a face lift every few years, the DNA remains unchanged.
From her hair to her feet, her portfolio of properties to her fleet of automobiles, practically everything in Barbie's tiny plastic world bears her unmistakable signature. How? It's all about the visuals.
Turns Out, It Doesn't Grow Back
Since Barbie first hit the market, rocking a ponytail and curly micro-bangs, her hair has undergone countless changes, from her feathery bouffants and bobs of the 1960s to her "flip" styles of the '70s. Today, you can find Barbies with different updos, highlights, Afros and a range of hair textures. If a hairstyle has been in vogue, there's a good chance that Barbie has at least tried it.
Obsession with the doll's hair reached a peak in 1992, the year Mattel released Totally Hair Barbie, whose 11.5 inches of crimped hair fell down to her toes. According to Mattel, it remains the best-selling Barbie in history.
But for all the variety in Barbie's hair over the decades, nothing came close to the at-home customization children would give to their dolls. There exists a venerable tradition of cutting it with a pair of scissors, often leaving her ends frayed and uneven. Some children would apply paint or Kool-Aid to her tresses -- a de facto form of hair dye -- or dip them in hot water in an attempt to form curls. Plenty of people can say they first learned how to braid or make a ponytail using their Barbie dolls as practice.
Of course, there were many others who accepted her hair as is. But in a society with beauty standards that historically haven't been kind to those without blond, straight or thick hair, transforming Barbie's hair in their own image was one way children could really make the doll their own.

Living Life on Tiptoe
One needs only to see a perfectly pointed foot, positioned to fit neatly into a high heel, to know it belongs to Barbie. The doll's feet spawned an Instagram trend in 2018, and in the first shot of the trailer for the coming "Barbie" movie, Margot Robbie steps out of a pair of pompommed stilettoes onto the ball of her foot, her heel still suspended in air. It's a look as glamorous as it is unnatural; while promoting the film, Ms. Robbie explained that to get the shot, she had to hold on to a bar to keep her balance.
Though a Barbie from the 1970s could wear flats as well as heels, Barbies who could wear flats didn't become mainstream until 2015, when Mattel released a line of dolls with ankles that could be manipulated to fit into flat shoes. Some saw it as a sign that Barbie was modernizing, moving away from outdated standards of femininity.
Although Barbie's feet have stood for years as a sort of visual shorthand for the doll itself, Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatric surgeon, said that if Barbie were human, she would be wise to get checked out for equinus, a chronic condition that often results from tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon, sometimes because of long-term stiletto use.
Even with the risks, Dr. Parthasarathy doesn't think women need to retire their high heels for good. Still, she cautioned, "we don't want too many people wearing high heels all the time, because women should also be comfortable."

Proportional Misrepresentation
Is there anything more symbolic of all that is surreal about Barbie -- the way the doll gave young women a twisted idea of the perfect body, the way she represented female reality distorted by male fantasy (she was based on a German doll meant to be enjoyed at bachelor parties) -- than her measurements? Her pneumatic bosom, teeny waist, blossoming hips and endless legs are just the most obvious distortions. The more you look into her proportions, the clearer it becomes that she is unlike anything ever made in nature -- even Margot Robbie.
Indeed, there have been various efforts to scale her up to adult size, simply to reveal the impossibility of her body shape, which originally clocked in at about 39-18-33. In a 1995 article in The International Journal of Eating Disorders, researchers calculated that to attain Barbie proportions, a healthy adult woman would have to "increase 24 inches in height, 5 inches in the chest and 3.2 inches in neck length, while decreasing 6 inches in the waist." Ten years ago, Rehabs.com issued a report that examined Barbie's effect on young girls' body image, noting that the odds of finding someone with the doll's chest-to-waist ratio were in the billions. The neck of a life-size Barbie would be too thin to support her head, and her torso would have room for only half a liver.
Barbie got a new body in 1998 -- slightly wider waist, smaller chest and hips. By 2016 Mattel had caved to pressure and offered petite, tall and curvy Barbies. But despite all the supposedly more realistic options, impossible Barbie remains the standard Barbie for many. When it comes to the psychology of our physiology, she defies not just nature, but reason and expectations.

The Original Boy Toy
Barbie's ultimate accessory is her man. Since Mattel's introduction of the Ken doll in 1961, Barbie's boyfriend has entered the public imagination as a benevolent himbo, a chisel-jawed foil to her dynamism and curves. Their relationship is sexless (neither has genitals) but supportive: In early promotional images, Barbie occupies the foreground while Ken stands behind her to carry a bag or offer her a flower.
Ken arrived two years after Barbie, a literal afterthought. The original doll was a slim blond who wore skimpy red swim trunks. He beefed up as he tried on the styles of each decade: In the 1970s, there was Sport & Shave Ken, who had bulging forearms and a 5 o'clock shadow. By the 1990s, Ken had a Harley.
His image has been lightly complicated over time. Earring Magic Ken, released in 1993, became a cult item among gay men thanks to his pierced ear. In 2017, amid flagging sales, Mattel released a suite of Kens of different races, body shapes and hairdos (one had a man bun). Ken was no longer a monolith, Caity Weaver wrote in GQ: "He can be complicated, mysterious -- maybe even vegan."
Depending on whom you ask, Ken may be the epitome of emasculation, an all-American sex symbol, a feminist fantasy or a gay icon. He is all of this while still being secondary to Barbie. "She's everything," the poster for the "Barbie" movie reads. "He's just Ken."

Not Too Shabby for a Bachelorette Pad
It has taken many architectural forms over the decades, from a three-story townhouse with groovy Verner Panton-style furniture introduced in 1974 to a pink mansion with a balcony and a turret released in 1995, but one aspect of the Barbie Dreamhouse has remained consistent: its lone occupant.
"Even when she has a huge suburban mansion, she has a single bed," said Whitney Mallett, an editor, with Felix Burrichter, of "Barbie Dreamhouse: An Architectural Survey." "Ken does not live there. It's Barbie's house, Barbie's world."
The Dreamhouse has long functioned as both a design lab -- reflecting the changing American interior at a sort of time lag (recent versions have eco-conscious additions like recycling bins) -- and a playground for female self-invention. The first version, a foldout ranch home introduced in 1962, included a bed, a sofa and a stereo console but no kitchen. It was a signal -- radical for its time -- that Barbie's life would not be centered on family or domestic labor but rather on hosting friends and pursuing a career (or, in Barbie's case, many, many careers).
Around 1990, Dreamhouses were supersized, and the elevators, spiral staircases, two-story slides and other over-the-top décor suggested affluence in Barbie's fictional life -- as did her Malibu, Calif., address. "The luxurious expansion of the Barbie Dreamhouse tracks economic expansion in the United States and conspicuous consumption," said Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, curator of contemporary design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.
As for the play set itself, it was made first out of cardboard and then out of molded plastic, inexpensive materials seemingly at odds with the fantasy interiors. But the contradiction makes sense, considering the mass-market nature of Barbie herself: The doll who has everything, at least materially, can be had for $ 5.97 at Walmart.
-- Steven Kurutz
A Clotheshorse With Room to Gallop
Barbie made her entrance into the world in a knit, black-and-white-striped, strapless one-piece swimsuit, but even back then she had other outfits -- 22 of them, in fact. Over the years, she acquired clothes almost as quickly as she was acquired; Mattel estimates that by this point, over one billion outfits have been made for Barbie and her clan, using over 105 million yards of fabric.
Her wardrobe has been a mirror held up to our most identifiable trends over the decades -- a sleeveless blouse and a pencil skirt in the '60s, a bandanna print halter-neck maxi dress in the '70s, an aerobics-ready purple leotard and matching leg warmers in the '80s -- and to our sense of self. Barbie always dressed the parts we allowed ourselves to imagine, from debutante to doctor. Her outfits helped keep her relevant.
Little wonder fashion loves her. Dozens of designers have done special Barbie collaborations, starting with Oscar de la Renta in 1985. There have been Bob Mackie Barbie (1990, in gold paillettes and white marabou stole), Dior Barbie (1997, complete with throwback New Look jacket and skirt), Diane von Furstenberg Barbie (2006, wearing a signature pink-and-white wrap dress and toting a wheelie bag) and Moschino Barbie (in 2015, with faux leather outfit), to name a few.
In 2009, for Barbie's 50th birthday, 50 designers created life-size Barbie-inspired looks for a special runway show at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, Barbie was given the Board of Directors' Tribute by the Council of Fashion Designers of America -- an award that had previously been bestowed on Michelle Obama and Gloria Steinem. Why? Well, Barbie may not be us, but her wardrobe is.
-- Vanessa Friedman
Tickled a Very Specific Pink
Though she is now synonymous with a pink so distinctive that she has co-opted the Pantone swatch 219 C, Barbie made her 1959 debut in monochrome. With just a pop of crimson on her lips, Barbie's black-and-white striped bathing suit provided a neutral springboard that begged to be swapped out for one of 22 other looks (sold separately) in a classic palette of mostly navy, black and red.
Still, there was a hint of the pink to come in a few pieces from Barbie's debut collection: notably, the "Nighty Negligee" dressing gown and the regrettably named "Plantation Belle" ensemble, which featured a flirty pink tea-length frock and matching straw purse. Those particular pinks were a far cry from neon, more reflective of the soigné shades immortalized in the "Think Pink" sequence from the 1957 film "Funny Face." "That candy pink totally suited the moment," said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute.
But the moment changes. The collector and author Bradley Justice cites the late '60s as the time when the relative restraint of Barbie's wardrobe gave way to the pop influence of Mod. Fluorescent colors increasingly came into play in the '70s. Kim Culmone, Mattel's head of design for Barbie, points to the boa-draped Superstar Barbie in 1977 as the first moment the doll "went full-on pink."
The dawn of the '80s ushered in a taste for all things brighter and bolder, and with it, Barbie's signature color. In 2011, Mattel and the industry color authority Pantone teamed up on a Barbie doll swathed in 219 C, a shade already available to the public, and the association stuck. The color is a rich, turbocharged pink that telegraphs the potency and staying power of Barbie not just as a toy but as a global brand.
-- Jeremy Allen
Top Down, Wind in Her Stitched-In Hair
Barbie's taste for the finer things extends well beyond fashion. Her car collection -- sports cars, Jeeps, even a camper -- as well as the various shades of pink that it comes in, is proof.
Her first car, introduced in 1962, was an Austin-Healey 3000 Mark II. The British sports car came in a variety of colors -- most indelibly, a faded light orange with aqua seats, a silver steering wheel and dashboard, whitewall tires and silver hubcaps. It was perhaps sleeker than later Barbie rides, and her signature car -- all-American this time -- was yet to come.
In 1976, the Star 'Vette, as Barbie's Chevrolet Corvette was called, became an immediate touchstone of the doll's image and an enduring staple of her car collection. The toy sports car came in metallic shades of hot pink and purple with shooting star decals on the hood and either of its two doors. Her luggage also came attached to the top of the trunk. Barbie was on the move.
A label on the original packaging called the micro-Corvette a "dream machine for Barbie doll and her friends."
The Star 'Vette has made an appearance in every decade since. Barbie's garage would later grow to include a Ferrari 328 GTS, a Porsche 911 Cabriolet and, in 2000, a Volkswagen New Beetle.
With the top down and room for a passenger friend, Barbie's image took on another meaning, showing girls that the freedom of the road was theirs to enjoy, too.
-- Frank Rojas
A Closet's Worth of Choking Hazards
The designer Michael Kors once called accessories the exclamation point of an outfit. When it comes to Barbie, her accessories also became, for countless parents of Barbie-loving children, the exclamation point at the end of "Ouch!" -- as in "Ouch! I just stepped on a tiny stiletto!"
Household annoyances aside -- dogs eating her handbags, vacuums sucking up her cat-eye sunglasses -- a Barbie is largely defined by her accessories. Once upon a time, these accessories were fashion-forward and valuable collectibles. In the 1960s, a doll-size fur stole made of real mink was sold at Sears for $ 9.99 -- the equivalent of almost $ 100 today.
But as Barbie collected more occupations and hobbies, her accessories became more like identity totems. Today, Music Producer Barbie carries a sound mixing board and wears over-the-ear headphones. Teacher Barbie comes with a blackboard and thick-framed glasses. Fashion Designer Barbie wears statement necklaces and a sewing tape measure around her neck. Where would Surfer Skipper or Surfer Ken be without their accompanying surfboards? At the bottom of the toy box, waiting to be given -- via accessory -- a purpose.
-- Jessica Testa
Dressed for Success, in Every Field Imaginable
Barbie is the ultimate career woman. Who else among us has been a fighter pilot, UNICEF ambassador, marine biologist, cupcake chef, computer engineer and aerobics instructor?
Inevitably, for someone with a résumé boasting more than 250 different occupations over six decades and diamond-hard ambition barely concealed by her fluffy exterior, Barbie's extensive toolbox has grown in line with the advances of modern women in the workplace. In the 1960s, fans could buy Barbie as a ballerina with ribboned shoes; a student teacher with notebooks and glasses; or a registered nurse with medicine, a hot water bottle and a diploma (though as the space race took off, an astronaut Barbie came with a white helmet, a silver suit and snazzy zip-up moon boots). Later on, Barbie also became a veterinarian, complete with a white jacket, plastic cats and dogs, and a stethoscope; an Olympic swimmer with goggles and medals; and an entrepreneur, armed with an iPhone and a tablet displaying a rather promising-looking bar chart.
In recent years, Barbie, who has never had children, has focused on building a career in STEM (the acronym used for science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- all fields in which women are underrepresented). Now, Barbie comes as a science researcher, a robotics engineer and a software developer, with free coding classes for those who buy those dolls.

'Undress Me Everywhere'
To play with Barbie is to take her clothes off. It's all right there in the Aqua song: "You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere." And you can undress her everywhere: Her pelvis is smooth plastic, devoid of anything remotely clinical or anatomically correct. After all, despite what Greta Gerwig's film would have you believe, she is not a human woman.
Still, that distinction hasn't stopped Barbie's nether region from stirring up some controversy. In the mid-1990s, Mattel released Teacher Barbie, an educator doll that sported a skater dress covered in numbers and apples and that came with her own blackboard. Teacher Barbie, like many a Barbie doll, was issued without any underwear. (If you want to get technical, her pelvic area was lightly textured to represent underwear, according to a report from The Journal Times of Racine, Wis.) Moral outrage ensued, and the doll was ultimately reissued with cloth underwear. "They keep forgetting it's a child's toy, and when we put our adult eyes on it, we see things kids don't think of," a spokeswoman for Mattel told the newspaper.
Strangely, there was no such hand-wringing over whether Elizabethan Queen Barbie, issued the same year as Teacher Barbie, needed a set of panties.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 1973, Uri Geller claimed to bend metal with his mind on live television. Skeptics couldn't beat him. Now they've joined him.
In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC's most popular television shows, "The Dimbleby Talk-In," and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Mr. Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
"It's cracking," Mr. Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. "It's becoming like plastic."
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Mr. Geller became not just a global celebrity -- a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice -- but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn't explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
"I've never even seen a magic show," Mr. Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. "Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight."
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show "The Next Uri Geller," which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It's a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Mr. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the '70s and '80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Mr. Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled "Bend It Like Geller," which was written by the Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the "Talk-In" appearance, the book celebrates Mr. Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Mr. Harris, who was once among Mr. Geller's most avid debunkers.
Today, Mr. Harris and Mr. Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Mr. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, "Gellerism Revealed," as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Mr. Geller is an entertainer, one who'd figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Mr. Geller's bent spoons are, in a sense, the analog precursors of digital deep fakes -- images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Mr. Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Mr. Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in "The Matrix."
"It's not the spoon that bends," a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves's character. "It is only yourself."
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Mr. Geller can't actually bend metal with his brain -- and civility and fairness demands this "if" -- he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Mr. Geller's claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
"I mean this in the most respectful way," said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Mr. Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. "I think the world is aware that if he's fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging."
The best publicist in the world
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Mr. Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
"Where are you all from?" he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
"Thank you for coming to Israel!" he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Mr. Geller is a vegan who doesn't drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he'll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a "mystifier." Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
"I tell them, 'Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,"' he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. "This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience."
Mr. Geller never retired, though he doesn't travel much any more and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours -- no walk-ins, please -- to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $ 6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $ 10 million.
In Britain, Mr. Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news -- offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
"I'm the best publicist in the world, come on," he said, matter-of-factly. "You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn't matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant."
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Mr. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That's a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
"Yoko Ono, amazing woman," he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. "She always wears Porsche glasses."
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn't told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending ("Doesn't matter how I do it, whether it's real or not") and then a slightly off-key version of "My Way," in a recording sung by Mr. Geller himself, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people -- including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
"I have so many questions," said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Mr. Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting 'Bend!' in unison
By the time Mr. Geller appeared on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother's kitchen around age 5. It didn't occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer's key.
"The guy freaked out and said, 'I'm having a house party tonight, will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,"' Mr. Geller recalled. "I go and I'm stunned. I'm stunned by the reaction."
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Mr. Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he'd visited in Rome. Ms. Loren's objections made front-page news in Israel, and Mr. Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening's show in Haifa.
"I get to the theater that night, there are 400 people outside without tickets," he said. "It was sold out. That's when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter."
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on "The Tonight Show," and for 20 intensely awkward minutes Mr. Geller didn't even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe's unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn't need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Mr. Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain's most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show's host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Mr. Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
"Can you do that?" Mr. Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
"Of course," Mr. Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
"Yes," Mr. Dimbleby said, unimpressed, "but you're a magician."
'I basically call him a fraud'
One early Geller devotee was Mr. Harris, who watched the "Dimbleby" show from his grandparents' home in Sydney, Australia. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Mr. Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
"I was totally sucked in," he said in a recent phone interview. "If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown."
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn't among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn't dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Mr. Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Mr. Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Mr. Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Mr. Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
"It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man," Mr. Harris said during a recent video call with Mr. Geller. "He started to unravel it, then said: 'No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it's bent and let me know."'
It was not bent. By then, Mr. Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents' spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Mr. Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book "Gellerism Revealed" is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
"I basically call him a fraud and charlatan," he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Mr. Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
"He is intending to enter the 'psychic healing' field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people," he wrote in an edition of his book "The Truth About Uri Geller." He also called Mr. Geller a "dangerous and insidious figure," one he intended to stop "at all costs."
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Mr. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Mr. Randi, including one for claiming that Mr. Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Mr. Randi burned through most of his $ 272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Mr. Geller's eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It's true that Mr. Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies who thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $ 3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Mr. Geller's track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can't remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer's remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like "Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All."
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Mr. Randi's appearance on Barbara Walters's talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Mr. Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Mr. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
"Here is my identical key," Ms. Walters told Mr. Randi, challenging him to equal Mr. Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. "Touch it and make it bend."
A few moments later, the key is bent. Ms. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Mr. Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Mr. Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, "Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer."
The new sleight of hand
The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and today magic and technology are merging. Start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
"Geller's bent spoon demonstrations and deep fakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we're seeing," said Alice Pailhès, an author of "The Psychology of Magic." "Both elicit strong emotional responses -- confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia."
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you're likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deep fake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it's going to take much more than Mr. Randi and Ben Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series "Death by Magic," said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Mr. Geller.
Mr. Money-Coutts first met Mr. Geller in 2003. A student at the British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Mr. Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. ("I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came," Mr. Money-Coutts recalled.) Mr. Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn't equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
"It was decadence," he said. "I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?"
Mr. Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, though his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-80s -- a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family -- he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
"I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers," he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, "and I thought, 'I've got to get out of this."'
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can't truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant "Sprout!" over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as though it had been willed to blossom.
"Among magicians," asked a cheeky young man, during the question and answer part of the presentation, "was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?"
"Are you serious?" Mr. Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. "Do you really think that I'm going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!"

TEL AVIV, Israel — In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC’s most popular television shows, “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
“It’s cracking,” Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. “It’s becoming like plastic.”
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Geller became not just a global celebrity — a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice — but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn’t explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
“I’ve never even seen a magic show,” Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. “Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight.”
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show “The Next Uri Geller,” which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It’s a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the ’70s and ’80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled “Bend It Like Geller,” which was written by Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the “Talk-In” appearance, the book celebrates Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Harris, who was once among Geller’s most avid debunkers.
Today, Harris and Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, “Gellerism Revealed,” as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Geller is an entertainer, one who’d figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Geller’s bent spoons are, in a sense, the analogue precursors of digital deepfakes — images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in “The Matrix.”
“It’s not the spoon that bends,” a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves’ character. “It is only yourself.”
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Geller can’t actually bend metal with his brain — and civility and fairness demands this “if” — he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Geller’s claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
“I mean this in the most respectful way,” said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. “I think the world is aware that if he’s fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging.”
The Best Publicist in the World
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
“Where are you all from?” he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
“Thank you for coming to Israel!” he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Geller is a vegan who doesn’t drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he’ll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a “mystifier.” Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
“I tell them, ‘Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,’” he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. “This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience.”
Geller never retired, although he doesn’t travel much anymore and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours — no walk-ins, please — to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $10 million.
In Britain, Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news — offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
“I’m the best publicist in the world, come on,” he said, matter-of-factly. “You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn’t matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant.”
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That’s a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
“Yoko Ono, amazing woman,” he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. “She always wears Porsche glasses.”
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn’t told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending (“Doesn’t matter how I do it, whether it’s real or not”) and then a slightly off-key version of “My Way,” in a recording sung by Geller, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people — including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
“I have so many questions,” said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting ‘Bend!’ in Unison
By the time Geller appeared on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother’s kitchen around age 5.

The New Sleight of Hand
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and today magic and technology are merging. Startups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
“Geller’s bent spoon demonstrations and deepfakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we’re seeing,” said Alice Pailhès, an author of “The Psychology of Magic.” “Both elicit strong emotional responses — confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia.”
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you’re likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deepfake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it’s going to take much more than Randi and Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series “Death by Magic,” said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Geller.
Money-Coutts first met Geller in 2003. A student at British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. (“I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came,” Money-Coutts recalled.) Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn’t equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
“It was decadence,” he said. “I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?”
Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, although his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-’80s — a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family — he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
“I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers,” he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, “and I thought, ‘I’ve got to get out of this.’”
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can’t truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant “Sprout!” over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as if it had been willed to blossom.
“Among magicians,” asked a cheeky young man, during the question-and-answer part of the presentation, “was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?”
“Are you serious ?” Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. “Do you really think that I’m going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!”

Full text: The News
Volkswagen is replacing the chief executive at its luxury brand Audi, naming Gernot Döllner to take over from Markus Duesmann, as the company seeks to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles.
Mr. Döllner, who has served as Volkswagen's leading strategist, will start his new role on Sept. 1, Audi said in a statement on Thursday. Audi, although profitable, is struggling to convert to battery power and compete with the growing threat from Chinese carmakers.
Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's chief executive before Oliver Blume took over in September, brought Mr. Duesmann to Audi from BMW three years ago, with the hope that he could help the brand innovate and strengthen sales of its electric models.
The company's earnings grew 40 percent to 7.6 billion euros, or $ 8.3 billion, in 2022, thanks to a decision to prioritize its higher-end vehicles over more affordable cars as it worked through a chips shortage caused by the supply chain disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic.
Audi is now working on its final generation of combustion engine models and plans to bring 10 new electric models to its lineup, ahead of plans to produce only E.V.s beginning in 2026.
What It Means: Audi faces competition for electric vehicles.
Audi is Volkswagen's second-most-important luxury line, after Porsche. Although Porsche has successfully broken into the market for electric vehicles, Audi's strength has been the continued popularity of its combustion engine vehicles.
Now, the company faces stiff competition from the leading producers of electric vehicles, such as Tesla and Chinese automakers. Mr. Blume has said he expects the company to maintain 14 percent growth and wants to see Audi better coordinate its production with both VW and Porsche.
That will be easier with Mr. Döllner as the company's head, as he worked many years alongside Mr. Blume when both were top-level managers at Porsche, which like Audi is owned by the Volkswagen Group.
Mr. Döllner has been working at Volkswagen since 1993, while still earning his doctorate. He served as head of Porsche's four-door Panamera sedan series, which he helped develop.
What's Next: A focus on North America and China.
A main focus for Mr. Döllner will be to push ahead talks on opening a factory in North America. Audi's main competitors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, both have production facilities in the United States, allowing them to produce nearly twice as many vehicles for that market. Audi's S.U.V.s are popular with U.S. drivers, and the company is looking at developing electric versions of several of its leading models.
In China, Audi's combustion engine vehicles remain popular, but the company needs to speed up production of electric vehicles if the brand is to remain competitive with popular local producers, including BYD and Chery.

How the Newest 'Transformers' Throws a '90s Hip-Hop Party: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The director and production designer of the latest installment in the robot action franchise discuss recreating the sights and sounds of 1990s Brooklyn culture.
In previous "Transformers" movies, fans have seen their beloved robots Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Arcee battle their way out of plenty a dilemma. But have they ever seen an Autobot kick butt to the rhymes of LL Cool J? That's the energy of "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts" (in theaters), with its director Steven Caple Jr. giving the franchise an inclusive spin.
The down on his luck Brooklyn native Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos) is recruited by the Autobots to retrieve an artifact held by the museum researcher Elena Wallace (Dominique Fishback) that could transport the stranded Autobots back to their home planet, Cybertron.
Robot fights ensue (mainly with a rival faction called the Terrorcons), but apart from the dazzling effects and globe-trotting backdrops, what gives Caple's film its singular identity is the 1990s New York City hip-hop it takes inspiration from.
"The '90s was a specific era, in general, that is definitely what we wanted to tap into with the film," Caple said in an audio interview. A sense of Black cultural spirit -- the fashion, music, and community -- was one that Caple felt was missing from many big budget movies of that decade. He said that it was only present if you were watching films by Black directors like John Singleton and Ernest Dickerson, major influences for Caple.
To imbue the film with this nostalgic presence, the production first needed to transform a section of Montreal into Brooklyn. The effects of gentrification in Brooklyn were a factor that necessitated the move across the border. The team referred to the photography of Jamel Shabazz and the television series "New York Undercover" as visual touchstones to capture the city's past aesthetics. They also scoured Montreal for a semblance of a street that could serve as Noah's neighborhood, and populated the area with vintage Oldsmobiles, Cavaliers and an Acura Legend. A tracking shot near the film's beginning creates a vivid reawakening of the era: Noah walks down the street past classic cars, and through scenes of people sitting on crates and drinking quarter waters, of some selling tapes out of their trunk.
Caple and the production designer Sean Haworth credited Ramos and Fishback -- both New York natives -- with providing notes that added to the film's authenticity.
"They start bringing things that they remembered from their childhood," said Haworth in an interview, "things they liked or the music they listened to, the books they read."
Another texture from the '90s arises in the film's period-accurate fashions. Caple credited the costume designer Ciara Whaley with rewatching television shows like "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Living Single" to inspire the fly look composed of chokers and suspenders for Fishback's Elena. For Noah's appearance, Caple wanted to draw from the decade's popular clothing lines. "I was very specific in being like, I wanna work with the Karl Kanis and the Walker Wear, the gear we were pushing during that time, but also were Black owned," he said.
While the film's visual callbacks are imperative, it's the hip-hop soundtrack that gives "Rise of the Beasts" its sonic verve. The music occasionally springs from diegetic sources. Fishback, for instance, suggested to Caple that Elena should sing to herself whenever she's nervous. It's why when the Terrorcons infiltrate Elena's museum, she can be heard crooning TLC's "Waterfalls" to herself.
At other times, a needle drop of a radio classic will propel a scene, such as Digable Planets' "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)" powering a heist sequence whereby Noah attempts to steal an Autobot disguised as a Porsche. Other soundtrack samplings include Black Sheep's "The Choice Is Yours," The Notorious B.I.G.'s "Hypnotize," A Tribe Called Quest's "Check the Rhime" and Wu-Tang Clan's "C.R.E.A.M." The music remains prominent even when the action shifts from the confines of New York City to the rolling hills of Peru. During the final battle between the Autobots and Terrorcons, LL Cool J's "Mama Said Knock You Out" provides a sharp punch that put a dent in the film's budget.
"It fits so perfectly, but the studio said this is gonna be the most expensive song in the movie," Caple said. "It was that pricey. But it just felt so right."
As did commissioning the soundtrack's sole original song, "On My Soul," by Tobe Nwigwe (who also stars as Noah's friend Reek) and the hip-hop legend Nas, featuring Jacob Banks. The defiant track not only gives the final battle a firmer edge beyond the easy grooves of the throwback needle drops, it marries contemporary recording techniques with '90s flair, particularly through Nas's sharp verses. In an interview, Nwigwe said that Nas "came in and just cooked up greatness."
To Caple, harnessing the '90s hip-hop scene was more than artistically fulfilling. It's a vision of urban Blackness that needn't be politically important, even as it showcases a specific cultural lens of music and fashion. And while it's easy to see "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts" as a bid for nostalgia, Caple doesn't want to call it a comeback. It's a resurgence.

Firefighter Drowns in N.J. Trying to Save His Daughter: [National Desk]

Full text: There were no lifeguards on duty at Avon-by-the-Sea, along the New Jersey shore, on Friday.
The day began with a dip into the cool Atlantic waters along the New Jersey shore near Avon-by-the-Sea.
Mark Batista, a father of three and a veteran member of the New York Fire Department, brought his family to the beach on Friday morning, when the salty ocean air fell just shy of 70 degrees. Soon after, his daughter made a beeline toward the waves, splashing as she waded deeper into the dark blue.
Suddenly, a deadly rip current emerged. The narrow, fast-moving stream swept her farther and farther away from the shore.
Mr. Batista rushed in to rescue her, friends and authorities said. But the ocean, in all its cruelty, pulled him under.
Mr. Batista, 39, a longtime firefighter and emergency medical technician, drowned, according to Jim Long, a spokesman for the Fire Department.
He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead. His daughter, whose name and age have not been released, survived.
Their relationship was described in a social media post a few months before Mr. Batista's death. "I can't promise to be here the rest of your life," he wrote in October on Instagram along with a photo of his smiling daughter, her arms wrapped around his neck. "But what I can promise is to love you for the rest of mine."
Mr. Batista's drowning was the second along the nearly 130-mile New Jersey coastline this year, according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service. The other victim was a 15-year-old boy who died over Memorial Day weekend at Sandy Hook Beach. He was also pulled out to sea by a rip current.
In both cases, no lifeguards were on duty where the drownings occurred, according to the data and the Monmouth County Sheriff's Office.
Lifeguards at Avon-by-the-Sea will begin to work full time on Saturday, according to the community's website. On Friday, after Mr. Batista's death, the sheriff's office issued a statement on Facebook warning "all to please not to go in the water when there are no lifeguards on duty."
Mr. Batista first joined the New York Fire Department Emergency Medical Services in 2008. He spent about five years as an emergency medical technician before becoming a firefighter, Mr. Long said. He was most recently assigned to Engine Company 226 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
"We are heartbroken to learn about the death of Firefighter Mark Batista," Mr. Long said in a statement.
"Firefighter Batista was a dedicated public servant who spent 15 years serving in the FDNY," he added. "We join his family in mourning his tragic passing."
Mr. Batista's body was transferred on Sunday from the Middlesex County Medical Examiner to Vander Plaat Colonial Home in Fair Lawn, N.J., according a memo obtained by The New York Times that was sent to Fire Department firefighters and emergency service workers.
Mr. Batista's wife, Lenin Batista, posted a message to friends and family on Instagram. "I feel lost, heartbroken and very afraid," she wrote in Spanish.
On Sunday morning, Janelle Rivera, a veteran emergency service technician and Mr. Batista's longtime friend, had not yet heard about his drowning, she said later.
As she sat down to drink her coffee, she picked up her phone and saw she had dozens of unread messages. She opened one and saw a photo of Mr. Batista along with a picture of a purple and black striped flag. They were the colors of the mourning bunting, a pleated fabric drape that hangs over a firehouse to signify the death of a member.
Ms. Rivera was stunned.
She thought of how she met Mr. Batista when he worked at E.M.S. Station 45 in Queens. She remembered the near-fatal motorcycle accident Mr. Batista was in, just a few years ago, the one that made him rethink how he spent his time in the world. She thought of how he often took his family to the shore because his daughter loved the ocean.
Ms. Rivera also recalled running into Mr. Batista about a month ago at Fire Department headquarters in Brooklyn. He was driving his prized white Porsche.
On that day, Mr. Batista talked about his wife as he always did. "Every second of every day, he made sure his wife knew how much he cherished and valued her. And that meant so much to me, knowing someone in the world like that exists," Ms. Rivera said. "Anytime I had a bad day, I could just look upon him to give me hope that it's possible to be loved that way."
"That his wife had to watch him go into that water and not come out, it kills me," she added. "The life of his daughter is the result of his heroism, and that is everything a wife and mother could ever ask for."

Can Federal Investment Persuade America To Go Green?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Electric vehicles are rare in Moses Lake, Wash., a small city in the fertile Columbia Basin about a three-hour drive east of Seattle. In that conservative farms-and-factories community, few people have the cash or the inclination. The only electric vehicle I saw during a two-day visit last month was a Tesla in the hotel parking lot.
Over the next few years, however, hundreds of Moses Lake residents are going to be entering the electric vehicle business. Two different companies, attracted by cheap hydropower, are opening plants there, each backed by $ 100 million in federal money, to produce a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries.
The investment is part of the roughly half a trillion dollars the Biden administration is marshaling to transform an economy fueled by carbon into one fueled by clean, renewable energy, and it illustrates a gamble at the heart of that broader effort.
Instead of delivering electric vehicles, solar panels and other green technologies at the lowest possible cost, no matter their country of origin, the Biden administration is determined to use this opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing. And it is concentrating much of that effort in rural and Rust Belt communities, where reactionary politics have taken hold most strongly. The plan to combat global warming is also a bid for industrial revival and a transformed political landscape.
There is a real risk that President Biden's economic and political aims will come into conflict with his environmental goals. If domestic production results in higher costs, that could suppress demand for electric vehicles. Political opposition to renewable energy, on the rise in many conservative communities, could impede production. But giving people an economic stake in the transition to green energy may well be the nation's best chance to build a durable political consensus in favor of confronting global warming.
The novelist Upton Sinclair observed, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."
Well, the opposite is true, too.
In Moses Lake, where one city official described the local version of the American dream to me as "house-boat-truck," it is possible to imagine that one day in the not-too-distant future, workers at the battery plants will be driving electric pickups.
The environmental case for investing 200 million tax dollars in Moses Lake is that gas-powered vehicles produce 24 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, and persuading consumers to drive electric vehicles instead is going to require a lot of batteries that are more powerful and more affordable than what's available today.
Right now, almost all electric vehicles are powered by batteries that use graphite to store electricity. Scientists have long known that silicon can hold more energy than graphite. But silicon swells as it charges, with results much like a soda can left in a freezer. The two companies building factories in Moses Lake, Sila Nanotechnologies and Group14 Technologies, make specially modified forms of silicon that solve the swelling problem. Batteries using the special sand can propel vehicles up to 20 percent farther than existing batteries. Recharging is a lot faster, too.
At Group14's first plant, outside Seattle, trays of carbon that look like badly burned brownies emerge from a long oven and are milled into a powder so fine that a thimbleful could coat a hockey rink. The key to Group14's technology is that each of those tiny grains of carbon is about two-thirds air, like a very porous sponge or a coral reef. The grains are then placed in a chamber of silane, a gaseous form of silicon, which fills about half of their interiors, leaving room for expansion when the silicon is charged. The resulting black powder is shipped to battery plants, where it will be painted onto thin strips of metal and stacked inside batteries.
Sila, which uses a different process to reach similar ends, has its own small factory at its Bay Area headquarters. Together, the two companies make enough powder to power a few hundred vehicles per year. The factories in Moses Lake, which together will cost more than $ 700 million, will each produce enough for about 200,000 vehicles a year. Group14 has signed Porsche as an investor and a customer; Sila is working with Mercedes-Benz.
Both companies say they would have moved ahead even without direct federal funding. But the money does mean that they can grow faster. Rick Luebbe, the chief executive of Group14, said the company was able to raise additional capital on the back of the federal money, allowing it to build two production lines in Moses Lake rather than one. "It's a validation for people who want to work for us, for people who want to support us, and for customers," he said.
It would take 400 more factories the size of the ones in Moses Lake to make enough silicon to power all the vehicles produced in an average year. But the government isn't betting just on silicon. It is simultaneously funding an even bigger expansion of graphite manufacturing at factories in Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee. It's also backing companies pursuing other alternatives to graphite, and other potential breakthroughs in battery technology. The government is trying to pick winners only in the sense that it wants the next big idea in batteries to be made in the United States.
Backing domestic production marks a break with decades of federal economic policy that treated low prices as the primary goal, and imports as the best way to achieve that goal. In 2005, for example, the government introduced tax credits for the installation of solar panels, without restrictions on the country of origin. Over the next six years, imports of Chinese solar panels increased to $ 2.7 billion a year, up from $ 21 million a year.
Chinese companies also have raced ahead in the market for electric vehicle batteries, but the Biden administration is hoping to leapfrog them by investing in a new generation of ideas. China controls three-quarters of the world's supply of graphite, but "our technology requires sand and energy," said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila. "Those can be sourced in quite a lot of places."
The federal government is also rigging the competition against Chinese producers. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, buyers of electric vehicles are eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500. But as of April 18, the credit is available only if at least half of the value of the vehicle's battery was produced in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and at least 40 percent of the minerals were produced in the United States or by an approved list of allies. Over the next few years, those requirements will gradually rise to 100 percent for the battery and 80 percent for the minerals.
Other subsidies could take an additional $ 9,000 off the price of cars with American batteries. The incentives are enough that for the first time, some electric vehicles are now cheaper than comparable gas-powered cars.
The residents of Moses Lake are eagerly anticipating the benefits.
Adan Lopez, 20, is studying physics at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake. He isn't sure whether he wants to stay in the area. "Jobs are kind of limited around here," he said. "If you want to do anything, people have to go to Spokane or Seattle."
Brant Mayo, executive director of the Grant County Economic Development Council, said the Moses Lake region has been chasing factories since the early 1990s to bring higher-paying jobs to the area. "We want our kids and our grandkids, if they want to be in the area, to have an opportunity to do whatever they want here," he said.
Factories also attract factories. After Microsoft opened a data center in the nearby town of Quincy, a company that makes plastic conduits for data centers opened a 50-employee operation. Three electrical firms also have opened offices.
The potential costs of trying to orchestrate economic development are less obvious and less concentrated, and thus easier to ignore. But they could easily outweigh the benefits. Government investment can allow companies to take risks that investors wouldn't support, but it also can insulate companies from market discipline, propping up underperforming technologies and preventing better ideas from gaining traction. Preserving factory jobs also is expensive, and higher costs could slow the adoption of electric vehicles. It costs about twice as much to build a battery plant in the United States as in China, according to one recent estimate.
The urgency of global warming means that the Biden administration may be gambling with time it can't afford to lose.
Moses Lake, population 26,040, was created by federal investment. The area was a sparsely populated desert until the damming of the Columbia River began in the 1930s. The Democratic Party's vision of cheap power and water created one of the nation's most productive farming regions, famous for its apples and potatoes. But the city and the surrounding region are now "bright red," in the words of Steve Starr, the lonesome chairman of the local Democratic Party.
Mr. Starr is skeptical that this new season of federally funded economic growth will make a difference. Other issues loom larger. At the county fairgrounds, the Democrats have a building with a big sign out front reminding visitors about the government's role in the region's history. The Republican Party's building, just across the way, has a large sign declaring opposition to abortion.
Mr. Starr also says the government's role in the current factory boom is easy for people to ignore. Instead of public works, the government is backing private companies. The sign in front of Group14's future factory doesn't have any mention of federal funding.
"Without the federal government this would be an uninhabited desert, but you won't hear Republicans here say that," Mr. Starr said. "Are people going to accept the idea that Biden, through federal government initiatives, is helping our economy? My answer is, sadly, probably not."
Some Republicans insist they don't want the help. The congressman who represents Moses Lake, Dan Newhouse, joined all but a few of his Republican colleagues in voting against the 2021 legislation that is providing funding for the battery plants, and against the 2022 bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, that is providing an even larger block of funding for similar projects. In April, he voted for the House debt ceiling bill that would have rolled back much of that federal funding.
Electric vehicles, in particular, are becoming a partisan battleground. Republican lawmakers in Wyoming introduced a resolution this year calling for the state to ban the sale of electric vehicles by 2035 to "ensure the stability of Wyoming's oil and gas industry." The resolution, which did not pass, directed Wyoming's secretary of state to send a copy to the governor of California, which has a law banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035.
In Moses Lake, the most likely flashpoint is access to power. The cheap, green electricity from two Columbia River dams is still the community's greatest asset and it remains under public control. It is the most important reason Group14 and Sila both chose to build factories here.
But there is not enough of it. The local utility, the Grant County Public Utility District, says that it expects to begin buying electricity from outside the county by 2025. For the battery plants, or other factories, to grow here, the community is going to have to invest in expanding its supply of renewable energy.
Richard Hanover grew up in Moses Lake and now works as the director of development at the Port of Moses Lake, which controls much of the region's industrial land. When he was a child, he said, it didn't seem possible Moses Lake would ever have a chance at the kind of prosperity that is now within reach.
"It wasn't even possible when I started here nine years ago," he said.
Now it is. Will Moses Lake seize the opportunity?

Full text: Things start out fun with this prequel, but frantic plot mechanics might steer your interest into a ditch.
No franchise asks more -- and less -- from its audience than "Transformers." The spectacle-first, logic-second series has given us six films to adjust to Optimus Prime, a semi-truck who whip-whop-whoomps into a humanoid with windshield wipers that tickle his nipples. "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts," a goofy seventh installment that rattles along well enough until the wheels fall off, ballyhoos an evolution: a biomechanical gorilla who calls himself Optimus Primal. Optimus Primate would have been too sensible. And before you ask, the movie offers no explanation why a bionic biped would bother shape-shifting into another bionic biped. Silly mammal -- that's not the point.
In fairness, these metaphysical questions were explored in the futuristic and bizarrely engaging '90s cartoon "Beast Wars: Transformers" and its spinoff "Beast Machines: Transformers," which felt like sipping on a spiked juice box in an ashram. When that Optimus Primal was asked if he was robot or animal, he mystically intoned, "Both ... and neither. The key is finding the balance within yourself. Only then can you truly say, 'I am transformed."'
But also in fairness, those shows and this movie share zero DNA. "I don't get 'Beast Wars,"' Lorenzo di Bonaventura, one of this film's producers, once said. Instead, he and the director Steven Caple Jr. have rewound the clock to 1994 for yet another demolition derby. Once the nostalgic touchstones have been inlaid -- one-strap overalls, O.J. Simpson and a killer classic hip-hop soundtrack -- Optimuses Prime and Primal (voiced by Peter Cullen and Ron Perlman) team up to combat a planet-gobbler (Colman Domingo) and his minion, Scourge (Peter Dinklage), whose thorax throbs angrily like someone installed a cigarette lighter on his lungs.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Along for the ride are two Homo sapiens from Brooklyn: Dominique Fishback as Elena, a museum intern, and Anthony Ramos as Noah, an electronics whiz. The charismatic actors struggle, through no fault of their own, to share scenes with sentient fenders. It doesn't help that neither character's behavior quite passes the Turing test. Elena's job duties range from authenticating rare da Vincis to having her boss's clothes pressed; Noah burns scrambled eggs while soldering a cable box. Of the dozen-plus additional creatures crammed onscreen, the only others who register are a motor-mouthed Porsche named Mirage (Pete Davidson), an armored falcon (Michelle Yeoh), and an eroticized motorcycle (Liza Koshy) introduced rump-first in a nod to the director of the first five films, Michael Bay, who sure loved to linger on a lady's chassis.
Things start out fun, with some clever inversions. Noah steals Mirage and is horrified to realize that the car has, in turn, stolen him. The humans do a little shape-shifting themselves, through costumes and stolen IDs. And Noah is comically pained each time he has to explain that he's working with alien automobiles to prevent Armageddon. Then the frantic go-here, get-the-gizmo story mechanics steer our interest into a ditch.
The plot is a bust. Five credited screenwriters and not one compelling stake. How pointless is it to threaten main characters -- let alone Earth -- in a prequel? Worse, at the climax, gray machines slug it out on gray terrain under a gray sky. It's as visually pulse-pounding as thumbtacks on a driveway, and an invitation to close one's eyes and concentrate on the A.S.M.R. pleasure of shuddering steel. When that gets old, at least there's solace in the premise, however slapdash its execution. The very existence of a technorganic ape is evidence that computer-generated blockbusters know they still need a beating heart.

Full text: A professor decorated a sidewalk in Georgetown with 10-foot sculptures of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. The well-heeled locals were not pleased.
The thing about putting a pair of 10-foot metal Transformers statues outside your townhouse in the most picturesque district of the nation's capital is that the neighbors are going to have opinions.
And on Prospect Street in Georgetown, they were not pleased.
The statues -- Bumblebee and Optimus Prime, two of the good guys from the long-running "Transformers" movie franchise -- appeared in January 2021 outside the white-brick home of Newton Howard, a cognitive scientist and machine-learning expert with ties to the intelligence community.
He had ordered them from a factory in Taiwan to the tune of more than $ 25,000 each. Where large brick planters had once blended in with the local aesthetic, there was now something akin to outsider art by way of an anonymous welder and Hollywood's reinterpretation of 1980s toys.
Plenty of people love the statues, which resemble invaders from the future, in a neighborhood that does its best to hang on to its cobblestone past. Students at nearby Georgetown University can't get enough. Neither can tourists: The Transformers statues have their own entry on Google Maps as a place of interest, with 4.9 stars. "The best part of visiting Georgetown," one reviewer declared.
"People are at my door every day," Dr. Howard, 53, said at his home on a recent afternoon. "It doesn't bother me. I find it to be beautiful that actually people are appreciating things."
But some of his neighbors are less enthusiastic, and the critics of his notion of a Georgetown-appropriate sidewalk display have been trying to get rid of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime for more than two years.
Dr. Howard, a bald man with an unplaceable accent, wears dark round eyeglasses that come equipped with a camera and a microprocessor that allows him to translate languages on the spot, he said.
He paid $ 3.75 million for the townhouse and moved in during the pandemic. In 2021, he snapped up the one next door for $ 4.8 million. The homes lie close to his job at Georgetown University School of Medicine, where he is a research professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular and cellular biology. (He added to his real estate holdings in 2022, when he bought a $ 3.6 million home in Potomac, Md. It has 14 bathrooms and a bocce court.)
Putting up the Transformers wasn't the only thing Dr. Howard did to irritate his Georgetown neighbors, who learned shortly after his arrival that he wasn't some sort of shabby, retiring professor. He had flashy taste and he liked to show it off, parking a number of expensive cars on Prospect Street: a yellow McClaren 720S (new ones start at $ 310,000), a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT (which goes for $ 1.4 million and up), a Porsche 918 (fewer than 1000 were made, and they go for well over $ 1 million). Not to mention an MRAP truck and a small airplane from his collection that he once parked in front of his home. The car show came to a stop only after he received complaints.
A rich guy with loud cars is one thing, a known story. The Transformers were something else altogether. They quickly became a flashpoint in Georgetown, and on the internet, after the local news site DCist reported on the efforts of Dr. Howard's neighbors to get the statues removed.
Sally Quinn, the author and longtime Georgetown resident, said she was firmly in the anti-Transformers camp. "I think they're really ugly," she said. "Some people may like them. You know, everybody's taste in art is different. But that's not the point."
The point, she continued, was historical preservation: "People come to Georgetown because it's Georgetown. It's a beautiful, quaint village."
But the author Kitty Kelley, who said she has lived in the neighborhood for "two husbands," or since 1977, sent Dr. Howard a handwritten card in support of his sidewalk flair.
"All you have to do is take a walk through Georgetown, and you're going to see gnomes and wrought-iron benches," said Ms. Kelley, who is known for her dishy biographies of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ("Jackie Oh!"), Oprah and Nancy Reagan. "You'll see cement lions of all sizes. So why should this man be deprived of using the space right outside his front door?"
"Maybe it isn't Picasso," she continued. "It isn't a sculpture by Degas, but I think he's entitled."
Ms. Kelley noted that her own outdoor decorations have included topiary monkeys, a seven-foot bird feeder and "an angel who's shooting something across the yard."
So: Was Dr. Howard a champion of free expression who found himself on a crusade against exclusionary zoning and "snooty neighbors," as Slate cast him? Or was he an attention-seeking scofflaw with questionable taste?
Or maybe this was simply a case of an eccentric and mysteriously rich guy being eccentric and mysteriously rich.
Neighbors Weigh In
Georgetown is not the most futuristic place. Some of the streets still have cobblestone and the remains of streetcar tracks. The neighborhood is filled with pastel rowhouses from the 18th and 19th centuries and with newer homes meant to recall the older structures.
The area also has its share of stately brick mansions that make you wonder who lives there, or used to. Often, it's someone well-off, but occasionally it's a someone someone. Power players in media, politics and entertainment -- like Madeleine Albright, Ben Bradlee, Katherine Graham, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Elizabeth Taylor -- have called Georgetown home. But it wasn't always Washington's glamour spot.
"Georgetown was kind of a dump in the early 20th century," said George Derek Musgrove, the co-author of the 2017 study "Chocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital."
The old houses had largely fallen into disrepair, and the neighborhood was home to working-class Irish and African Americans. Then, with the explosion of government hiring during the New Deal, Ivy League graduates moved in. They fixed up their homes in an array of styles until the national craze for historical preservation took hold. In 1950, "Old Georgetown" was designated a federal historic district, with all the restrictions on home modification that entailed.
"By the time you get to 1960, and John Kennedy leaves his Georgetown mansion on N Street for the White House, you just couldn't afford to get in if you wanted to," Mr. Musgrove said.
A lot of the residents support efforts to keep things more or less the same. Catherine Emmerson, whose family lives close to Dr. Howard, helped start the Prospect Street Citizens' Association a few years ago to stop a condo conversion that would have blocked local residents' views of the Potomac River.
When the Transformers arrived, the group had a new target.
It's not that the association was against celebrating film history. In fact, its members argued that the condo conversion would have threatened something that ought to be a landmark (and now is): a set of steep steps on Prospect Street, built in 1895, that appeared in "The Exorcist." (Think: tumbling priest.)
But that was "The Exorcist." A film. (Maybe?) An old movie, at least. The "Transformers" franchise, which has grossed more than $ 5 billion across six films, was more like ... I.P. (Michael Bay, the "Transformers" producer, declined to comment on Dr. Howard's decorating choices or the neighbors' reaction.)
And the Citizens' Association had clear recourse. Before putting up the statues, Dr. Howard did not apply for any kind of permit, despite Georgetown's historic status and the fact that the sidewalk is public space.
There is a process, a local official emphasized when he appeared in front of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission via video in March 2021, three months after Bumblebee and Optimus Prime had become part of the neighborhood. And he had bypassed it entirely.
The commission went on to inform him that, before gaining approval, he would have to apply to something else: the Old Georgetown Board, a federal body of three architects that ruled on any changes to the exteriors of properties.
Ms. Emmerson and another neighbor, the author and former television journalist Luke Russert, also weighed in. Ms. Emmerson argued that the statues represented a safety hazard and drew crowds of disruptive gawkers. (Dr. Howard later had his Transformers bolted in place.)
Mr. Russert was more blunt. "What's to stop someone from putting up a statue of Joseph Stalin and saying, well, this is provocative, it's art, it speaks to me?" he argued. "They are a nuisance, they are an eyesore, and they detract from the spirit of the neighborhood."
As tensions continued, Dr. Howard said he started hearing two terms that he had never heard before -- NIMBY and YIMBY. ("Not in my backyard" vs. "Yes in my backyard.") The pro-development crowd wanted to claim him as a hero. He declined to ally himself, exactly. Instead, Dr. Howard argued, his statues were all about "the American idea," because they welcomed visitors to a cloistered part of the city.
"You don't want to just come up with ways to shut down your neighborhood so nobody comes into it," he said.
His critics disputed the notion that he was motivated by an idea of civic good. "His repeated disregard for the law and procedure tells a story of someone who is not operating in good faith for the collective community," Ms. Emmerson wrote in an email to The New York Times.
'The Real Tony Stark'
There was no horde outside Dr. Howard's townhouse on a recent Sunday afternoon. A young man paused to snap a photo of his 2-year-old son standing with the statues. The toddler's blue and yellow shoes matched Optimus Prime's color scheme.
From the rooftop, a six-foot Optimus Prime statue peeked down at the street. It had once stood at the front door, but after the initial controversy Dr. Howard commissioned a taller version for the sidewalk. Then he moved the original, perched as if part of some SWAT team on the lookout for any Decepticons.
The interior of Dr. Howard's home, which he said he decorated himself, resembled a lair. The glassy back of the townhouse overlooks the Potomac, where the buzz of jets headed into and out of Reagan National Airport adds to the techno-paradise vibe. Motorcycles were parked in the living areas as objets, and five more Transformer statues stood guard. There was also a giant model of Iron Man, a Marvel superhero dear to Dr. Howard.
"A lot of people used to call me the real Tony Stark," he said, referring to Iron Man's alter ego.
The memorabilia on display included his concealed carry permit, as well as framed photographs of him with Bill Clinton and Tim Tebow, the former N.F.L. quarterback who became known for kneeling in prayer on the field. Dr. Howard, who said he is a follower of Messianic Judaism, a religion sometimes referred to colloquially as Jews for Jesus, said that he and Mr. Tebow belong to the same fellowship group. (Mr. Tebow couldn't be reached for comment.)
His home was fastidious, except for a half-built child's toy in the living room. Dr. Howard has four children, ranging in age from 5 to 26, he said. (The older children are from a previous marriage.) He and his wife, Rebecca, are also fostering five Afghan refugees, he added.
Senator Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, became friends with Dr. Howard through a shared interest in Afghanistan."I call him Tony Stark," he said. "I would have called him that without the statue." (Senator Mullin made a splash in 2021 for personally trying to escort Americans out of Afghanistan after Kabul fell to the Taliban, against the explicit wishes of the State and Defense Departments. Dr. Howard was "very involved" in similar efforts, Senator Mullin said.)
The professor -- who is, duh, a fan of the "Transformers" movies -- said the sculptures had a deeper meaning for him. Not only did they represent machines and humans coexisting in harmony, he said, but the word "transform" had a great deal of personal significance.
"I like changing things when you're in a status quo and they're wrong," he said. "When one looks at themselves and feels self-pity and falls into dwellings of darkness, you should transform."
Dr. Howard has gone through several transformations himself. He was born in the Sinai Peninsula when Israel controlled it. His family -- Egyptian Jews who ended up living in France, he said -- moved to the United States when he was 11.
He said he joined the Army at 18, then worked as a linguist in Michigan "across various agencies," specializing in Arabic, Farsi and Dari. He changed his name around that time because, he said, "it was offered by an agency." He declined to provide more detail.
"There's a lot of things during that phase of my career that should be kept secret," he said.
Dr. Howard -- whose doctorates include concentrations in mathematics and neuroscience, and who holds an appointment at the University of Oxford alongside the one at Georgetown -- is a curious mix of limelight-seeking and discreet. After college, he said, he worked in military intelligence. He later did work for InQTel, which is functionally the C.I.A.'s venture capital fund.
What precisely he did to get rich is unclear. He said his wealth resulted from selling various businesses, some of which he could not talk about. The walls of his townhouse are filled with commemorative plaques of his patents, many of which have defense industry applications, including "Wireless Network for Routing a Signal Without Using a Tower" and "System and Method for Automated Detection of Situational Awareness."
He said he suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2000 while delivering medical supplies, though he declined to offer more detail. After his recovery, he decided to focus on applying the principles of machine learning to the human brain, and turned to neuroscience. "I figured instead of sitting and getting my brain worked on, I would work on it myself by studying it," he said.
His ventures include Aiberry, a start-up that tries to use A.I. analysis to improve on mental health screening. He said he hoped to help solve the problem of degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's with a cloud-connected device implanted in the brain, using A.I. to optimize the levels of deep brain stimulation.
In other words, he would like to help human beings preserve their humanity by becoming a little more machine.
The Ruling
The Old Georgetown Board seems to rule with an iron fist -- just try putting up a neon sign in the neighborhood -- but its power is advisory. The city of Washington, D.C., has the real authority to enforce decisions, but the influence of neighbors complaining in unison cannot be discounted.
Topher Mathews, a commissioner for Georgetown's Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said that the Transformers mess wouldn't even make his top five neighborhood dramas of the past 10 years. Easily outstripping it, for instance, was the agita caused over the opening on O Street of Call Your Mother Deli, which attracts long lines.
And locals love to bring up the Tree Incident of 2018, which involved a new homeowner's decision to prune and cut down magnolia trees on his property, which happened to be the former home of Ms. Onassis. In response, a neighbor created a Halloween display with a mock tombstone reading, "Beloved magnolia 1840-2018 destroyed R.I.P.," and a grim reaper that announced "Tree Killer Lives There."
Dr. Howard has argued that his statues constitute meaningful public art. The "Transformers" movies follow a classic good-versus-evil struggle in which the Autobots (the good guys) work to save humanity from the Decepticons (the bad guys). Reviewing the first installment of the franchise in 2007, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that it was "part car commercial, part military recruitment ad, a bumper-to-bumper pileup of big cars, big guns and, as befits its recently weaned target demographic, big breasts."
The Old Georgetown Board took up the matter of Dr. Howard's statues in spring 2021, and the city gave him a six-month permit to keep them up. But well after the six months was up, Bumblebee and Optimus Prime were still in place.
By the time the board met again, in April 2023, Dr. Howard claimed that he had spent tens of thousands of dollars fighting to keep his statues up, an amount that included legal and architect advisory fees and city fines.
This time, the board ordered him to take the statues down. Instead of complying, Dr. Howard appealed to the D.C. Public Space Committee. He also rebuffed offers from the Advisory Neighborhood Commission to help him find another place in the neighborhood to display his statues.
Dr. Howard seems to enjoy the attention that has come with the ongoing case. He has talked extensively with the press about his crusade. He was flattered that Paramount, the studio behind the Transformers movie, had invited him to the Washington premiere of the next installment, "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts," which comes out June 9.
As DCist and The Washington Post chronicled the twists and turns of the neighborhood drama, sentiment online seemed to swing his way. A student at Georgetown University started a Change.org petition, signed by more than 900 people, to keep the statues up. "This is so dumb," Hayden Gise, an Advisory Neighborhood Commission vice chair who lives in a neighborhood close to Georgetown, wrote on Twitter. "Let him live oh my god. Everyone loves property rights until some guy does something cool."
On May 25, the statues' fate went before the Public Space Committee. Dr. Howard had hired Paul Strauss, D.C.'s shadow senator, to represent him. Or, as Mr. Strauss put it, he was acting as counsel for Optimus Prime, while a colleague represented Bumblebee.
"People have misunderstood the issue," Mr. Strauss said. "You talk about compatibility with a historic district? Technically, these guys are millennia old. I mean, they're prehistoric."
Mr. Strauss and Dr. Howard also persuaded Peter Cullen and Dan Gilvezan, actors who voiced Optimus Prime and Bumblebee on the 1980s cartoon series based on the toys, to attest at the hearing about the history and significance of the nearly 40-year franchise.
The entreaties didn't work. The D.C. Public Space Committee denied Dr. Howard a permit, meaning that he would have to take the statues down himself, or the city would. It wasn't a question of art; it was a question of following the rules.
Dr. Howard didn't seem inclined to stand down. Before the meeting, he suggested that he would appeal a ruling against him on First Amendment grounds. His lawyer clarified that they saw the issue as one of equal protection: Plenty of people fill their sidewalk planters in Georgetown and never get dinged for it. Why is his client required to seek a permit for what is in his planter?
After the meeting, Dr. Howard said he thought he would apply for a new permit. But he seemed deflated.
"I'm sad," he said in a text to a reporter, adding,"What do you think I should do?"
The victory that Dr. Howard said he was seeking was a moral one.
"I know what these Transformers mean to me," he said. "What does it mean to them?"
As of June 1, the statues were still standing.

A Budding Big Three Are Locked in Battle While Dominating the Field: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka have been winning just about everything important lately, emerging as a potential triumvirate unseen in the women's game for about a decade.
Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka have won a combined five Grand Slam singles titles. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have won 64.
Swiatek, Rybakina and Sabalenka have been at the top of the sport for roughly a year. Some combination of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic has been there the last 20.
Swiatek, the world No. 1 from Poland; Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion who was born and raised in Russia but represents Kazakhstan; and Sabalenka, the 2023 Australian Open champion from Belarus, are still largely known only to tennis geeks. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are among the most recognizable athletes on earth.
So it is with the utmost hesitance, caution and respect for what has come before that anyone should invoke the term "Big Three" when talking about Swiatek, 21, Rybakina, 23, and Sabalenka, 25.
And yet something has been happening with this group lately in the rivalry-starved women's game -- something that could all come together in a glorious rumble during the next two weeks at the French Open. The first of the three to play at Roland Garros, Sabalenka, started her tournament with a win over Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine in a match tinged with wartime bitterness. Swiatek and Rybakina's first-round matches are scheduled for Tuesday, with Swiatek taking on 70th-ranked Cristina Bucsa and Rybakina facing Brenda Fruhvirtova.
Ever since Ashleigh Barty of Australia retired while atop the rankings in March 2022 at age 25, Swiatek, Rybakina and Sabalenka have been hogging nearly all of the most prestigious trophies. They have often beaten one another on the way to the winner's circle, giving hope to the tennis executives -- if not the rest of the field -- that the women's game just might be on the cusp of the kind of rivalries it has been missing for roughly a decade, perhaps even as far back as when Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters were battling for supremacy.
"It is what you want, the best players playing each other, over and over," Steve Simon, the chairman and chief executive of the WTA Tour, said during a recent interview.
The budding rivalry even has a geopolitical back story to add some fuel and antagonism. Swiatek has been among the most outspoken critics of Russia's invasion, helping to raise millions of dollars to support relief efforts in Ukraine. She wears a pin with Ukraine's flag on it when she plays. Rybakina and Sabalenka hail from the two countries perpetrating the war, as Kostyuk reminded everyone Sunday.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has continued to cast a pall over the sport, especially whenever players from the Eastern European countries most affected by the conflict compete. Kostyuk refused to shake Sabalenka's hand after their match on Sunday.
Swiatek has never gone as far as Kostyuk and the other players from Ukraine have, but whatever relationship Swiatek has with her two biggest rivals, it is a chilly one. Swiatek said she, Rybakina and Sabalenka respect one another but do not have any relationship at all off the court. Also, she said, she tries not to think about politics when she plays.
"When I think about the player, like, personally, it doesn't help," she said. "We don't really have time in a match to overanalyze all the other stuff."
There certainly has not been a shortage of matches to analyze, though.
Swiatek has lost to Rybakina three times this year already -- at the Australian Open, the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., and then this month at the Italian Open in Rome, where she retired after injuring her leg early in the third set. Rybakina went on to win the tournament.
Rybakina has provided a blueprint for toppling Swiatek, a three-time Grand Slam tournament winner. Few could do that in 2022, when Swiatek reeled off 37 consecutive wins at one point. But Rybakina is among the most powerful players in the game, and she uses that ability to put Swiatek on her heels.
"Against Iga, it's always tough battles," Rybakina said earlier this year. "Everybody wants to beat her."
Swiatek beat Sabalenka in the final at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, in April (with a car on the line). Sabalenka returned the favor in May in the final at the Madrid Open.
Sabalenka beat Rybakina to win the Australian Open in January. In March, Rybakina beat Sabalenka to win the title at Indian Wells, regarded in the sport as an unofficial fifth Grand Slam tournament.
"Women's tennis needs this kind of consistency to see world No. 1 and world No. 2 facing in the finals," Sabalenka said after her win in Madrid. "It's more intense."
She has also made it clear that overtaking Swiatek for No. 1 has been her primary motivation during the past year and that having a specific target has helped her figure out what she needs to improve upon to get there.
It's not unlike the dynamic that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic experienced at the heights of their success. They knew they were better than just about everyone else, knew the weapons that their stiffest rivals brought to the fore and knew their top priority had to be finding a way to answer them.
Swiatek said it's more fun this way, and not just for the spectators. So many matches against the same tough outs and so many familiar tactics to combat turn the sport into a search for solutions to very specific problems.
"Pretty exciting, because I never had that yet in my career," she said. "Extra motivation, for sure."
Not a true Big Three yet, but not that far off, and far closer than women's tennis has been to one in a while.

An Influencer Thought He Was Above the Law. Romania Proved Him Wrong.: [Correction]

Full text: The online influencer, popular with young men, is facing charges of human trafficking and rape, after seeking out a place where "corruption is accessible to everybody."
Andrew Tate, a pugilistic online influencer and self-crowned "king of toxic masculinity," never made any secret of why he had chosen Romania as his home and business base.
"I like living in a society where my money, my influence and my power mean that I'm not below or beholden" to any laws, Mr. Tate told his fans.
But, like much of what the former kickboxer has told his millions of mostly young male followers on social media -- including claims that he is a trillionaire and has 19 passports -- Mr. Tate's proclamation of faith in Romania as a risk-free haven for antisocial behavior reflected more fantasy than reality.
The Romanian authorities arrested Mr. Tate, a citizen of both the United States and Britain, and his younger brother, Tristan, in December on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organized criminal group. Held for three months in a jail in Bucharest, the capital, both men, who deny any wrongdoing, are now under house arrest, awaiting trial.
Their home is a sprawling compound down a dingy dead-end street in Voluntari, a town next to Bucharest that is dotted with shiny new office towers and derelict empty lots. It looks more like an industrial warehouse than the lair of a man who boasted of immense wealth and posted videos of himself hanging out in private jets with beautiful women and driving fast cars.
The high-end cars that once crowded the courtyard, including a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche, an Aston Martin and a BMW, are all gone, confiscated by the Romanian authorities. The only vehicle left is a clunky Russian Lada. It was not worth impounding.
Romania still ranks far below most fellow members of the European Union in clean-government rankings. In last year's Corruption Perceptions Index from Transparency International, only Bulgaria and Hungary were lower. And Romania, according to the State Department's 2022 report on human trafficking, remains "a primary source country for sex trafficking" in Europe.
But Romania has in recent years made a serious effort to tackle the endemic graft and general lawlessness that long blighted the country -- and that apparently attracted Mr. Tate. Before his arrest, he said he liked "living in countries where corruption is accessible to everybody," and where anybody can pay a $ 50 bribe to get out of a speeding ticket.
Eugen Vidineac, the Romanian lawyer defending Mr. Tate, said that his client had "said many stupid things," but that after his arrest, "he stopped thinking about Romania being so corrupt."
Since Mr. Tate established Romania as his base around 2016, the country's anti-trafficking agency has expanded its staff and launched a messaging blitz on billboards, television and online, warning women against "lover boys," traffickers who use seduction as a recruiting technique. Mr. Tate is accused of using this tactic to lure vulnerable women to his compound to perform in sex videos online.
The State Department report said that while Romania did "not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking," it was "making significant efforts to do so."
It cited legal changes, a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for trafficking, stepped up cooperation with other European countries and the establishment in 2021 of a dedicated unit to combat sex trafficking by Romania's Organized Crime and Terrorism Investigation Directorate, the agency leading the investigation into Mr. Tate.
The directorate last year opened 1,246 new trafficking investigations, double the number in 2021.
Monica Boseff, the president of the Open Door Foundation, a private group that runs a shelter for women fleeing the sex trade, said that Mr. Tate was "not the only misogynist making creepy statements on social media related to women." But she said he had "miscalculated" in his belief that anything goes in Romania.
"We still have big problems that we need to solve, but there has been real improvement and we finally have hope" that the abuse and exploitation of women are slowly being seen by society and officials as crimes, Ms. Boseff said.
For Silvia Tabusca, a law lecturer at the Romanian-American University in Bucharest who has worked with prosecutors on trafficking cases, Mr. Tate's big mistake was not so much that he misjudged Romania's changing legal and social climate, but that he included a young American woman among his alleged victims.
Without pressure from the United States to investigate Mr. Tate, Ms. Tabusca said, "I'm not sure Romanian prosecutors would ever have touched him."
The United States Embassy in Bucharest, citing "privacy considerations," had no comment on whether the American authorities had intervened on behalf of a U.S. citizen. The Romanian agency leading the investigation also declined to comment.
Like Ms. Tabusca, Mr. Tate's lawyer attributed what he described as the unexpected zeal of the Romanian authorities against his client to American intervention, which he said had begun last year after the mother of a young woman from Florida started worrying that Mr. Tate had taken her daughter captive and asked the State Department to do something.
The mother's appeal, the lawyer said, led the American authorities to request help from Romania and prompted the opening of a criminal investigation in April last year -- soon after the daughter told her mother that she was in Romania and living in Mr. Tate's compound. Investigators bugged the compound, tapped his telephone, and monitored his movements and online communications.
The details of what they found are still secret and, according to the lawyer, who has access to the case file, provide no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, only of debauchery. "My client's problem," he said, "is his lifestyle. But lifestyle is not a crime. What matters is what is illegal, not what is immoral."
Mr. Tate, for his part, offered a characteristically melodramatic explanation for his arrest. A day after armed police officers stormed his compound, he told his followers on Twitter, who now number 6.6 million, that "the matrix sent their agents." The "matrix" is Mr. Tate's catchall designation for what he sees as a conspiracy by "woke" corporate elites, mainstream politicians and feminists to emasculate men.
Prosecutors accuse Mr. Tate of luring women to his compound and then putting them to work under duress as performers on pornographic webcams. The lawyer said that Mr. Tate's residence had no webcam studios and that his client had never coerced anyone into staying or working there. The Tate brothers, he said, "are famous; they are rich; they are young and beautiful," adding: "What would be their interest in forcing women to act as slaves?"
The only people living in the compound, the lawyer said, were the brothers and their various girlfriends. He acknowledged that some of the women had appeared in videos released by Mr. Tate, but said they had done so of their own free will in the hope that this would help them gain followers on social media. "He never took money from the girls," the lawyer said.
The now defunct website for one of Mr. Tate's business ventures -- an online academy offering a "Ph.D. Program" in "techniques for getting girls" -- gave a different story. It boasted that Mr. Tate "owns and operates strip clubs and webcam studios" and has "TOP QUALITY women living with him and making him money full time."
The sales pitch for the program, which charged more than $ 400 for enrollment, promised to teach students "how to build an army of women who are so loyal to you that they allow you to have as many girls as you want."
Two women whom prosecutors described as victims have insisted that they associated with Mr. Tate of their own accord and were not coerced. A clinical psychologist's report prepared as part of the case said they had been brainwashed into believing they had a genuine romantic relationship with Mr. Tate.
Ms. Boseff, the Open Door Foundation head, said that most of the more than 1,200 women who had passed through her group's shelter over the past decade had been entrapped by traffickers masquerading as "lover boys," and often felt affection and loyalty to them despite being pushed into working as prostitutes.
Mr. Tate, she said, understood that "everybody craves to be loved, to be cared for and to hear words of encouragement" -- needs that can make young women who have turbulent home lives particularly vulnerable to exploitation.
Statistics compiled by the anti-trafficking agency show that 74 percent of victims are recruited by acquaintances, friends, neighbors or even relatives.
Since his release from jail into house arrest at the end of March, Mr. Tate has recast himself as a philanthropist, claiming that he has set up a shelter for dogs, rebuilt a Romanian orphanage and is "going to save the world."
Unconvinced by his newfound commitment to good works, a Bucharest court on Friday extended the Tate brothers' house arrest for another month.
"Romania is not as corrupt as Tate had thought and hoped," said Mihaela Dragus, a police officer with Romania's National Agency Against Trafficking in Persons.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula 1, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 miles an hour. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It's hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We're inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-sized wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Mr. Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver's seat wearing athletic pants. He won't need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks' time, Mr. Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it's time for lunch. "Is chili bad for you?" he asks, digging into a bowl at his team's commissary. "I don't think it's that bad."
Reaching Formula 1, the highest level of international motor sport, is a big step for Mr. Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at 6 years old and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula 1 itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is enormously popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $ 4.4 billion by the Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media -- F1 had barely kept a YouTube page -- and backed a popular Netflix documentary series, "Drive to Survive." Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220 percent from 2018, and the sport made $ 2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization. "It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood," Bernie Ecclestone, the 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. "F1 is being made more and more for the American market."
The backlash reached a crescendo at last week's Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style pre-race ceremony, the rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a "global music collaboration" with Formula 1. (The lyrics rhyme "Max Verstappen," the name of the sport's top driver, with "your champion.")
"Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1," wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained: "None of the drivers like it," groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic pre-race sequence would be featured at several more grands prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport's stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell's macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style "harbor": blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast "Small Torque," said she was surprised by the spectacle when she attended a race in Austin, Texas. "There were girls with pompoms," she said. "I remember watching it and thinking, Oh my gosh, this is so different from anything I'd seen F1 do in a long time."
Ms. Fairman conceded that some Europeans find the American hullabaloo "tacky." But she added: "When it's something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it's just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party."
The arrival of Mr. Sargeant, who grew up about an hour's drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he's happy to play the part. "What's up America, let's bring that energy!" he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as "the local boy done good."
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Mr. Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: "I'm so sorry. I can't believe it."
Weeks earlier, in an interview in England, Mr. Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. "I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of 'first American,"' he said. "It's still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still."
If Mr. Sargeant doesn't perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. "At the moment," he said, "I just have to worry about staying here."
'I just want to get back in the gym.'
Before his tough Miami weekend, Mr. Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a top 10 finish. "Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London," he replied. "That's all I want to do."
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Mr. Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It's not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or Olympian gymnast, has devoted their life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Mr. Sargeant was 6 when he and his brother Dalton got a kart from their parents for Christmas. "No one in the family was really even that much into racing," Logan said. "We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend." He began winning junior races around the country -- too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula 1, he'd have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing excursions for life on a different continent: "We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe."
Mr. Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing between Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978. "As a kid, it was tough," he recalled. "Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather -- it was literally vice versa." He eventually settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. "I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym," he said. "I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table."
It is incredibly difficult to nab a seat in Formula 1. Today's drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag -- critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grands prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world's most sophisticated racecars. But it's ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion and F1's only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Mr. Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida's Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald J. Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan's father, Daniel Sargeant, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $ 6.5 million in corporate funds "for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities" of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $ 5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesman said that Logan Sargeant was not "in a position to comment" on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Mr. Sargeant's Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was sanctioned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Mr. Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. "I'm incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan's here for any other reason than I think he's got this pure talent," he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Mr. Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year's two other rookies. "He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more," Mr. Vowles said. "He's a perfectionist, and I like that in him."
Tooting around in a Vauxhall Astra
Britain, where Formula 1 originated in 1950, remains the sport's spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it's now an American subsidiary: a Manhattan private equity firm, Dorilton Capital, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $ 200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, like engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park -- a far cry from McLaren's space-age complex an hour's drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Mr. Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team's sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $ 60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure Mr. Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
"Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years," he said in an interview. "There are eager companies who want the publicity." Mr. Sargeant's car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading "Go Logan!" alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year's race fell about 25 percent, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data show that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $ 90 million annually -- up from the $ 5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes. "We were too arrogant," he said. "We couldn't understand why the American fan base wasn't falling in love with us." But he also pushed back on the complaints that Liberty's efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
"This whole argument of 'Americanization,' it's a very crude way to describe things," he said. "We shouldn't ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It's about giving people more choices in the modern era. It's modernization of access to everyone."
Mr. Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty's approach. "I mean jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J," he told reporters in Miami. "I thought it was cool, wasn't an issue to me."
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler -- something Mr. Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
"I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine," he said. "But to be honest, I'm not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn't really interest me."
"The part that interests me," he concluded, "is driving them as fast as I can go."

Russian Elites Still Obtaining Luxury Goods: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than a year into Vladimir Putin's invasion, the web of global trade has adjusted to Western sanctions, with a network of middlemen sending cars, electronics and more to Russia.
On a dusty roadside on the outskirts of Dubai, Sohrab Fani is profiting from the West's response to the war in Ukraine: his shop installs seat heaters into cars being re-exported to Russia.
Twelve thousand heating pads languished in his warehouse for years, he said, until Russia's invasion and the resulting Western sanctions drove American, European and Japanese automakers out of the Russian market. Now, Russians import those cars via Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates -- and because cars shipped to the Middle East tend to be made for warm climates, accessories shops like Mr. Fani's are doing a brisk business outfitting them for winter weather.
"When the Russians came, I sold out," Mr. Fani said, so he ordered several thousand more seat-heating pads. "In Russia, they have sanctions. Here, there is not. Here, there is business."
More than a year into President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion, Western sanctions have damaged Russia's economy but not crippled it. The web of global trade has adjusted, allowing the Russian leader to largely deliver on a key promise: that the war would not drastically disrupt the lifestyle of consumption for Russian elites.
Russia is still importing coveted Western goods, enabled by a global network of middlemen.
In Moscow, the latest iPhones are available for same-day delivery for less than the retail price in Europe. Department stores still stock Gucci, Prada and Burberry. Car-sales sites list new Land Rovers, Audis and BMWs.
Just about all of the West's leading electronics, automobile and luxury brands announced last year that they were pulling out of Russia. Not all of their goods technically violate sanctions, but commerce with Russia became very difficult in the face of public outrage, pressure from employees, and restrictions on semiconductor exports and financial transactions.
Still, Russian demand for luxury items remains strong, and traders in Dubai and elsewhere are meeting it.
"The wealthy people always stay wealthy," said Ecaterina Condratiuc, the director of communications at a Dubai luxury car showroom who recently shipped a $ 300,000 Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT to a Russian dealership. The war, she added, "did not affect them."
In Dubai, buyers roam the showrooms of a sprawling auto market, haggling for Western cars -- the Dodge Ram is a recent favorite -- to purchase in cash and ship to Russia. Some are wealthy Russians buying vehicles for themselves, or small-time entrepreneurs looking to resell cars for a quick buck.
In other cases, Russian car dealerships, having lost their official affiliations with Western brands, are organizing their own imports, sometimes of hundreds of cars at a time.
The Russian analytics company Autostat reported that such indirect imports accounted for 12 percent of the 626,300 new passenger cars sold in Russia in 2022.
Electronics also take circuitous routes to the Russian market. In Dubai's old commercial neighborhood, Deira, electronics wholesalers have scrambled to recruit Russian-speaking staff.
"It's an open secret thing," said the owner of Bright Zone International General Trading L.L.C., a few storefronts down from a wholesaler of hair extensions. "Competition is very tough right now for Russia."
The owner, who requested that he only be identified by his last name, Tura, said he shipped hundreds of smartphones and laptops into Russia last year ahead of the holiday season. One potential buyer wanted a quote for 15,000 iPhones, Mr. Tura said, but apparently found a better deal elsewhere.
In another electronics shop nearby, an Afghan salesman, Abdullah Ahmadzai, said he had arrived in Dubai less than a year earlier, and had since learned enough Russian to negotiate with his Russian-speaking customers. Across the street, a man from Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, said he and his colleague quickly found employment in a shop selling phones, laptops and drones.
"All the stores here are looking for people who speak Russian," he said. "We got lucky."
After many Western companies pulled out of Russia, Mr. Putin's government encouraged unauthorized imports of their goods from other countries. The Russian trade ministry published a list of dozens of companies whose products could be imported without their makers' consent, including Apple, Audi, Volvo and Yamaha.
"Whoever wants to bring in whatever luxury goods will be able to do it," Mr. Putin pledged last May.
One Russian report estimated that such "parallel imports" of laptops, tablets and smartphones totaled $ 1.5 billion last year. At the same time, Chinese cars and electronics have flooded onto the Russian market.
"You can bring over whatever you want, as long as you have money," said Pyotr Bakanov, an auto journalist based in Moscow. "Everyone who isn't lazy is bringing cars over."
The new trade routes largely pass through countries that have friendly relations with Moscow. Western analysts and officials have pointed to Turkey, China and former Soviet republics like Armenia and Kazakhstan as countries redirecting Western goods to Russia. They say that the Kremlin is taking advantage of those imports not just to mollify a populace used to foreign phones and cars, but also to source microchips for weapons used against Ukraine.
Mr. Bakanov, like other Russian car bloggers and journalists, has gotten into the business himself: he posts advertisements on the messaging app Telegram, offering to import cars "to order from any part of the world." He said that foreign car parts are also coming in via parallel import -- some are now available in Russia for lower prices than before the war, when those parts were sold by authorized dealers charging high premiums.
The workarounds have become so widespread that Russian car publications run regular reviews of cars made for foreign markets. The multimedia console in the Toyota Camry made for China only operates in Chinese, a popular auto website warned in February; the reviewer suggested holding a smartphone translating app up to the display.
In the Dubai car market one March evening, Sergei Kashkarov sat in the passenger seat of a parked gray Toyota, negotiating his latest deal: sending six Mitsubishi cars to a dealership in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk by ferry and truck, via Iran and Kazakhstan. Mr. Kashkarov had moved to Dubai from Siberia in 2021 and, after the invasion, established himself as a broker connecting Russian car dealers with Dubai suppliers.
"I've got plenty of work," he said. "I'm really not complaining."
The new trade patterns show up in international statistics; car exports from the European Union to Russia, for instance, dropped to about 1 billion euros in 2022, from 5 billion euros in 2021.
But E.U. exports to Kazakhstan rose nearly fourfold, to more than 700 million euros, and exports to the Emirates rose some 40 percent, to 2.4 billion euros. Armenia reports that its car imports more than quintupled to $ 712 million last year.
Western car companies generally deny knowledge of their cars going to Russia in any significant quantities, or of a spike in sales in the Emirates.
"We haven't seen any of that," said Jim Rowan, the chief executive of Volvo.
Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said, "I'm not aware of anything going to Russia."
Carmakers would have trouble tracking sales of vehicles through intermediaries, industry officials say. And U.S. officials responsible for enforcing restrictions have focused more on goods that can be used for military purposes.
The United Arab Emirates has been identified as a "country of focus" by U.S. officials for its role as a hub for products shipped to Russia in violation of sanctions. Electronics are of particular concern, officials say, because their chips can be repurposed for military use.
"The U.A.E. has strict measures in place governing import and export permits for dual-use materials to prevent their exploitation for military purposes," an Emirati official said in a statement.
Browsing in Dubai's auto market, a group of three men said they split their time between Russia and Armenia. They refused to say what they did for a living but they described the import and resale of cars as a lucrative side business; one said he had bought around 100 cars in the last year.
"Dubai is a three-in-one," a man who gave his name as Aik quipped. "You go on vacation, you buy a car for yourself, and you buy some to resell."

GROVE, England — Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula One, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 mph. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It’s hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V-6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We’re inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-size wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver’s seat wearing athletic pants. He won’t need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks, Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it’s time for lunch. “Is chili bad for you?” he asks, digging into a bowl at the team commissary. “I don’t think it’s that bad.”
Reaching Formula One, the highest level of international motor sports, is a big step for Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at age 6 and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula One itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is hugely popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $4.4 billion by Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media — F1 had barely kept a YouTube page — and backed a Netflix documentary series, “Drive to Survive.” Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220% from 2018, and the sport made $2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization.
“It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood,” Bernie Ecclestone, a 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. “F1 is being made more and more for the American market.”
The backlash reached a peak at last week’s Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style prerace ceremony, rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a “global music collaboration” with Formula One. (The lyrics rhyme “Max Verstappen,” the name of the sport’s top driver, with “your champion.”)
“Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1,” wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained. “None of the drivers like it,” groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic prerace sequence would be featured at several more grand prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy’s Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport’s stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell’s macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style “harbor”: blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast “Small Torque,” said she was surprised by the spectacle of a race in Texas. “There were girls with pompoms,” she said. “I remember watching it and thinking, ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so different from anything I’d seen F1 do in a long time.’”
Fairman said some Europeans found the American hullabaloo “tacky.” But she added: “When it’s something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it’s just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party.”
The arrival of Sargeant, who grew up about an hour’s drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he’s happy to play the part. “What’s up, America! Let’s bring that energy!” he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as “the local boy done good.”
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: “I’m so sorry. I can’t believe it.”
Weeks earlier, in an interview in Britain, Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. “I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of ‘first American,’” he said. “It’s still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still.”
If Sargeant doesn’t perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. “At the moment,” he said, “I just have to worry about staying here.”
Getting ‘Back in the Gym’
Before his tough Miami weekend, Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a Top 10 finish. “Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London,” he said. “That’s all I want to do.”
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It’s not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or an Olympian gymnast, has devoted his life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Sargeant was 6 years old when he and his brother, Dalton, got a kart from their parents for Christmas.
“No one in the family was really even that much into racing,” Sargeant said. “We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend.” He began winning junior races around the country — too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula One, he’d have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing trips for life on a different continent. “We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe,” he said.
Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing among Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978.
“As a kid, it was tough,” he recalled. “Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather — it was literally vice versa.” He settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. “I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym,” he said. “I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table.”
It is very difficult to nab a seat in Formula One. Today’s drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag — critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grand prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world’s most sophisticated race cars. But it’s ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time world champion and F1’s only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida’s Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan’s father, Daniel, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $6.5 million in corporate funds “for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities” of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money-laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesperson said Logan Sargeant was not “in a position to comment” on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Sargeant’s Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s, was sanctioned after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. “I’m incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan’s here for any other reason than I think he’s got this pure talent,” he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year’s two other rookies. “He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more,” Vowles said. “He’s a perfectionist, and I like that in him.”
Commuting in a Compact Car
Britain, where Formula One originated in 1950, remains the sport’s spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it’s now an American subsidiary: Dorilton Capital, a private equity firm in New York City, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, such as engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park — a far cry from McLaren’s space-age complex an hour’s drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team’s sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure that Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
“Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years,” he said in an interview. “There are eager companies who want the publicity.” Sargeant’s car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading “Go Logan!” alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year’s race fell about 25%, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data shows that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, North Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $90 million annually — up from the $5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes.
“We were too arrogant,” he said. “We couldn’t understand why the American fan base wasn’t falling in love with us.” But he pushed back on complaints that Liberty’s efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
“This whole argument of ‘Americanization,’ it’s a very crude way to describe things,” he said. “We shouldn’t ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It’s about giving people more choices in the modern era. It’s modernization of access to everyone.”
Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty’s approach. “I mean, jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J,” he told reporters in Miami. “I thought it was cool, wasn’t an issue to me.”
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler — something Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
“I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine,” he said. “But to be honest, I’m not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn’t really interest me.”
“The part that interests me,” he said, “is driving them as fast as I can go.”

Panasonic Plans to Delay Making a Battery for Tesla
Panasonic said on Wednesday that it would delay the commercial production of its 4680 battery cells until next year as the company aims to improve their performance.
Panasonic, which will provide the battery to Tesla, had previously planned to start volume production as early as last month.
Panasonic is running a pilot 4680 production line at its Wakayama factory in Japan, while Tesla is already producing the 4680 battery cells, which its chief, Elon Musk, has touted as being key to making cheaper and compelling electric cars. But the carmaker struggled to meet its targets for production and performance of the cells.
Tesla's South Korean supplier LG Energy Solution said last month that it planned to set up a new 4680 production line at its domestic factory by the end of this year, but did not say when the batteries would start volume production. REUTERS

VW Shareholder Meeting Is Disrupted by Protests
Volkswagen's annual shareholder meeting was briefly disrupted Wednesday by protests over the company's factory in China's Xinjiang province, with a shouting, topless activist interrupting the speech by the chief executive, Oliver Blume, before she was hustled away by security personnel.
Additionally a cakelike object was thrown during a speech by the board chairman, Hans-Dieter Poetsch, apparently in the direction of another board member, Wolfgang Porsche, who represents his family's shareholding in the company.
Photos showed a white, gooey substance resembling pastry stuck to the front of the dais behind which Mr. Porsche was sitting.
Volkswagen has said that it has found no evidence of human rights violations at its Xinjiang plant. The Chinese government has been accused of human rights abuses against its Muslim Uyghur population, including forced labor in detention camps. The U.S. State Department has described China's actions in the region as genocide. ASSOCIATED PRESS
CLIMATE LITIGATION
Greenpeace Suit Targets Italian Energy Company
Greenpeace and an environmental coalition including 12 Italian citizens are suing the Italian energy company ENI, accusing it of knowingly contributing to climate change.
The complaint names ENI and its two biggest shareholders, the Italian Economy Ministry and the Italian state lender and public investment bank, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. It is seeking past and future damages as a result of "climate change to which ENI has significantly contributed by its conduct in recent decades, while being aware of it," according to a statement from Greenpeace Italy.
In a statement, ENI said it would demonstrate in court the "groundlessness" of the lawsuit and the "correctness" of its decarbonization strategy, which it said balanced sustainability, energy security and competitiveness.
ENI said it would consider legal action on its own against one of the plaintiffs, ReCommon, claiming defamation. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Ex-Chief at Audi Will Plead Guilty To Role in Diesel Emissions Scandal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Rupert Stadler, a former member of Volkswagen's management board, would be the highest-ranking executive to confess wrongdoing in a case that rocked the industry.
Rupert Stadler, the former chief executive of the automaker Volkswagen's Audi division, has agreed to plead guilty to charges in Germany related a vast emissions cheating scandal, becoming the highest-ranking executive to be convicted in the case, which changed the direction of the car industry.
A Munich state court said Wednesday that Mr. Stadler would accept a plea deal offered by a judge, which involves a suspended sentence of up to two years in exchange for a full confession and payment of a fine of 1.1 million euros, or $ 1.2 million.
Mr. Stadler, 60, who was also a member of Volkswagen's management board, was accused of allowing diesel cars made by Audi to remain on sale even after the parent company admitted in 2015 that millions of its vehicles were equipped with software designed to mask excess emissions.
The scandal cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in fines, legal settlements and lawyers' fees and had a lasting impact on the auto industry. It inspired European lawmakers to impose much tighter limits on auto emissions, accelerating a transition from internal combustion engines to electric cars. Volkswagen became one of the first big German automakers to invest heavily in battery power, which executives saw as a way to restore the company's tarnished reputation.
Mr. Stadler has been on trial in Munich since September 2020. Testimony was nearing an end last week when Judge Stefan Weickert offered him the deal. In Germany, evidence is typically heard intermittently and trials can drag on for years. Judges sometimes offer defendants a plea agreement after concluding that the evidence against them is strong.
Wolfgang Hatz, who led motor development at Audi and Porsche and was tried alongside Mr. Stadler, pleaded guilty to related charges last week. A third defendant, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, a former Audi executive who was involved in designing emissions systems, also accepted a plea deal.
Mr. Stadler, who had insisted throughout the trial that he did nothing wrong, agreed to accept the plea deal during a hearing on Wednesday morning, the court said. Prosecutors in the case also support the deal.
Mr. Stadler is expected to make his confession in two weeks' time, allowing the trial to wrap up by late June, the court said.
The two men were among the most influential executives at Volkswagen, which continues to maintain in court that the cheating was the work of middle managers who hid the wrongdoing from the management board.
Mr. Stadler became chief of Audi, one of Volkswagen's most profitable brands, in 2007 after working as chief of staff to Ferdinand Piëch, the Porsche family scion who dominated Volkswagen for two decades beginning in the 1990s. Mr. Stadler left Audi in 2018 after spending several months in pretrial detention.
In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud and other federal charges in Washington, after admitting that engineers rigged nearly 600,000 diesel cars sold in the United States to cheat on emissions tests. The cars were programmed to recognize when they were being tested on rollers in a lab. If so, the cars produced emissions that were compliant with regulations.
On the road, when regulators were not looking, the cars produced more toxic nitrogen oxides than a long-haul truck. Volkswagen diesels were not capable of consistently meeting emissions standards without suffering engine damage.
The software that enabled the cheating was originally developed by Audi, according to testimony and court documents, and adapted by Volkswagen engineers in 2007 after they had trouble getting their diesel engines to comply with United States standards. The illegal software was also deployed in Europe and other regions.
Volkswagen paid $ 4.7 billion in criminal and civil penalties as part of a settlement in 2017 with United States authorities. The company paid another $ 15 billion as part of a settlement with owners of VW, Audi and Porsche diesel cars.
The confessions of Mr. Stadler and Mr. Hatz mean that they will endure much lighter penalties than two lower-ranking executives, Oliver Schmidt and James Liang, who served multiyear prison sentences after being arrested in the United States and pleading guilty to charges.
A separate trial of several former Volkswagen managers is underway in Braunschweig. At least six others have been indicted in the United States but not arrested because they remained in Germany, which does not extradite its citizens.
Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive until he resigned in 2015 after the wrongdoing came to light, faces charges in the United States and Germany, but it is questionable whether he will ever face trial because of ill health. He has denied wrongdoing.
Volkswagen continues to suffer from the fallout of the scandal. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pursuing a civil case against the company, accusing it of defrauding bond investors by not fully informing them about the scope of the cheating. Volkswagen is contesting the suit, which is scheduled to go to trial next year.

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

SHANGHAI — For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $70,000 SUV designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
“If you’re sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury,” said Ben Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city’s auto show Tuesday. The country is now the world’s largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China’s giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China’s car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country’s dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells — at home and abroad — most of the world’s electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars’ electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80% of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
“Multinationals’ market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment,” said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 — standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers — many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies’ joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and EVs have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China’s market last year, compared with less than 6% in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold 1 million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany’s Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. GM would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which GM has a 44% stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $4,800 to $21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China’s domestic car companies rose to 52% in the last quarter of 2022, from 47% the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3% of the car market, up from 2.1% four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China’s leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesperson said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. GM plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
“The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March,” said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and GM had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
“They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones,” he said. “They don’t even seem to be in the same age.”
Car fashions change quickly in China. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 SUV.
Unlike most large SUVs on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle’s hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the SUV for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of “zero COVID” quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China’s many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.

Germany Pushing E.U. For Exemption to Build Synthetic-Fuel Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Berlin and Brussels are scrambling for a solution after Germany calls for allowing cars to run on synthetic fuels. The move could endanger the E.U.'s climate goals.
Germany is negotiating with the European Union to win an exception to the proposed 2035 ban on internal combustion engines to permit cars to run on carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, the country's Transportation Ministry said on Wednesday.
Berlin's abrupt decision in early March to seek a change in the measure on the eve of its final vote has caused a rift among E.U. governments and even automakers, and threatens to undermine legislation that is a cornerstone of the European Union's ambitious plans to make the 27-member bloc carbon-neutral by 2050.
The move is supported by some carmakers, including Porsche, but it has provoked criticism from other manufacturers that have begun spending huge sums to shift their production toward electric vehicles in anticipation of the ban.
Ford Motor and Volvo were among several dozen companies that signed a letter on Monday addressed to European leaders, warning that watering down the terms of a transition to electric vehicles could endanger their businesses as well as the environment.
"The lack of a strong regulatory framework could have significant consequences for businesses' decarbonization plans," the letter read.
Germany's Transport Ministry said it was in talks with European Commission regulators seeking a provision in the measure that would allow for the sale of cars with engines that were capable of running only on such synthetic fuels, known as e-fuels. Tim Alexandrin, a spokesman for the ministry, described the talks as "advanced" and "complex."
The commission is striving to reach an agreement with Berlin before leaders of the 27 member states arrive for a European Council summit on Thursday.
"I am confident that we can find a way to make sure that the interpretation we give to the agreement is also to the satisfaction of the German authorities," Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission who oversees the bloc's push toward climate neutrality, said last week.
E-fuels are made using electricity generated from renewable sources like wind or solar to separate hydrogen from water, and then combining the hydrogen with carbon dioxide captured from air or other sources. When the resulting fuel is burned in an engine, carbon dioxide comes out of the tailpipe, but the idea is that those emissions are offset by the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere to produce the fuel.
But e-fuels tend to be expensive and not easily available, and there are doubts about the ability to scale up production by 2035.
If Germany is successful in forcing through a carve-out on e-fuels, it will be the latest time that Berlin has intervened on behalf of its powerful automobile industry to water down Brussels's efforts to curb transportation emissions. More than a quarter of all carbon-dioxide emissions in the European Union are generated by vehicles, according to government statistics.
But with its 800,000 jobs and annual revenue of about 411 billion euros ( $ 443 billion), the automobile industry flexes outsize influence in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
It has long held sway over the country's leaders. Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened in 2013 to prevent European legislation that would tighten emissions rules and, four years later, lobbied again to weaken E.U. emissions testing procedures that were intended to prevent cheating of the kind that Volkswagen committed with its diesel engines.
This time it is Germany's luxury car industry that is pushing back against Brussels's latest attempt to rein in vehicle emissions. Porsche is among the leading proponents of e-fuels and has backed a production facility that opened in Chile last year, even as it continues to develop its popular electric Taycan model.
"E-fuels are a feasible alternative to reduce CO2 emissions rather quickly," Oliver Blume, who is chief executive at both Porsche and Volkswagen, told reporters last week. He said the 1.3 billion vehicles with combustion engines already on the global market would still be driven for decades, especially in developing economies, and would benefit from fuel with no net emissions.
"If you look at climate protection as a whole, this is not only a German or a European issue alone, it is a worldwide affair," Mr. Blume said.
Several companies that supply Germany's auto industry support including e-fuels in the European rules, including Bosch, Mahle and ZF, as well as major energy companies, including Exxon Mobil.
Italy, home to Ferrari and Fiat, joined the resistance after Germany raised concerns, along with the Czech Republic, Austria and Poland. If enough countries decide not to pass the measure, that could endanger its prospects.
But e-fuels have usually been seen as a future fuel for industrial uses, not cars. Even with plans to increase production, the amount of e-fuels projected to be available in Germany by 2035 would be sufficient to meet only 10 percent of the country's fuel needs in its air, shipping and chemical industries, according to a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Unlike cars, those industries cannot rely on electrification alone to reduce their carbon footprint, the institute said.
Volker Wissing, a member of the Free Democrats party who serves as Germany's minister of transport, argues that despite such warnings, all options need to be kept open in the push to reach climate neutrality.
"We are convinced that we need every technological solution to achieve our ambitious climate protection targets and keep society mobile," Mr. Wissing said.
But analysts point out that his party, the smallest of the three partners that make up the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, may have been driven by more than just concern for the environment in promoting e-fuels. Since entering the government, the party has seen its popularity nearly halved to just 6 percent, with key state elections planned in Bavaria and Hesse this year. Challenging Brussels could be seen as a way to reverse that slide by attracting approval from Germans who favor combustion engines.
"The Free Democrats always have to worry a bit about their parliamentary existence," said Uwe Jun, a political scientist at the University of Trier, referring to the fact that the party fell out of Parliament in 2013 after failing to meet the 5 percent threshold needed for representation.
Senior German government officials insist that they are confident that the Free Democrats will not let the standoff reach a point of actually sinking the European policy, saying that internally, the party has made clear it would accept a compromise.
"It remains our goal to reach an agreement," Mr. Alexandrin said.

Volkswagen Points $193 Billion at E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker announced a plan to accelerate its transition to battery-powered vehicles and bolster operations in China and North America.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would spend $ 193 billion on software, battery factories and other investments as it aimed to make every fifth vehicle it sold electric by 2025.
The automaker, the world's second biggest after Toyota, will also focus on expanding its presence in North America, where it has struggled for years, and becoming more competitive in China, one of its most important markets, said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive.
Mr. Blume laid out a 10-point plan for helping Volkswagen pivot to electric vehicles, a path it began in earnest when it effectively abandoned diesel technology after an emissions cheating scandal in 2015. The plan's centerpiece are investments totaling 180 billion euros, or about $ 193 billion. Two-thirds of that sum will be channeled into producing battery cells, developing software and shoring up supply chains of critical raw materials.
"For me, it is important that we have a clear orientation of where we are going," Mr. Blume told reporters, adding that 2023 would be "a decisive year" for the company. It is his first as chief executive; he took over in September from Herbert Diess, who aggressively pushed Volkswagen to embrace electric cars but was forced out after just four years because of disagreements with the company's board.
Mr. Blume hopes to use some of the proceeds of a 2022 initial public offering of Porsche, where he is also chief executive, to strengthen Volkswagen's electrification strategy. The listing brought in €43 billion.
Volkswagen reported a net profit in 2022 of €15.8 billion, or $ 16.7 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year, as supply chains disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic began to normalize.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to rise and contributed to high inflation, especially in Germany. Addressing those challenges, while balancing the demand for combustion-engine vehicles as the company pivots to electric-vehicle production, will be the main focus in Europe, Volkswagen said.
"We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial and operating officer, said at the Tuesday media event. "We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."
In the short term, Volkswagen will continue to produce combustion-engine cars, which generate profits that the company needs to pay for the transition to battery-powered vehicles. In 2022, Volkswagen sold 8.2 million cars and trucks.
Despite the German government's call for companies to diversify their operations in Asia, pivoting away from China, Volkswagen is continuing to invest in the country in partnerships with local companies.
Volkswagen is the leading producer of combustion-engine vehicles in China, but has lost ground to domestic carmakers in the fast-growing market for electric cars. Last year, Volkswagen introduced an "in China for China" strategy that it plans to expand, including developing technology and software specifically for consumers there, including in-car karaoke.
The automaker's problems in North America are somewhat different. After years of trying to become a bigger player in the United States specifically, it remains far behind U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor and Asian companies like Toyota and Hyundai.
Volkswagen retooled its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., last year to begin producing electric vehicles, and it now produces the ID.4 sport utility vehicle there. On Monday, Volkswagen said it had chosen a site in Ontario for a new battery plant. And earlier in March, the company said it would put up a factory in South Carolina to build pickup trucks and S.U.V.s that would be sold under the moribund Scout brand.
In Europe, a key element of the company's focus includes its first battery cell plant, a €2 billion factory that is rising out of a field in Salzgitter, Germany, near the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The new plant sits behind a site where Volkswagen has been building engines for more than 50 years and is slated to become the main provider of battery cells for the automaker.

Law Covering Identify Theft Is Reviewed By the Court: [Correction]

Full text: Using examples drawn from valet parking and restaurant meals, the justices indicated that a federal law imposing mandatory two-year sentences should be read narrowly.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court seemed poised on Monday to limit the scope of a federal law that adds two years of prison time to sentences for a variety of felonies if the defendant engaged in identity theft in the process.
The case concerned David Dubin, who was convicted of health care fraud. Mr. Dubin, whose company provided mental health testing to young people at emergency shelters in Texas, was accused of bilking Medicaid by misrepresenting who had conducted the testing and when it was performed and by rounding up the number of hours spent carrying out the tests from 2.5 to three.
Mr. Dubin's sentence included a two-year mandatory minimum term under a statutory provision titled "aggravated identity theft." But the text of the provision is broad and does not seem to require identity theft in the ordinary understanding of that phrase. Rather, it requires the longer sentence if the defendant "during and in relation to" certain felonies "knowingly transfers, possesses or uses without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person."
Jeffrey L. Fisher, a lawyer for Mr. Dubin, said his client had not used a patient's identity in any meaningful way, adding that the nature of the conduct mattered. "It has to be a lie about who receives services or who obtains services," he said, "not a lie about how those services were rendered."
The justices tried to test the limits of that argument. Justice Clarence Thomas asked, for instance, about a valet parking a Porsche, noting that "I don't have one."
"The valet is authorized to drive it generally but not to drive it around the city, but to park it," he said. "So I don't see how this is any different from that. He's authorized to bill at the appropriate charges, but it's not a general authorization."
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked about charges at a restaurant. "I give the waiter my credit card, and rather than charging me for the food, he charges me, you know, he pays down his mortgage with my credit card," she said.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch also asked about restaurant charges. "If the government's theory is correct and every time I order salmon at a restaurant I'm told it's fresh, but it's frozen, and my credit card is run for fresh salmon, that's identity theft," he said.
He said that the government's position in the case would transform commonplace misconduct into identity theft "whether it's in a restaurant billing scenario, a health care billing scenario, or lawyers who round their hours up." He added, to laughter, "I'm sure nobody in this audience has ever done that."
Vivek Suri, a lawyer for the federal government, faced hostile questions.
"Let's say the only allegation here involved the rounding up from 2.5 hours to three hours," Justice Thomas said. "Would that be sufficient to violate this provision?"
Mr. Suri said yes. "I appreciate that that may seem an unattractive result," he said.
Justice Thomas responded that "unattractive is an understatement."
Justice Gorsuch said Mr. Suri had conceded away his case. "It seems to me you've just given up the ghost and clarified things substantially -- that every time anyone overbills for anything, that triggers this statute," Justice Gorsuch said.
Justice Jackson appeared to agree. "It's like every fraud in the world," she told Mr. Suri. "And you just admitted in response to Justice Thomas that it could be a teeny, teeny fraud."
Near the end of the argument in the case, Dubin v. United States, No. 22-10, Mr. Fisher said the two-year mandatory minimum sentence under the contested provision functioned as "a very strong cudgel to use against people to procure pleas in very low-level fraud cases."
"And that's not what Congress was aimed for in this case," he said. "Congress wasn't trying to create a two-year mandatory minimum all of a sudden for ordinary fraud offenses."

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed poised Monday to limit the scope of a federal law that adds two years of prison time to sentences for a variety of felonies if the defendant engaged in identity theft in the process.
The case concerned Davis Dubin, who was convicted of health care fraud. Dubin, whose company provided mental health testing to young people at emergency shelters in Texas, was accused of bilking Medicaid by misrepresenting who had conducted the testing and when it was performed and by rounding up the number of hours spent carrying out the tests to three from 2.5.
Dubin’s sentence included a two-year mandatory minimum term under a statutory provision titled “aggravated identity theft.” But the text of the provision is broad and does not seem to require identity theft in the ordinary understanding of that phrase. Rather, it requires the longer sentence if the defendant “during and in relation to” certain felonies “knowingly transfers, possesses or uses without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.”
Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for Dubin, said his client had not used a patient’s identity in any meaningful way, adding that the nature of the conduct mattered. “It has to be a lie about who receives services or who obtains services,” he said, “not a lie about how those services were rendered.”
The justices tried to test the limits of that argument. Justice Clarence Thomas asked, for instance, about a valet parking a Porsche, noting that “I don’t have one.”
“The valet is authorized to drive it generally but not to drive it around the city, but to park it,” he said. “So I don’t see how this is any different from that. He’s authorized to bill at the appropriate charges, but it’s not a general authorization.”
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked about charges at a restaurant. “I give the waiter my credit card, and rather than charging me for the food, he charges me, you know, he pays down his mortgage with my credit card,” she said.
Justice Neil Gorsuch also asked about restaurant charges. “If the government’s theory is correct and every time I order salmon at a restaurant I’m told it’s fresh, but it’s frozen, and my credit card is run for fresh salmon, that’s identity theft,” he said.
He said that the government’s position in the case would transform commonplace misconduct into identity theft “whether it’s in a restaurant billing scenario, a health care billing scenario, or lawyers who round their hours up.” He added, to laughter, “I’m sure nobody in this audience has ever done that.”
Vivek Suri, a lawyer for the federal government, faced hostile questions.
“Let’s say the only allegation here involved the rounding up from 2.5 hours to three hours,” Thomas said. “Would that be sufficient to violate this provision?”
Suri said yes. “I appreciate that that may seem an unattractive result,” he said.
Thomas responded that “unattractive is an understatement.”
Gorsuch said Suri had conceded away his case. “It seems to me you’ve just given up the ghost and clarified things substantially — that every time anyone overbills for anything, that triggers this statute,” Gorsuch said.
Jackson appeared to agree. “It’s like every fraud in the world,” she told Suri. “And you just admitted in response to Justice Thomas that it could be a teeny, teeny fraud.”
Near the end of the argument in the case, Dubin v. United States, No. 22-10, Fisher said the two-year mandatory minimum sentence under the contested provision functioned as “a very strong cudgel to use against people to procure pleas in very low-level fraud cases.”
“And that’s not what Congress was aimed for in this case,” he said. “Congress wasn’t trying to create a two-year mandatory minimum all of a sudden for ordinary fraud offenses.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Lucid Steps Up Production As Supply Chains Stabilize: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The maker of electric luxury sedans said it made more than 7,000 cars in 2022, achieving a scaled-down target.
Lucid Motors said on Wednesday that it increased production of its luxury electric sedans by more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter, as better supplies of parts and materials allowed the company to slightly exceed its manufacturing target for the full year.
The carmaker said it produced 7,200 vehicles in 2022, its first year of manufacturing in significant numbers, including 3,500 in the fourth quarter. In August, the company said it aimed to make 6,000 to 7,000 cars during the year.
That target, however, had been lowered from an earlier goal of 20,000 vehicles. And the report on Wednesday disappointed Wall Street investors who had expected more. Lucid shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading.
Even as shortages of some parts and materials persist, "it's much better than it was," Peter Rawlinson, Lucid's chief executive, said in an interview.
Shipping cars remains a problem, Mr. Rawlinson said, helping to explain why deliveries of 4,400 vehicles last year fell short of production.
Along with Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks, Lucid is among the most prominent companies trying to take advantage of the shift to electric vehicles and challenge traditional carmakers.
Lucid's main selling points are efficiency and range. All variations of the sedan can travel at least 450 miles on a full charge, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That's more than any Tesla model.
Still, the odds are long. Tesla is the only new American carmaker in more than a century to achieve mass production and survive as an independent company. Auto manufacturing requires huge upfront investment, and profit margins are usually thin.
Lucid's least expensive model, the Air Touring, sells for $ 107,400, competing for wealthy buyers with companies like Mercedes-Benz and Porsche that have introduced luxury electric cars. Lucid has announced plans to begin selling an $ 87,000 model this year.
The company plans in the next years to produce cars that could compete with Tesla's more affordable Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, Mr. Rawlinson said on Wednesday.
Lucid, which has the backing of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, has $ 4.9 billion in cash, enough to survive at least through the first quarter of 2024, the company said in an earnings report on Wednesday.
Sales in the last three months of 2022 were $ 258 million, up from $ 195 million in the third quarter. Lucid reported a loss in the fourth quarter of $ 473 million, down from a loss of $ 530 million in the previous quarter.
The company does not expect to make a profit in 2023 as it continues to ramp up production, Sherry House, Lucid's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
Lucid said Wednesday that it aimed to produce 10,000 to 14,000 cars in 2023. Potential customers have reserved more than 28,000 vehicles as of this week, the company said, not counting up to 100,000 cars that Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy.
Mr. Rawlinson cautioned that not all of the reservations, which are nonbinding, would translate into sales. "You can never count your chickens before they're hatched," he said.

Tesla's Stainless Steel Pickup Truck Is Coming Soon. Maybe.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Already two years behind schedule, the Cybertruck has experts wondering how the company will manufacture its unusual stainless steel "exoskeleton."
More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla's share price, but also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Mr. Musk's hubris.
It would be very unlike Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup -- three of the best-selling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck's doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla's first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla's most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Mr. Musk's penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to "production hell" and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it's the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck's body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn't need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the "Back to the Future" films.
"Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech start-ups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions," Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. "To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk."
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel's tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
"Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don't have to learn from anyone else," said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, "and then they get stuck in a corner."
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Mr. Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn't begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle "will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line" in 2023, Mr. Musk said, "but it will be next year."
Tesla's delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or sport utility vehicles.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the best-selling vehicle, because it can't make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
G.M.'s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
"The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away," Mr. Rajkumar said. "It's a massive opportunity lost."
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Mr. Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Mr. Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Mr. Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
"Broadly the concept could make sense," said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. "This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good."
"But there are some open questions," Mr. Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck's body, which Tesla refers to as an "exoskeleton." Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $ 40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $ 100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are "certainly possible," said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. "I can understand why he wants to go there."

Stainless steel’s tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.
“Tesla thinks they can solve any problem and don’t have to learn from anyone else,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “and then they get stuck in a corner.”
Tesla said in an earnings report last month that it would begin producing the Cybertruck before the end of this year. But Musk qualified that statement during a conference call with analysts and investors, saying the company wouldn’t begin making the vehicle in large numbers until 2024. When Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck, it said the vehicle would go on sale in 2021.
The vehicle “will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line” in 2023, Musk said, “but it will be next year.”
Tesla’s delays allowed traditional carmakers to beat it to market with electric pickups, and leave Tesla with nothing to offer the many Americans who prefer pickup trucks to cars or SUVs.
Buyers are clamoring for electric trucks. Ford stopped taking reservations for its F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered version of the bestselling vehicle, because it can’t make the vehicles fast enough. Rivian, a newer electric vehicle company, is also struggling to produce enough of its pickup, the R1T, to meet demand.
GM’s GMC division is selling a Hummer pickup truck, but in relatively small numbers. And Chevrolet is expected to begin delivering an electric Silverado this year. Ram has said it will release a battery-powered 1500 truck next year.
“The first-mover advantage that Tesla could have leveraged has completely gone away,” Rajkumar said. “It’s a massive opportunity lost.”
Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
There are indications that the truck will use a stainless steel formula that is the same as or similar to that used by SpaceX, the rocket company headed by Musk. Charles Kuehmann, vice president of materials engineering at SpaceX, holds the same title at Tesla.
Kuehmann was a co-founder of QuesTek, a materials design firm, and worked on a design team at Apple. His reputation as a pioneer in the use of new materials gives some engineering experts confidence that Tesla has developed an alloy that will overcome the challenges of stainless steel.
Kuehmann did not respond to a request for comment.
The Cybertruck body has none of the curves typical of most vehicles, instead consisting of flat steel panels that experts say are probably cut with lasers and then welded together, eliminating the need for powerful stamping machines.
“Broadly the concept could make sense,” said Kip Findley, a professor of metallurgical and materials engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who has done research on advanced steel for vehicles. “This is pushing steel development forward and making people think about steel in a different way, which is good.”
“But there are some open questions,” Findley added. These include how owners will repair damage to the Cybertruck’s body, which Tesla refers to as an “exoskeleton.” Stainless steel dents less easily than conventional auto-body steel, but once damaged it is more difficult to pound back into shape.
As the only company mass-producing vehicle bodies from stainless steel, Tesla will not be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that other automakers share. That could make the truck more expensive to produce.
When Tesla introduced the Cybertruck, it said the starting price would be just under $40,000. But the final price is widely expected to be much higher.
Tesla is taking reservations, which cost $100, for the Cybertruck without naming a price for the vehicle. Tesla has not said how many reservations it has amassed.
If nothing else, the Cybertruck will stand out in a crowded field.
Stainless steel car bodies are “certainly possible,” said Wei Xiong, an associate professor of metallurgy and materials design at the University of Pittsburgh, noting that computer-aided design allows researchers to develop high-performance materials much faster than a few years ago. “I can understand why he wants to go there.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The family's investment vehicle said it would offer to buy out other shareholders in Rothschild & Co., the flagship in the global banking dynasty.
The Rothschild family, which over decades built an international banking dynasty by advising sovereigns and corporate giants, is preparing a new deal: taking its namesake company private.
Concordia, the family's investment vehicle, said on Monday that it would offer to buy the roughly 61 percent of shares in Rothschild & Co. that it does not currently own. It is working on a bid of 48 euros ( $ 51.73) per share, 19 percent higher than the stock's closing price on Friday.
The family is in a strong position, because Concordia controls nearly 48 percent of Rothschild & Co.'s voting rights, while other family-linked firms also own shares. The bank's stock, which has traded for decades on the Paris exchange, jumped 16 percent after Concordia's announcement, giving the group a market value of about €3.7 billion.
Taking Rothschild & Co. off the public markets would be the latest evolution of the advisory and investment firm in its more than 200 years of history. Tracing its roots back to a lender in Frankfurt run by Mayer Amschel Rothschild in the 1760s, the firm grew into a multinational bank that helped finance England's defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, raised money for railways that crisscrossed Europe and counted rulers like Queen Elizabeth II as clients.
The current iteration of Rothschild & Co. was formed in 2012, after the family -- led by Evelyn de Rothschild, from the British branch, and his cousin David, from the French side -- united its French and British businesses in a bid to keep up with growing international competition. The bank is currently led by Alexandre de Rothschild, who succeeded David.
It operates several businesses, including financial advisory, wealth management and merchant banking. Its advisory arm has consistently ranked among the top 10 deal makers in Europe, though it has regularly trailed American rivals like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Among its biggest recent assignments include advising on the initial public offering of the carmaker Porsche and the nationalization of the German utility company Uniper.
For the first nine months of last year, Rothschild & Co. made €2.2 billion in revenue, up 11 percent from the year before.
In announcing a plan to buy the remainder of Rothschild & Co., the family vehicle said it wanted to break free from the limits of running a publicly traded company.
"None of the businesses of the group needs access to capital from the public equity markets," Concordia said in a statement. "Furthermore, each of the businesses is better assessed on the basis of their long-term performance rather than short-term earnings. This makes private ownership of the group more appropriate than a public listing."
Rothschild & Co. said in a statement on Monday that it had "taken note of this proposed transaction" and hired an outside adviser to assess Concordia's bid.
A deal would not include Edmond de Rothschild, a Swiss-based wealth management firm run by a different branch of the family.

Tesla’s Pickup Truck Is Coming Soon. Maybe.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
More than three years after Elon Musk stunned the auto industry with an electric pickup truck that looked more like a stealth fighter than a way to haul two-by-fours and drywall, Tesla said last month that it would begin building the vehicle by the end of 2023.
The announcement has helped fuel a recovery in Tesla’s share price, but it also revived a debate about whether the often-delayed pickup, called the Cybertruck, is a work of genius or evidence of Musk’s hubris.
It would be very unlike Musk, Tesla’s CEO, to build a pickup that looked anything like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado or Ram 1500 pickup — three of the bestselling vehicles in the United States.
With its angular stainless steel body, the Cybertruck is an attempt to redefine the pickup in the same way that Tesla upended the conventional wisdom of the auto industry by proving that battery-powered vehicles could be practical and profitable.
Tesla advertises that a top-of-the-line version of the truck will be able to tow 14,000 pounds and accelerate faster than a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck’s doors will open automatically when the driver approaches.
The truck is important because it will be Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years and could help breathe life into a model lineup that some buyers consider dated. Established carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have released several new electric models since the Model Y, Tesla’s most recent car, went on sale in early 2020.
But the Cybertruck is so behind schedule that some auto experts wonder if it has become another example of Musk’s penchant for pushing technological boundaries to the brink of disaster. In 2018, his determination to build a highly automated assembly line for the Model 3 sedan led to “production hell” and nearly killed the company before he opted for more standard manufacturing practices.
This time it’s the use of stainless steel for the Cybertruck’s body that has industry experts shaking their heads.
Stainless steel resists corrosion and doesn’t need to be painted, eliminating a cost and the need for environmentally toxic chemical coatings. But it is also expensive and difficult to shape and weld. Stainless steel is typically heavier than the steel used in most other cars, reducing driving range.
There is a reason that only one car company has ever tried to mass-produce a car with a stainless steel body. That was DeLorean, which went bankrupt after building fewer than 10,000 cars, which are best known for their starring role as a time machine in the “Back to the Future” films.
“Musk is an example of how the fetishization of tech startups and their leaders can eventually lead those leaders to making bad decisions,” Patrick McQuown, executive director of entrepreneurship at Towson University in Maryland, said in an email. “To me, the insistence on stainless steel is a manifestation of his belief that he has some unique understanding of the market, and that the market will buy whatever he offers because it comes from the mind of Elon Musk.”
Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel’s tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.
These challenges probably help explain why Tesla is two years behind schedule in manufacturing the Cybertruck, which the company plans to produce at its factory in Austin, Texas.

After Extended Talks, Ford, Joining Red Bull, Is Back in Formula One: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The automaker and the drinks manufacturer are joining forces on a high-powered team in the world's most popular motorsports series.
The whispers of a merger between Ford and Red Bull had been the talk of Formula One for months, an intriguing story line in a competition that knows the value of drama.
The dance went on for months: Ford suggesting its interest in returning to the series was genuine, and Red Bull open about its discussions with multiple manufacturers.
On Friday, the companies confirmed the loudest rumors were true: Ford is re-entering into Formula One to partner with Red Bull, currently the series's top team and the employer of its reigning champion, Max Verstappen. In the new arrangement, the American automaker and the Austrian drinks company will join forces to design a new power unit ahead of the 2026 season, and try to extend Red Bull's dominance of the world's most popular motorsports series.
A flashy New York launch confirmed the partnership, a collaboration in which Red Bull will tap Ford's expertise in electric vehicles before a fundamental shift in engine rules for the 2026 season, when teams must become reliant on 100 percent sustainable fuels and, crucially for Ford at least, greater electric power.
That looming shift has already lured the German car manufacturer Audi to Formula One. Porsche, which held talks with Red Bull, is considering joining the fray, as is General Motors. Ford, which left Formula One almost two decades ago, also was looking for a way back in.
"We talked to a lot of people, we met with a lot of people," said Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive. "And as soon as we landed on Red Bull, we knew this was the right opportunity."
Formula One racecars are propelled by what is known as a power unit, a complex bit of machinery that includes several components, including an internal combustion engine, electrical motors and a turbocharger. Red Bull had previously been supplied with power units by Honda. But it found itself facing a crisis -- and needing a new partner -- when Honda announced in 2020 that it would leave Formula One within a year.
An agreement has since been reached for the team to continue sourcing Honda engines through 2025, but the shock of losing its supplier focused minds at Red Bull and ended with it resolving to build its own version rather than buy one produced by, or shared with, a rival like Mercedes.
"The Ford discussion felt right from the word go," Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, said in an interview. Both he and Farley declined to provide financial details of their new partnership.
Red Bull, which already employs hundreds of people for its Formula One team, had decided it would go into the engine-building business in 2021, poaching top engineers from rivals, notably Mercedes, and setting up a new division at its factory outside of London. That operation, Red Bull Powertrains, will become the locus of the partnership with Ford.
For Ford, the new rules, particularly the emphasis on electricity, and sustainable fuels, led it to revise its position on Formula One, a sport that it left after deciding it could not justify the business case to remain. Ford sold its Jaguar racing team to Red Bull in 2004.
Ford's new involvement -- and, Farley made clear, its potential costs -- would not be as intensive as those borne by typical teams backed by automobile manufacturers like Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. "We wanted something more strategic," Farley said.
He called it "a very practical approach to entering Formula One," adding, "I can look my shareholders, the Ford family, in the eyes and say we're being very judicious and thoughtful."
Mark Rushbrook, the head of Ford's motorsports division, said Ford spoke with 10 Formula One teams, as well as some aspiring teams, before reaching a deal with Red Bull, a decision that executives said was eventually made late last year.
In an interview before the deal was announced, Farley and Horner both spoke of a division of labor and responsibilities, with Red Bull's expertise in aerodynamics seen as complementing Ford's research and multibillion-dollar investment in developing batteries and electric vehicles.
Farley described the partnership as "a tech exchange," but Ford may be just as excited about tapping into a new audience. Formula One, powered by new races and a popular Netflix series, is resurgent in the United States. Three races, including a first Las Vegas Grand Prix, will be held in America in the new season, more than in any other country on the globe-trotting circuit, and the hit Netflix series, "Drive to Survive," has made stars of its drivers and even team managers like Horner.
"I think, you know, that series opened America's eyes to Formula One," Horner said. "It brought in a whole new fan base, a young fan base, a much broader demographic, and it's had an incredible impact."
That is exactly the cohort that Farley and Ford are trying to reach as the company looks to grow its electric vehicle business. "We wanted to connect with a new group of consumers," he said.
Ford remains the third most successful engine manufacturer in Formula One history, but its last championship-winning car was driven by Michael Schumacher almost three decades ago. It knows as well as anyone how Formula One can be a fickle sport, and how rule changes can disrupt the fortunes of once dominant teams, a fact most recently confirmed by the decline of Mercedes, which until it was usurped by Red Bull in the last two seasons was the undisputed powerhouse of the grid.
By the time the Ford-Red Bull collaboration reaches the start line in 2026, the changes will be even more profound, and the potential for unpredictability even greater. Rushbrook described the changes as akin to "a clean slate" for the sport.
Red Bull's ability to ride rule changes successfully over its 16 years helped to shape Ford's thinking, he added. "They can really have the DNA or the culture inside their team to be the best and to be at the front," he said.
Farley said he is convinced that Ford has found a formula that works, one that will not require Ford to invest bottomless sums to keep pace with traditional factory-run teams.
"This is a different kind of wiring than the traditional relationships in the past," he said, "and one of the best bang for bucks in motorsports."

Democratic Senators Press Southwest Over Meltdown
A group of Democratic senators are seeking an explanation from Southwest Airlines for its operational meltdown last month. In a letter sent on Wednesday to Southwest's chief executive, Bob Jordan, the lawmakers posed dozens of questions to the airline, addressing topics like its flight-crew scheduling system, ticket refunds and executive compensation. The letter was signed by 13 members of the Senate Democratic caucus, including Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who spearheaded it. "No business can treat its customers like that and get away with it," Mr. Markey said. Around Christmas, a storm wreaked havoc on Southwest's operations, leaving travelers stranded during the busy holiday travel season. While other airlines were able to recover, Southwest found itself crippled, in part as a result of outdated scheduling technology for its flight crews. In total, the airline canceled more than 16,700 flights. MARK WALKER

Porsche Considers Deal To Put Google in Cockpit
Porsche is considering fully integrating Google software into its car cockpit, a source close to the company said on Thursday. The deal would enable Porsche customers access to applications like Google Maps and Google Assistant without needing to connect the car to an Android phone. Porsche had previously been reluctant to use Google software because Google asked for too much data to be shared, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks. Technology companies from Google to Apple and Amazon are in a race to control carmakers' dashboards as software becomes an integral part of car design. But some automakers are wary of allowing the tech giants unfettered access to the data generated by connected cars, or to allow them to displace the automakers' brands with their own in dashboard displays. BMW, for example, was "definitely not taking the path" of integrating Google Automotive Services into its cars, a spokesperson said. REUTERS

CNN Plans to Move Out Of CNN Center in Atlanta
CNN is moving out of the CNN Center, its longtime downtown Atlanta home, by the end of this year. The cable channel's weekday anchors are all already in New York or Washington, but CNN still has digital and CNN International operations in Atlanta. A spokeswoman, Bridget Leininger, confirmed in an email that the remaining CNN employees and operations in Atlanta would move to the Techwood Turner Broadcasting campus in Midtown. The move will happen in stages and will finish by the end of this year, Leininger said. CNN's previous parent company, AT&T, sold the CNN Center for nearly $ 164 million to two Florida-based real estate firms, CP Group and Rialto Capital, in 2021, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the building's other tenants. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Shah, who appeared on "The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City," was sentenced to more than six years in prison for her involvement in a telemarketing scheme, prosecutors said.
Jennifer Shah, who gained fame as a cast member on the reality television show "The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City," was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in prison for her involvement in a telemarketing scheme that defrauded thousands of victims, prosecutors said.
Ms. Shah used the scheme to finance her luxury lifestyle, which included a rented 9,420-square-foot mansion in Park City, Utah, that she referred to as the "Shah ski chalet," a rented apartment in Midtown Manhattan and a leased Porsche Panamera, prosecutors said.
The criminal case against Ms. Shah had been heavily featured on the Bravo reality series, which turned the charges against her into a dramatic plot point.
In her tagline for the second season of the show, she declared, "The only thing I'm guilty of is being Shah-mazing."
In court papers, prosecutors cited that line to argue that Ms. Shah had mocked the charges against her.
Ms. Shah's lawyers wrote in court papers that the show was a "semi-scripted, heavily edited facsimile of 'reality' intentionally manipulated to maximize ratings" and that it did not accurately reflect her feelings about the case.
Her lawyers blamed the show for making it seem, as her sentencing date approached, as if Ms. Shah was "intransigent, defiant, and often even unrepentant, about her actions here."
"Nothing could be further from the truth," Ms. Shah's lawyers wrote. "Just as Jen Shah has never been a 'housewife,' little else is real about her persona and caricature as portrayed by the editors" of "The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City."
A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal, Bravo's parent company, declined to comment.
The show, which premiered in 2020, purports to depict women living glamorously while negotiating issues like sex and religion in a city that is home to the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
At her sentencing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Friday, Ms. Shah said she was sorry for her role in the scheme, which prosecutors said had defrauded victims by selling them bogus "business services" that promised to help them make money online.
She was ordered to pay about $ 6.6 million in restitution and to forfeit $ 6.5 million and 30 luxury items, including designer handbags and jewelry, prosecutors said.
In addition to the 78-month prison sentence, Ms. Shah, 49, of Salt Lake City, was sentenced to five years of supervised release.
"I want to apologize to all the victims and families and I take full responsibility for the harm I caused and will pay full restitution to all of the victims," Ms. Shah said, according to NBC News. She added, "I recognize that some of you lost hundreds, and others lost thousands, and I promise to repay."
Prosecutors said that from at least 2012 until March 2021, when she was arrested, Ms. Shah had been a leader of the wide-ranging scheme and had facilitated the sale of leads, or contact information for potential victims.
Victims were told during "coaching" sessions that the sessions would help them earn money from online businesses, prosecutors wrote in court documents.
Instead, the coaching sessions were designed to convince victims that, to make their internet businesses succeed, they would need to buy additional products and services, which were of little or no value, prosecutors wrote.
Many of the victims were over 55 and some reported losing tens of thousands of dollars, depriving them of much of their life savings, prosecutors said.
Ms. Shah was not deterred by Federal Trade Commission investigations and enforcement actions or by the arrest of dozens of others involved in the scheme, prosecutors said.
Instead, they said, she tried to cover up her criminal conduct by telling others to lie and delete text messages, placing businesses and bank accounts under other people's names and taking steps to move some of her operations to Kosovo.
Before she pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Ms. Shah sold "Justice for Jen Shah" T-shirts that featured "NOT GUILTY" on the front and "#justiceforjenshah" on the back, prosecutors said.
"With today's sentence, Jennifer Shah finally faces the consequences of the many years she spent targeting vulnerable, elderly victims," Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.
"These individuals were lured in by false promises of financial security, but in reality, Shah and her co-conspirators defrauded them out of their savings and left them with nothing to show for it," Mr. Williams said.
Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Ms. Shah to 10 years in prison. Ms. Shah's lawyers had asked for a sentence of three years, writing in court papers that she was "an exceptional mother and a good woman who has already been punished extensively as a result of the sins of her past."
"Though Ms. Shah admittedly played an important role in the particular fraud in which she was involved, she was only one of many people involved, was not involved in all facets of the conspiracy, never communicated with any of the victims, and she clearly did not invent this particular fraud," her lawyers wrote. "Nor was she a mastermind."

Must We Gentrify the Rest Stop?: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: McDonald's is gone, and the Manhattanization of the New York State Thruway has begun. Prepare to Instagram your pit stop.
Five years ago, the New York State Thruway Authority conducted a survey of more than 2,600 drivers to take measure of the customer experience at the service areas lining the 570 miles of road that make up one of the largest toll highways in the country, stretching from the edge of the Bronx up past Buffalo. Whether participants were traveling for work or for pleasure, they had needs that apparently were going unfulfilled.
Among those who identified as occasional users of the Thruway, more than half said they would like food halls with "local artisan" offerings. Some commuters wanted Blue Apron meal kits. The resulting report listed as chief takeaways that leisure travelers complained about unappealing interiors and the lack of "Instagrammable moments."
In a society so casually stratified that major airlines now offer five classes of service and airport security lines can be bypassed for an annual fee, rest stops remain one of the few spaces in modern life that can be generally counted on to level us. Whether you've arrived in an eighteen-wheeler or a Porsche S.U.V. or a 16-year-old Toyota beater, whether you are a devoted consumer of high fats or an otherwise restricted eater of lean proteins and whole grains, you will park, pass through a comfortingly dull stretch of hardscape and order the McDonald's fries either by way of habit or self-gifted nutritional loophole.
That particular indulgence, though, is no longer available on the New York State Thruway. As of New Year's Day, all outposts of McDonald's were closed, the company's contracts having expired on Dec. 31, 2022. The disappearance of the chain is part of a grand plan of "modernization," in the words of a spokeswoman for the state authority, which began more or less with cashless tolling and is currently taking hold in the reimagining of the Thruway's 27 service areas in line with the desires of a blonde-wood-admiring and flaxseed-positive traveling public.
Two years ago, following a bidding process, the job of operating the service areas went to an Irish company called Applegreen, a conglomerate of gas stations and convenience stores backed by the investment giant Blackstone. Applegreen and its partners will pick up the entire cost of the redevelopment ( $ 450 million), leaving public money untouched and delivering what renderings suggest will be the rest stop conceived as a WeWork conceived as a modern weekend place in the farmhouse style. Some spots might have business areas, and the selfie magic might begin in front of floor-to-ceiling windows under an inscription that reads: "Eat Local. Drink Local."
The Thruway's service areas were originally built in the mid-1950s and brought the equalizing experience of cafeteria food to a world that was much more egalitarian. Howard Johnson's arrived in the 1980s. McDonald's entered the frame a decade later, the last time the stops were remodeled. The current reinvention will bring local farm stands, food trucks and, among some other fast food selections, the polarizing choices of Chick-fil-A, run by a red-state billionaire contributor to anti-LGBTQ causes, and Shake Shack, founded by a liberal billionaire restaurateur who came to prominence serving expensive food around Union Square.
Certainly, there are many reasons to consider it great progress never again to be led into temptation by the golden arches on this stretch of roadway, reminded of the scourge of low-wage work, environmental damage and the aggressive undermining of public health. But on the countervailing side, where we might find some modicum of social good, McDonald's provides a business model that does not market identity. You don't get to pretend that you are chic, or rich, urbane or pious when you order a Double Quarter Pounder With Cheese. You are not buying into a philosophy or a lifestyle; you are buying 740 calories of distraction from life.
For many of its democratizing influences, social media has demanded the imposition of bourgeois aesthetic values all across retail culture, no matter how alienating they might be to those who don't live in a world of plant-based foods and felt-upholstered furniture and who have neither the time nor inclination to record their consumer transactions on camera. The newly transformed La Guardia Airport plays to the iPhone and the compulsion for rarefied space, with an almost perversely cosmopolitan restaurant scene.
On internet chat boards, however, drivers are already registering their frustration with the Thruway changes. Given the deep and longstanding tensions between central New Yorkers and those living downstate, it is not obvious that the people of Utica, for example, would be delighted by the Manhattanization of the highway, over merely maintaining functional generic space that allows them to refuel, grab a sandwich and move along, a dozen potential Instagrammable moments be damned.
