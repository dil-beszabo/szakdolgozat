Full text: Our species called this latest 366-day journey around the sun "2024" and packed into it a ton of astronomical and spaceflight excitement.
A solar eclipse crossed North America. Two robotic landers reached the lunar surface, largely intact. The most powerful rocket booster ever built was caught by a pair of mechanical arms nicknamed "chopsticks." A journey began to Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa. And private astronauts conducted a daring spacewalk.
Can this revolution around the sun we name "2025" compare? We'll let you be the judge of how enthusiastic to get about the events you can expect on the launchpads and in the night sky.
Jeff Bezos enters the arena
Through SpaceX, Elon Musk has dominated spaceflight around the planet in recent years. But the extraplanetary ambitions of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos could present a challenge to Mr. Musk soon.
The space company started by Mr. Bezos, Blue Origin, has a powerful rocket called New Glenn that may at last get off the ground in 2025. Like SpaceX's Falcon 9, the booster stage is designed to be fully reusable so it can fly again and again and reduce the cost of launches. The rocket could launch national security satellites for the U.S. military and spacecraft for NASA, including orbiters to Mars and moon landers.
Another thing New Glenn will carry is satellites for Amazon, where Mr. Bezos is still executive chair. The company's Project Kuiper involves plans to build a mega-constellation of satellites beaming internet down from space, in competition with SpaceX's Starlink constellation. Amazon also plans to launch Kuiper satellites using rockets from many of Blue Origin's competitors, including United Launch Alliance, Arianespace of France and even SpaceX.
Rubin's first light
Astronomers atop a mountain in central Chile are wrapping up construction of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which might capture its first views of the night sky this year, as early as July 4.
Formerly the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the observatory was renamed in 2020 to honor Vera Rubin, who died at 88 in 2016. Dr. Rubin's work persuaded astronomers of the existence of dark matter, which makes up a vast majority of mass in the universe, but no one knows what it is.
The name is fitting. With the largest digital camera in the world, scientists will use the Rubin Observatory to create a time-lapse motion picture of the southern sky. Such images would help researchers understand the nature of dark matter, as well as dark energy, the unknown force pushing the cosmos apart. The trove of data will also help reveal the story of our galaxy's birth and catalog asteroids and comets in our solar system, including those that could slam into Earth one day.
The moon, and Trump, come back around
During the first administration of Donald J. Trump, American space policy refocused on lunar exploration. President Biden's administration sustained that direction. But as Mr. Trump returns to the White House in January, the country's existing space plans could be upended by canceling the expensive rocket NASA has been developing for more than a decade. Alternatively, Mr. Trump could more radically shift NASA's focus to sending people to Mars. Getting to the Red Planet is the primary goal of Mr. Musk, who has been advising the president-elect.
For all that potential uncertainty, a series of robotic space missions are planned to the moon early in the year. The first two, a pair of landers from the American company Firefly Aerospace and the Japanese company Ispace, will launch on the same SpaceX rocket as soon as mid-January. The mission by Firefly will be the first trip of its Blue Ghost lander and will carry cargo paid for by NASA. The lunar trip by Ispace will be its second attempt after the company's first lander crashed into the moon's surface in 2023.
Later in the year's first quarter, Intuitive Machines may try to put another robotic lander on the moon after the company's Odysseus lander reached the surface intact, but tilted over, last February. The company's second lander, named Athena, also will carry NASA-financed instruments, including a drill that will try to find samples of ice. Athena will share a SpaceX launcher with Lunar Trailblazer, a NASA orbiter that will study water on the moon.
Vigils for Voyagers 1 and 2
Voyagers 1 and 2, twin spacecraft that inspired a generation of cosmic wonderers, were launched in 1977. After decades of exploring the outer solar system before charting the unknown frontier of interstellar space, the two spacecraft are showing signs of age.
Early in their journey, the pair swooped past Jupiter and Saturn, and Voyager 2 later visited Uranus and Neptune. But perhaps the mission's most iconic gift to the world was a photo taken of Earth, a tiny pixel against the expanse of space, leading the famed astronomer Carl Sagan to coin the image "Pale Blue Dot."
In recent years, the robotic explorers have each blinked in and out of contact with NASA. Communication with Voyager 2 was purposefully shut down in 2020 for months, then lost by accident for a couple of weeks in 2023 before it was restored.
Voyager 1, on the other hand, gave mission specialists a scare this year when it stopped sending data back to Earth. Instruments on both spacecraft have been shut down to conserve power.
But NASA isn't giving up on them yet. When they are eventually interred in the space between the stars, it would be an apt resting place given how the duo has ventured where no other spacecraft had gone before.
India's orbital objective
India's space program has landed a robot on the moon and put a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. The country's most immediate priorities are much closer to Earth, but that doesn't mean they are less ambitious.
India is focusing on human spaceflight. A member of the nation's astronaut corps, Shubhanshu Shukla, is to spend up to 14 days this spring aboard the International Space Station during a commercial mission with the company Axiom Space.
Mr. Shukla and his fellow Indian astronauts are hoping to be the first to launch to low Earth orbit on its homegrown rockets. India said in December that an orbital vehicle from that program, known as Gaganyaan, was being prepared for a test launch with no astronauts aboard. A successful flight could lead the way to a crewed Indian astronaut launch as early as 2026.
New milestones and new spacecraft
SpaceX wowed the world in November during Flight 5 of Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built. Expect the company to try to repeat the stunning "chopsticks" catch of its massive Super Heavy booster. SpaceX may also attempt to catch the upper-stage Starship vehicle after it completes an orbit of Earth and returns to the launch site in South Texas for the first time. SpaceX said it was aiming for 25 launches of Starship in 2025 as it prepares the spacecraft to land astronauts on the moon under the company's contract with NASA.
Other new rockets and spacecraft may take flight in 2025.
One is Neutron, a reusable rocket being developed by Rocket Lab, which was founded in New Zealand. The company routinely carries satellites to orbit aboard its small Electron rocket, and could conduct a first flight of the new vehicle from a launch site in Virginia.
Another is Dream Chaser, a space plane built by Sierra Space. After delays in 2024, the company hopes it will carry cargo to the I.S.S. for the first time this year.

A Milestone: Telegram Set To See Profit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Even as Telegram faces legal scrutiny and grapples with billions in debt, it is set to be profitable for the first time as it tries cryptocurrencies, subscriptions and ads.
In recent months, Telegram, the lightly moderated social media app, has held discussions with investors who lent it more than $ 2 billion. The goal: to reassure them that the company remains a viable bet after its founder, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France in August on charges related to illicit activities on the platform.
In the conversations, Telegram told investors that it was tackling its legal troubles head-on by policing more user-generated content. The company also said it had paid down a "meaningful amount" of its debt, according to an investor in the talks who was not authorized to discuss confidential information.
Telegram has been under increasing scrutiny around the world this year for hosting illicit content from child predators, drug traffickers and other criminals. The company also faces pressure another way: to prove it can make money.
For years, skeptics have questioned if a platform known for hosting toxic material could turn a profit. Unlike social media companies such as Meta, Telegram took an unusual business path: It did not raise money from venture capitalists, sell advertising based on user data or hire aggressively to accelerate growth. Instead, it relied on Mr. Durov's fame and fortune to sustain its business, took on debt and barreled into the cryptocurrency market.
Now Telegram is out to show it has found its financial footing so it can move past its legal and regulatory woes, stay independent and eventually hold an initial public offering. It has expanded its content moderation efforts, with more than 750 contractors who police content. It has introduced advertising, subscriptions and video services. And it has used cryptocurrency to pay down its debt and shore up its finances.
The result: Telegram is set to be profitable this year for the first time, according to a person with knowledge of the finances who declined to be identified discussing internal figures. Revenue is on track to surpass $ 1 billion, up from nearly $ 350 million last year, the person said. Telegram also has about $ 500 million in cash reserves, not including crypto assets.
Telegram has nearly 1 billion users, including 12 million subscribers who pay about $ 5 a month for added features. More than half of its revenue this year came from advertising, the person said, after attracting larger brands such as Samsung. It also plans to expand ads within public channels that attract more than one trillion views a month. Telegram was valued at more than $ 30 billion earlier this year.
Telegram has been helped by cryptocurrencies in particular, two people said. The company sold hundreds of millions of dollars of digital assets this year, including Toncoin, a virtual currency that was partly built inside Telegram and is now run by outside developers. It has floated new crypto-focused ideas like allowing users to mine cryptocurrencies and exchange them through third-party applications on Telegram.
"Telegram needs a sustainable business model to continue operating as a self-sufficient company," said Raúl Castañón, a senior analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence, who has tracked Telegram for the past decade. "They have already done what I consider the most challenging part, which is getting a really sizable user base."
In a statement, the company said its "priority is the long-term health and sustainability of Telegram's ecosystem by expanding our monetization efforts, investing in content moderation tools and -- most importantly -- remaining a neutral platform focused on protecting the privacy of our users."
The Financial Times earlier reported Telegram's digital asset sales and valuation.
Yet as Mr. Durov tries to transform Telegram into a mainstream business, he faces a balancing act: how to dial back the platform's anything-goes approach so it appeals to advertisers and investors, while maintaining the allegiances of users who seek a digital free-speech space.
Mr. Durov's legal fate also hangs over Telegram's future. The 40-year-old, who has denied the charges in France, must remain there while under investigation and faces a possible jail sentence if convicted. He is Telegram's sole owner and its driving force. The company does not have an independent board and has not publicly outlined a succession plan. If it is squeezed for cash or cannot develop a sustainable business model, that could force Mr. Durov to take on more debt or sell part of the company for the first time.
Telegram's business dilemmas trace back more than a decade.
In 2014, Mr. Durov was pushed out of his previous start-up, the Russian social network VKontakte, when he declined to hand over user data to the Russian authorities. After selling his stake in VKontakte, he used the estimated $ 300 million in proceeds to bankroll Telegram, pledging to maintain sole ownership and not take money from outside investors.
The arrangement gave Telegram, now in Dubai, independence. Under no pressure to generate revenue, Mr. Durov focused on privacy over advertising and other moneymaking products.
By 2017, Telegram was approaching 200 million users and its costs were soaring for back-end servers, product development and other items. Mr. Durov began exploring new financing options that would also allow him to maintain sole ownership of the company.
"We wanted to be independent," he said in an April interview with Tucker Carlson. "We knew that our mission and our goals were not necessarily consistent with the goals of the funds that could be investing into us."
His solution was crypto. In 2018, Telegram raised more than $ 1.7 billion by pledging to create its own digital currency that would be given to about 170 wealthy investors. The funds were to be used partly to develop blockchain technology for making digital transactions.
Investors included the Silicon Valley venture capital firms Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. Others were the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Jan Marsalek, an executive at the payment processing firm Wirecard who was later accused of being a Russian spy and is wanted for fraud and other crimes, according to documents seen by The New York Times.
The crypto deal was a success -- but in 2020, Telegram was forced to abandon it after the Securities and Exchange Commission said it violated federal securities laws and posed a risk to retail investors.
Telegram agreed to return the money, but had already spent nearly a third of the cash, according to an S.E.C. announcement and a person familiar with the investigation. Telegram offered its backers a partial refund or a promise to repay them with a 10 percent profit at a later date.
Several investors sued. Adding to their anger, Telegram was paying Mr. Durov an annual salary of roughly $ 12 million from 2018 to 2020, according to records seen by The Times. A private settlement was eventually reached. (Telegram said Mr. Durov's salary is now 1 UAE dirham a year, worth about 25 cents.)
Around then, Telegram announced its first major efforts to generate revenue, including through advertising. Large brands were reluctant to advertise on a platform known for hosting terrorist propaganda and far-right extremists, though smaller advertisers joined.
Maria Vasileva, 30, who lives in Thailand, said she used Telegram ads to find new subscribers for channels she operates on the platform teaching data analytics. Ads are more successful in countries where Telegram has a large audience, like Russia and Ukraine, she said, but "in other countries, advertisers still need to be convinced about Telegram's benefits."
In 2021, Mr. Durov decided to take on debt. He promoted a bond offering by promising investors a 10 percent discount on an eventual public offering of the company.
In several rounds of bond offerings from 2021 to this year, Telegram raised about $ 2.4 billion from investors including sovereign wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates. BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, also owns some Telegram bonds, according to Bloomberg data.
The bondholder who recently spoke with the company said they were attracted by Telegram's large user base and growth. Prices for Telegram's bonds fell after Mr. Durov's arrest, but have since mostly recovered, a sign the market thinks the company can pay back the money.
In March, Mr. Durov talked up a potential Telegram stock listing to The Financial Times, with the expectation it would happen by early 2026. But plans changed this summer when he was arrested in Paris.
Telegram declined to comment on I.P.O. plans and said it "remains fully owned by Mr. Durov, who has neither the desire nor the need to sell any equity."
Some investors remain wary. Two U.S. hedge funds said they had reviewed the company's finances, but opted against backing it, concerned it would not stabilize its business amid the regulatory and legal scrutiny.
Telegram said it would pay back investors on time. Its crypto holdings have recently been bolstered by the incoming Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies.
Mr. Durov, who has stayed mostly quiet about the accusations against him, has been working out of a Paris hotel since August. He often promotes Telegram's new business features to his more than 13 million followers on the platform, along with occasional life advice.
"Split a big task into smaller parts, organize them in the right sequence -- and you'll get through," he said in October.

Google Suggests Ways It Can Address Monopoly on Search: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The search giant's proposals included allowing flexibility for companies and consumers in choosing a search engine.
Google said on Friday what it thought should change to address a ruling that it had illegally maintained a monopoly over online search: not much.
Google's proposal followed the landmark ruling in August by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who said Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung to be the search engine that automatically appears when users open a web browser or a smartphone. In response, the government last month asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.
In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Judge Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement. But it said those agreements should be less restrictive than in the past.
Apple, for example, could select different search engines to come up automatically for iPhone and iPad users, said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, in a blog post. Cellphone makers using Google's popular operating system, Android, could also install multiple search engines and could install other Google apps without installing its search tool or its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant product.
"We don't propose these changes lightly," she said. "But we believe that they fully address the court's findings, and do so without putting Americans' privacy and security at risk or harming America's global technology leadership."
Google still plans to appeal Judge Mehta's ruling after he makes a decision on remedies sometime next year, Ms. Mulholland added.
What Judge Mehta decides to do could reshape the core of Google, a $ 2.35 trillion company, and the digital economy more broadly. Google made more than half its revenue last year -- $ 175 billion -- from search and related businesses, and the company is so associated with search that its name has become a verb synonymous with looking for answers online.
Google's attempts to fend off the government's sweeping requests -- the most significant remedies requested in a tech monopoly case since the Justice Department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000 -- could help set a precedent for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths.
The Justice Department has sued Apple, claiming the company makes it hard for consumers to leave its tight system of devices and software. Next year, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to go to trial against Meta, over claims that it snuffed out competition when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has also filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopoly in online retail, and is investigating Microsoft's power in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
A second Justice Department case against Google, alleging that it has a monopoly in advertising technology, is awaiting a decision by a federal judge in the coming weeks.
In the search case, which was filed in 2020 under the first administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, Judge Mehta agreed with the government that Google had benefited from a cycle of dominance.
In a 10-week trial last year, Justice Department lawyers said Google had locked out rivals by signing deals with Apple, Mozilla, Samsung and others to automatically appear as the search engine when users open a smartphone or a new tab in a web browser. In total, Google paid $ 26.3 billion as part of those deals in 2021, according to evidence presented at the trial.
Google argued that its deals had not broken the law and that users chose Google because it was better at finding information than search engines like Microsoft's Bing or DuckDuckGo, a product that promises more privacy for its users.
Beyond the sale of Chrome, the government asked for a potential sale of Android, Google's smartphone operating system. It also asked the court to stop the company from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the search engine that is automatically selected on smartphones and in browsers. Google should also allow rival search engines to display the company's results and have access to its data for a decade, the government proposed.
The government also said Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, should be forced to divest its stake in any artificial intelligence products that could compete with search, a bid to stop the company from dominating the nascent technology.
Google urged Judge Mehta to take a more narrow path to resolving those concerns. In addition to opportunities for other search engines to compete for prime placement on phones and browsers, Google said, browser manufacturers like Apple and Mozilla should be allowed to change their default search engines at least every 12 months.
The company proposed what it described in the blog post as a "robust mechanism" to comply with the court's wishes, without "giving the government extensive power over the design of your online experience."
Google said its proposal should apply for three years. The government's proposed changes would apply for a decade.
"The pace of innovation in search has been extraordinary and there is every reason to believe that will continue as developments in artificial intelligence rapidly change online computing products and services," Google said in the filing.
Google said the government sought a response from the judge that "exceeds the anticompetitive conduct found at trial."
The company cited a 1955 opinion from a federal court that said even when a company was found to have broken antitrust laws, a court did not have "license to embark upon a general program of comprehensive control of the defendants' business."

Hedlyne Goes For Maximum of Two Lines
The Biden administration brought new, sweeping accusations of fraud on Friday against three of the largest banks in the country -- but President-elect Donald J. Trump's administration will have the opportunity to drop the case as soon as next month.
The allegations involve Zelle, the money transfer app that is co-owned by seven of the nation's largest banks and competes with Venmo, Cash App and other smartphone-based payment apps. As has been regularly reported, Zelle is a hotbed for scammers, and the lawsuit on Friday from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said more than $ 800 million had been swindled from clients of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
While fraud on Zelle can involve any number of complicated steps, it can be as simple as a grifter's convincing an individual to send payment for an item, such as concert tickets, and then failing to deliver the promised good or service. Banks have long argued they aren't responsible for reimbursing such losses to customers who voluntarily transfer money out of personal accounts, but the consumer bureau said they ought to be. In a 91-page complaint submitted in Arizona federal court, it laid out some of what it said were hundreds of thousands of instances of fraud enabled by the three banks.
"What they built became a gold mine for criminals -- a system that made it easy for fraudsters to move money quickly while making it nearly impossible for customers to get their money back," the agency's director, Rohit Chopra, said.
The lawsuit was the latest in what has become a late blitz of action from the consumer bureau, one of the more hated agencies for many Republicans, who argue that it is reflexively anti-business. This month, the incoming chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, unsuccessfully called for the bureau to pause its rule making until Mr. Trump takes office.

Hedlyne Goes For Maximum of Two Lines
The Commerce Department said on Friday that it was finalizing an award of up to $ 4.745 billion to South Korea's Samsung Electronics and up to $ 1.61 billion for Texas Instruments to expand chips production.
The Samsung award is about $ 1.7 billion smaller than the preliminary award announced in April of up to $ 6.4 billion and reflects its revised smaller investment plans, the department said.
A Commerce spokesperson said the department "changed this award to align with market conditions and the scope of the investment the company is making. Samsung feels that this award represents a strong commitment to their Texas and U.S. efforts and is a sustainable long-term plan for them."
In April, administration officials said Samsung planned to invest roughly $ 45 billion to build two chip production facilities, a research center and a packaging facility by 2030. On Friday, Commerce said Samsung plans to invest $ 37 billion and complete the projects by the end of the decade.
Samsung did not immediately comment but Samsung Electronics executive Young Hyun Jun said in a statement released by Commerce that the agreement "represents another milestone as we continue to invest and build a state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem in the U.S."
Texas Instruments has pledged to investment more than $ 18 billion through 2029 in two new factories in Texas and one in Utah, which are expected to create 2,000 manufacturing jobs. The company is getting $ 900 million for its Texas operations and $ 700 million.
Congress in August 2022 approved a $ 39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $ 75 billion in government lending authority.
Last month, Commerce finalized an award of up to $ 7.86 billion for Intel down from $ 8.5 billion announced in March after the California-based chips maker won a separate $ 3 billion award from the Pentagon. REUTERS

Full text: The north benefited from the global search for alternatives to Chinese manufacturing. No one knows whether a second Trump term will impede or accelerate that growth.
Pham Van Thinh can see the back of an LG electronics factory from his patio, and in his eyes, nothing is more beautiful than that bright white behemoth.
Some nights, when workers stream out after 8 p.m., their lanyards flashing ID cards with new-hire faces, he walks amid the crowd, soaking up the energy of a once-poor village near Vietnam's northern port of Haiphong that has suddenly joined the march of global trade.
"It makes me happy," said Mr. Van Thinh, 73, a retired police chief who fought for the Communist north in the Vietnam War. "All these young people, they have better lives."
Six years ago, this cluster of prosperity did not exist. Then President Donald J. Trump hit China with tariffs, igniting a global search for alternatives to Chinese manufacturing.
Few nations, if any, have benefited more than Vietnam from the scramble that followed -- especially north Vietnam, historically an economic laggard compared to the more cosmopolitan south. Around Haiphong, a few hours' drive from China, factories bloomed. The LG plant expanded exponentially; the industrial park nearby filled up with Chinese companies adding production abroad. Rural hamlets like Mr. Van Thinh's -- once known for little more than rice fields and dreams -- grew almost overnight into boom towns of 30,000.
Will another Trump term impede or accelerate that growth? No one knows.
Mr. Trump has vowed to punish countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States, and Vietnam now ranks third on that list, behind only China and Mexico. Officials in Hanoi say they worry about "discrimination" -- that Vietnam will be singled out for tariffs while competitors avoid Mr. Trump's blacklist.
South Korean companies (including LG and Samsung) are Vietnam's biggest foreign investors, and some have already paused expansion plans, waiting on Washington.
Still, some analysts exude confidence, saying Vietnam will continue to flourish if Mr. Trump slaps far higher tariffs on China than on other countries, as he has threatened.
No matter what happens next, America's once-and-future president can safely say he helped make north Vietnam great again. For the first time since France's 19th-century rule of Vietnam from Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, the north has become Vietnam's economic engine and gateway to the world. It leads the country in the value of exports going out, and foreign investment flowing in.
"The balance of power between these two regions has shifted radically," said Vu Thanh Tu Anh, an economist at the Fulbright School of Public Policy and Management in Ho Chi Minh City. "It shows up in all the statistics."
The north's transformation, while driven in part by geography and local politics, also highlights how trade weaponization by great powers is rearranging the global economy. Industrialization is spreading to new places at a faster clip, with local fortunes defined not just by competitive advantages such as productivity, but also by distant leaders fighting for supremacy, picking winners and losers.
Put another way, the "wisdom of crowds" and markets is giving way to the whims of mercurial men -- with reverberations that reach into distant nations and villages.
From China to Vietnam
In Asia, where national economies are more integrated with fewer trade barriers than almost anywhere else, what Mr. Trump started with tariffs, the pandemic advanced.
Faith in China was shaken as its government resisted investigations into Covid-19's origins and responded to the virus with strict lockdowns and factory shutdowns. That led many governments to get more involved in weaning supply chains from Chinese dominance.
Japan, for example, created a fund in 2020 to help companies diversify from China. South Korea expanded efforts to help businesses build ties to India and Southeast Asia through its "New Southern Policy," while American and European officials have pressured companies (and their Asian suppliers) to "de-risk" from China.
Vietnam has been a huge winner. Of the roughly 120 Japanese companies using government diversification subsidies, over 50 claimed them for Vietnam, more than any other country, according to Japanese officials.
LG, the South Korean multinational, recently sold its last two screen display factories in China after adding production around Haiphong.
A Taiwanese electronics supplier has begun producing network devices for Elon Musk's Starlink system at a factory about 60 miles from Haiphong.
They are part of a larger trend. Between 2017 and 2023, foreign investors committed $ 248.3 billion to Vietnam for 19,701 projects, according to an analysis by Le Hong Hiep, coordinator of the Vietnam studies program at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. That's more than half of all foreign investment since Vietnam opened its economy in the late 1980s.
Vietnam's growing trade surplus with the United States -- reaching $ 104 billion last year, up from $ 38 billion in 2017 -- has led to accusations that China uses Vietnam as a warehouse, rerouting its products to avoid tariffs. Chinese imports and investment have soared.
But in a country as wary of its neighbor as Vietnam, where 1,000 years of Chinese colonization lingers in national memory, the boom is by no means owned or operated by Beijing. From Vietnam's economic opening in the 1980s through 2023, mainland China was the sixth-largest foreign investor in the country. With Hong Kong included, it was only fourth, after South Korea, Japan and Singapore.
A recent Harvard Business School study showed that illegal tariff avoidance was more rare than the trade imbalance might suggest -- representing between 1.8 and 16.1 percent of exports to the United States in 2021.
Researchers found that most exporters were making new products with inputs from many locations and local investment, not just relabeling Chinese products as Vietnamese.
Haiphong's Leap Forward
"No winners" come from a U.S.-China trade war, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, declared last week in a meeting with global financiers. North Vietnam's experience suggests otherwise.
In 1954, after separating from France to become an independent nation, it was one of the poorest and least-developed countries in Asia, relying almost entirely on subsistence farming.
Haiphong, the north's main port, was pounded by the U.S. military with some of the heaviest bombing raids of the war, and in the decade after unification in 1975, all of Vietnam became what one scholar called "a poverty-stricken society beset by a stagnant economy."
Today, double-digit growth rates in the north are the norm, and Haiphong is a modern metropolis of two million people connected to Hanoi by a new highway. Cranes swing like weather vanes above more than a dozen construction sites. New bridges cross a river twisting through the city, where piers at industrial parks help ships move to one of the busiest ports in the world.
Bruno Jaspaert, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam and the chief executive of DEEP C, which runs industrial parks around Haiphong, said the waterway was just one regional advantage. Northern provinces have also had leaders better connected to Hanoi, yielding more infrastructure investment, plus more open, affordable land.
Compared to the south, where an industrial base left over from the war made it easier for companies like Nike to get going in the 1990s, Mr. Jaspaert said the north "started later, they can plan better and they are also much faster."
Pointing out the window of his office to Haiphong's new city hall, surrounded by new apartment complexes, he emphasized that none of that was there when he moved to Vietnam in 2018.
Northern Vietnam was already growing then, in a country that lifted 40 million people out of poverty from 1993 to 2014. But American tariffs became an economic accelerant -- lighter fluid poured on a steady flame. And in the north, an epicenter of ancient Vietnamese civilization and Communist revolution, government officials' quick action coincided with foreign investors' own sense of capitalist urgency.
Mr. Jaspaert said production decisions that once took 18 to 24 months now take six to nine. And while the south stagnates somewhat (Ho Chi Minh City's subway line remains incomplete after 20 years of construction), the north races on.
DEEP C's revenues and profits have quintupled since the Trump tariffs.
Villages like Mr. Van Thinh's have been transformed.
When the LG plant expanded in 2019, the narrow streets of nearby hamlets quickly turned into commercial strips with restaurants and bold-colored barbershops for workers who make a solid local wage of around $ 400 to $ 550 a month.
Every spare piece of land has been turned into worker housing. Mr. Van Thinh now manages 35 rooms with his family. Nearby, Pham Thi Cham, 55, drained a backyard pond where she raised fish to build eight rooms that she rents out for about $ 60 a month.
Many of the workers come from central Vietnam. Instead of going south, they came north.
Tran Van Sy, 26, a quiet young man in a knockoff Givenchy T-shirt, arrived three years ago from a poor coastal province to work for LG. He said he lives frugally enough to send 60 percent of his pay back home.
It's a story repeated up and down the halls of boardinghouses with sneakers by the doors and motorbikes parked outside.
Mr. Van Thinh said all nine of his grandchildren were studying at universities or working at factories.
"I never could have imagined this," he said.
Now, with defiant exuberance, he can't imagine the progress stopping.
He emphasized that he trusted his government to keep manufacturing healthy, adding pressure for leaders in Hanoi.
Plus, would Mr. Trump really crush a boom outside China that he helped create?
"Everything is going so well," Mr. Van Thinh said, staring at the hazy lights of the LG factory. "These companies, they'll continue to expand."

China Opens Investigation Into Nvidia For Antitrust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move by Chinese regulators came a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced U.S. technology to China.
China's antimonopoly regulator announced on Monday that it was investigating potential violations of antitrust law by Nvidia, the American company that makes a vast majority of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems.
The inquiry, a rare move by Beijing, comes a week after the Biden administration expanded curbs on the sale of advanced American technology to China. In the days since, the Chinese government announced that it would ban the export of several rare minerals to the United States and imposed sanctions on more than a dozen U.S. defense firms and defense industry executives.
Together, the moves by Beijing signal its willingness to engage in supply chain warfare as the policy contest over trade and the control of technology escalates between the world's two largest economies.
The battle has made A.I. chips into one of the world's most sought-after technologies, and Nvidia has cornered the market, accounting for 90 percent of global sales by the end of last year. Nvidia's dominance helped it become one of the most valuable companies in the world over the past year.
Graham Webster, an academic focused on geopolitics and technology at Stanford University, said China had a variety of tools it could use to go after foreign companies and show its opposition to U.S. policy. "Nvidia is a pretty obvious target," he added.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday that it was investigating Nvidia for violating commitments made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a company that makes computer networking equipment. The Chinese regulator approved Nvidia's acquisition of the company in 2020 with conditions to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure supplies to China.
Nvidia said in a statement that it was "happy to answer" questions from China's regulators. "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," the statement said.
As the Biden administration has progressively tightened restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China, the company has responded by offering less powerful versions of its chips to the Chinese market.
Officials in Washington, in trying to prevent Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and the machines to make them, say that the technology is essential not just for smartphones and chatbots but also for military superiority.
Chinese tech companies have resorted to stockpiling the chips, while also turning to smugglers and front companies to secure supplies. At the same time, Beijing is pouring large sums of money into its own chip companies in an attempt to make its tech sector less reliant on foreign technology.
"Well before the Biden administration, the Chinese government wanted greater self-reliance on key technologies," said Mr. Webster, a scholar at the program on geopolitics, technology and governance at Stanford.
The Biden administration has been considering further restrictions on global sales of A.I. chips that could affect Nvidia and its competitors. One new rule could impose more requirements on companies from the United States and other countries when shipping advanced A.I. chips to China, to try to ensure they are not breaking existing U.S. rules, according to two people familiar with the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The new rule would build on letters that the U.S. government sent to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, two of the world's largest chip companies, ordering them to stop sending advanced chips to China. The Biden administration had discovered that TSMC made some components for A.I. chips produced by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, in violation of export controls.
Another pending rule from Washington could impose licensing requirements and caps on the number of chips that could be sold in certain countries, as well as security standards for those buying larger clusters of A.I. chips.
Alan Estevez, a U.S. Department of Commerce official who oversees export controls, declined to comment on the pending rules, but said that the department was continuing to investigate how TSMC chips could end up in Huawei's A.I. products.
The Chinese government's antitrust investigation of Nvidia is not the first time Beijing has targeted American chipmakers.
In October, a think tank with ties to China's internet regulatory agency called for a review of Intel, the American tech company, for selling products that "constantly harmed" China's national security and interests. The last company subject to a cybersecurity review was the American chip maker Micron, which was ultimately cut off from supplying chips to a significant portion of the Chinese market. Another American chipmaker, Qualcomm, paid a $ 975 million fine in 2015 after the Chinese government investigated it for antimonopoly violations.
Last week, Chinese industry groups representing companies in a range of business sectors, including semiconductors and auto manufacturing, called for Chinese companies to purchase more chips domestically or from countries other than the United States.
"American chip products are no longer safe and reliable, and related Chinese industries will have to be cautious in purchasing American chips," the China Semiconductor Industry Association said, following the U.S. decision to impose export controls.
As Nvidia has grown, revenue from China has become less important to the company overall. During its most recent fiscal year, Nvidia's sales there fell to 14 percent of its total business from 19 percent.
But no Chinese company has been able to make chips as advanced as Nvidia's.
"China still wants Nvidia technology, in part or in whole," said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies. "Its market share dominance was well established in China long before export controls."
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Nvidia's sales practices and its most recent acquisitions. The U.S. inquiry is largely concerned with the company's power to determine how a scarce but essential technology is being allocated.
Competitors and customers around the world have complained about Nvidia's ownership of critical pieces of the A.I. supply chain. In addition to making the chips crucial to building A.I. systems, the company controls software that manages data centers and sells some of the leading equipment that controls high-performance computers.

G.M. to Sell Its Stake In a Plant Back to LG: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: LG Energy Solution will now solely own a factory in Michigan that it had planned to operate through a joint venture with General Motors.
General Motors said on Monday that it was selling its stake in a nearly complete battery factory in Michigan to its partner LG Energy Solution, reducing to three the number of battery plants the carmaker will operate in the United States.
G.M. and LG, a South Korean company, already produce batteries jointly at factories in Warren, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tenn., that supply vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox.
G.M. has a separate battery joint venture with Samsung SDI that is building a factory in New Carlisle, Ind. G.M. said it remained committed to that project.
Electric vehicle sales, while brisk, have not lived up to projections from a few years ago, prompting many carmakers to delay or cancel investments. "We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the E.V. market in a capital efficient manner," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in a statement.
LG will complete work on the Michigan factory, in Lansing, and sell its output to another customer, which will be named later. G.M. said it would get back the $ 1 billion it had invested in the factory, which is nearly finished.
G.M. has boasted that it is close to making a profit on electric vehicles in part because it can mass-produce batteries in the United States, driving down costs and taking advantage of manufacturing subsidies offered by the Biden administration. G.M. sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any carmaker except Tesla during the third quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
But President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress may undo or reduce those subsidies next year, forcing carmakers and battery producers to reassess whether they can expect a return on their investments.
G.M. has also been re-examining its approach to electric vehicle batteries since hiring Kurt Kelty, a former Tesla executive, as vice president for batteries in February. Mr. Kelty has said G.M. will diversify the kinds of batteries it uses, tailoring them to different vehicles and price ranges.
Along those lines, G.M. also said Monday that it would jointly develop prismatic batteries with LG Energy Solution. Prismatic batteries are packaged in rigid cases that weigh less and are simpler to manufacture, G.M. said. G.M. and LG currently produce so-called pouch batteries, which have soft packaging.
"We're focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve E.V. performance, enhance safety and reduce costs," Mr. Kelty said in a statement Monday.

Government to Lend $7 Billion to Build Battery Factories: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The loan, from the Biden administration, was designed to withstand Republican attacks and will be used to make electric-car batteries in Indiana.
The Biden administration expanded its efforts to lock in its climate policies on Monday, saying that it would lend almost $ 7 billion to help build battery factories in Indiana to supply vehicles made by Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram.
The financing, which was the second multibillion-dollar loan related to electric-vehicle manufacturing in a week, is part of the administration's efforts to create domestic supplies of batteries.
President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to reverse Biden administration policies aimed at promoting electric-vehicle manufacturing. Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gases in the United States.
Last week, the Department of Energy said it would lend $ 6 billion to help Rivian build an electric-car factory in Georgia. Rivian, a relatively new company that makes only electric vehicles, plans to produce sport utility vehicles and hatchbacks at the factory, in Social Circle, near Atlanta.
The loan announced on Monday, for $ 6.85 billion not including interest, will be used to finance two battery plants in Kokomo, Ind., that are being built by StarPlus Energy, a joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI, a South Korean company.
The factories will employ 2,800 people once they are up and running and 3,200 workers during construction. The plants will be capable of making batteries for 670,000 vehicles a year, the Department of Energy said.
The loan agreements for StarPlus and Rivian will be binding once the government and the companies sign final contracts, which is expected to take place before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January.
As has often been the case with the Biden administration's clean energy funds, both projects are in congressional districts represented by Republicans, who have generally been opposed to using federal money to promote the manufacturing of electric cars.
Still, some of them may be unwilling to get in the way of projects that bring thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to their districts.
Carmakers have also asked Mr. Trump not to roll back tax provisions that support sales of electric vehicles.
In addition to promoting sale of electric vehicles, the Biden administration has sought to establish domestic sources of lithium and other materials used to make batteries. China currently dominates the battery-supply chain.
The Indiana factories "will greatly expand E.V. battery manufacturing capacity in North America and reduce America's reliance on adversarial foreign nations like China," the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office said in a statement.
Sales of electric vehicles have fallen short of some projections, but they still rose 11 percent in the third quarter while sales of gasoline cars were flat, according to Cox Automotive.
The Biden administration has offered tax credits of up to $ 7,500 and other incentives intended to ensure that half of all cars sold by 2030 are electric, up from 9 percent this year.
Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have vowed to eliminate the incentives and other environmental policies that they have said effectively force carmakers to sell electric vehicles that buyers do not want.
Stellantis has not been a major presence in the U.S. electric car market, but it is rolling out several new battery-powered models in the coming months, including versions of the Jeep Wagoneer S.U.V., Dodge Charger muscle cars and Ram pickups.
The federal loan will make it easier for Stellantis, which also owns Peugeot, Fiat and several other brands, to compete in the market for electric cars. The company has lost market share in the United States and is under financial pressure after sales worldwide fell 27 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.
Stellantis announced on Sunday that its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, had resigned.
The Biden administration has lent almost $ 34 billion to support manufacturing of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles, including the Rivian and Stellantis projects.
The loans carry interest rates comparable to what the federal government pays on Treasury notes.

How Does Google Reverse Monopoly Grip on Search?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The federal judge who ruled Google was a monopolist in search is weighing the U.S. government's proposal to force the company to sell its Chrome browser. Here's what happens now.
The U.S. government asked a federal judge last month to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular web browser.
It was the most extreme proposal by the Justice Department to address Google's monopoly in internet search after the judge's landmark decision in August, which found the Silicon Valley company had violated antitrust laws. To fix the issue, Google will offer its own remedies this month.
The judge, Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to decide how to address Google's search monopoly by August. His ruling could cause enormous ripple effects, potentially reshaping the internet.
Here's what to expect.
Why does Google face a breakup?
The Justice Department and several states sued Google in 2020, accusing it of illegally protecting its monopoly over internet search and search advertising.
Google for years had paid companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers. The government said these contracts were designed to entrench Google's dominance and make it harder for rivals to compete.
Google's ironclad hold over online search allowed it to gather more data from users, which then made its product better and harder for rivals to dislodge, Justice Department lawyers argued during a 10-week trial last year.
Google countered, among other defenses, that it had simply created the best search product.
Judge Mehta ultimately ruled in favor of the government. Now he must decide how to solve the problem with "remedies" to restore competition to the market.
What did the Justice Department propose as fixes?
Beyond forcing Google to sell Chrome, the Justice Department said in a filing last month that the company should be barred from entering into the exclusive search engine agreements. The judge should also force Google to share its search results and data with rivals for a decade, the government said.
Google should be forced to choose between selling Android, its smartphone operating system, or being barred from taking steps that force companies to bundle its services with Android phones, the government said. And the company should shed any stakes in artificial intelligence companies that it has invested in, since A.I. can bolster search, the government added.
What is Google's next step?
The Silicon Valley company has until Dec. 20 to submit its solutions to fix its search monopoly.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, recently said the government was pushing a "radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America's global technology leadership" and "break a range of Google products."
Paul Gallant, a tech policy analyst at TD Cowen, said he expected Google to not go beyond what the company wanted to do. That could include an offer to stop paying to be the automatic search engine on phones and browsers, he said.
"It wants to propose something that shows the judge it's taking this all seriously, but not so much that the judge says, 'Sounds good -- you got it,' and then the company regrets the offer," Mr. Gallant said.
And then?
Judge Mehta has scheduled a hearing starting in April to ask both sides to present arguments for their proposals. Witnesses are also expected to testify.
Throughout the case, Judge Mehta has been careful not to tip his hand. He could take remedies from one side wholesale, or find his own middle ground. In court in November, he said it was clear that the remedies debate would include discussion of the impact of artificial intelligence.
Which companies were broken up previously?
In 1911, a Supreme Court decision broke up Standard Oil, the source of the Rockefeller family fortune. Standard Oil was split into 34 companies, including Standard Oil of New Jersey, which became Exxon, and Standard Oil of California, one of the roots of modern-day Chevron.
Facing pressure from the federal government, AT&T agreed in 1982 to split itself up into regional phone providers.
In 2000, the Justice Department persuaded a judge to order a breakup of Microsoft, which was accused of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system. But an appeals court overturned that decision the next year.
What would a breakup mean for Google?
A breakup would damage Google, which has built an integrated web of online systems and services to aid its lucrative search business. Last year, the company generated $ 175 billion from its search engine and related businesses, or 57 percent of its total revenue. Any split could also dent the company's considerable profit, which totaled $ 74 billion in 2023.
If Google is forced to divest Chrome, its search engine's popularity could erode. Google has 89 percent of the global search market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Any drop in traffic would mean fewer clicks on ads and less revenue.
"Google will lose one of the most powerful moats around its ads business," said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst at eMarketer, a firm that conducts business research.
A spinoff of Android would also be painful, eliminating Google's influence over a majority of the world's smartphones. The mobile operating system brings users into the company's ecosystem of services and helps it compete against Apple in smartphones and other devices.
If another search engine became the one to be automatically selected on Android devices, that could further diminish traffic to Google's search engine, hurting revenue and profit.
The final remedies could influence other antitrust lawsuits against Google. A federal judge in Virginia heard closing arguments last month from the Justice Department and the company over accusations that Google has a monopoly in ad technology.

Lucy Liu Likes an Artistic Work in Progress: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "That's how creative things happen," said the actress, one of the stars of the holiday film "Red One."
Lucy Liu's 9-year-old son, Rockwell, hasn't seen his mother draw blood in "Charlie's Angels" or "Shazam! Fury of the Gods" and certainly not in "Kill Bill, Vol. 1."
But the only splash of crimson in her latest film, "Red One," is the suit of Santa Claus, who has been kidnapped from the North Pole. Liu is one of the Christmas movie's stars, alongside Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, and plays the head of security for the world's mythological creatures.
"This is the only live-action movie that my son has been able to watch, and he wanted to see it again right afterward," Liu said on a video call. "I think he forgot that I was actually in it at one point."
When she isn't shooting or producing (she will next appear in "Presence," a Steven Soderbergh thriller slated for release in January), Liu can most often be found in her art studio. She tends to lose track of time there -- "the whole point of art," she said. "You just get lost in that world."
Liu, who lives in Manhattan, elaborated on why her library card, spur-of-the-moment theatergoing and riding her bicycle are essential to her well-being. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Transcendental Meditation
I put together an art book years ago, and I asked Deepak Chopra if he would write a foreword. He did, but he also asked me to come into his office. He wanted to teach me about meditation. And so he gave me a mantra, and it was an important moment for me because I didn't know that it would make such a big difference.
NY1
Now they have an app and I can have it on my phone. I feel like it's unfiltered. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of agenda. It doesn't feel like it's over-branded. Every morning, it's the first thing that happens to me after meditation.
My Library Card
I love the public library. I love going to the library for my son, for myself. I love the smell of a library. I love that when you go to the children's section, it's not quiet. And I love reading those children's books because when I was younger, my parents did not read children's books to me. So everything is absolutely new for me.
Spontaneous Theater
When I have time, I'll jump on the subway and meet my friend at the theater and we'll stand in line and see if they have tickets. I don't care where I sit. I'll sit in the mezzanine, I'll sit in the balcony. I love that shared experience and that you don't have to plan it weeks or months in advance.
Public Transportation
I was born and raised in Queens, so I took it to go to high school. I don't know that I appreciated it that much then, but my son and I love taking the bus and the subway. It's super fast. You can read, listen to music, people-watch. I absorb everything that's happening. I keep my ears open.
My Freestyle Samsung Projector
You can put this in your bag and connect it to an outlet and project it on a wall or on a sheet or wherever you want. It is so convenient, and it just makes it so much better not to have a television set hanging right in front of you.
Udon at the Gallery
I was hemming and hawing if I should even put this in because I hate to blow up a spot. I mean, it's already very popular -- a really beautiful place called the Gallery. It has this gorgeous udon dish. They put it in what looks like a coffee filter with this broth that has so much umami. There's a live flame. I think most people think udon is a whole bowl of noodles. No, it's like eight strands of noodles that they handmade in-house with just the exact right amount of sides, whether it's kitsune or Wagyu or mushrooms.
Haflinger Slippers
They're felt, but they have a support, and they're so comfortable. It is hard to have a different slipper after you wear them. Mine were so worn out that they had holes in them, and a friend said, "You can no longer wear those." I secretly kept them.
Bicycle
When you're riding a bicycle, there's no way to not feel like a child again, just the feeling of the wind and the environment around you. I love being able to stand on the bike and huff and puff up or down the hill. You feel so alive.
My Art Studio
It's a safe space. You can make a mess and you can leave it and come back to it. I think it's important to make a mess because sometimes that's how creative things happen. At my son's school, if he was doing something creative and had to transition to another project, they would put a work-save card on it and say just don't touch it. And that's essentially what a studio is. The whole space is a work-save card.

Adding Layers of Security To Your Phone or Tablet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: New features in Apple's iOS 18 and Google's Android 15 can lock up apps with sensitive information and even hide them from view.
Losing a smartphone or tablet stuffed with your life's details can be a nightmare, but your privacy may also be at risk in less obvious situations -- like if you leave your unlocked phone unattended or if the children know your tablet's passcode. While apps for financial or medical matters typically require their own passwords (and Apple's Photos and Google Photos can hide specific pictures), the latest versions of iOS and Android offer new tools for further shielding sensitive content on your device. Here's a quick overview.
Securing iOS Apps
Apple's iOS 18, released in September, now includes the ability to lock apps that don't already require a passcode, Face ID or Touch ID to open them. Apple notes that look-alike siblings and children could bypass Face ID, so use a secret passcode if that's a concern.
To lock an app, find it on the iPhone's or iPad's home screen (or in the App Library) and press your finger on its icon. In the pop-up menu, select "Require Face ID" or the security method you normally use.
Tap "Require Face ID" again when prompted. To open that app going forward, you'll need to unlock it.
To remove the lock from an app, press down on its icon and select "Don't Require Face ID" from the menu.
If locking is not enough, you can also now hide specific apps (and not just entire home-screen pages).
While Apple's default iOS apps can't be hidden, you can put the invisibility cloak on the ones you have downloaded from the App Store. Just press your finger on an app's icon, choose "Require Face ID" and tap "Hide and Require Face ID" from the menu.
Hidden apps won't show up in searches or provide notifications. They appear as blank icons in a folder at the bottom of the App Library screen. Tap the Hidden folder to authenticate and unlock it so you can use the apps. (Alternatively, open Settings, select Apps and scroll to the bottom to see the Hidden Apps menu.)
To make a hidden app visible again, find its icon in one of these places, press on it and choose "Don't Require Face ID." You may have to manually add it back to your home screen from the icon's pop-up menu.
Securing Android Apps
Tools included with Android phones vary based on the system version, the device manufacturer and the wireless carrier. Many of these combinations can hide and lock apps, so check your settings for options.
For example, many Samsung Galaxy devices have a "Hide apps on Home and Apps screens" option. And most Galaxy models can lock sensitive apps in the Secure Folder, which can be found in the security settings. Once you follow the steps to enable the Secure Folder, you need to supply a passcode or another digital key to get to the items stored within it.
In its Android 15 system released last month, Google added a "private space" feature, which allows you to install apps into a digital vault that requires a password or another authentication to open. Once you set it up, you can switch between using apps in your private space and those in your regular collection.
Google's Android Help site has a lengthy guide to setting up and using a private space. But to get started, go to the Settings app, tap "Security & Privacy," scroll down and select "Private Space."
You need to unlock your device with your authentication method to proceed. Tap the "Set Up" button to be guided through the steps for configuring the private space, which includes creating (or signing into) a separate Google Account and installing apps into it. This action walls off those applications from the rest of the device -- and keeps that data from syncing with your main Google Account.
You must choose a way to unlock the private space (like fingerprint recognition or a PIN), which can differ from your main device lock. Keep in mind that apps stop running when the private space is locked. Google advises that apps that use the phone's sensors to track information (like medical data) or that run in the background are not suitable for stashing in a private space.
Once you have established your private space, you can find it by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the All Apps screen. Tap the lock icon to open or close the private space. If you really want invisibility, tap the gear icon and choose the option to hide the private space when it's locked. To find it yourself, enter "private space" in the Android search bar.
Photograph To take off the lock, top, press "Don't Require Face ID." Above, you can find hidden apps in the Hidden folder on the iOS App Library screen or at the end of the app list in the Face ID & Passcode settings.; Setting up your secret app vault in Android 15 starts with selecting the Private Space option in the Security & Privacy settings and then following the steps on the screen.

Swedish Battery Maker Files For Bankruptcy in the U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's woes are symptomatic of a wider malaise among companies that make batteries for electric vehicles.
The Swedish battery maker Northvolt, once seen as Europe's strongest competitor to Chinese battery manufacturers, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday.
The company has been struggling financially for months, cutting jobs and restructuring operations. Founded in 2016 by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt said filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow it to "restructure its debt, appropriately scale the business to current customer needs and secure a sustainable foundation for continued operation."
The company has faced a series of challenges this year. They began with accidents at a plant in Sweden and the loss of a contract with BMW worth 2 billion euros, or $ 2.15 billion, in June. In September, Northvolt announced plans to pause its production of cathode materials -- one of the basic building blocks of a battery -- at a factory in Skelleftea, Sweden.
Two planned factories in Germany and Canada are financed separately and will continue to operate outside the bankruptcy process, the company said. Northvolt's factories in Sweden will remain open and continue to make deliveries and pay vendors and employees, the company added.
The filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, and the company said it expected to emerge from the process in the first quarter of next year.
"Despite near-term challenges, this action to strengthen our capital structure will allow us to capture the continued market demand for vehicle electrification," Tom Johnstone, the company's interim chairman, said in a statement.
Northvolt said it would gain access to new sources of funding through the bankruptcy process, including $ 145 million in cash. In addition, it said, one of its customers had committed to providing a $ 100 million loan.
The company reported a $ 1.2 billion loss in 2023, increasing from a $ 285 million loss in the previous year. Nevertheless, in January it secured financing from the European Union worth $ 5 billion, the largest loan from the bloc aimed at fostering green-tech industries.
Northvolt's woes are symptomatic of a wider malaise among companies that make batteries for electric vehicles, one that bodes ill for American and European automakers trying to keep pace with new rivals from China.
Chinese battery makers like CATL and BYD have been thriving while competitors in South Korea, Japan and Europe have been struggling. The Chinese battery makers are benefiting from soaring sales of electric vehicles in China, where the technology accounts for half of new car sales. That gives Chinese battery makers a clear advantage over competitors like Northvolt, SK, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and Panasonic, which are more dependent on Europe and the United States, where E.V. sales have been tepid.
Demand for battery-powered vehicles in Europe stagnated this year, growing only 1.3 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 14.6 percent in the previous year, according to the European Union.
The slump affecting battery makers underscores the extent to which China sets the tone for electric vehicle manufacturing. CATL is already the largest battery maker in the world by a wide margin.
Some people in the battery industry said it was a mistake to try to compete with Chinese manufacturers, given that they had a big head start. The Chinese government decided years ago to focus on electric vehicles and subsidized battery makers.
Investors and governments should have put their money into new battery technologies that would give them an advantage, said Celina Mikolajczak, a former Tesla executive who is the chief battery technology officer at Lyten, a Silicon Valley company that is developing batteries made using low-cost sulfur rather than costly metals like nickel and cobalt.
"If you are going to play in that industry, you have to bring something that differentiates you," Ms. Mikolajczak said.
Battery manufacturing is exceedingly difficult. Cells must be manufactured on automated assembly lines in dust-free environments using highly processed metals and chemicals. Minor impurities can ruin batches of cells, costing companies millions. Battery factories cost billions of dollars to build, and there is a shortage of engineers with the required know-how.
"The world grossly underestimated how hard it is to make batteries," said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila, a company that makes advanced battery materials. "We are going to shake out to fewer players."
Signs had been building that Northvolt was in distress. In August, the company said it would shut down a research and development center near San Francisco and consolidate the development of next-generation batteries in Sweden. Patrik Andreasson, the chief strategy officer at Northvolt, warned that Europe and the United States risked falling behind in electric vehicle technology.
"The longer we as Europe and North America take to switch over to full battery electric vehicles, the more territory we concede to competitors, mainly out of China," Mr. Andreasson said in an interview in August.

U.S. Remedy For Google Could Force Chrome Sale: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In a landmark antitrust case, the government asked a judge to force the company to sell its popular Chrome browser.
The Justice Department and a group of states asked a federal court late Wednesday to force Google to sell Chrome, its popular web browser, a move that could fundamentally alter the $ 2 trillion company's business and reshape competition on the internet.
The request followed a landmark ruling in August by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that found Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search. Judge Mehta asked the Justice Department and the states that brought the antitrust case to submit solutions by the end of Wednesday to correct the search monopoly.
Beyond the sale of Chrome, the government asked Judge Mehta to give Google a choice: Either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or be barred from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the government could force the company to sell Android at a later date.
In a sweeping filing, the government also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on smartphones and in browsers. The court should also require Google to allow rival search engines to display the company's results and have access to its data for a decade, the government said.
The proposals are the most significant remedies requested in a tech antitrust case since the Justice Department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000. If Judge Mehta adopts the proposals, they will set the tone for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths, including Apple, Amazon and Meta.
Being forced to sell Chrome and Android would be among the worst possible outcomes for Google. Chrome, which was introduced in 2008 and is free to use, is the most popular web browser in the world, with an estimated 67 percent of the global browser market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Google's search engine is bundled into Chrome.
Android is the world's most popular mobile software, with an estimated 71 percent of the market, according to Statcounter. The system is open source, meaning that Samsung and other phone manufacturers do not have to pay Google for its use. But most Android devices come with Google's apps already installed.
Both are part of an elaborate Google ecosystem that keeps people using the company's products.
"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired," the government said in the filing. "The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages."
Legal experts said the request to force the sale of Chrome could be met with skepticism by Judge Mehta, in part because the government's attempted breakup of Microsoft in the 2000s was overturned by an appeals court.
"That's going to be an uphill climb for the government," said Doug Melamed, a visiting fellow at Stanford Law School who worked in the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Microsoft case.
Google is set to file its own suggestions for fixing the search monopoly by Dec. 20. Both sides can modify their requests before Judge Mehta is expected to hear arguments on the remedies this spring. He is expected to rule by the end of the summer.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, called the government's proposal "extreme."
"D.O.J.'s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court's decision," he said in a blog post. "It would break a range of Google products -- even beyond Search -- that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives."
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
Regulators have in recent years cracked down on the power of the biggest tech companies. The Justice Department has also sued Google over its dominance in advertising technology, and Apple for making it difficult for consumers to leave its tightly knit universe of devices and software. The Federal Trade Commission has separately sued Amazon and Meta, accusing them of anticompetitive behavior and stifling rivals.
It is unclear if these efforts will continue under President-elect Donald J. Trump. Some of the antitrust lawsuits began during his first administration.
The government's victory in the Google search case followed a 10-week trial last year. Justice Department lawyers said Google had locked out rivals by signing deals with Apple, Mozilla, Samsung and others to be the default search engine that appears when users open a smartphone or a new tab in a web browser. In total, Google paid $ 26.3 billion as part of those deals in 2021, according to evidence presented at the trial.
The government argued that those deals entrenched Google's power, guaranteeing that its search traffic was robust. The company then used the data it gathered to make its search engine better, which kept customers coming back.
Google argued that its deals had not broken the law and that users chose Google because it was better than search engines like Microsoft's Bing or DuckDuckGo at finding information.
The states and the Justice Department were still deciding what to ask for right up to the Wednesday deadline, according to three people familiar with the talks.
The government also asked the judge to force Google to shed any stakes in artificial intelligence companies that control technology that could compete with search engines. Generative A.I. has emerged as the next big playing field in tech, and Google has already integrated its own A.I. into search results.
Google is an investor in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that makes a chatbot called Claude. Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.
Publishers and website owners should also have the ability to opt out of Google's A.I. models using that content for training, the government said in its filing.
On Monday, a federal judge will hear closing arguments in the second major antitrust trial against Google -- the one involving advertising technology -- in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president-elect is again calling out companies by name in his campaign against what he sees as other countries' unfair practices.
When Donald J. Trump repeatedly singled out the Japanese construction equipment maker Komatsu during his 2016 presidential campaign, employees at the company were taken aback.
He brought up the Tokyo-based maker of tractors, forklifts and bulldozers in interviews and during presidential debates -- sometimes to make a point about the decline of U.S. manufacturing, and sometimes for no apparent reason. In one interview, Mr. Trump criticized the Affordable Care Act as being so expensive that it required people to "get hit by a Komatsu tractor" to meet the deductible.
At the time, Komatsu's president brushed off the remarks, saying the company was grateful to Mr. Trump for helping to raise its global profile. After his improbable victory over Hillary Clinton, however, Komatsu took steps to ingratiate itself with the Trump White House.
In 2017, Komatsu spent about $ 2.8 billion to acquire an American company that made mining equipment. Since then, it has increased investments in North America, adding thousands of workers to its payroll and ramping up domestic production.
When Mr. Trump was campaigning again this year, Komatsu returned to his cross hairs. His criticism was the same: He said the company had an unfair advantage from a weak Japanese yen.
"Look at Komatsu and these tractor companies," he said in a June interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. "Nobody wants to buy our product because it's too expensive."
A return to a Trump presidency is expected to have major implications for companies that do significant trade with the United States. But for those that have already been a target of Mr. Trump's hectoring and public spotlight, this week's election has come with an extra jolt of déjà vu -- a reminder of the chaos of having to react to barbs lobbed from Mr. Trump's bully pulpit.
"It's really risky because his ire can be random," said Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at the investment bank Natixis. "Companies know they can get caught in the crossfire."
In Asia, which accounts for the majority of America's trade deficit, executives and policymakers are scrambling to understand what the president-elect's pledge of higher tariffs will mean for the region. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called for blanket levies of up to 20 percent on all imports, while imported goods from China would be subject to tariffs of 60 percent or more.
In a research note, the Australian banking group ANZ said that it expected Trump 2.0 to phase in the new China tariffs over time but that 60 percent was unlikely. The note also laid out possible responses from Beijing such as scaling back imports of U.S. agriculture goods and restricting exports of critical materials like rare earth metals.
China's foreign ministry declined to comment on Wednesday about "hypothetical" tariffs.
Mr. Trump has also denounced major Biden administration economic initiatives that encouraged Asian technology companies to invest in the United States.
South Korean firms, such as the battery makers LG Energy Solution and SK On, have plowed money into building facilities and adding suppliers in the United States since the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted in 2022. The law provides tax credits and incentives to companies investing in green industries in the United States. Mr. Trump has said he plans to repeal the law and rescind the unspent funds.
Similarly, the South Korean chip maker Samsung Electronics relied on $ 6.4 billion in subsidies to build U.S. semiconductor plants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act to reduce America's reliance on chips produced in Asia. Its rival SK Hynix received $ 450 million in funding.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest chip maker, received $ 6.6 billion to build a factory in Arizona.
Mr. Trump said the subsidies for Taiwanese companies, like TSMC's funding for the Arizona plant, were a bad idea, because Taiwan had already grown to dominate the chip industry at the expense of U.S. rivals.
"They took almost 100 percent of our chip industry," Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek. "We should have never let that happen. Now we're giving them billions of dollars to build new chips in our country."
Mr. Trump has yet to comment publicly on recent reports that some TSMC chips have ended up in devices made by Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant that was put on a trade blacklist during the first Trump administration. TSMC, which makes most of the world's advanced chips, said it had not supplied to Huawei since the restrictions went into place.
TSMC said its investment plan in the United States remains unchanged. Another Taiwanese company, GlobalWafers Corp., a maker of silicon used in chip production, said that it expected the subsidies offered under the CHIPS Act to continue and "run smoothly in the Trump administration."
When it came to his dealings with India in his first term, Mr. Trump zeroed in on Harley-Davidson, the Milwaukee-based manufacturer of heavyweight motorcycles, as a symbol of what he saw as the country's misuse of tariffs. Mr. Trump has called India, hailed by Republicans and Democrats as a crucial strategic partner in America's competition with China, a "very big abuser" of tariffs.
But Harley-Davidson, a rip-roaring symbol of the American highway, became a fixation for Mr. Trump. In 2018 alone, he brought up the plight of Harley-Davidson in India at least three times. The sticker price of fully American-assembled bikes that the company sold in India were marked up because of tariffs as high as 100 percent.
"It's unfair," Mr. Trump told a group of American governors at the White House that year. "India is selling us a lot of motorbikes."
Overall, the country exports more to the United States than it imports, leaving Americans with a $ 28 billion trade deficit. All motor vehicles and parts accounted for barely 4 percent of what India sold to the United States, most of which was in oil products, gems and gold.
Mr. Trump boasted that he had talked Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India into reducing the tariff to 50 percent, but he still wasn't satisfied. "The prime minister, who I think is a fantastic man, called me the other day and said, 'We are lowering it to 50 percent,"' Mr. Trump said. "Like they're doing us a favor. That's not a favor."
But the lower tariffs had little effect on Harley-Davidson. The company was already avoiding levies by assembling midweight bikes at a plant near New Delhi, and it knew that its full-size motorcycles were a luxury and not well suited to Indian streets. It closed its plant in 2020.
Shortly after, Harley-Davidson announced a partnership with Hero MotoCorp, a local manufacturer. Hero makes a Harley-branded bike that is lighter and much cheaper than anything Harley sells in the United States.
Back in Tokyo, Komatsu has been contemplating how to respond to a second term for Mr. Trump. As it has for many Japanese manufacturers, a weak yen -- trading near three-decade lows -- has helped Komatsu's bottom line when it sells goods abroad and brings those foreign earnings back to Japan. The company has posted two straight years of record profits.
Mr. Trump said he believed that the weak yen and Komatsu's success were hurting rivals like Caterpillar, the U.S. industry leader in construction equipment. But Komatsu's annual revenue is roughly one-third of Caterpillar's, and the U.S. construction giant's market value is eight times as great.
For its part, Komatsu sees the United States as an export hub and ships more out of the country than it imports. Half of its U.S. sales are from products made in America.
Hiroyuki Ogawa, the company's president, said in a briefing last week that Komatsu would try to import parts for its sold-in-America equipment from countries including Indonesia, India and Thailand if Mr. Trump imposed substantial tariffs on China.
He is hoping that the company's significant U.S. investments and bolstered manufacturing presence in America will not go unnoticed by Mr. Trump.
"In that sense," Mr. Ogawa said, "we hope Komatsu will be recognized."

Will the White House's Big Bet on Intel Backfire?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At an annual gathering of tech executives and billionaires in Sun Valley, Idaho, this past July, Gina Raimondo commandeered a table near a duck pond and tried to exert her influence as the U.S. secretary of commerce to help rescue an ailing national champion.
As media moguls and business luminaries cut deals nearby, Ms. Raimondo met with chief executives from Microsoft, Google and other firms and encouraged them to order their semiconductors from the United States, including from Intel. It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the American chip giant, was critical to that effort.
Ms. Raimondo, who is overseeing the Biden administration's investments in the chip industry, has made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel's U.S. manufacturing plants, according to eight people familiar with those requests, most of whom asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations.
A majority of the firms have rejected her overtures because Intel's chip-making techniques are not as sophisticated as those of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's leading chip maker and their primary supplier, these people said.
The doubts expressed by top tech executives show how far Intel has fallen at a moment when Ms. Raimondo is trying to rebuild American chip manufacturing. Her unofficial role as a chip salesperson underscores how much is riding on the success of Intel, a 56-year-old firm that is at the center of President Biden's efforts to rev up domestic semiconductor production.
While the Biden administration's endeavor involves many companies, a crucial part of its ambition is pegged to Intel, which lobbied -- and helped secure votes -- for the 2022 CHIPS Act.
Intel, which is the only American-owned maker of advanced logic chips, is the single biggest recipient of federal money from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for the tiny electronics that power everything from cars to iPads. Intel is also the sole recipient of a new $ 3 billion government contract to make advanced chips for the U.S. military.
Backed by promises of more than $ 20 billion in government support, Intel's chief executive, Patrick Gelsinger, has committed to invest more than $ 100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. But Intel's business has recently worsened, causing concern on Capitol Hill and stoking the fears of some administration officials who have worried for years about the company's ability to deliver on its promises.
Intel's investments alone account for more than a quarter of the total chip investments that the Biden administration has publicized. Mr. Gelsinger said investments in the United States would proceed, but Intel announced 15,000 layoffs and delayed the opening of a large factory in Ohio, a project that Mr. Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in 2022 and 2023.
The company's experience hints at the perils the government faces in designing industrial policy and picking winners and losers in a fast-moving industry. The question now is whether the administration can help Intel turn around its performance or if it will sink billions of dollars into a company that may continue to struggle.
Intel built its empire making chips for personal computers, but it missed out on the industry's last two major products: smartphones and artificial intelligence chips. Its sales and stock price have plummeted, and potential buyers have been circling the company.
"The nightmare scenario is you have a huge bet that just fails," said Peter E. Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who previously worked on the chips program at the White House. "It's natural folks looking at this would be worried."
The Biden administration has hedged its bets by offering money to 20 other foreign and domestic chipmakers to invest in the United States. Officials say their plan to persuade five of the world's leading chipmakers, including Intel, to build plants in the United States is still on track.
In the two years since the CHIPS Act was passed, the U.S. semiconductor industry has created 115,000 jobs and had more investments in factory construction than it did in the previous 24 years combined, Natalie Quillian, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in a statement. "We're confident in the success of the CHIPS and Science Act," she said.
But those efforts have been slowed by a broader downturn in the chip industry. Samsung and Micron Technology have also posted disappointing results over the past year and delayed factories planned in Texas and New York.
Micron said it was preparing for construction and expecting strong financial results next year. Samsung said its facility would start production in 2026.
In an interview, Ms. Raimondo said her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all U.S. manufacturers.
"Of course, I'd be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful," she said. "But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it's Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips."
"We're going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company," she added.
AMD, Nvidia and Marvell declined to comment. Amazon confirmed those conversations, while Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.
To prevent taxpayer money from being wasted, the administration created certain milestones for the companies it would subsidize. Companies must hit benchmarks -- like building a plant, producing chips or signing up customers -- before they can receive portions of their funds.
Like most companies, Intel has not yet received its first financial infusion under the program. And in recent months, it has been sparring with the government over the milestones it must hit before it gets funding, five people familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Gelsinger, who has spent the past three months restructuring the company and reassuring investors, said in an interview that he was frustrated with the process.
"There's been renegotiations on both sides," Mr. Gelsinger said. "My simple message is, 'Let's get it finished."'
America's Champion
Ms. Raimondo first met Mr. Gelsinger on a Zoom call in early 2021, where they joked about both being new to their positions. The two had just stepped into roles on opposite coasts of the country, where their interests would quickly become entangled.
Ms. Raimondo -- the former governor of Rhode Island and a venture capitalist -- had to immediately contend with a global chip shortage, which was shuttering American car factories and slowing the economy.
The Biden administration was also shaken by the country's dependence on Taiwan, home to TSMC, for advanced chips. Chasing bigger profits, most American chip companies had relocated their manufacturing to Asia, where workers were skilled and cheap. But relying on Taiwan seemed increasingly risky as China sought to bring the island under its control.
In 2021, Ms. Raimondo's deputies calculated that an interruption in Taiwan's chip supply could be as harmful to the U.S. economy as the Great Depression had been, two government officials said.
Mr. Gelsinger took over Intel with a plan to catch up to TSMC's technology and build an expansive new factory business. He wanted the government to help bankroll that effort and joined Ms. Raimondo and other executives in pushing Congress for broader funding. Mr. Gelsinger met with more than 100 lawmakers in 2021 and 2022 to argue that American-owned chip factories were vital to the country's future.
In March 2022, Mr. Gelsinger was Mr. Biden's guest at the State of the Union address. In his speech, Mr. Biden described a $ 20 billion project that Intel had planned for Ohio as a "field of dreams" and said that the company would invest $ 100 billion across the United States.
"That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they're waiting for is for you to pass this bill," Mr. Biden said to a standing ovation.
In late July, Congress voted to approve the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most ambitious attempts ever to reshape industry. It gave the Commerce Department $ 50 billion of funding and a $ 75 billion loan facility, and created a generous tax credit equal to a quarter of a company's investments.
In their Washington office, Intel's lobbyists watched the livestream of the House vote, sharing bottles of beer and congratulations.
Fears of Phantom Plants
As they designed the chips program, Ms. Raimondo and Biden officials weighed how to support Intel while safeguarding taxpayer money. They were already questioning whether Intel could follow through on its promises, several officials said.
David Yoffie, a longtime Intel board member, said he had told officials that Intel had a history of struggling to make chips for others. "Intel was going down a path that I wasn't confident would succeed," Mr. Yoffie said.
Caitlin Legacki, a former Commerce Department official, said there also was a fear that "Intel is going to take chips money, build an empty shell of a factory and then never actually open it, because they don't have customers." This is why the program was designed to withhold payments until companies hit certain milestones, she said.
Intel's plant in Arizona was a cautionary tale. In 2012, Intel hosted President Barack Obama at the site and trumpeted a $ 5 billion investment. It constructed the building, but waited several years to fill the factory with machinery because it didn't have enough customers, said two former Intel employees.
As Ms. Raimondo negotiated with other chipmakers, like TSMC and Samsung, she also became concerned about appearing too cozy with Mr. Gelsinger, and began trying to minimize their public appearances together, two people familiar with the situation said.
When the White House wanted to once again spotlight Intel's Ohio investment in the 2023 State of the Union, Ms. Raimondo expressed concerns, cautious about hitching the administration's reputation to a promise that could be unfulfilled, an official who was involved in the process said.
Ms. Raimondo declined to confirm the account, saying she did not remember it that way.
Too Big to Fail?
In March 2024, the Biden administration announced that it planned to award Intel $ 8.5 billion in grants to build factories, as well as up to $ 11 billion in loans. Intel might also be eligible for nearly $ 25 billion of tax credits.
The same month, Intel filed paperwork in Ohio saying it would delay its plant there by two to three years. It had signed a contract to produce chips for Microsoft but needed more customers to justify its plans.
As 2024 went on, Ms. Raimondo made more forceful requests to companies to consider Intel's services, chip executives said. Those included conversations with Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon.
The administration also selected Intel as the sole partner for a $ 3 billion program to make chips for the military. Some chip executives have criticized the program, called Secure Enclave, as a giveaway, but a White House official said Intel was uniquely qualified for the program.
On Aug. 1, Intel announced the results from a disastrous quarter, as its profits fell and it halted a decades-old shareholder dividend. Its stock plummeted 26 percent, its worst trading day in 50 years.
Its shares partially rebounded in mid-September, as it unveiled the Secure Enclave deal and a contract to make chips for Amazon in Ohio.
In a statement, Intel said that more than 2,000 construction workers were on site in Ohio building one of the world's largest chip factories and that it was "going to finish the job."
Mr. Gelsinger said Intel had been spending on that project, though it hadn't received any government funding.
"Obviously, with elections, you know, nigh in front of us, hey, we want this done," he said.
Ms. Raimondo said that she expected to close more deals before the end of the year, but that she was focused on protecting taxpayers.
"I'm sure all these companies would prefer that we just back up the Brink's truck of taxpayer money into their parking lot and deposit it into their treasury," she said. "But I can't do that."

Full text: If you're not sure how to describe what you want with keywords, use your camera or photo library to get those search results.
A picture is worth a thousand words, but you don't need to type any of them to search the internet these days. Boosted by artificial intelligence, software on your phone can automatically analyze objects live in your camera view or in a photo (or video) to immediately round up a list of search results. And you don't even need the latest phone model or third-party apps; current tools for Android and iOS can do the job with a screen tap or swipe. Here's how.
Circle to Search
Google's Circle to Search feature, released early this year for Android devices, makes firing off a query as easy as dragging your finger around a specific object on the screen -- all without switching apps. The feature is available on dozens of Android phones, including many Samsung Galaxy devices. (Galaxy users also have Samsung's Bixby Vision tool for visual search.)
To use Circle to Search, make sure it is enabled. On Android 15, open the Settings, choose Display & Touch and select Navigation Mode to see the Circle to Search controls. (Steps vary based on the hardware and software involved, but the Settings search box can help you find Circle to Search if you have it.)
Now, when you see something that you want to investigate further, summon Circle to Search by pressing the circular home button at the bottom of the screen (for 3-Button navigation) or by pressing the navigation handle (the horizontal line at the bottom of the screen) for Gesture navigation.
When Circle to Search is activated, the screen dims slightly and a menu of search tools appears. Drag your finger around the onscreen item that interests you, and Google Search results will appear below the image. You can add keywords to narrow the search, and A.I. overviews may be included.
Google has not released an iPhone edition of Circle to Search, but there is a workaround that skips the circling and analyzes a freshly made screenshot of the object in question.
To use it, you need the Google app for iOS and a few minutes with Apple's free Shortcuts app for automating tasks.
Open the Shortcuts app and tap the plus (+) button in the top-right corner. Go to the Search Actions box. Search for and select the "Take Screenshot" action. Next, look for the "Search Image With Lens" action and add it. Tap the Done button.
You can command the Siri assistant to run the shortcut by its "Search Image With Lens" name. But for silent research requests, you can activate it by touch once you have an image in the camera's viewfinder or a photo on the screen.
To assign the shortcut to the Action button, available only on iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or later models, go to Settings, choose the Action Button, then Choose a Shortcut and select Search Image With Lens.
On older iPhones, go to Settings, select Accessibility, then Touch and Back Tap. In the Back Tap menu, select your choice of Double Tap or Triple Tap and choose the Search Image With Lens shortcut. Tap the back of your phone twice or thrice to run the shortcut and get your search results.
Looking Through Google Lens
The Google Lens image-recognition technology has been providing visual search results since 2017 and can identify many plants, animals, landmarks, artworks and other objects, as well as stuff (like clothing) you may want to buy. It can also translate signs and assist with math homework, among other things.
The software is available in the stand-alone Google Lens app for Android -- as well as in the Google app, Google Photos and the Chrome browser (for both Android and iOS).
In the Lens app for Android, tap "Search with your camera" and point the phone at the object you want to search. In other Google apps, tap the square Lens icon onscreen to start searching. The results (often related to marketing efforts) appear below the image.
Using iOS Visual Look Up
Apple's coming A.I.-powered Visual Intelligence feature for its iPhone 16 models with their Camera Control buttons will supply real-time visual search before the end of the year. Until then (and for older iPhones), there's the Visual Look Up tool that arrived in 2021. It works with Apple's Photos app, Safari browser, Quick Look image previews and elsewhere to identify objects.
To use it, open a photo or pause a video. If Visual Look Up is available, the information button at the bottom of the screen shows a leaf, paw print, map pin or other icon you can tap for more information from Apple's Siri assistant on the object in the image. As with all search tools, check the Google and Apple privacy policies if you have concerns.
The accuracy of visual search results can vary, but for those times when you don't have the words or time to describe what you're seeing, the tool might point you in the right direction.

Full text: Booking a table for two at Tao Downtown, I hesitated when I got to the box asking whether I had a special request. I did, but I wasn't sure how it would go down. Would I be the first customer in history to ask for a noisy table?
This is not a normal ask, but I had my reasons. Recently I'd been trying to find out whether the way to hear and be heard in a dining room filled with booming speakers and screaming diners might be as simple as wearing a pair of earbuds. To put it to the test, I needed something I usually try to avoid: a hellishly loud restaurant.
As you may have heard, Apple announced last month that it would soon introduce new software enabling its AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to act as over-the-counter hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss, adjustable to your own ears. (You will be able to take a simple exam from Apple on your device, or upload the findings of one given by an audiologist.)
What you may not know is that the AirPods Pro 2 already come with a setting that can turn up the volume on the voices of people you're talking to and another one that tamps down background noise. Other earbud makers, including Sony, Samsung, Beyerdynamic and Soundcore, also offer functions meant to make conversation easier in noisy places. AirPods outsell them all, though, which is why I wore a pair to Tao and several other Manhattan restaurants known to wreak mayhem on the eardrums.
Over my 12 years as a restaurant critic, few problems I wrote about drew as many emails and comments as noise, and no issue came anywhere close to sparking as much white-hot rage. When I admitted that I like loud restaurants, up to a point, many readers were angry with me. They were even angrier with restaurants.
I get it. Long exposures to loud noise can cause hearing damage. Even at less brutal volumes, not being able to hear the other people at the table is maddening. Not being heard -- having to repeat yourself and raise your voice until you sound as if you're in a screaming match -- is worse. All this is more punishing for people with any amount of hearing loss. Drowning in an angry sea of background noise, most of us finally give in to helplessness. We seethe, silently.
Before taking my Apple-white AirPods out to dinner, I tested them in a makeshift home laboratory. I sat in a chair with bookshelf speakers on either side of my head loudly blaring "Metal Machine Music," Lou Reed's room-clearing experiment in crunching guitar dissonance. Several feet in front of my face I set a third speaker, tuned to "The Brian Lehrer Show" on WNYC, on which a botanist was being interviewed about fall foliage.
In the first round, with my naked ears, Lou totally annihilated Brian. For the next round, I stuffed the AirPods into my ears set to what Apple calls Transparency Mode. The point of Transparency Mode is to allow the ambient noise in, and boy, did it ever. 2-0, Lou.
Then came the real experiment. Still in Transparency Mode, I burrowed down into the Accessibility settings until I had toggled the Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction switches to their lime-green On positions. Conversation Boost uses directional microphones to isolate and amplify voices that are directly in front of the listener. Ambient Noise Reduction dampens sound coming from other angles.
Now the botanist came through loud and clear. Lou's guitars purred raggedly but semi-quietly, like an asthmatic house cat.
In the wild, my earbuds' performance was less dramatic.
Inside two restaurants on the stretch of the Lower East Side that some people call Dimes Square, I ran into a problem I hadn't expected: The dining rooms weren't very loud. This is not the usual complaint about Dimes Square, but it was a warm night, and more people were eating outside than in.
Both restaurants had also thrown open their windows. This meant that sound waves, instead of bouncing off the glass to bombard the ears of everybody indoors, went sailing out of the room like paper planes.
Even though the din wasn't as murderous as I'd hoped, it did lead to a discovery I hadn't expected. I went with a friend who also owns an AirPods Pro 2 set. Each time he plugged them into his ears and turned down the background noise, he dropped his voice to a murmur, as if he were in a genuinely quiet room. Nice for him, but I could barely hear a word he said -- even with the help of my own AirPods.
Tao Downtown has no windows or outdoor seating. As our host took a right at a reclining Buddha the length of a moving van and led us down the 40-foot staircase to the sunken dining room, I saw full tables everywhere. The music was thumping along. It wasn't hellishly noisy, but it would do.
My AirPods didn't make the thumping disappear. They helped a lot, though. It was as if I'd dialed the volume down to three from seven or eight. My dinner guest across the table came through clearly. I could hear him without my AirPods, too, but I had to work at it -- leaning forward, watching his lips and making other small efforts that can add up to make a night in a noisy space exhausting.
That I could hear him at all was no doubt the result of painstaking planning by Tao's designers. Building a restaurant where you can talk to your dinner companions is a tricky proposition. Background noise can come from street traffic, subway tracks, air-conditioning, exhaust hoods and subwoofers. The No. 1 enemy of conversation, though, is simply other people.
"Your biggest source you have to control is the human voice," said Albert Maniscalco, a partner at Cerami & Associates who has helped massage the acoustics of Union Square Cafe and Eataly.
The voices you want to hear are in the same frequency range as the ones you don't, Mr. Maniscalco explained, so there's constant competition for your ears. This crowding is especially critical in the higher frequencies produced by consonants, those quick bursts of sound that make the difference between, say, "Spain" and "stain." Your friend's voice may carry across the table, but crucial bits of information that make her intelligible will be missing, especially as higher frequencies build up around you.
And build they will. People who want to be heard over background chatter will, invariably and often subconsciously, start to vocalize more and more forcefully. This tendency is so well documented that it has a name, the Lombard effect, and it is not unique to humans. It has been studied in cats, canaries, marmosets, bats, frogs and beluga whales.
Braxton Boren, an associate professor of audio technology at American University, has described the Lombard effect in crowded rooms as a version of what social scientists call the tragedy of the commons, the tendency of people to overuse a shared, finite resource until they spoil it.
In Mr. Boren's analogy, the resource is peace and quiet. Diners in a crowded restaurant probably know that they have a shared interest in keeping the volume down to a conversation-friendly level. But they also want to be heard, even when it means talking too loudly. Self-interest wins out over the common good.
"Every person who gets a little louder is a betrayal of our common pact to stay quiet," Mr. Boren said.
The two standard ways to prevent the tragedy are regulation and privatization. We might all agree to speak more quietly in restaurants -- a form of social regulation. "But the mechanics of the Lombard effect make it very unlikely that a group of people will do this for any length of time," he said.
The other answer is to privatize parts of the commons. In a restaurant, Mr. Boren said, this could mean installing booths with partitions that block some of the noise coming from the big, shouty table in the center of the room. But he is also intrigued by hearing aids and earbuds with directional microphones. In effect, they allow the wearer to stake out a personal quiet zone inside a loud space.
A couple on a date with tiny speakers plugged into their ears may strike us as unromantic, but it shouldn't if it helps them talk to each other. Diners have different hearing abilities and different ideas of a good time. My signal may be your noise, and vice versa. The restaurant that can please all sets of ears does not exist.
So why aren't more people tweaking the volume of crowded rooms to their own preference? In the case of AirPods, one answer may be that Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction are so well buried in the settings that each time I wanted to switch them on, it was like crawling through a heating duct in the ceiling.
Both functions are nested inside the Accessibility settings, where people who don't believe they have hearing loss aren't likely to look. They should become easier to find when the hearing-aid and hearing-test functions are rolled out in the coming weeks.
Based on my experiments, I would not suggest buying a pair of AirPods Pro 2 just for these features. But if you already own them or one of the other earbuds that have similar settings, I would recommend taking them out for dinner. Even a modest improvement could make the difference between real communication and silent rage. And it's cheaper than a trip to Stain.

NEW YORK — Booking a table for two at Tao Downtown, I hesitated when I got to the box asking whether I had a special request. I did, but I wasn’t sure how it would go down. Would I be the first customer in history to ask for a noisy table?

Charged Up Over Electric Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said that the company had fixed battery-manufacturing problems and that its electric vehicles would soon be profitable.
Electric vehicles have had a hard year. Sales have been disappointing. Former President Donald J. Trump has regularly disparaged them. And even many environmentally conscious car buyers have been choosing hybrids instead.
Yet the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, says the company is still committed to doing away with combustion engine cars in the United States by 2035 -- and she may have good reason for her optimism.
G.M. says it will start making money on battery-powered models by the end of the year -- becoming the only U.S. automaker aside from Tesla to achieve that feat. Sales of G.M.'s electric vehicles are starting to take off. And the company just introduced a model that sells for less than $ 30,000 after a federal tax credit.
G.M. and other manufacturers have delayed investment in electric vehicle projects. But in an interview, Ms. Barra rebuffed the notion that the transition from internal combustion has run out of juice. She said G.M. was determined to uphold its 2021 pledge to phase out sales of gasoline cars by 2035 in the United States.
"That is the plan we're still executing," she said.
Her expression of resolve comes at a critical moment. Without G.M., the largest U.S. carmaker, it is unlikely that the country can move away from internal combustion engines and the greenhouse gases they emit.
Tesla has largely driven the growth of electric vehicles. But lately the company's sales have slowed and its chief executive, Elon Musk, has sought to focus the company on long-shot plans to build autonomous taxis and humanoid robots while saying little about new consumer models.
Ms. Barra went to Spring Hill, Tenn., south of Nashville, this month to show that G.M. was serious about electric vehicles and to reassure investors that they could make money on them.
G.M. has retooled a plant in Spring Hill to produce electric Cadillacs and has built an enormous battery factory nearby. It has invested more than $ 4 billion as part of a plan to build electric vehicles in numbers that will drive down sticker prices while increasing profit margins.
The latest G.M. electric cars and trucks can travel more than 300 miles on a charge and one, the Chevrolet Equinox, lists at $ 35,000 before a $ 7,500 federal tax break.
In 2022, two years into the pandemic, new electric vehicles were quickly snapped up. That is no longer true but U.S. sales of such cars and trucks still grew about 11 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Electric vehicles now account for 9 percent of the new car market, according to Kelley Blue Book, and some analysts expect them to hit 10 percent by the end of the year, up from 8 percent in 2023, as the Equinox and other affordable models reach showrooms.
G.M. did especially well during the third quarter, registering a 60 percent increase in electric vehicle sales largely because of new models like the Equinox and an electric Chevrolet Blazer. One in five Cadillacs sold in the United States from July through September was electric.
Tesla still sells five times as many electric vehicles as G.M. does. But given the early stage of this new technology, analysts said, Ms. Barra's main competition is Ford, Hyundai and other established automakers that are competing for the same customers as G.M.
"They don't have to beat Tesla," said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who follows the auto industry. "They just have to beat everybody else."
Ms. Barra's personal commitment to electric vehicles was on display late last year when problems manufacturing a key battery component stalled production.
Earlier in her career, all of it spent at G.M., Ms. Barra oversaw all the company's production machinery. She drew on that expertise, spending "many days," she said, alongside engineers in a Detroit factory who were trying to fix an assembly line critical to battery manufacturing. Ms. Barra said she wanted to "understand the situation -- ask questions and then get them the support they needed."
Once that problem, which involved packaging battery cells into modules, was solved, G.M. swiftly increased production at battery factories in Spring Hill and in Warren, Ohio. Both those factories, and a third under construction in Lansing, Mich., are part of a joint venture with LG Energy Solution of South Korea. G.M. is planning a fourth battery factory, in New Carlisle, Ind., with Samsung, another Korean manufacturer.
G.M. has recruited several senior executives from Silicon Valley for technology expertise. In June the company hired David Richardson from Apple to lead software development, an area where most carmakers have struggled. Kurt Kelty, a former high-ranking executive at Tesla and Panasonic, a big battery supplier to Tesla, joined G.M. in February as vice president in charge of batteries.
G.M. has also locked in a steady domestic supply of lithium, a metal critical to batteries, by investing in a Nevada lithium mine called Thacker Pass.
Big car companies like G.M. have struggled to move as quickly as Tesla and some industry observers remain skeptical.
The United States, where G.M. is strongest, accounts for only 11 percent of global sales of electric vehicles. China, where G.M. has struggled, accounts for 69 percent. Even if G.M. makes gains in E.V.s in the United States, "they are going to be leading sales in a market that is still moving slowly," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, a used car website.
But as the market for electric vehicles expands, G.M.'s ability to churn out millions of cars -- everything from Cadillac Escalades that can sell for more than $ 150,000 to the Chevrolet Trax, which retails for around $ 25,000 -- may give it an advantage.
G.M. offers nine electric vehicles from its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC and delivery van divisions, including the Cadillac Lyriq, made in Spring Hill. That's roughly twice as many models as Tesla, which gets most of its sales from two products. G.M. has plans to introduce several more models in the coming months.
Strong sales of gasoline and diesel vehicles have helped G.M. ride out fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, Mr. Kelty noted. "Maybe I shouldn't say that," he said, "but it's bringing in a lot of profits that enable us to do some really creative things and really invest in the future."
The Spring Hill battery plant, with automated assembly lines overseen by workers dressed in gray full-body suits to protect the sensitive machines from contamination, has allowed G.M. and LG to become one of the biggest makers of batteries in the United States. That puts the company in a position to reap cost savings that come with mass production.
The cells are two feet long and encased in silvery pouches. Twenty-four cells are packed into a module, which in turn are tethered together in battery packs. The number of modules varies based on the size of the vehicle and their driving range. Using the same battery modules for many different vehicles cuts costs.
By building batteries in the United States, G.M. can take advantage of federal subsidies that will be worth $ 800 million to the company this year. The incentives were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, part of the Biden administration's effort to create a battery industry that is not dependent on China.
Those subsidies are at risk. Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal or undermine President Biden's auto and energy policies. That will present a conundrum for the Republicans who dominate politics in Tennessee, Georgia and other Southern states that have benefited the most from the I.R.A.
G.M.'s investment in Spring Hill, which once produced Saturn cars, has turned the small city, set amid rolling green farmland, into a boom town. The 2020 census put the population at 50,000, but Jim Hagaman, the mayor, said the town may now have as many as 65,000 residents.
Mr. Hagaman, who is not affiliated with a political party, said he was confident that G.M.'s investment in Spring Hill was not dependent on politics. "They'll still build cars," he said.
Ms. Barra agreed. "Long before we knew what the I.R.A. was or that it was going to actually pass, we had set this strategy," she said.
Representative Andy Ogles, a Republican and a Trump supporter whose district includes Spring Hill, did not reply to a request for comment.
Political pressure is also coming from car dealers, who tend to support Republicans.
Mickey Anderson, president of Baxter Auto Group, a chain of dealerships in Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, said dealers like him generally agreed with Ms. Barra that electric vehicles "are the future." But, he added, Mr. Biden's clean air standards "are completely out of alignment with today's consumer demand."
Mr. Anderson leads a group of 5,000 dealers, including many who sell Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, that has pushed policymakers to ease penalties on carmakers that do not ramp up production of electric vehicles and hybrids over time.
Ms. Barra argues that electric vehicles will be popular regardless of who is in office. The electric Equinox will be cheaper to own than its gasoline-powered equivalent, taking into account savings on fuel and maintenance. And as the U.S. charging network grows, owners will be less afraid about running out of power on a lonely road.
Even the least expensive Equinox has the lively acceleration typical of electric vehicles. And next year, G.M. will revive the Chevrolet Bolt, which will be even more affordable than the Equinox.
"The consumer," Ms. Barra said, "will choose an E.V. because there's a robust charging infrastructure, because it's affordable" and, she added, because "they love it."

SPRING HILL, Tenn. — Electric vehicles have had a hard year. Sales have been disappointing. Former President Donald Trump has regularly disparaged them. And even many environmentally conscious car buyers have been choosing hybrids instead.
Yet the CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, says the company is still committed to doing away with combustion engine cars in the United States by 2035 — and she may have good reason for her optimism.
GM says it will start making money on battery-powered models by the end of the year — becoming the only U.S. automaker aside from Tesla to achieve that feat. Sales of GM’s electric vehicles are starting to take off. And the company just introduced a model that sells for less than $30,000 after a federal tax credit.
GM and other manufacturers have delayed investment in electric vehicle projects. But in an interview, Barra rebuffed the notion that the transition from internal combustion has run out of juice. She said GM was determined to uphold its 2021 pledge to phase out sales of gasoline cars by 2035 in the United States.
“That is the plan we’re still executing,” she said.
Her expression of resolve comes at a critical moment. Without GM, the largest U.S. carmaker, it is unlikely that the country can move away from internal combustion engines and the greenhouse gases they emit.
Tesla has largely driven the growth of electric vehicles. But lately, the company’s sales have slowed, and its CEO, Elon Musk, has sought to focus the company on long-shot plans to build autonomous taxis and humanoid robots while saying little about new consumer models.
Barra went to Spring Hill, Tennessee, south of Nashville, this month to show that GM was serious about electric vehicles and to reassure investors that they could make money on them.
GM has retooled a plant in Spring Hill to produce electric Cadillacs and has built an enormous battery factory nearby. It has invested more than $4 billion as part of a plan to build electric vehicles in numbers that will drive down sticker prices while increasing profit margins.
The latest GM electric cars and trucks can travel more than 300 miles on a charge, and one — the Chevrolet Equinox — lists at $35,000 before a $7,500 federal tax break.
In 2022, two years into the pandemic, new electric vehicles were quickly snapped up. That is no longer true, but U.S. sales of such cars and trucks still grew about 11% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Electric vehicles now account for 9% of the new car market, according to Kelley Blue Book, and some analysts expect them to hit 10% by the end of the year, up from 8% in 2023, as the Equinox and other affordable models reach showrooms.
GM did especially well during the third quarter, registering a 60% increase in electric vehicle sales largely because of new models like the Equinox and an electric Chevrolet Blazer. One in five Cadillacs sold in the United States from July through September was electric.
Tesla still sells five times as many electric vehicles as GM does. But given the early stage of this new technology, analysts said, Barra’s main competition is Ford, Hyundai and other established automakers that are competing for the same customers as GM.
“They don’t have to beat Tesla,” said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who follows the auto industry. “They just have to beat everybody else.”
Barra’s personal commitment to electric vehicles was on display late last year when problems manufacturing a key battery component stalled production.
Earlier in her career, all of it spent at GM, Barra oversaw all the company’s production machinery. She drew on that expertise, spending “many days,” she said, alongside engineers in a Detroit factory who were trying to fix an assembly line critical to battery manufacturing. Barra said she wanted to “understand the situation — ask questions and then get them the support they needed.”
Once that problem, which involved packaging battery cells into modules, was solved, GM swiftly increased production at battery factories in Spring Hill and in Warren, Ohio. Both those factories, and a third under construction in Lansing, Michigan, are part of a joint venture with LG Energy Solution of South Korea. GM is planning a fourth battery factory, in New Carlisle, Indiana, with Samsung, another Korean manufacturer.
GM has recruited several senior executives from Silicon Valley for technology expertise. In June, the company hired David Richardson from Apple to lead software development, an area where most carmakers have struggled. Kurt Kelty, a former high-ranking executive at Tesla and Panasonic, a big battery supplier to Tesla, joined GM in February as vice president in charge of batteries.
GM has also locked in a steady domestic supply of lithium, a metal critical to batteries, by investing in a Nevada lithium mine called Thacker Pass.
Big car companies like GM have struggled to move as quickly as Tesla, and some industry observers remain skeptical.
The United States, where GM is strongest, accounts for only 11% of global sales of electric vehicles. China, where GM has struggled, accounts for 69%. Even if GM makes gains in EVs in the United States, “they are going to be leading sales in a market that is still moving slowly,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, a used car website.
But as the market for electric vehicles expands, GM’s ability to churn out millions of cars — everything from Cadillac Escalades that can sell for more than $150,000 to the Chevrolet Trax, which retails for around $25,000 — may give it an advantage.
GM offers nine electric vehicles from its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC and delivery van divisions, including the Cadillac Lyriq, made in Spring Hill. That’s roughly twice as many models as Tesla, which gets most of its sales from two products. GM has plans to introduce several more models in the coming months.
Strong sales of gasoline and diesel vehicles have helped GM ride out fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, Kelty noted. “Maybe I shouldn’t say that,” he said, “but it’s bringing in a lot of profits that enable us to do some really creative things and really invest in the future.”
The Spring Hill battery plant, with automated assembly lines overseen by workers dressed in gray full-body suits to protect the sensitive machines from contamination, has allowed GM and LG to become one of the biggest makers of batteries in the United States. That puts the company in a position to reap cost savings that come with mass production.
The cells are 2 feet long and encased in silvery pouches. Twenty-four cells are packed into a module, which in turn are tethered together in battery packs. The number of modules varies based on the size of the vehicle and their driving range. Using the same battery modules for many different vehicles cuts costs.
By building batteries in the United States, GM can take advantage of federal subsidies that will be worth $800 million to the company this year. The incentives were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, part of the Biden administration’s effort to create a battery industry that is not dependent on China.
Those subsidies are at risk. Trump has vowed to repeal or undermine President Joe Biden’s auto and energy policies. That will present a conundrum for the Republicans who dominate politics in Tennessee, Georgia and other Southern states that have benefited the most from the IRA.
GM’s investment in Spring Hill, which once produced Saturn cars, has turned the small city, set amid rolling green farmland, into a boom town. The 2020 census put the population at 50,000, but Jim Hagaman, the mayor, said the town may now have as many as 65,000 residents.
Hagaman, who is not affiliated with a political party, said he was confident that GM’s investment in Spring Hill was not dependent on politics. “They’ll still build cars,” he said.
Barra agreed. “Long before we knew what the IRA was or that it was going to actually pass, we had set this strategy,” she said.
Rep. Andy Ogles, a Republican and a Trump supporter whose district includes Spring Hill, did not reply to a request for comment.
Political pressure is also coming from car dealers, who tend to support Republicans.
Mickey Anderson, president of Baxter Auto Group, a chain of dealerships in Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, said dealers like him generally agreed with Barra that electric vehicles “are the future.” But, he added, Biden’s clean air standards “are completely out of alignment with today’s consumer demand.”
Anderson leads a group of 5,000 dealers, including many who sell Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, that has pushed policymakers to ease penalties on carmakers that do not ramp up production of electric vehicles and hybrids over time.
Barra argues that electric vehicles will be popular regardless of who is in office. The electric Equinox will be cheaper to own than its gasoline-powered equivalent, taking into account savings on fuel and maintenance. And as the U.S. charging network grows, owners will be less afraid about running out of power on a lonely road.
Even the least expensive Equinox has the lively acceleration typical of electric vehicles. And next year, GM will revive the Chevrolet Bolt, which will be even more affordable than the Equinox.
“The consumer,” Barra said, “will choose an EV because there’s a robust charging infrastructure, because it’s affordable” and, she added, because “they love it.”

U.S. Considers Breaking Google Into Smaller Parts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They include making Google's data available to rivals and forcing it to break off parts of the company, the Justice Department said in a court filing.
The Justice Department said Tuesday night that it was considering asking a federal court to force Google to break off parts of the company or change its practices in order to eliminate its monopoly in search, moves that could redefine the $ 2 trillion company's core business.
In a filing, the government said it could ask the court to require Google to make the underlying data that powers its search engine available to competitors.
It said it was considering asking for "structural" changes to Google to stop the company from leveraging the power of its Chrome browser, Android operating system or Play app store to benefit its search business. But it stopped short of identifying what those changes could be.
"Google's anticompetitive conduct resulted in interlocking and pernicious harms that present unprecedented complexities in a highly evolving set of markets," the government said in its filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. "These markets are indispensable to the lives of all Americans, whether as individuals or as business owners, and the importance of effectively unfettering these markets and restoring competition cannot be overstated."
Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a blog post in response to the filing that the company was concerned the Justice Department was "already signaling requests that go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case."
In a landmark ruling in August, a judge on that court, Amit P. Mehta, said Google "is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly." It crossed a line when it paid companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine in web browsers and on smartphones, Judge Mehta ruled in the case, U.S. et al. v. Google.
The Justice Department's request is the first formal step in a monthslong process that could reshape a company that is synonymous with the act of looking for answers online. Any limits on Google's search business could help redefine online competition with rivals including Microsoft and OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot.
Beyond asking Google to release some of the data distinguishing its secret sauce for search results, the most extreme option would require Google to spin off parts of its search business completely. That would add it to a small list of companies, including AT&T and Standard Oil, that split apart after a bruising battle with the U.S. government.
Judge Mehta's decision on how to address the concerns about Google's monopolistic behavior, expected next year, will provide a signal of the strength of government efforts to rein in tech giants that influence how we shop, consume information and communicate online.
Federal antitrust officials have sued Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram. They have also sued Google a second time over its ad tech business, which a federal judge is expected to rule on as soon as this year. And already, federal trustbusters are turning their sights to another group of companies specializing in artificial intelligence, opening investigations of Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia.
(The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
In November, the Justice Department will provide its final request for how to fix Google's monopoly through what are known as remedies. In December, Google will have the opportunity to propose its own potential fix to Judge Mehta. The company is also planning to appeal his ruling that it illegally maintained a search monopoly.
The case has been winding through court for years. The Justice Department under the Trump administration, along with several states, sued Google over its search business in 2020 over claims that the internet giant muscled competitors out of the search market, including by paying other companies to make its technology the default option for their users.
The government argued during a 10-week trial last year that those placements sent more search queries to Google than to its competitors. Google was able to use that data to widen the gap between its product and rivals like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the government said.
Google contended that it faced plenty of competition in search, including from social media apps like TikTok and Instagram, shopping sites like Amazon and artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT.
Judge Mehta sided with the government, saying Google had fomented a cycle of dominance that it was impossible for even well-capitalized competitors to break.
In Tuesday's filing, the Justice Department laid out many ways it could ask the court to break that cycle. In addition to floating the idea of forcing Google to share its data, the government said it could ask the court to stop the company from entering into deals to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers.
The government signaled that it had been closely watching developments in artificial intelligence, which companies like Google have rushed to integrate into their search products.
"Google's ability to leverage its monopoly power to feed artificial intelligence features is an emerging barrier to competition and risks further entrenching Google's dominance," the government said.
It said it could ask the court to give websites the opportunity to opt out of having their content used to train Google's A.I. models. The government also signaled that it could ask the court to stop Google from "using contracts or other practices to undermine rivals' access to web content."
The government will have to avoid asking for too much and alienating Judge Mehta, said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt's law school who studies antitrust.
"So do you ask for something really big, like a breakup, knowing that that's tilting at windmills and very unlikely to be granted by the judge?" she asked.
Some outside of the Justice Department want it to take that path. Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who served in the Biden White House, has argued for the government to ask the judge to make Google spin off its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating system.
He said in an interview that the government should urge Judge Mehta to consider aggressive antitrust remedies from decades past. That includes the breakup of Standard Oil, the company that generated the Rockefeller family fortune, and a 1956 agreement between the government and AT&T that forced the company to license many of its technological innovations for free, which supporters of antitrust efforts say helped to create the modern semiconductor industry.
"I think they need to convince the judge to look at the broader sweep of antitrust history," Mr. Wu said.

Judge Orders Google to Open Android to Other App Stores: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The internet giant was ordered by a federal judge to make a series of changes to address its anticompetitive conduct.
In December, a federal jury in San Francisco found that Google had violated antitrust law by imposing high fees and stringent rules on Epic Games and other app developers in Google's app store.
On Monday, Judge James Donato of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered Google to make a series of changes to address its anticompetitive conduct. For three years starting Nov. 1, the company must allow developers to bring their own app stores to the Android mobile operating system. It must also allow app makers to charge users with their own billing systems, outside the Android ecosystem.
Google will be entitled to charge developers "a reasonable fee for these services," which must be based on Google's actual costs.
Judge Donato acknowledged that Google would be unhappy with his decision.
"Google's modus operandi in this case has been to deluge the court in an ocean of comments, many of which were cursory and undeveloped," he wrote in his ruling. He compared the volume of Google's arguments to a "blunderbuss."
The order was a victory for Epic, which makes the popular video game Fortnite and has waged legal battles against Google and Apple since 2020 in an effort to weaken their power over the app economy.
Epic had petitioned the court to crack open Google's Android system so it could offer its own app store while sidestepping the company's rules and fees. Judge Donato's ruling fulfilled most of those requests, but will still force Epic and other developers to pay Google for Android's security and content moderation services.
Google reiterated on Monday its vow to appeal the jury's verdict.
"The Epic verdict missed the obvious: Apple and Android clearly compete," Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post. "We will appeal and ask the courts to pause implementing the remedies to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers as the legal process moves forward."
Tim Sweeney, Epic's chief executive, celebrated the ruling in a thread on the social media site X.
"Big news!" he wrote. "The Epic Games Store and other app stores are coming to the Google Play Store in 2025 in the USA -- without Google's scare screens and Google's 30% app tax -- thanks to victory in Epic v Google."
He vowed to continue his company's legal battle against Google in other countries.
Epic instigated the fight with Google in 2020 by allowing customers to make in-app purchases directly with Epic, bypassing Google and violating its rules. Google quickly banned Fortnite, and Epic responded suing.
The game developer was the last plaintiff standing in a legal fight that once included the dating app company Match Group and attorneys general from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Before the trial began, Google settled with Match by agreeing to return $ 40 million to the company. It also agreed to pay $ 700 million to settle the states' claims.
Epic mostly lost its case against Apple, but a federal judge allowed the developer to give users the option of paying for its games outside Apple's App Store.
One of Epic's main goals with the litigation was to reduce the fees it paid Google. On the Play Store, Google charges app makers a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and up to 30 percent for purchases made within popular apps that are downloaded from its store. Google says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases.
With Judge Donato's order, Google will not be able to impose restrictions on how developers can compete on the Android platform in exchange for "a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service."
Google can no longer use those incentives to stop app makers from telling users they can buy subscriptions outside Google's billing system, for example. It can also no longer force phone makers to pre-install the Google Play Store in any specific location on a device's screen or prevent them from loading other app stores with those conditions.
App makers will also be able to share links with users offering ways to download apps outside a Google app store. Epic had asked the judge to make it easier for Android device users to download apps from the open internet.
Google faces two other major antitrust lawsuits in the United States that challenge various parts of its business, including a landmark case with the Justice Department that questioned the dominance of its search engine and that the company lost in August. The government is scheduled to lay out a list of possible remedies on Tuesday.
A second trial with the Justice Department, about Google's market power in advertising technology, will be decided in the coming months. Just last week, Epic lobbed another lawsuit at Google and its Android partner Samsung, claiming the two companies worked together to make it harder for Epic to compete on the platform.
Judge Donato weighed in on whether U.S. antitrust law could keep up with the fast-moving tech sector.
"The question has been asked whether our tech-based economy has outgrown the federal antitrust laws, which date back to 1890 when the Sherman Act was signed into law," he wrote. "In the court's view, it has not."

The Spy Who Risked His Life to Meet a Reclusive Dictator: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Park Chae-so was so successful in infiltrating the North that Kim Jong-il, the enigmatic ruler, once gifted him blueberry wine. So why was the celebrated undercover agent later jailed by South Korea?
When the South Korean spy met with Kim Jong-il, he declined the late North Korean leader's offer of a toast, citing a promise to his mother that he would never drink.
But the undercover agent, masquerading as a businessman, vowed to break his abstinence when the two Koreas reunified, until recently an overriding policy goal of the leaders of both countries.
Park Chae-so, the spy, amused Mr. Kim when the North Korean dictator gave him a bottle of blueberry wine as a parting gift. He asked for another.
"Mr. Chairman, don't we Koreans say one is one too few?" he said.
Mr. Park's 1997 meeting with Mr. Kim, the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-un, lasted only 35 minutes. But it was a coup for South Korea's intelligence community: He was its only known undercover agent to penetrate the security cloaking the world's most secretive regime and finagle an audience with its enigmatic leader.
Until then, Mr. Kim was so reclusive that even his own people had heard his voice only once, in 1992, when he shouted one sentence into the microphone while inspecting a military parade: "Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People's Army."
But Mr. Park was impressed with Mr. Kim's speaking style.
"There was a flow -- and not a single repetition," Mr. Park, 70, said of his conversation with the supreme leader.
Mr. Park's identity and his meeting with Mr. Kim, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to 2011, were exposed in a political scandal in 1998, turning him into a celebrated -- but former -- spy in the South.
These days, the ex-spy is a cautious but vivid storyteller, and this account is based on his version of events, which have inspired a book about his life and a movie, "The Spy Gone North." While parts of his story have been corroborated by officials and associates, neither North Korea nor his former spy agency has officially commented on his work.
Mr. Park visited North Korea more than a dozen times, convincing North Korean officials that he could get them badly needed cash, including by helping them sell porcelain and other ancient North Korean artifacts abroad.
He said that whenever he was there, he folded his clothes -- and left a couple strands of hair in his bag -- in such a way that he would know whether his belongings were searched while he was away from his hotel. When the searching stopped, he knew he had gained the trust of his minders.
A senior North Korean official once put a gun to his head when he refused to cooperate with a plan to have him sleep with a North Korean woman and have a baby in the North, he said during an interview in Cheongju, where he lives, one of a few conversations he had in Cheongju and in Seoul with The New York Times. Mr. Park was told that Mr. Kim had already named the prospective baby: Tongil, or "Unification."
"Whenever I visited the North, I knew my life was on the line," Mr. Park said. "When the plane took off from Pyongyang and was up in the air, I could breathe again, relieved that I had survived another trip."
A son of a farming family in Cheongju, south of Seoul, Mr. Park was an army major in 1990 when he was recruited by the Defense Intelligence Command. He began creating a new reputation as part of a carefully choreographed plan to eventually have him infiltrate North Korea. He borrowed money, squandering it in real estate deals gone wrong, and often got into trouble with superiors. He added a few criminal records to his file.
Three years later, in 1993, he was tapped by the country's top intelligence service, the Agency for National Security Planning, just as North Korea's clandestine nuclear program had turned into an international crisis.
By this time, he was known among his friends and former military colleagues -- and hopefully among the North Korean spies in the South who would check up on his background -- as a disgruntled former military intelligence officer, heavily indebted and dabbling in various private business enterprises.
For agents spying on North Korea, the famine there in the 1990s created rare opportunities. The North's elites traveled to China to trade and earn badly needed cash. There, they met South Korean businessmen, some of them undercover agents who piggybacked on business deals to meet North Korean officials and establish an intelligence-gathering foothold.
Mr. Park had his first breakthrough when he learned that one of North Korea's biggest players in such deals was a nephew of Jang Song-thaek, Mr. Kim's brother-in-law and at the time one of the country's most powerful figures.
To get the nephew in trouble with his Chinese creditors, Mr. Park arranged for a shipment of walnuts and pine nuts to be confiscated at a South Korean port. He then gave the nephew $ 160,000 to pay off his debt, and the grateful Jang family began pulling strings for Mr. Park and doors started to open.
One of his new contacts, Ri Chol, a North Korean Workers' Party trade official, later introduced him in turn to a senior official from the Ministry of State Security, the North's secret police, in Beijing. After learning that the security official had a son and daughter about to get married, Mr. Park delighted him with a pair of expensive watches as a wedding gift.
Such episodes convinced him that money talked among the elites of the impoverished North.
"My mission was to penetrate as deep inside the Pyongyang leadership as possible to learn what they were thinking," Mr. Park said. "If I had any success, it was because I figured out their taste for money."
As his contacts expanded up the hierarchy, the scrutiny increased. No matter how good his cover story, Mr. Park's North Korean contacts would have known that anyone doing business with them was at least being watched by South Korean intelligence.
North Korean officials once showed him photos of his mother working at a garden and his two daughters going to school in South Korea. The message: Don't betray us or else.
By the time Mr. Park met Mr. Kim, he had already crafted a lucrative business deal for North Korea that involved bringing a film crew to the North to shoot South Korean TV commercials. Mr. Park said Mr. Kim personally had blessed this proposal.
Surprisingly, the leader also asked Mr. Park to "read his face," having heard from his aides that Mr. Park practiced the Asian art of fortunetelling based on facial features.
But Mr. Kim also had a more serious plan for Mr. Park.
North Korea wanted him to help with its scheme to block Kim Dae-jung, the longtime opposition leader in the South, from winning its 1997 presidential election. Pyongyang instead wanted the South led by a less-experienced conservative leader.
At home, Mr. Park's spy agency also did not want Kim Dae-jung, a former dissident whom it once attempted to assassinate, to win the election either. His agency and North Korea, sworn enemies of each other, both plotted separate smear campaigns designed to depict Kim Dae-jung as an untrustworthy communist.
Mr. Park personally opposed such interference. He tipped off aides to Kim Dae-jung so they could prepare against such plots, while urging North Koreans to embrace an opposition victory.
After the opposition leader won the presidency, Mr. Park's bosses at the spy agency went to prison for illegally meddling in the election. Before they did, they leaked classified intelligence reports that mentioned an undercover agent code-named "Black Venus" who had met Mr. Kim in Pyongyang. There was enough detail for journalists to figure out who Black Venus was.
Mr. Park was preparing for a trip to North Korea in 1998 when South Korean media identified him as Black Venus. His agency discharged him with a $ 224,000 bonus.
"I had no regrets," Mr. Park said. "I could not let an enemy country interfere with an election in my country."
He then made a second fateful decision.
He reconnected with Mr. Ri, the North Korean trade official, and worked as a freelancing agent for inter-Korean projects -- a genuine businessman this time. In 2005, he and Mr. Ri arranged the filming of a Samsung cellphone commercial in Shanghai, the first of its kind, that featured two female celebrity entertainers from both Koreas.
After the political mood changed in South Korea with the conservatives taking back power in 2008, his old agency caught up with him. In 2010, agency officials arrested Mr. Park on charges of illegally contacting North Koreans and sharing sensitive military data with them. Mr. Park argued that none of it was secret, but he was sentenced to six years in solitary confinement.
Since he was freed in 2016, he has not had a formal job.
Although Mr. Park has no plans to reconnect with his North Korean contacts, he often wonders if they might reach out to him as he had helped them hide money abroad when he was a spy.
"They need my help to access the money," he said.

Full text: Every year, new smartphones come out with appealing but nominal upgrades. If you want to get off the upgrade hamster wheel, here are ways to make your phone last as long as possible. RODERICK SCOTT
Prioritize your phone's battery health. Avoid extreme temperatures to help preserve your phone's battery. Apple, Google and Samsung recommend keeping your device between 62 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit as an ideal range; anything below 32 degrees or above 95 can damage your battery. Short-term exposure to colder temperatures doesn't do as much damage as exposure to hotter temperatures.
Experts recommend that you not charge your phone to 100 percent regularly, which can cause the battery to degrade. Many Android phones and iPhones offer an optimized-charging feature to prevent this from happening, which you can find in the battery section within settings.
Protect your phone. Newer phones are more resistant to scratches and drops, but it's still a good idea to add protection against other types of accidents. A screen protector and case can help prevent shattered screens, cracks and other damage.
Update the software. When a new software or security update is available, download it sooner rather than later. Keeping your phone's software up-to-date can add many of the same features that are available on newer models. Outside of providing new features, it's imperative to install updates when they're available for overall security.
Keep it clean. On top of wiping your phone's screen, keep an eye on its charging port and speaker grilles. Long-term buildup of lint and dust can cause charging issues or worse. To clean your phone, you'll need only a microfiber cloth, some dish soap and a Clorox or 70 percent alcohol wipe.
Manage your phone's storage. To keep your phone in optimal shape for more than two years, get creative about preventing the device's storage from reaching its capacity. Offload as much music, photos and videos as possible, especially if they're stored in your text messages.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, is talking to the United Arab Emirates, Asian chipmakers and U.S. officials to expand the computing power needed to build artificial intelligence.
Late last year, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, started pitching an audacious plan that he hoped would create the computing power his company needed to build more powerful artificial intelligence.
In meetings with investors in the United Arab Emirates, computer chip makers in Asia and officials in Washington, he proposed that they unite on a multitrillion-dollar effort to erect new computer chip factories and data centers across the globe, including in the Middle East. Though some participants and regulators balked at parts of the plan, the talks have continued and expanded into Europe and Canada.
OpenAI's blueprint for the world's technology future, which was described to The New York Times by nine people close to the company's discussions, would create countless data centers providing a global reservoir of computing power dedicated to building the next generation of A.I.
As far-fetched as it may have seemed, Mr. Altman's campaign showed how in just a few years he has become one of the world's most influential tech executives, able in a span of weeks to gain an audience with Middle Eastern money, Asian manufacturing giants and top U.S. regulators.
It was also a demonstration of the tech industry's determination to accelerate the development of a technology it claims could be as transformative as the Industrial Revolution.
When word leaked that Mr. Altman, 39, was looking for trillions of dollars, he was mocked for seeking investments equivalent to roughly a quarter of the annual economic output of the United States. Officials in Washington also expressed concerns that a U.S. company was trying to build vital technology in the Middle East. To build A.I. infrastructure in a number of countries, American companies would need approval from United States officials who oversee export controls.
Mr. Altman has since scaled his ambition down to hundreds of billions of dollars, the nine people said, and hatched a new strategy: Court U.S. government officials by first helping to build data centers in the United States.
It is still unclear how all this would work. OpenAI has tried to assemble a loose federation of companies, including data center builders like Microsoft as well as investors and chipmakers. But the particulars of who would pay the money, who would get it and what they would even build are hazy.
At the same time, OpenAI has been in separate talks to raise $ 6.5 billion to support its own business, a deal that would value the start-up at $ 150 billion. The Emirates' technology investment firm, MGX, is among the group of potential investors, which also includes Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple and Tiger Global, three people familiar with the conversations said.
OpenAI is seeking cash because its costs far outpace its revenue, the three people said. It annually collects more than $ 3 billion in sales while spending about $ 7 billion.
Some of OpenAI's plans have been previously reported by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Conversations with the nine people close to the talks, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, provide a fuller picture of the efforts and how the strategy has evolved.
(The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
In private conversations, Mr. Altman has compared the world's data centers to electricity, according to three people close to the discussions. As the availability of electricity became more widespread, people found better ways of using it. Mr. Altman hoped to do the same with data centers and eventually make A.I. technologies flow like electricity.
Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT learn their skills by analyzing troves of digital data. But there is a shortage of the chips and data centers that drive this process. If that supply grows, OpenAI believes it can build more powerful A.I. systems.
In dozens of meetings, OpenAI executives have prodded tech companies and investors to expand global computing power, the nine people close to the company's discussions said.
"Sam is thinking about how OpenAI remains relevant," said Daniel Newman, chief executive of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. "It needs more compute, more connectivity, more power."
Mr. Altman's original plan called for the Emirates to fund the construction of multiple chip-making plants, which can cost as much as $ 43 billion each. The plan would reduce chip manufacturing costs for companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest chip producer.
TSMC makes semiconductors for Nvidia, the leading developer of A.I. chips. The plan would allow Nvidia to churn out more chips. OpenAI and other companies would use those chips in more A.I. data centers.
Mr. Altman and his colleagues discussed building the data centers in the Emirates, a nation with excess electrical power. In the United States, it has been hard for companies to build new data centers because there is not enough electrical power to run them.
OpenAI discussed funding the infrastructure plan with MGX, an A.I.-focused investment vehicle created by the Emirates. It also met with TSMC, Nvidia and another chip company, Samsung.
Omar Sultan Al Olama, the Emirates' minister of state for A.I., told The Times in a March interview that there "is a business case" for going after such a giant deal.
Nvidia declined to comment. MGX and Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.
OpenAI said in a statement that it was focused on building infrastructure in the United States "with the goals of ensuring the U.S. remains the global leader in innovation, driving re-industrialization across the country and ensuring A.I.'s benefits are widely accessible."
Will Moss, a spokesman for TSMC, said the company was open to discussions about expanding semiconductor development but was concentrating on its current global expansion projects and had "no new investment plans to disclose at this time."
When Mr. Altman visited TSMC's headquarters in Taiwan shortly after he started his fund-raising effort, he told its executives that it would take $ 7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision, two people briefed on the conversation said. It was his first visit to one of the multibillion-dollar plants.
TSMC's executives found the idea so absurd that they took to calling Mr. Altman a "podcasting bro," one of these people said. Adding just a few more chip-making plants, much less 36, was incredibly risky because of the money involved.
"We are not, nor have we ever been considering multitrillion-dollar projects. While the total investment needed for the global infrastructure of A.I. to be fully built out by everyone could cost trillions over several decades, what OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions," said Liz Bourgeois, an OpenAI spokeswoman.
Around the same time, Mr. Altman visited South Korea and held talks with two chipmakers in the country: Samsung and SK Hynix. But he soon ran into national security concerns over a prominent role for the United Arab Emirates in developing a technology that many consider critical to the economy and warfare.
Some White House officials and congressional leaders are afraid that approving the infrastructure to be built in the Emirates could give China a back door to important technologies. National security researchers have found evidence that some Emirati universities have worked with Chinese universities with ties to Beijing's military, said Sihao Huang, a technology fellow at the RAND Corporation.
Talks with the Department of Commerce, the Emirates and chipmakers are continuing. OpenAI has also expanded its discussions into other parts of the world, according to four people familiar with those talks.
In the spring, company executives held meetings with Japanese officials in Tokyo. They laid out a plan for building data centers powered by electricity from nuclear power plants that were decommissioned after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.
During one meeting, a Japanese official laughed when OpenAI said it was seeking 5 gigawatts of electrical power, about a thousand times the power that an average data center consumes, a person familiar with the meeting said.
Later, in meetings with officials in Germany, OpenAI explored building a data center in the North Sea so it could tap into 7 gigawatts of power from offshore wind turbines, the person said.
But political pressures have forced OpenAI to explore options in the United States. During a White House meeting with other tech leaders this month, Mr. Altman presented an OpenAI study called "Infrastructure Is Destiny."
The study called for new data centers in the United States, two people familiar with the meeting said. Built at a cost of $ 100 billion each -- about 20 times the cost of today's most powerful data centers -- they would hold two million A.I. chips and consume 5 gigawatts of electricity.
As he spoke, Mr. Altman sat in front of a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who poured money into massive infrastructure projects like New York's Lincoln Tunnel, two people familiar with the discussion said. The OpenAI chief told White House officials -- including Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser -- that A.I. data centers would be a catalyst for the re-industrialization of America, creating as many as half a million jobs.
Mr. Altman also warned that the United States risked falling behind China and that if the United States did not work with the Emirates, China would instead.
This week, President Biden and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Emirati president, met at the White House and directed their senior officials to develop a memorandum detailing future collaboration on A.I.
To bolster its efforts, OpenAI has hired Chris Lehane, a Clinton White House lawyer, as its vice president of global policy, along with two people from the Commerce Department who worked on the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law designed to increase domestic chip manufacturing. One of them will manage future infrastructure projects and policy.
Speaking last week at an investor event for T-Mobile, which is a customer of OpenAI, Mr. Altman struck a modest tone about the company's ambitions.
"We build on a gigantic amount of work that has come before us," he said. "If you think about all that had to happen throughout human history to discover semiconductors and build chips and networks and these massive data centers, we're just doing our one little bit on the very top of that."

The study called for new data centers in the United States, two people familiar with the meeting said. Built at a cost of $100 billion each — about 20 times the cost of today’s most powerful data centers — they would hold 2 million AI chips and consume 5 gigawatts of electricity.
As he spoke, Altman sat in front of a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who poured money into massive infrastructure projects like New York’s Lincoln Tunnel, two people familiar with the discussion said. The OpenAI chief told White House officials — including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser — that AI data centers would be a catalyst for the re-industrialization of America, creating as many as 500,000 jobs.
Altman also warned that the United States risked falling behind China and that if the United States did not work with the UAE, China would instead.
This week, President Joe Biden and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the UAE president, met at the White House and directed their senior officials to develop a memorandum detailing future collaboration on AI.
To bolster its efforts, OpenAI has hired Chris Lehane, a Clinton White House lawyer, as its vice president of global policy, along with two people from the Commerce Department who worked on the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law designed to increase domestic chip manufacturing. One of them will manage future infrastructure projects and policy.
Speaking last week at an investor event for T-Mobile, which is a customer of OpenAI, Altman struck a modest tone about the company’s ambitions.
“We build on a gigantic amount of work that has come before us,” he said. “If you think about all that had to happen throughout human history to discover semiconductors and build chips and networks and these massive data centers, we’re just doing our one little bit on the very top of that.”

Full text: Shortcuts, small external keyboards and even improved (and free) dictation software can make long sessions of text input much simpler.
With summer officially over, it's back to business (or school) for many people, which can mean more time writing longer things, especially on the go. The smartphone has replaced the laptop for many tasks, but when it comes to text input, tapping away on tiny onscreen keys might make you wish you had hauled along the computer just for its keyboard. Thankfully, your phone includes several features to make text entry much easier. Here are a few suggestions.
Visit Your Settings
Thanks to predictive text prompts, automatic punctuation and other shortcuts (like pressing vowel keys to see the pop-up menu of accent marks), typing on small glass rectangles isn't as awkward as it used to be. To find out what features are available for your phone, start with its Settings app.
On an iPhone, tap General and then Keyboard.
For many Android phones, tap System, Keyboard, On-screen Keyboard and then Gboard (often the default app). Galaxy models typically offer the Samsung Keyboard with similar options.
You should see choices for spell-check, text correction -- yes, Apple's infamous Auto-Correction has gotten better -- and other aids. For example, both the Apple iOS keyboard and the Google Gboard (which has an iOS version, too) can display a compact keyboard for easier single-handed input.
On the Gboard keyboard, press and hold the comma key for a shortcut into the settings -- or tap the four-squares icon on the far left and select the One-Handed button; the same menu lets you resize or "float" the keyboard around the screen if you prefer.
Password-manager tools prevent mistyped logins, and fewer taps may help to prevent errors elsewhere. With tools like Slide to Type from Apple and Glide Typing by Google, you can drag your finger around the keyboard and the software guesses the word you want; note that the results may vary.
The keyboard can move the text-insertion cursor, too. On an iPhone, press and hold the space bar until the keyboard dims, and then drag your finger to reposition the cursor on the screen. For the Google Gboard, you can move the cursor by sliding a finger along the space bar if the "gesture cursor control" is enabled in the Glide Typing settings.
Apple and Google include keyboard layouts for typing in languages other than English or inserting emojis. You can add third-party keyboards apps, but beware of software from unfamiliar companies that could pose security risks.
Add Hardware
If you have a lot of text to enter, pairing your iPhone or Android phone with an external Bluetooth keyboard (including the Magic Keyboard made by Apple) lets you switch to traditional typing hardware. You can even use navigational buttons and shortcuts with an iPhone by going to Settings, Accessibility and Keyboards and enabling the Full Keyboard Access feature.
If you don't want to haul a full keyboard around, consider a folding model, as it can fit easily in a jacket pocket but expand into something resembling a full-size set of keys.
Traveling keyboards, which typically fold up into two or three sections when not in use, range in price from about $ 25 to $ 80 depending on the size and features.
Speak Your Mind
Speech-to-text technology that converts the spoken word into editable type on the screen has been around for decades and has only become more accurate as the software has improved. Many apps (including virtual assistants) can take dictation. The Apple Notes app in iOS 18 can now directly record a live audio file and transcribe it.
To use the feature on an iPhone, open Settings, select General and then Keyboard, and turn on Enable Dictation. The Auto-Punctuation option automatically inserts commands, periods and question marks as you talk, but Apple's site has a full list of dictation commands for editing text and inserting emoji characters.
On Android phones using the Gboard keyboard, open the Settings app, go to System, select Keyboard and make sure Google Voice Typing is enabled. When you tap the microphone icon, you can start speaking or select the Info icon (an encircled "i") to see the list of voice commands that Gboard understands, including in the Google Docs word processor. As with most dictation apps, you must call out punctation by name, like "question mark" or "new paragraph," and other formatting.
Dictation can be helpful for quickly transcribing a lot of words, but it may not be the best method for, say, a crowded coffee shop or composing a confidential memo within earshot of co-workers. Some dictation requests are uploaded to the internet for processing and require a network connection.
But no matter how you input your text, be sure to proofread it (or have A.I. do it) before you send it along, as typographical errors do have a way of sneaking in no matter how you get your words on the screen.

BIERSDORFER/THE NEW YORK TIMES); Typing in a smartphone's landscape mode enlarges the keyboard for two-thumb typing,; Keyboard settings for Apple, left, and Google, right, hold the controls for typing shortcuts, dictation functions and many other tools to make entering text easier.; With your permission, the Google Gboard keyboard will translate your spoken words into text, and it can even insert the emoji characters you name. You must call out punctation by name, like "question mark." This article appeared in print on page B4.

Intel Is Said To Be in Sights Of Qualcomm: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While Intel has struggled in recent years, other chipmakers are thriving because of a boom in demand.
The chipmaker Qualcomm has approached its rival Intel in recent days about the possibility of acquiring the slumping Silicon Valley giant, two people familiar with the matter said Friday, requesting anonymity because the talks were confidential.
Qualcomm has not yet made an official offer for Intel, one of the people said, and the obstacles to a deal remain steep. Any deal would likely draw significant regulatory scrutiny, given the mammoth size and national security importance of both chip companies. It is unclear whether regulators would allow Qualcomm to buy Intel without taking on its struggling foundry business, and it remains equally unclear whether Qualcomm would want to take on that complex endeavor.
A deal would also be costly. Intel, which has seen its shares fall nearly 40 percent over the last year, has a market capitalization of $ 93 billion. Qualcomm, which has seen its shares rise 55 percent, has a market value of $ 169 billion.
Qualcomm and Intel, through spokeswomen, both declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Qualcomm's approach.
That any chip-making rival would consider trying to buy Intel would have been inconceivable a decade ago. But years of management issues and whiffs on technology transitions have weakened what was once one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies.
Intel missed out on selling chips for mobile phones and has failed to capitalize on the boom in artificial intelligence, a field rival Nvidia now dominates with specialized chips used in data centers. Intel's chip manufacturing operations, once the most advanced, also lost a technology lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Intel's problems were underscored in early August, when it announced a $ 1.6 billion quarterly loss and plans to cut 15,000 jobs. The company, the largest planned recipient of federal financing under legislation called the CHIPS Act, on Monday announced other moves that include plans to pause the setting up of new plants in Germany and Poland.
Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is a leader in cellular technology and provides chips used in flagship smartphones from companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics.
Unlike Intel, Qualcomm has never operated factories, a costly business that most chip designers avoid. So it would seem more likely to be interested in the Intel operations that design chips, as well as its broad expertise in PC software and channels for selling those systems, said Patrick Little, a former Qualcomm executive who now is chief executive of SiFive, a Silicon Valley start-up that sells rival microprocessor designs.
"Those are things Qualcomm would have to mature on their own over time," Mr. Little said. "If they worked with or somehow had a piece of Intel that could accelerate that part of their strategy."
Any effort to buy Intel would likely face a tough antitrust review and would be scrutinized closely on national security grounds, since its design and manufacturing operations are important for defense applications and overall U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors.
Lauren Hirsch reported from New York and Don Clark from San Francisco.

Improved Foldable Smartphones Are Worth a Try: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Let's be real. The rectangular design of the quintessential smartphone is getting stale for lots of people, including this graying gadget reviewer. That's why the next phone I buy won't be another "same, same" iteration of the iPhone. It will be a foldable, a phone with a bendable display that flips open like a book to increase its screen size and closes up to fit in my pocket.
These folding phones, from companies like Samsung, Motorola and Huawei, have been getting buzz since their debut in 2019 thanks to their novel design. But they remained niche because of issues with software and durability. And at upward of $ 1,500, they were too expensive.
A shift is underway. The devices keep getting better, and some are becoming cheaper. IDC, the research firm, predicts that handset makers will ship 25 million foldable phones this year, up nearly 40 percent from last year.
After testing two different sizes of foldables that arrived in stores this summer -- Motorola's small $ 700 Razr and Google's jumbo $ 1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold -- I'm convinced that phones with bendable screens will become mainstream in the next few years.
Most of the issues have disappeared. The Razr resembles a compact mirror and unfolds to become a traditional smartphone. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks like a normal smartphone when closed up, but unfolded, it transforms into a tablet.
Both devices demonstrate that bendable screens are no gimmick. They can become even more useful than a traditional smartphone. Above all, they are more than adequate devices for those wanting to try something different.
Here's what you need to know about the new devices.
Motorola Razr
Over the last decade, smartphones kept getting bigger as more consumers gravitated toward larger screens. (Apple, for instance, discontinued its smaller iPhone Mini last year.) But there are still plenty of people who might prefer a smaller phone, including those with dainty hands and shallow pants pockets.
When the Razr is closed, you control a 3.6-inch screen on the cover of the phone. It's roomy enough to use a set of basic apps for placing a phone call, sending a text, taking a selfie or reading notifications. This is a big improvement from older compact foldables. In past phones, like the $ 1,380 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip from 2020, the outer screen was much tinier and showed only notifications and a clock.
I found the small screen on the Razr to be delightful. I enjoyed using it to show people photos of my dogs and my newborn. It was best for when I wanted fewer distractions from social media apps, like TikTok and Instagram, but still wanted to keep up with messages.
When unfolded, the Razr reveals a larger 6.9-inch inner screen that functions like a smartphone. This screen is slightly longer than my iPhone, so it shows more text when I'm scrolling through an article. There's also a split-screen mode to run two apps side by side -- to write an email while browsing a website, for instance -- but it felt too cramped for typing.
There's a crease in the middle of the screen where it folds, which is most noticeable when light is reflecting against it. But it didn't bother me while looking at photos and videos.
The phone's camera took crisp, clear photos with vibrant colors in daylight. At night, photos taken in low light looked grainy and dim -- not ideal if you're the clubbing type.
The Razr's strong battery lasted about 36 hours before it needed a charge.
Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold
Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the successor to last year's Pixel Fold, which I called one of the most impressive pieces of technology of the year. The Pixel foldable caters to the opposite end of the spectrum from the Razr: It's a product for people who can't get enough screen.
When the Pixel is folded, its outer screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally. That's roughly the same as a standard iPhone screen, so it works like any smartphone.
But when you unfold it, things get more exciting. The inner screen, measuring 8 inches diagonally, is roughly equivalent to a smaller tablet like the iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. This size is comfortable to hold for long durations while reading a book in bed or watching a movie on a plane. Again, there's a crease that is noticeable only when light reflects against it, so this wasn't an issue.
Over all, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an incremental improvement from last year's Pixel Fold. The new model is slightly thinner and lighter. The camera produced clear photos with accurate colors in both daylight and low light. The battery lasted a full day before needing a charge, which is decent.
The area that Google wasn't able to improve on was price, which remains $ 1,800 and still feels too high. To put that in perspective, a $ 350 iPad and an $ 800 iPhone combined are cheaper. Google said the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was its most premium phone offering, in part because of the engineering involved in making the device thinner. The high price tag makes this foldable a product for tech enthusiasts, but it's a glimpse of what's to come to the masses when large, bendable screens get closer to $ 1,000.
Bottom Line
Between the two types of foldables, I'd recommend the Razr because it's more practical in terms of size and cost. It's cheaper than flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung. And as a geriatric millennial who refuses to give up skinny jeans, I especially liked how the compact phone felt in my pocket.
So why, you might ask, haven't I converted to a foldable already? The simple reason is that I have a personal preference for the iPhone's software system, and I'm holding out for a foldable one.
There's hope yet that this will happen. Apple has been developing a foldable iPad, according to an Apple employee who claims to have seen a prototype of the tablet. That could pave the way for an iPhone with a bendable screen. Apple declined to comment.
I, for one, love my iPad for reading articles and watching video, but when I'm on the go, the tablet is usually left at home. I dream of the day that our big, bright screens can fold up so we can carry them everywhere. That future feels inevitable.

Let’s be real. The rectangular design of the quintessential smartphone is getting stale for lots of people, including this graying gadget reviewer.

Full text: Efforts by the Beijing-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, to break through innovation barriers have landed it in a geopolitical tech battle.
In a sprawling factory in eastern Shanghai, where marshy plains have long since been converted into industrial parks, China's most advanced chipmaker has been hard at work testing the limits of U.S. authority.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, is manufacturing chips with features less than one-15,000th of the thickness of a sheet of paper. The chips pack together enough computing power to create advancements like artificial intelligence and 5G networks.
It's a feat that has been achieved by just a few companies globally -- and one that has landed SMIC in the middle of a crucial geopolitical rivalry. U.S. officials say such advanced chip technology is central not just to commercial businesses but also to military superiority. They have been fighting to keep it out of Chinese hands, by barring China from buying both the world's most cutting-edge chips and the machinery to make them.
Whether China can advance and outrace the United States technologically now hinges on SMIC, a partly state-backed company that is the sole maker of advanced chips in the country and has become its de facto national semiconductor champion. SMIC pumps out millions of chips a month for other companies that design them, such as Huawei, the Chinese technology firm under U.S. sanctions, as well as American firms like Qualcomm.
So far, SMIC hasn't been able to produce chips as advanced as those of rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Taiwan, or others in South Korea and the United States. But it is racing forward with a new A.I. chip for Huawei called the Ascend 910C, which is expected to be released this year.
Huawei's chip is not as fast or sophisticated as the coveted processors from Nvidia, the U.S. chip giant, which the White House has banned for sale in China. SMIC can also most likely make only a small fraction of what Chinese firms want to buy, experts said.
But the chip would still be a boon for China's A.I. ambitions. Nvidia's components are the secret sauce in A.I. computing clusters that can train chatbots, unlock new medicines and help design hypersonic missiles. If Huawei, with SMIC's help, can make more A.I. chips in the coming years, that could blunt the impact of American technology restrictions -- and perhaps one day cut into Nvidia's lead.
SMIC did not respond to requests for comment. Huawei and the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees technology controls, declined to comment.
In an interview in June, Gina M. Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that the United States led the world in A.I., and that tech restrictions were helping to maintain that lead. "We have protected, to a large extent, our most sophisticated technology from getting to China," she said.
Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said China opposed "politicizing and weaponizing trade, scientific and technological issues." He added, "Sanctions and repression will not deter the development of China and Chinese enterprises."
Beijing has invested more than $ 150 billion in the chip industry, including a $ 47 billion investment fund announced in May, helping to fuel a stunning factory expansion. SMIC alone operates more than a dozen chip manufacturing facilities, called fabs, around China, and is planning or constructing at least 10 more, according to Paul Triolo, a tech expert at Albright Stonebridge who tracks the industry.
SMIC, which has nearly 19,000 employees, spent $ 4.5 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of this year, more than it earned in revenue, according to its financial filings. Among contract chipmakers, it lags only TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in South Korea in sales. It shipped nearly four million wafers in the first half of the year, each of which can be split into hundreds or thousands of chips.
U.S. export controls have "forced China and Chinese companies to get better across the board," Mr. Triolo said. While these companies face major hurdles, "they have already made significant progress to get where they are now, and you can't really underestimate their ability to doggedly pursue overcoming the other obstacles."
A national chip champion
SMIC was founded in eastern Shanghai in 2000 by Richard Chang, a Taiwanese American who worked for decades at the U.S. chipmaker Texas Instruments and became known as the father of Chinese semiconductors. SMIC was immediately viewed as China's answer to TSMC, which is the world's biggest maker of cutting-edge chips.
To court overseas engineers, SMIC created a housing development with an international school and opened churches near its factories. The company hired from TSMC's research and development team, including Liang Mong-song, SMIC's current co-chief executive.
SMIC built new fabs at a breakneck pace, becoming the world's third-biggest chip foundry -- the term for a business that makes chips on behalf of other companies -- within four years of its founding. It offered cheap prices to firms like Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments. In 2004, it listed on stock exchanges in New York and Hong Kong.
SMIC's ties with the Chinese government have grown closer over time. Its biggest shareholders -- China Information and Communication Technology Group, Datang Holdings and China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund -- are all state-owned. By 2015, around half of SMIC's board seats were controlled by people with close ties to the state.
Government support did not guarantee success. After a spate of overbuilding, SMIC was forced to sell off several facilities. In 2019, it delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, listing in Shanghai the next year.
By then, China's chip industry had attracted U.S. attention as a national security issue. In 2019, the Trump administration persuaded the Netherlands to block a sale by the Dutch firm ASML to SMIC of its most advanced chipmaking machine over concerns that it would aid China militarily.
In 2020, the White House slapped trade restrictions on SMIC after the publication of a report detailing its links to a major Chinese defense conglomerate and military-affiliated universities. SMIC denied connections to the military. The Biden administration later tightened the restrictions.
But the rules have allowed for workarounds. Companies have continued selling less advanced equipment to SMIC's new factories by obtaining special licenses and routing sales through non-U.S. subsidiaries and employees.
Given these loopholes, some said it was no mystery that SMIC had progressed.
"The fence has gotten higher, but we've decided to leave open the front, side and back gate," said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation.
Today, North American customers account for about a sixth of SMIC's revenue. The company's boxy silver factory in eastern Shanghai where it makes advanced chips for Huawei sits in a compound connected to other factories that sell chips that go into products sold around the United States, and buy machinery from American companies.
According to Chinese customs data, China's imports of chipmaking equipment in the first seven months of this year surged 53 percent from the same period in 2023.
Officials seeking tougher limits on SMIC have faced pushback from those who say that could damage the United States economically, since SMIC also works with American companies.
When Congress tried in 2022 to pass a law barring the Pentagon from buying products containing SMIC chips, automakers, weapons companies and others complained, saying the components were woven through their supply chains, people familiar with the discussions said.
The law, which eventually passed, was changed to give defense suppliers five more years to cut their ties with Chinese chipmakers that had military connections.
"U.S. companies would say, accurately, if you tried to put SMIC out of business tomorrow, there would be collateral damage for U.S. companies," said Chris Miller, the author of "Chip War," a history of the industry.
Necessity breeds innovation
In August 2023, as Ms. Raimondo visited China on a diplomatic trip, Huawei released a phone with a SMIC chip that exceeded the technology limits previously set by U.S. restrictions. The timing was viewed as a slap in the face to the United States.
Analysts and U.S. chip executives concluded that SMIC had repurposed less advanced equipment to make a more advanced chip.
Both TSMC and Intel, the U.S. chip giant, tried the same method in the past. But the strategy can result in many faulty chips, and Intel found it wasn't commercially viable, semiconductor experts said.
In response, U.S. officials have been drafting even tighter rules that would target some SMIC factories. They have also pushed Dutch and Japanese officials to stop supplying SMIC's most advanced fabs. This month, the Netherlands issued new rules that brought its export controls in line with U.S. regulations.
The limited access to advanced equipment has undoubtedly held SMIC back, and some experts argue that, as competitors like TSMC and Intel innovate, and as the United States and its allies ramp up their technology controls, China will be left further behind. The constraints already appear to have slowed the rollout of some of Huawei's new products.
Galen Zeng, a senior research manager at IDC, a market intelligence firm, estimated that SMIC would most likely lag other international chip giants by three to five years even if China developed substitutes soon for critical chipmaking equipment.
Still, Dylan Patel, the chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, a research firm, estimated that SMIC could make 1.2 million A.I. chips for Huawei next year, double this year -- far fewer than what China needs or what American chip designers make, but indicating an upward trajectory.
In an electronics market in Shenzhen in April, John Wu, a Huawei vendor, said Huawei's A.I. chips had limited availability. But he expressed confidence that Chinese firms would continue to develop, and that competition would ultimately hurt the United States.
He described the U.S. restrictions using a Chinese expression -- like "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet," he said.

A Tireless Quest For Maximizing Sweet Dreams: [National Desk]

Full text: Online and off, so-called sleepmaxxers are going to extreme lengths in pursuit of better sleep. Is that a problem?
Derek Antosiek considers himself something of a sleep connoisseur. He has applied tape to his mouth, propped his nostrils open with dilators and sealed his ears with plugs. He has tried out a fan that pumped cool air under his sheets, and positioned separate mattresses for himself and his wife side by side so that her movements wouldn't disturb him. He has tested light therapy lamps and air quality monitors and sleep trackers and blue light glasses.
With each new experiment, the goal was the same: getting closer to a perfect night's sleep.
After decades of Americans abiding by the mantra that they can sleep when they're dead, many have woken up to the importance of a good night's rest. Overall sleep time has increased over the past two decades, and even more over the last few years, according to the federal government's annual survey of how Americans use their time.
"The tide is changing," said Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the director of a sleep center at the school. "People -- especially Gen Z -- have reclaimed their right to a full night of sleep, and they have done that without embarrassment."
Even though sleep attitudes have shifted, experts say the basic recommendations have stayed the same: at least seven hours, at around the same time, with as few interruptions as possible. What's different is the number of people for whom sleep has become a fixation. Online, such people -- sometimes referred to as "sleepmaxxers" -- proudly display the extreme lengths they will go to in pursuit of better sleep.
The videos promise solutions to problems that sleepers never knew they had. One enthusiast recommended an adjustable pillow to reduce facial pressure. Another filmed herself waking up with her hair wrapped in a bonnet and wearing a jaw strap, barely able to speak after taping her mouth shut. She then took it all off in what has become known online as a "morning shed." Bragging about early bedtimes has become as much of a social media flex as documenting a lavish vacation.
These days, for the sleep-curious, there are mouth tapes (meant to promote breathing through the nose), nostril expanders (which ostensibly reduce snoring), nose tapes (for opening nasal passages) and jaw straps (which wrap around the head and keep the mouth firmly shut). There are pillow mists; magnesium foot sprays; and the "sleepy girl mocktail," a concoction of cherry juice, prebiotic soda and magnesium powder.
There's also higher-end technology, like the fan that Mr. Antosiek tried, which can retail for close to $ 600, and entire lines of sleep wearables, some costing almost $ 1,000, that track and measure the quality of people's sleep. There's a "sunrise" alarm clock, which its creators claim wakes people up according to their natural circadian rhythms. For the true enthusiasts, there is even a mattress system that adjusts temperature, detects snoring and vibrates when it's time to wake up. It will also run you about $ 4,000.
Leading sleep scientists have become swept up in a booming, multibillion-dollar slumber industry. After Dr. Walker published the best-selling book "Why We Sleep" in 2017, the sleep-tracking company Oura brought him on as a medical adviser.
But as interest in sleep has risen, some doctors and academics have noticed people becoming preoccupied with obtaining a perfect night's rest. In 2017, researchers from Rush Medical College and Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine came up with a word, orthosomnia, to describe people who seek treatment for self-diagnosed sleep issues resulting from their use of sleep trackers and wearables.
In The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, the researchers wrote that they worried about the effects of a "perfectionistic quest for the ideal sleep," likening what they were seeing to orthorexia, an obsessive fixation with healthy eating.
Not all sleepmaxxers develop orthosomnia, of course. But Dr. Milena Pavlova, the medical director of the Sleep Testing Center at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Boston, does worry about people becoming too focused on bedtime.
"Sleep is a passive process," Dr. Pavlova said. "It is to be protected, not forced -- or 'maximized."'
Sleep maximization goes mainstream
Mr. Antosiek, a 31-year-old who lives in Michigan, started to take sleep seriously a few years ago after realizing that he never grew out of bad habits he developed in his early 20s, including drinking too much on weekends and staying up late.
Searching for information online, he stumbled upon a small but dedicated community called Sleep Hackers on the message board site Reddit, made up of people who regularly share tips and express frustrations with their own sleep issues.
Soon, Mr. Antosiek became a moderator for the forum, and his own habits changed. He started trying to get what he considered to be "the right amount of light at the right times" of the day, and using various sleep gadgets and trackers. One of them was an Oura Ring, a sleep tracker that fit on his finger and provided him with a daily sleep score between zero and 100. The score meant a lot to him. On nights he had trouble falling asleep, he'd was hard on himself and feared the next morning's results, knowing they would affect his chances of receiving an "optimal" score of 85 or higher.
For many sleep devotees, their fascination with hacks has remained a harmless hobby. Mayte Myers, 27, who goes to sleep wearing a jaw strap and mouth tape, said the elaborate bedtime ritual gave her something to look forward to. "It honestly feels like a weighted blanket for my face," she said.
Similarly, Maureen Osei, a 24-year-old from North Carolina, puts on mouth tape, nose tape, a bonnet and a jaw strap before bed.
"It's kind of like there's nothing else to do but to fall asleep, because it's so uncomfortable," she said. "I'm not going to scroll with my chin strap on, you know?"
For others, though, focusing on sleep has backfired. Sarah El Kattan, a 26-year-old who lives in Frankfurt, never thought much about sleep. Then, near the end of 2021, she started to focus on optimizing her health after listening to a popular health podcast. She then read Dr. Walker's book, and that focus turned to her sleep. That's when something like a switch went off in her head, she said. Suddenly, the prospect of going to sleep started to make her anxious, and she began to exhibit physical symptoms.
"It started with heart palpitations," Ms. El Kattan said. The more she thought about sleep, the worse things became. At night, she knew every passing minute was another minute of sleep lost, and her obsessive thoughts created a vicious cycle that kept her awake for even longer.
Dr. Walker said he had heard from other people who dealt with sleep issues after reading his book. He suggested that such people should stop focusing on sleep -- "don't listen to my podcast, don't read the book, don't do any of that," Dr. Walker said -- and instead seek help from a professional.
'I became very obsessed'
On the whole, sleep experts say, the new cultural focus on sleep is a welcome change. They did not discount any one hack or gadget outright, so long as people are being safe. "Everything works for someone," said Leah A. Irish, an associate professor of psychology at North Dakota State University who studies sleep.
The very ritual of preparing for bed by, say, spraying magnesium on your feet may be more important than the effects themselves, a signal to the brain that it's time to wind down.
But claims that any one tool works are often debatable. Even sleep researchers with a foot in the industry can admit that. "Probably none of these are going to help you get a better night's sleep," said Vanessa Hill, a behavioral sleep scientist at the Appleton Institute, a health and well-being research institute at CQUniversity in Australia, who has consulted for the app Samsung Health and the mattress company Purple. "It's most important that you're comfortable. So if some of these things help you feel more comfortable, great."
While small studies have found mouth taping to be beneficial for those with mild sleep apnea, its effect on people who don't have breathing issues is less understood, and the most rigorous studies found little evidence of magnesium having an effect on sleep quality.
In some cases, there are risks. Mouth tape can actually reduce the amount of oxygen people breathe in if their noses become obstructed, and jaw straps can cause jaw pain, Dr. Walker said. For those who have severe sleeping issues, it's better to see a doctor first.
And viral hacks and new inventions are no replacement for the tried-and-true rules of sleep, such as getting in and out of bed at the same time every day, reducing alcohol consumption and making time to wind down. Ms. El Kattan finally started sleeping better, for instance, when she stopped consuming caffeine and practiced being kinder to herself.
In Mr. Antosiek's case, the earplugs, mouth tape and nasal dilator have helped him, he said. But the bed fan didn't do much, and the Oura Ring made things worse. "I found myself waking up and immediately looking at my score, like, 'Did I get good sleep?"' he said.
With distance, Mr. Antosiek can admit now that he probably let things get out of hand. "I became very obsessed, maybe to an unhealthy degree at one point," he said.
Shyamal Patel, Oura's senior vice president of science, said the Oura Ring was not "designed with the idea of maximizing engagement," and suggested that people who find themselves fixating on their sleep data take a break from tracking.
Mr. Antosiek went a step further: He decided to stop using the product altogether. He doesn't think he ever developed orthosomnia, he said, but he can understand how people can take sleep maximization too far.
These days, if he wakes up feeling rested and alert, that's good enough for him.

In Antosiek’s case, the earplugs, mouth tape and nasal dilator have helped him, he said. But the bed fan didn’t do much, and the Oura Ring made things worse. “I found myself waking up and immediately looking at my score, like, ‘Did I get good sleep?’” he said.
With distance, Antosiek can admit now that he probably let things get out of hand. “I became very obsessed, maybe to an unhealthy degree at one point,” he said.
Shyamal Patel, Oura’s senior vice president of science, said the Oura Ring was not “designed with the idea of maximizing engagement,” and suggested that people who find themselves fixating on their sleep data take a break from tracking.
Antosiek went a step further: He decided to stop using the product altogether. He doesn’t think he ever developed orthosomnia, he said, but he can understand how people can take sleep maximization too far.
These days, if he wakes up feeling rested and alert, that’s good enough for him.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest announcement from Apple's China rival came just hours after the unveiling of iPhone 16.
Over successive administrations, the U.S. government has used stiff trade restrictions to try to stifle the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. In turn, the company never misses an opportunity to show that it is still standing.
Last year, at the tail end of a visit to China by Gina M. Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, Huawei unveiled a smartphone that was powered by an advanced semiconductor made in China. The chip was exactly the kind of technology that the United States, in an effort led by Ms. Raimondo, had tried to prevent China from developing.
The Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Pro, was heralded in China as the triumph of a national champion over American constraints. It sold out within minutes on Chinese e-commerce platforms. Many shoppers chose to pair their purchase with a phone case emblazoned with a photo of Ms. Raimondo's face.
In the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen on Tuesday, Huawei again made a bid for the spotlight with the announcement of a new device just hours after Apple introduced its iPhone 16 in California. Huawei's latest phone, the Mate XT, is heavy on novelty: It can be folded, twice.
The tablet-size device folds along two vertical seams to become the size of a typical phone. It is the first commercially available trifold smartphone. It comes in two colors, red and black, and will go on sale on Sept. 20.
"It's a piece of work that everyone has thought of but never managed to create," said Richard Yu, Huawei's consumer group chairman. "I have always had a dream to put our tablet in my pocket, and we did it."
The Mate XT, with a screen that measures 10.2 inches diagonally, is equipped with artificial-intelligence-enabled translation, messaging and photo editing features. Mr. Yu also unveiled a thin keyboard that folds in half to the same size as the phone. He showed the audience how he carried both together in the pocket of his suit jacket.
Starting at $ 2,800, the Mate XT is priced like a luxury product.
Since the Mate 60 Pro was launched last year, Huawei has been eating into Apple's yearslong dominance of the market for high-end smartphones in China.
While the trifold phone is making a splash, Huawei has not yet introduced its latest rival to the iPhone, the next-generation Mate 70.
In recent years, Huawei has launched products in September, which is also when Apple typically unveils new iPhones.
Huawei has used the events to also commemorate the 2021 release of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and the daughter of the company's founder who had been detained in Canada after the company had been accused of violating U.S. sanctions. Her case became a geopolitical point of contention, and her return received widespread attention in China.
Analysts said the introduction of the Mate 70 had been slowed by constraints on chip production at the country's leading chipmaker, the state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation of China, or SMIC.
The company was behind the chips that enabled Huawei to take the world by surprise last year. But the technology used to manufacture those chips is costly and prone to defects, making it difficult to produce them in large volumes.
Huawei relies on SMIC's most advanced technology for three of its product lines, including the new trifold phone, said Joanne Chiao, an analyst at TrendForce, a market research firm.
Huawei has not confirmed a release date for the Mate 70. SMIC did not respond to a request for comment.
Huawei was once a top global smartphone brand and maker of 5G telecommunications equipment. Its worldwide market share for smartphones plunged after the Trump administration moved in 2019 to restrict its access to critical technologies, including semiconductors. Additional sanctions by the United States and its allies further eroded the company's profits. But Huawei staged a comeback last year, reporting its fastest growth in four years, driven in part by the sales of Mate 60 Pro.
The new folding phone is Huawei's attempt to show off its leadership despite the uncertainty around the release date of the Mate 70, according to Linda Sui, a senior director at TechInsights, a market research firm.
"Huawei still tried to do something to save face, to make people believe they feel comfortable competing with Apple side by side," Ms. Sui said.
For a decade, China accounted for roughly 20 percent of Apple's total sales. It was the iPhone's most important market after the United States.
But Apple's market share in China fell drastically during the first half of this year. Even offering iPhones at a discount -- a rare step for Apple -- was not enough to reverse the decline.
In the quarter that ended in June, Apple dropped out of the five top-selling brands in China, according to Canalys, a research firm. It was the first quarter in years that the best-selling smartphones in China were all made by domestic companies.
Since the Mate 60 was released, Apple has lost nearly a quarter of its market share for high-end smartphones, Ms. Sui said. That share has been taken up by Huawei.
Apple faces additional challenges: reluctance by Chinese consumers to spend while the economy sputters, and growing government pressure for people to turn away from devices made by U.S. companies.
Many consumers are holding on to their phones longer rather than spending on an incremental upgrade. Apple has bet that new software enabled by artificial intelligence will motivate people to spring for the iPhone 16.
Inside China, the government closely regulates access to A.I. products like some of the new features Apple has outlined. Apple has said it plans to work with OpenAI, the American artificial intelligence leader, on part of this technology. But to make it available in China, Apple is likely to need to find a Chinese partner company.
An obvious choice would be Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Samsung, the South Korean electronics maker, teamed up with Baidu for the versions of its new A.I.-enabled smartphone that were released in China this year.
Apple, which did not reply to a request for comment, has not explained how it will roll out its A.I. software in China.
Lori Chang, a senior analyst at Isaiah Research, a market research company, said the trifold phone was unlikely to give Huawei's sales a big boost. The device is expensive, and because the foldable screen is hard to make, the company is expected to produce just a few hundred thousand units. Huawei launched its first foldable phone with one seam in 2019.
In Shenzhen on Tuesday, Mr. Yu, the Huawei executive, said the phone's high price reflected how challenging it was to produce. "We hope to reduce the cost by improving the process after it is launched on the market," he said.
Still, as of Tuesday, more than four million people had signed up on Huawei's website to be notified when the Mate XT goes on sale.

New iPhone's Latest Feature: Built-In Artificial Intelligence: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company also showcased a new Apple Watch and AirPods that can reduce noise at concerts or near construction sites.
The iPhone has grown predictable. Over the past seven years, it has generally looked the same, with incremental improvements to its cameras, processors and battery life.
But on Monday, Apple tried to turn the page on that predictability by introducing its first artificially intelligent iPhone.
The iPhone 16, which was unveiled in a prerecorded video at the company's futuristic Silicon Valley campus, comes in four different models that are designed to run the company's generative artificial intelligence system, called Apple Intelligence. The company said that the phones will be able to sort messages, offer writing suggestions and use a more capable Siri virtual assistant.
In addition to announcing those changes to the iPhone, the company unveiled the Apple Watch Series 10, which has rounder corners and a larger, brighter display that is nearly 10 percent thinner. It also introduced a new AirPods Pro, capable of automatically reducing noise at concerts or near construction sites, and acting as professional-grade hearing aids.
The new phones arrive at a pivotal time for Apple and the broader tech industry. Apple's business has sputtered in recent years as iPhone users have held on to their phones for longer. It has made a major bet by realigning its engineering teams to work on artificial intelligence in hopes that the technology, which can answer questions, create images and write software code, will persuade people to buy new devices.
The tech industry is hoping that Apple can help make A.I. mainstream. Microsoft, Google and Samsung have all added generative A.I. features to products but have yet to see those capabilities widely adopted. But Apple has shown in the past that it can wait to embrace an emerging technology and popularize it, as it did with digital music players, smartphones and smartwatches.
"The question is: How good is Apple Intelligence?" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, a market research firm. "We've seen incredible demos from Microsoft, Google and OpenAI, but when you start to work with these services, a lot are parlor tricks. Helping normal people do something useful every day would make people go, 'I need a new iPhone."'
The iPhone 16 is debuting with fewer capabilities than the company marketed in June, when it announced its Apple Intelligence system. Starting next month, the phones will summarize notifications, offer writing recommendations and allow people to more quickly find photos by describing an image to Siri. The A.I. also makes it possible to use the camera to identify specific types of flowers, plants or dog breeds.
Other capabilities will arrive over time, the company said, including Siri's ability to field some requests related to personal information on the phone, like pulling details from a text message about a family member's flight and checking airline information for real-time arrival details.
Requests unrelated to personal information will be routed to ChatGPT, which will be available on iPhones after Apple cut a deal with OpenAI in the spring.
The iPhone's limited feature set is emblematic of how Apple is taking a cautious approach to generative A.I. By contrast, last month Google revealed a Pixel phone that includes a conversational virtual assistant, the ability to edit people into photographs and the opportunity to use the company's generative A.I. chatbot, Gemini, to answer complex questions. Google has also had A.I. misfires, including a chatbot's telling users to eat rocks.
Apple released four versions of the iPhone 16, all of which come with a new camera button. The entry-level models, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, start at $ 799 and feature a faster processor, a more powerful camera and an "Action button" that can be programmed to automatically retrieve capabilities like the phone's flashlight. The higher-end models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, start at $ 999 and feature a slightly larger display, a larger battery and the ability to capture studio-quality audio. They will be available in stores on Sept. 20.
To power Apple Intelligence, both phones come with similar processors. The base iPhone 16 model features the A18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip. The upgrade makes for a smaller difference in the capabilities of the lower- and higher-priced phones than in recent years.
Wall Street is enthusiastic about the artificially intelligent phones, with analysts predicting the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12 percent increase from this year.
The generative A.I. era also presents new challenges for Apple. During most of the iPhone's 17 years, the company developed a single software system that it updated throughout the world. But many countries want the computing systems and data supporting A.I. to be located within their border. The artificial intelligence systems are also expected to be sensitive to the cultural and language differences of the people using them.
As a result, Apple may have to create more customized software for the countries that sell iPhones, analyst say.
The company said Apple Intelligence would become available next month in the United States in a preliminary software update. Apple will expand the software's distribution to Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa later this year. It said the capabilities wouldn't be available in Chinese, Japanese or Spanish until next year.
"Regions are becoming more Balkanized," said Patrick Moorhead, the founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech research firm. "It is slowing down the pace of output for Apple, as each region becomes more bespoke."

New iPhones Will Be Put To A.I. Test: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: On Monday, the company will introduce smartphones with A.I. features that could take the technology mainstream or sow fresh doubts about its viability.
Shortly before Steve Jobs's death in 2011, Apple filled a cramped auditorium in Cupertino, Calif., for the unveiling of its fifth iPhone. The device's biggest selling point was a new software feature called Siri, which helped cause a jump in iPhone sales.
On Monday, Apple is planning to run that play again.
For the first time in more than a decade, the tech giant will unveil a suite of iPhones whose signature feature won't be an improved camera or an updated design, but new software capabilities. The system, called Apple Intelligence, will sort messages, offer writing suggestions and create a more capable Siri powered by generative artificial intelligence.
The new iPhones represent a big moment for generative A.I., which can answer questions, create images and write software code. As a latecomer to the A.I. party, Apple is in a position to take the technology mainstream -- or sow fresh doubt about its viability if it doesn't live up to expectations.
Early enthusiasm for A.I. has been tempered by questions about its utility. This spring, Microsoft postponed features in an A.I. computer because of security vulnerabilities around the technology's recording of every second of activity. Humane, a start-up that raised $ 240 million for a device called the Ai Pin, was panned by tech reviewers because its system was slow to fulfill requests and sometimes fielded them inaccurately.
In the wake of those problems, Wall Street is looking to Apple for reassurance that customers want A.I. The tech giant spent two years watching as Microsoft, Meta, Google and Samsung added A.I. to products. Apple has shown over the years that it can enter a market late and redefine it, as it did with digital music players, smartphones and smartwatches.
Apple is hoping that A.I. can rejuvenate the iPhone. It considers the opportunity in A.I. so important that it canceled one of its big bets -- a $ 10 billion project to develop a self-driving car -- and reassigned hundreds of engineers to work on the technology.
People are holding on to their iPhones longer as compelling new features have dwindled. The time between replacing an iPhone has expanded to nearly five years, up from three years in 2018, according to TD Securities, an investment bank. The slowdown in buying new phones has weighed on Apple's business, which relies on the iPhone for more than half of total sales.
In addition to Apple Intelligence, which will be available on the iPhone Pro and Pro Max, analysts say, the new iPhones will feature a new button for taking photos, a slightly larger screen and faster processors.
Wall Street analysts predict the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12 percent increase from this year.
Similarly optimistic forecasts tied to A.I. have backfired for other technology companies. In recent months, shares of Nvidia, Microsoft and Google have been dragged down by weaker-than-expected sales of A.I. products. The declines weighed on the rest of the stock market because artificial intelligence has become a major focus of investors.
For Apple, which introduced its first iPhone 17 years ago, it's unclear whether new features even matter. Nearly three-quarters of users say they buy a new iPhone because their current phone has become obsolete or been lost or damaged, according to a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm. Only a fifth say they buy a new phone to get the latest features.
"Pushing out really cool new features used to drive a huge amount of replacements, but that isn't doing it any more," said Josh Lowitz, a partner at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "It's become like replacing your clothes dryer or your running shoes. You replace them when they're worn out."
Apple has tried to distinguish its A.I. offering by emphasizing its ability to handle personal requests more privately. When it unveiled the technology in June, it said most requests would be fielded on the iPhone itself, where there's a lower risk that personal information could be compromised. Other requests would be routed to a cloud computing network with Apple semiconductors that the company said wouldn't store any information.
If a user asks Siri when her mother's flight is arriving, Apple says, its A.I. system can provide a real-time estimate by pulling the flight information from an email and checking it against current flight tracking data.
The company will complement those A.I. services with answers from ChatGPT. It struck a deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to fulfill impersonal user requests, like what to cook with select ingredients.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Apple hasn't said when its array of A.I. features will be available for the new iPhones. It also hasn't explained how it will launch the technology overseas, particularly in China, its second-most important market. It is expected to address both on Monday.
Because A.I. systems could process personal information, governments have been pushing to have their citizens' data stored inside their borders. China previously mandated that with its citizens' iCloud data, requiring that Apple cede legal ownership over the data to a state-owned company. It is not known if it would do the same with an Apple cloud network for A.I.
"This is a real challenge," said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. "You're going to need to be culturally or regionally customized because every country is going to have to be handled very differently. There's a lot of uncharted territory here."

Full text: If your current smartphone can't make it through the day without needing a recharge, here are a few steps to make it last a little longer.
Back-to-school deals and the fall season can make upgrading to a new phone quite tempting. But what if you need to hold off just a little longer -- even as the battery sealed inside your ancient phone is already conking out before lunch and you're just trying to nurse it along for the time being?
Thankfully, there are some steps to help preserve power, especially if you're not quite ready to buy because you're waiting for this year's new hardware crop, winding down a carrier contract or getting your finances in order. Here's a guide.
Stretch It
Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time and charging cycles, and it's not uncommon for a well-used device to experience shorter spans between charges after two or three years of regular use. Even with an older battery, reducing activities that need a lot of energy can provide more time between charges.
The usual suggestions -- like turning down the screen's brightness, avoiding processor-intensive games, keeping the phone cool or temporarily putting the device into Airplane Mode to cut down on network activity -- can add minutes. Power-saving advice varies based on your hardware and its system software, so check with your manufacturer or wireless carrier for specific instructions for Android devices (including Google's Pixel phones and Samsung's Galaxy models) as well as for Apple's phones and tablets.
Apple and Google both include a feature that reduces power consumption with one tap: the iOS Low Power Mode or Android's Battery Saver. (The name varies on Android devices; for example, some Samsung Galaxy phones may call it "Power saving mode.")
When the feature is enabled, the battery icon turns yellow as the mode reduces screen brightness, pauses some network activity (like online photo backup) and limits app actions like mail-fetching, automatic downloads and other battery burners. Processor speed may also be reduced, and as a result, the phone may run slower.
To find the power-reduction feature in iOS, open the phone's main Settings icon, select Battery and tap the button to enable the mode. The iPhone's Low Power Mode may kick in automatically when the battery gets low, but turning it on manually -- even after you've just charged up -- can help squeeze out more use.
In the Battery menu on many Android phones, you can choose between Standard Battery Saver and Extreme Battery Saver (for even more power-rationing) and put the mode on a schedule.
Watch It
On most phones, the battery settings include other features that help you see your battery's overall health, which could influence your decision about whether to upgrade devices.
The iOS Battery settings screen includes graphs that show battery level and activity, as well as a list of apps hogging the most power. The Battery Health & Charging screen displays the battery's maximum capacity; less than 100 percent means less charge-holding time. Optimized Battery Charging, usually on by default, is designed to help extend the battery's life by reducing the amount of time it is fully charged, which eventually adds to the 300 to 500 charge cycles expected from most batteries.
Android's Battery settings include a usage screen to show what apps are tapping the most power, as well as a diagnostics tool to help troubleshoot battery woes. When enabled, the Adaptive Battery setting analyzes phone use and adjusts how much power apps can grab.
Assist It
If your phone's battery is shot and you can't upgrade yet, investing in an external battery can get you through the day. These come in all shapes and sizes, and after you charge up the external battery, just connect your phone to it for a juice boost.
Portable power packs range in price, but typically cost between $ 50 and $ 75 for models that can recharge a phone at least three times between its own charge-ups. Wirecutter, the product-review site owned by The New York Times, has recommendations that include the Belkin BoostCharge Plus 10K.
Several companies -- like Zagg and ZeroLemon -- also make small portable wireless chargers and phone cases that double as backup batteries. Prices range from about $ 30 to $ 100.
Replace It
If you opt to hang on to your current phone, replacing the battery is an option. Check with your manufacturer about authorized repairs, especially if you have an extended warranty or phone insurance. Apple's website has information about iPhone battery service, as does Google's site for its Pixel phones and Samsung's site for Galaxy devices.
If your phone is out of warranty, places like Best Buy, Staples or uBreakiFix can replace batteries, sometimes while you wait, for less than $ 100.
If you're really on a budget and have a sense of adventure, there's always the do-it-yourself approach. The iFixit tech-repair site has illustrated battery-replacement guides for many phone models, and other repair videos are online. Back up your phone first, proceed at your own risk and be careful -- or you may just have to upgrade anyway.

Google Faces A Yelp Suit On Antitrust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Yelp complained for more than a decade that Google tilted the search market in its favor. After its rival's landmark legal loss, it finally decided to sue.
When a federal judge declared Google an illegal monopoly in a landmark ruling this month, it was not immediately clear what consequences the world's largest search engine provider would face.
But one result is coming into focus: Google's antitrust defeat opened the door to more lawsuits.
On Wednesday, Yelp, the popular online service that lets people find and review local businesses, sued Google in federal court in San Francisco. Yelp claims that Google used its dominance as a general, or all-purpose, search engine to gain an unfair advantage in local search services. Yelp is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an order for Google to stop its anticompetitive practices in a jury trial.
A longtime critic of Google, Yelp has frequently complained about how the search giant treats other companies in its results. But it is the first time the San Francisco company has sued Google, despite years of protests to regulators around the world.
"This is a watershed moment," Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview. "This is the time to have the conversation, this is the time to correct past wrongs."
Yelp is leaning on a ruling from Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that said Google had abused its power over online search. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to automatically steer users to Google's search engine on their smartphones and web browsers.
Google said in a statement that "Yelp's claims are not new."
Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman, said in a statement that similar claims were thrown out by the Federal Trade Commission about a decade ago and more recently by Judge Mehta. "On the other aspects of the decision to which Yelp refers, we are appealing. Google will vigorously defend against Yelp's meritless claims," he said.
The company added that Yelp was an online middleman and it was more valuable to present direct connections to businesses. Google's local search results direct more than 6.5 billion connections to businesses each month, including website clicks and phone calls, it added. The Justice Department has considered asking Judge Mehta to break Google up, The New York Times has reported. But there will be another round of hearings to determine remedies in the case, starting in September. Google has said it will appeal the ruling.
While Yelp may be the first company to bring a case against Google after Judge Mehta's ruling, it might not be the last. The decision offered a legal framework for other companies that claim they have been strong-armed by Google.
Aaron Schur, Yelp's general counsel, said in an interview that the company's arguments about Google were not unique to Yelp and that he does not "think it will be the last" case of this kind.
Google places its own results on local businesses above Yelp's when people look for a nearby restaurant or hair salon, for example, often presenting a Google map near the top of the results page and forcing Yelp and others to compete for space below.
Yelp has been one of the tech industry's most vocal critics of Google since 2010, the year after it reportedly rejected Google's $ 500 million offer to acquire it. The two companies competed to offer users reviews on businesses and services like plumbers and cafes, but Yelp repeatedly complained to regulators that Google was suppressing its content.
Mr. Stoppelman said he had hesitated to sue Google because he believed a lot of resources were needed to take on such a giant company. Last year, Yelp had $ 1.34 billion in revenue, while Alphabet, Google's parent, recorded $ 307 billion.
He added that he believed it was the government's job to enforce monopoly laws against the search giant, a message that Yelp repeatedly delivered.
With Google's recent loss, "the winds on antitrust have shifted dramatically," Mr. Stoppelman said.
Google said Yelp has been lobbying federal and state antitrust enforcers for over 15 years with its criticisms of Google and that none of them -- including the Justice Department -- have taken up Yelp's claims.
Yelp filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, where a jury last year found Google liable for strong-arming Epic Games and other app developers with stringent fees and rules on the Android mobile operating system.
"This is a case about Google, the largest information gatekeeper in existence, abandoning its stated mission to deliver the best information available to its consumers and instead forcing its own low-quality local search content on them," Yelp said in its legal filing.
Yelp added that when Google prioritizes its own results, it "starves competitors of the traffic and revenues that would allow them to achieve scale and pose a competitive constraint on Google's conduct."
The company said Google has leveraged its leading position in search to monopolize local search services and the local search ad market. It is suing Google under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, a U.S. antitrust law from 1890.
In the filing, Yelp said that "Google took Yelp's data, used it for its own competing property to siphon users away from Yelp and profited."
The claim dates back to when the companies had a two-year partnership starting in 2005. Yelp did not renew the deal for fear that Google would build a competing local search product, and it did.
Years later, in 2015, Yelp said that Google adjusted its search algorithm in a way that sent less traffic to Yelp, which experienced its first yearly decline in traffic as a result. Since then, the company said, "Google's self-preferencing and gatekeeping has resulted in stagnant or diminished traffic to Yelp."
Now, Yelp says, Google promotes its own services over competitors in all so-called vertical markets. This includes searches on topics like shopping and travel, where companies like eBay and Expedia compete with Google. Besides hurting the rivals' businesses, Yelp argues that it also harms consumers.
Yelp, an ad-supported business, said that Google's conduct undermined its ability to compete for advertisers, who want to reach the most users, and allowed Google to raise ad prices.
"Google's local search results are on average shorter, more prone to error, less subject to quality control, and less likely to result in user engagement than Yelp's local search results," the company said in its complaint.

May the Force ... Oh, Just Forget About It: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The vast galaxy is filled with well-worn concepts from other open-world games. Finding excitement requires descending to the game's black markets and gambling dens.
Star Wars Outlaws, an attempt by the publisher of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry to plug the famous movie franchise into the tried-and-true formula of the open-world action-adventure game, is, unsurprisingly, huge. It spans a broad galaxy broken up into several systems, each featuring its own hub worlds with distinct natural biomes and identities.
There's the familiar desert expanse of Tatooine, along with a wintry planet coated in frost and snow, one with vine-strewn jungles and one boasting broad, sweeping savannas. Out in orbit, you can navigate through cloudy nebulas and the ruins of past space battles. You can shoot at pirates or square off against squadrons of Imperial TIE fighters under cold blue starlight.
But the expansive scale comes with costs, and Star Wars Outlaws does not have the high level of polish that has come to be, fairly or not, the expectation of big-budget video games like this one from Ubisoft. Far too often I'd get tripped up on some awkwardly shaped geometry or, struggling with the controls, fling myself off a ledge I was meaning to jump onto. My blaster fire would sometimes strike harmlessly off the same invisible walls my enemy could somehow spot me through, making stealthy trespass -- a major component of the game's interaction -- a chore of hard-to-read signals.
As a result, the game strains under its own weight. It has the same jittery unpredictability the Elder Scrolls games are known for, but not the same breadth of choices in its interactivity.
What Star Wars Outlaws has going for it, of course, is a comforting patina. Buggy controls and unsatisfying mechanics are compensated for by rich nostalgic fantasy. And it's a far-reaching nostalgia, too, for the most part skipping the later films and the largely reviled prequels to set the game between "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Figures wear period-appropriate outfits and slam Duplo-size buttons on old C.R.T. monitors. Familiar vehicles, locations and characters make their dutiful appearance.
But after having to trespass onto yet another identical-looking Imperial base, or fight off another wave of nameless pirates, the magic does begin to fade. Having to engage over and over again with cookie-cutter mechanical contrivances -- scaling a wall with telltale rock features, using X-ray vision to spot enemies with a mechanic made popular by Arkham Asylum 15 years ago, looking for graffiti conveniently pointing out nearby grapple points -- wears against the novelty of getting to role-play as a planet-hopping scoundrel.
These mechanics also feel rougher and less polished in this version of Star Wars. They help the game earn its open-world moniker but hardly justify themselves, feeling like stand-ins for more interesting ideas. Any brilliance and creativity is buried deep.
Star Wars Outlaws comes alive in the claustrophobic, low-ceilinged spaces of its underground black markets, its gambling dens, its bars and cantinas. The camera pulls in tight behind the main character, Kay Vess, as she pushes her way through throngs of the threatening and cajoling scum of the galaxy.
Vess's journey takes us far from the quasi-biblical Jedi and their Force, and the righteous morality of the rebellion, which she takes pains to scoff at. Instead, much of what you're doing is a Make-a-Quick-Buck simulator, going about the illicit work of smuggling contraband and sabotaging operations.
A young upstart and rogue-ish freelancer raised on the iniquitous streets of Canto Bight, Vess is available to the highest criminal bidder. We join her as she sets out to make a big, career-defining score. She is waylaid, naturally, at every step along the way by this galaxy's big players, its high rollers and "underbosses." She must navigate through a maze of unfair and precarious systems on the way toward her planned heist, pilfering the vault of the treacherous gang boss Sliro.
These systems are at the heart of what Star Wars Outlaws does well. Missions tend to be structured around gig work for syndicates, all viciously vying for power and influence. Doing a job for one often means working against another by stealing from the group, hurting its profits or, more often than not, outright murdering its operatives. The resulting loss of favor means getting locked out of potential jobs and chased out of the offended syndicate's territories. At least until you can find a way to get back into its good graces.
Many missions end with a choice between two less-than-ideal options. During these decisive moments we get to fully inhabit the role of the scoundrel, the archetype made so alluring by Harrison Ford's performance as Han Solo. We pick our allegiances on a whim, selling out the Pykes to the Hutts and then switching sides a minute later. We make foolish errors but easily rebound from them. This winding path weaves a convincing narrative.
The central story line is less impressive, thanks to the rudimentary character development of Vess. Visually, she fits the part. Her shaggy, feathered bangs hang casually over a deep brow and a fixed smirk; she swaggers around with the practiced bravado of a hustler in over her head. But she is more often swept along by events than in control of them.
We know that Vess is running away, reeling from abandonment and loneliness. But the characters she teams up with, like the surly military droid ND-5 or her furry friend Nix, do not get enough narrative momentum to sell their emotional connection to her. They flit in and out of view, brought into the foreground to confirm some trite point about emotional growth or to be put in danger to help sell Vess's heroic status. We end the game not terribly far from where we started: a sympathetic but ultimately unformed hero.
Part of this is owed to the game's tendency to shower the player with distractions like card games and alien horse races, weapons upgrades and the wild goose chases required to hunt down their many bespoke parts. It's the curse that afflicts most open-world games. They are worlds as shallow as they are wide.
How interesting can it really be to come across another Jawa, another droid, to see another speeder, no matter how meticulously detailed, to see different arrangements of spaceports and starship decks and hyperdrives and moons? To hear, over and over again, that familiar suctioning twang of a blaster firing?
You have to look past a lot of busywork before you reach the good stuff.
When Vess reads a tip on how to fix a horse race that's been secreted away in the back office of one of the syndicates, and then wins big after making the maximum bet on that rigged horse, it proves that Star Wars Outlaws can effectively model how crooked systems function. When Vess starts out on a straightforward mission for the Ashiga Clan, only for her handler to be revealed as a Crimson Dawn spy, you get a taste of the nefarious complexity of these interlocking systems.
When Vess is making deals in seedy basements or hoofing it from danger, weighed down by ill-gotten gains, the experience enthralls. I only wish Star Wars Outlaws could let what works out into the open air a bit more, focusing on what is actually compelling in its galaxy rather than the sheer scale.
Star Wars Outlaws, which releases on Friday, was reviewed on the PlayStation 5. It will also be available on the PC and the Xbox Series X|S.

U.S. to Award $1.6 Billion to Texas Instruments for Semiconductor Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The funding stems from the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which aims to bolster the production of critical semiconductors in the United States.
The Biden administration will award up to $ 1.6 billion in grants to Texas Instruments to help the company build three new manufacturing plants, the latest in a slew of awards intended to ramp up the nation's production of semiconductors.
The funds will help the Dallas-based company construct two plants in Sherman, Texas, and a facility in Lehi, Utah, Commerce Department officials announced on Friday. The grant is meant to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors, the tiny chips that are key components of electronic devices.
The investment will "advance U.S. economic security and mitigate those same supply chain vulnerabilities that were brought to light during the pandemic," said Laurie E. Locascio, the under secretary of commerce for standards and technology, during a call with reporters on Thursday night.
In addition to the grant, the department will award up to $ 3 billion in loans to Texas Instruments, officials said. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. The funds will support the company's investment of more than $ 18 billion to construct the new facilities, officials said.
The funding comes from the CHIPS Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support in 2022. The legislation was intended to bolster the domestic production of semiconductors and reduce the nation's dependence on Asian countries for them. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are manufactured in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Ramping up domestic chip manufacturing has been a major goal for President Biden, whose economic policy agenda focuses in part on boosting American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades.
The legislation also came in response to the expensive and economically damaging chip shortages that occurred during the pandemic. Officials said the Texas Instruments award would support the company's production of current-generation and mature, or less advanced, semiconductors that were in short supply during the pandemic.
The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to dole out as grants to encourage chipmakers to build and expand new facilities in the United States. So far, the Biden administration has announced more than $ 30 billion in grants through the program. Several companies that manufacture more advanced semiconductors have received multibillion dollar awards in recent months, including Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung.
Texas Instruments broke ground on its new plants in Sherman in May 2022, and on its Lehi plant in November 2023.
Together, the new plants are expected to create more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs, federal officials said. The first facility in Sherman is expected to begin production as early as 2025, and the plant in Lehi is expected to start production as early as 2026.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, has estimated that the new investments will help the United States triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, increasing the nation's share of global chip manufacturing to 14 percent.
The federal effort has helped catalyze nearly $ 400 billion in private investments from semiconductor and electronics companies, administration officials said.
Still, longer-term questions about the viability of some companies remain. Intel said this month that it would cut more than 15,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force. Company officials have said they remained committed to expanding its semiconductor facilities in America.

Full text: The reporter Jin Yu Young wrote about companies that have pushed their managers to work longer hours, a move that has not gone over well with some young people in the country.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
I spent much of my childhood in the United States and Canada but have lived in South Korea for all of my adult life. I have noticed one stark contrast between the places I grew up in and South Korea: people's attitude toward work. In North America, it seems to me that people look for jobs that they are interested in or passionate about. In South Korea, people often prioritize jobs that offer prestige and better reputations.
As a reporter covering South Korea from the Seoul bureau of The New York Times, I have written about the country's cutthroat education system. It may come as no surprise that South Korea's work culture is also rigorous. There is a lot of data to prove this, and more than enough anecdotes about employees working extremely long hours. But to have the nation's largest companies go on the record about implementing longer working hours for managers -- a response to a downturn in business -- is another thing altogether.
The news about longer hours appeared on my radar in the spring. Through online forums, and later from the local news, I learned that some influential South Korean companies were advocating longer hours, and in some cases, even encouraging managers to come to the office six days a week.
Rich Barbieri, the deputy business editor in Seoul, approached me about taking on the story. The news could serve as a peg and hook into a deep-dive enterprise on South Korea's current and former labor laws. This looking-glass type of article is my favorite to report and write. Telling a story with real voices and experiences is how, I think, we preserve our humanity in our journalistic quest to record the present for posterity.
The first task was to find companies that were willing to go on the record about asking managers to work longer hours. As many business journalists know, it's often difficult to breach the barrier of tight-lipped spokespeople. I spoke to a handful of them to confirm the news. It took multiple tries: I had almost a dozen phone calls with one company before getting anything on the record. A company that did agree to speak on the record mentioned that one of its divisions had done poorly in recent months; executives and leaders within the company were expected to come to its rescue. (Translation: They would work longer hours.)
Another key element for my article would be to speak with someone who had worked in South Korea before and after 2004, when workweeks were capped at five days. I wanted to find someone who could speak about the nation's work culture at a time when many people were accustomed to working more than five days a week.
I had interviewed Lim Hyun-kyu, who worked for Samsung for over 30 years, for a previous article on the country's role in the semiconductor industry. While our conversation at the time was short, he was incredibly knowledgeable about South Korean business practices at large.
In July, he gladly agreed to speak to me again. In his office, we spoke at length about his experience working in the 1970s and '80s, and the recent paradigm shift in work values. Mr. Lim mentioned that his son has a very different relationship with work than he'd had.
To me, this article had as much of a generational element as it did a business one. In an interview, Joon Han, a sociology professor at Yonsei University, said that unlike previous generations, today's job seekers in South Korea value work-life balance and flexibility.
In Korean, there is a term called nunchi, which doesn't have a direct English translation but signifies one's ability to read the room, a kind of implicit pressure. It's a large part of our culture. In a corporate setting, it might include meeting your bosses' expectations without being asked to. While the six-day workweek may apply only to executive leaders, younger workers say it's only a matter of time before it trickles down the ranks. I wanted to include their voices as well.
"Companies say they're only making managers come in on the weekend, but if you see your boss working on a Saturday, you're going to feel nunchi," said Kim Seol, a representative of the Youth Community Union, a labor group for people ages 15 to 39.
Many younger employees no longer want to live in a society like this. I worked last year on an article about the Metaverse and its foray into the entertainment industry. My Times colleagues were enamored by one of the characters, Pengsoo, a life-size penguin with a jarring voice and a snappy attitude that quickly became popular among those in their 20s and 30s for its no-nonsense remarks. Experts told me the popularity of Pengsoo -- who was named South Korea's "person of the year" in 2019 -- speaks to changing norms around hierarchy and work culture in South Korea.
My article on South Korea's evolving workweek performed better than expected. I didn't expect so many comments and mentions on social media. Even though the article is about South Korea, perhaps it resonated with readers around the world because they are also examining their own relationships with the office. Speaking with my editor Rich this month, he said taking the pulse of work culture in South Korea could be something we can continue to do in the future. Hopefully, not on the weekends.

Google Unveils Pixel 9 To Beat Apple's iPhone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The internet giant unveiled the next generation of Pixel phones, headphones and watches to stand out in a hardware market that has mostly ignored it.
When Google released its first Android smartphone in 2008, the company's founders slid onstage in roller skates. One of them, Larry Page, said the device was as advanced as a computer had been a few years before.
On Tuesday, executives left the skates behind but kept to the tone of that pitch: Google crammed all the cutting-edge technology it could into the latest Pixel phones. The devices are chock-full of artificial intelligence, to let users engage with a conversational assistant, edit people into photos and search for information found in their screenshots, the company said in blog posts.
Google is hoping the features will help the four new phones -- including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro and the double-wide Pixel 9 Fold -- finally overcome consumer apathy to its smartphone ambitions. It is Google's latest attempt to make a splash in a smartphone market dominated by its partner Samsung, as well as by Apple, which has already detailed the A.I. capabilities coming to the next generation of iPhones.
Google's effort to make itself a significant player in consumer hardware has been an uphill climb. It has about 5 percent of the smartphone market in the United States, and generally less than that in other major markets, like Britain, Germany and India, according to Statista, which compiles data.
The company gets most of its revenue from advertising on its search engine and YouTube video platform. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Google had acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, in a decision that could upend the company's lucrative business model. Google said it would appeal the decision and "remain focused on making products that people find helpful."
Google has tried to use the excitement around generative A.I. chatbots and features to reset the competition. In April, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, announced that he was merging its teams that develop Android with those that engineer Pixel devices and other hardware. The hope was that combining the two would make it easier to incorporate more A.I. into the products and speed up decision-making.
All the phones are available for preorder on Tuesday. Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will launch Aug. 22 and the other two on Sept. 4.
Google suggested that its A.I. features would arrive sooner than Apple's, which said it would add A.I. to its smartphones by this fall. Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president who oversees hardware and Android, said he understood "people's skepticism" when it comes to the rollout of A.I.
"There have been so many promises, so many 'coming soons' and not enough real-world helpfulness when it comes to A.I.," Mr. Osterloh said, "which is why today, we're getting real. We have lots of live demos of products, features and A.I. experiences that are starting to ship with Android and our new Pixel devices."
Google said that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which has two screens -- one outside and a wider screen when unfolded -- would bring users "the best of Google's A.I." The device starts at $ 1,799, the company said, while the rest of the lineup starts from $ 799 to $ 1,099, depending on size and specifications.
While Google's share of the smartphone market is small, it has recently made some strides. The company's 4.6 percent of the smartphone market in 2023 was up from 3.6 percent a year earlier, according to data from the research firm IDC.
Besides the new phones, the company showcased the Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2, headphones that incorporated the company's Tensor A1 computer chips for the first time. Google said they were designed for its A.I. and advanced audio processing, so users could have clearer calls and hear less outside noise.
The company is hoping that its latest product blitz will be helped by its A.I. It has incorporated its Gemini chatbot, formerly named Bard, into the Android operating system used by billions of people.
One service, Gemini Live, will allow phone users to have audio conversations with the chatbot and ask complex questions or learn what kinds of jobs might be suited to their skill-set and degree, the company said. It is available to those who pay to subscribe to Gemini starting today. Google said it would give phone customers a free year of its premium A.I. plan, for access to more features.
Gemini will also connect with new apps in the coming weeks, including Calendar, Tasks and more features on YouTube Music, to make it a more helpful assistant.
Google acknowledged that all these efforts would bring A.I. deeper into users' private lives, and said that it would safeguard their data by not sharing it with other companies, and give users control over what Gemini can have access to.
"We're infusing A.I. into everything we do," Sameer Samat, Google's president of the Android Ecosystem, wrote in a blog post. "In order for A.I. to be truly helpful, it should naturally fit into our everyday lives, and the best place to experience that is on your Android device."

Sponsors Taking Up More Space At Games: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: LVMH and Samsung intruded on previously sacrosanct spaces at the Paris Games, angering fellow sponsors and raising concerns about a repeat at the closing ceremony.
When the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH agreed to pay about $ 175 million to underwrite the organizing committee for the Paris Olympics, the company, owned by France's richest person, Bernard Arnault, asked for more than any previous sponsor had ever done. Organizers of the Games, desperate for that cash, appeared to have said yes at every turn.
The medals? Made by the LVMH-owned jeweler Chaumet. The French parade uniforms? Made by the LVMH-owned label Berluti. The medal trays for every event? The unmistakable checkerboard pattern of Louis Vuitton. And on and on it went. But there was one secret that had been held back, Antoine Arnault, who is Bernard Arnault's son and the family's representative to the Olympics, told a gathering of well-heeled Parisians on the eve of the Games.
Keep an eye out, he and other LVMH executives said, for "a big surprise" involving the company.
In the end it was hard to miss. Among the parade of athletes cruising along the River Seine was one vessel carrying different cargo: suitcases and trunks encased in Louis Vuitton leather. The Louis V was just one part of the show, an hourslong broadcast that also featured a long video segment beamed to millions of people worldwide that showed the making of the trunk and then panned to dancers in LVMH-designed clothing.
The audacious segment -- effectively a three-minute advertisement for LVMH during one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the Games -- left some longtime Olympic executives slack-jawed. But it also outraged several of the International Olympic Committee's top partners, billion-dollar companies that have been involved with the Games for far longer than LVMH.
"I was very surprised to see the level of LVMH branding in the ceremony," said Ricardo Fort, a former executive responsible for events like the Olympics and the soccer World Cup at Coca-Cola, whose Olympic partnership dates to the Amsterdam Games in 1928. "This is so unusual I can't even think about another opening ceremony where a brand had such a visible role."
Michael Payne, who devised the I.O.C.'s original marketing strategy of partnering with a handful of deep-pocketed and long-term global partners in each Olympic cycle, said the committee would have "some explaining to do" to its partners -- if only to reassure them that there would not be a repeat in the closing ceremony on Sunday.
Asked if LVMH's exposure during the opening ceremony would now be the norm for powerful sponsors, Tak Kosugi, the head of Olympic marketing at Panasonic, another longtime I.O.C. partner, blew out his cheeks, leaned back in his chair and pushed his head backward. "Tough question," he said, before offering his thoughts in the most diplomatic language he could muster.
Kosugi noted that not just LVMH, but more than 20 sponsors -- both global companies and French ones -- had paid handsomely to be associated with the Paris Olympics, and he offered a reminder that the Games' policy has always been different than that of any other major sporting event when it comes to sponsor visibility on the field of play.
The field of play at the Olympics, which includes the opening ceremony, is supposed to be "clean," he said: shorn of the type of branding that is ubiquitous at huge global events like the World Cups of soccer, rugby and cricket. That principle imposes tight restrictions on what partners, however much they spend, can do.
"Once you do something like that it might be very similar to other sporting events," Kosugi said. Panasonic, whose links to the Olympics date to the 1984 Los Angeles Games, had more reason than most to be frustrated by the opening ceremony: In another long scene, a D.J. performed behind a mixer made by a rival company with its logo highly visible; furious, the company fired off a complaint to the I.O.C. Kosugi declined to comment on that. So did the I.O.C.
Two senior I.O.C. officials said that, had they been aware of how long and how brazen LVMH's opening ceremony video would be, they would have insisted on cuts to the segment. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid damaging professional relationships with partners.
"We knew the content," the I.O.C.'s chief spokesman, Mark Adams, said without clarifying if Olympic officials were aware of the entirety of the sequence before it was broadcast.
Anne Descamps, a spokeswoman for the Paris organizing committee, said highlighting LVMH allowed organizers to show the world France's strength in the luxury sector.
But the episodes shed a light on how hard sponsors need to work to defend and promote valuable marketing rights, acquired at great expense, to the Olympic Games.
Historically, sponsors have been required to discreetly integrate their businesses into the event if they harbor any hope of being visible on the field of play. That has included large red clocks made by the Games' timekeeping partner, Omega; bottles of Powerade, which is owned by Coca-Cola, being handed to athletes; and in-stadium screens provided by Panasonic.
But some of the subtleties of previous Games have been replaced with more obvious commercial opportunities this year.
After the American gymnast Simone Biles secured victory in the all-around, one of the most popular and most-watched events of any Olympics, she stood atop the podium having been delivered her gold medal, lifted off a Louis Vuitton tray, by the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach.
Moments later, after the United States national anthem boomed out of the loudspeakers in the Bercy Arena, a young woman dressed in LVMH-designed apparel crept up to the bronze medalist, Sunisa Lee of the United States, and handed her a Samsung phone. Lee took hold of it and eagerly posed for a selfie on the podium with Biles and Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, the silver medalist. The scene would be repeated hundreds of times across the Games.
"For me the medal rostrum is sacred and not the place to play with sponsorship," said Payne, who, in his two decades at the I.O.C., zealously guarded against the intrusion of brands into places they did not have permission to be. That zero-tolerance policy from the I.O.C., he said, applied even to official sponsors -- most famously, he said, during the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Games.
Made aware that a McDonald's restaurant inside the Olympic Village had strategically placed its logo on a pole so that it could be viewed from inside the stadium during the athletes parade when lit, Payne urgently sent staff members to the restaurant to demand that it be turned off.
When the staff members reported back that the restaurant was closed, Payne told them to break in and cut the electricity supply. "By the time we got to Djibouti" -- still very near the front of the procession alphabetically -- "the electric was cut off and the sign was off," he said.
In the years since, however, there has been a creeping commercialization. More and more space has been given to partners, even in previously sacrosanct spaces like the opening ceremony and the medal stand, and never more so than in Paris. Interview backdrops have featured corporate logos and companies operate in Games-adjacent spaces like the Champions Park, a location branded by Panasonic, where medal winners come to show off their medals to adoring fans.
Anne-Sophie Voumard, the I.O.C.'s director of television and marketing services, suggested there will be even more branded innovation in the years ahead as Olympic officials try to balance traditions with the needs of sponsors who contribute more than $ 2 billion per Olympic cycle.
"We have been historically trying to work with our partners," she said, "to have a very smooth organic integration and ways for us to be actually promoting their products in a way that helps with the delivery of the Games or with the experience. And the victory selfie is exactly that example."
She added that the I.O.C. "will continue to evolve in this respect and try to be smart about how we continue to integrate our partners."
In Los Angeles, which will host the Summer Games in 2028, organizers and sponsor alike will have seen what Paris did to test the boundaries, Payne said.
"The creatives in L.A. will be going 'goody, goody, goody,"' he added. "It won't be easy to put the genie back in the bottle."

In Los Angeles, which will host the Summer Games in 2028, organizers and sponsors alike will have seen what Paris did to test the boundaries, Payne said.
“The creatives in LA will be going ‘goody, goody, goody,’” he added. “It won’t be easy to put the genie back in the bottle.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More lenient posting rules for Olympic athletes have helped spark a deluge of successful social media content. Some say that's changing how we watch the Games.
Just moments after the American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt won a gold medal at the Paris Games, she let the whole world know what she was thinking:
"Oh my gosh I just won the FREAKING OLYMPICS hahahahah DUUUUDE," she wrote on social media from the event venue.
The post may seem like something athletes always do. But at the Olympics, it's part of a new twist -- and one of the keys to returning to the sense of a shared national experience that defined the Games of yesteryear.
For the last decade or more, it has seemed like the Olympics have struggled to capture relevance the way they did a generation ago. Blame was assigned to a fracturing media landscape and a long string of asterisks (pandemic restrictions in Tokyo, time zone issues in Beijing, a Zika outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, geopolitical tensions in Sochi).
But the reason may have been simpler: The Olympics has largely been missing from social media. The closely guarded intellectual property of "the Olympic rings" meant video from the Games was posted only in limited ways, with broadcasters worried that they would run afoul of strict rules or anxious that they would cannibalize their own broadcasts.
New, more lenient social media rules for athletes announced ahead of the Paris Games and a rethink among broadcasters -- as well as the ability of social media companies to geofence certain content -- appear to have changed virtually everything.
And audiences are cheering.
Athletes can now "create personalities just like any influencer would," said Apolo Ohno, the eight-time Olympic medalist in short-track speedskating. "It's unlike anything before."
The prolific posting has fueled Olympic memes and TikTok trends, contributing to a sense that the Games are everywhere. The South Korean pistol shooter Kim Ye-ji went viral for her cool composure. The Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen introduced the world to the chocolate muffins in the Olympic Village. The American gymnast Sunisa Lee jumped on a viral TikTok trend, mocking her jarring fall off the balance beam: "Unfortunately, I was selected for the Olympics," she wrote.
The posts appear to have had an effect. NBCUniversal, which owns the American rights to the Games, says Olympic viewership on its Peacock streaming platform and traditional television is up 77 percent over the Tokyo Games. In the company's internal studies of new Olympics viewers, 36 percent said they tuned in after watching events in social media clips.
Rigid social media restrictions were meant to protect the big money. Since the 1980s, fees for TV rights have been the largest generator of revenue for the International Olympic Committee, or I.O.C., which has done just about everything in its power to protect its partner broadcasters and official sponsors.
An athlete streaming video from the Games could threaten the value of broadcasting rights that cost media giants billions. A competitor who, intentionally or not, promotes relationships with brands that haven't paid millions to be official Olympic sponsors could infringe on those sponsors' exclusivity. And so the I.O.C. enforced strict rules for social media.
That created a tough situation for athletes. At the London Games in 2012, a group of American track athletes campaigned against rules that prevented them from mentioning personal sponsors during a "blackout" period around the Games. And the superstar swimmer Michael Phelps found himself in a whirl of controversy after a photo shoot he had done with Louis Vuitton, which was not an Olympic sponsor, leaked early.
"It's this impossible situation," Peter Carlisle, Phelps's agent at the sports agency Octagon said about the restrictive social media rules. "So, at some point, pressure mounted."
Get ready with me ... at the Olympics. Under the more permissive rules, athletes can post videos from Olympic-accredited events. (There are still some caveats: No livestreaming, and videos must be shorter than two minutes.) That has unleashed a windfall of content that would have otherwise been absent, like Simone Biles's take on the viral "get ready with me" TikTok trend, which she filmed before winning a gold medal in the individual all-around artistic gymnastics final last week.
Today's athletes may be particularly well suited to leverage the new flexibility around social media. "They were the first digital, social, native-born participants and athletes from the Olympics," said Elizabeth Lindsey, the president of Wasserman, a sports and entertainment marketing agency.
Broadcasters aren't mad about it. They've switched to embracing social media as a tool to promote the Games rather than seeing it as a threat to prime-time viewership.
Jennifer Storms, the chief marketing officer of entertainment and sports for NBCUniversal, told DealBook that the network "tore up the playbook" for its social strategy at the Paris Olympics, pumping out real time highlights that it supplemented with longer form and exclusive videos on streaming and traditional TV. It brought in swarms of celebrities, including Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart, as well as an army of content creators.
Viewership for videos shared through the NBC Sports social accounts increased 432 percent compared to Tokyo in 2021, according to NBC.
"What we're seeing is 17 days of combustible moments, where the Olympics are creating and owning the cultural conversation," Storms said. "The athletes and their ability to have a little bit more access and opportunity to post during the Games is just adding to this conversation."
A new Olympic chapter? Given that the next Summer Olympics is set to take place in Los Angeles -- the unofficial content capital of America -- executives, athletes and others have said they are expecting an even bigger social media push.
The I.O.C. is "going to come back and say, 'OK, what do we have to do in preparation for '28? What's our takeaway? How badly did any of our sponsors complain about athletes' social media? How much did our broadcast partners complain?"' Rick Burton, a professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said. "But my read so far is that everything's going swimmingly or is going about as well as the I.O.C. could have hoped."

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump more plainly calls for greater say over the Fed. The former president, who has repeatedly suggested that he would like to erode the central bank's political independence, said at a news conference that he "should have at least say in" how interest rates are set. It was perhaps the clearest articulation yet of his view on the role of the Fed, which could upset a decades-old political structure that underpins investors' trust in the central bank's decisions.
Gov. Tim Walz went under the microscope over his economic record. The Minnesota governor and social media star became the subject of intense scrutiny after Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, picked him as her running mate. (The findings so far: a largely progressive, if sometimes pragmatic, record.) Some Wall Street donors were disappointed that Harris didn't pick Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, but many felt that Walz was still an acceptable choice.
Google suffered a stinging antitrust defeat. A federal judge ruled that the tech giant illegally abused its monopoly over online search, including via multibillion-dollar deals to make its search engine the default on Apple and Samsung devices. The decision could reshape the modern internet industry. And it's not clear that Google would benefit from a change in the White House, given Donald Trump's antipathy toward the company.
The week was also tough for the media industry. Warner Bros. Discovery wrote down its linear television networks, including TBS and TNT, by $ 9.1 billion to reflect the challenges facing them,and Axios laid off 10 percent of its employees, citing newer hurdles facing its business.
A pullback in consumer spending hits vacation plans
As fears of a recession swirl, investors are keeping a close eye on consumers. Spending in general is holding up, but elevated inflation and high interest rates are putting the squeeze on some customers.
Companies like McDonald's, Amazon and PepsiCo have noted a pullback among their lower-income customers. This week, some travel industry giants also warned of a pending slowdown.
Airbnb said some customers were waiting until closer to their departure date to book reservations, a possible sign of uncertainty over their finances. Brian Chesky, the company's chief executive, also noted "some signs of slowing demand from U.S. guests." The company lowered its forecast for third-quarter revenue.
Hilton raised its full-year profit outlook. One of its big hopes is that a boom in international travel will make up for slowing demand in the U.S. Christopher Nassetta, the company's chief executive, said lower-income travelers have "less disposable income and capacity to do anything, including travel," while wealthier consumers "still have pretty fat bank accounts."
Disney reported better-than-expected earnings, driven by hit movies and streaming growth. But its theme park business underperformed. "The lower-income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress," said Bob Iger, the company's chief executive.
The outlook appears brighter for journeys closer to home: Uber reported better-than-expected gross bookings, which include ride hails and delivery orders. "While our consumers tend to be higher income, we're not seeing any softness or trading down across any income cohort," said Dara Khosrowshahi, the company's chief executive.
The tribe of big bettors
Nate Silver, the founder and former editor of FiveThirtyEight, says many of the world's richest people share this trait: They're analytical and competitive -- willing to make a big bet.
In his book "On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything," Silver, a professional poker player turned political forecaster, breaks down what these types -- in the worlds of poker, venture capital, cryptocurrency and Wall Street -- have in common. Borrowing a poker term, he calls them residents of "the river."
DealBook spoke with Silver about the upcoming elections and how river dwellers factor into them. The interview has been condensed and edited.
The Times has reported that Kamala Harris's staff crunched the data and determined she could win the presidential election whether she picked Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona or Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania as her running mate. Do you agree with that analysis?
Yes, but I think that's not a great mindset. They should think in terms of, what improves our odds at the margin most?
I would have picked Shapiro because Pennsylvania is the most likely state in our model to be the decisive state in the election. And because he demonstrates a track record of popularity with the cross section of voters that Pennsylvania has.
That way of thinking seems in line with how you describe the mindset of "the river" in the book. Can you explain the term?
It's people who take risks for a living, or assess risk for a living. People who are very quantitative and also very competitive, which lends itself to making big gambles. A surprising number of the richest people in the world, maybe almost all of them, subscribe to some version of this mentality.
"The village" is a more understood concept. It's media, academia and government, especially when a Democrat is in office. It's intellectuals.
Where else have you encountered this distinction?
Bill Ackman versus the president of Penn or Harvard University is a classic river-against-village conflict. So is The New York Times suing OpenAI.
You call Elon Musk a river resident. It's easy to see how such a risk-taking mentality helped build his business empire. Do you think it's also shaped his politics?
In some ways, his bet on Twitter actually looks pretty good as a cultural bet. It looks quite bad as a financial bet. But if you want to change the narrative around politics -- to go on a platform that was the village's platform, where there were a lot of establishment left or center-left influencers and academics and journalists, and then to steer the discussion pretty far right -- it's a bet that's worked out better for him than I might have thought.
Many in your book view themselves as capable of analyzing a situation independently based solely on the facts, rather than being part of an ideological group. But you've basically labeled them as a tribe.
What Silicon Valley thinks might be different from mainstream society -- but literally, they all know one another and all have offices on Sand Hill Road. And the relevant actors are really a pretty small group of elites.
I'm concerned about the groupthink in the river, and particularly the groupthink as it turns to politics.
What concerns you?
That partisanship and tribalism are extremely powerful drugs. And it becomes more powerful in an environment like Twitter.
The river does have a lot of admirable qualities. I think it's smart to think probabilistically. I think America is founded on risk taking. And directionally speaking, people should take more risks and not less. But I don't want it to all turn into some meme war between Elon Musk and parts of the establishment. If partisanship corrupted the village, it can corrupt the river, too.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Mounjaro and Zepbound Fuel Strong Lilly Quarter
Eli Lilly blew past second-quarter expectations with the diabetes treatment Mounjaro and its weight loss counterpart Zepbound funneling more than $ 4 billion in sales to the drugmaker.
Lilly also raised its forecast for the year well beyond Wall Street expectations as newer drugs like Zepbound built momentum.
The company's shares soared Thursday after Lilly detailed its quarterly results.
Mounjaro sales more than tripled in the quarter to nearly $ 3.1 billion. Zepbound, which is made from the same molecule, brought in $ 1.2 billion two quarters after regulators approved the drug.
Overall, Lilly's profit rose 68 percent to $ 2.97 billion in the second quarter. Revenue climbed 36 percent to $ 11.3 billion. Adjusted earnings totaled $ 3.92 per share.
Analysts expected earnings of $ 2.74 per share on $ 9.97 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. ASSOCIATED PRESS

G.M. Affirms Its Desire
To Stay in China
General Motors said on Thursday it was committed to building a profitable and self-sustainable operation in China, despite facing stiff competition from local brands.
Shares of G.M. rose more than 4 percent.
"We're committed to maintaining cash stability there at a point where it's self-sustaining. That means not needing any capital from outside," said Paul Jacobson, the chief financial officer.
Global automakers have struggled to make headway in China as local manufacturers continue to release affordable models.
G.M. has faced increasing investor scrutiny on its China operation, which in the last decade has shifted from being a profit engine to a drain on finances.
The automaker said last month that it would work with its joint-venture partner in China to restructure its business and that it planned to cut spending there. REUTERS

Samsung Recalls Ranges With a Risk of Fire
Samsung is recalling more than 1 million electric ranges after reports of 250 fires and dozens of injuries.
According to a Thursday notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, these slide-in ranges have front-mounted knobs that can be activated by accident if humans or pets unintentionally contact or bump into them. That poses a fire hazard.
To date, Samsung has received more than 300 reports of the knobs activating unintentionally since 2013, the C.P.S.C. noted, and the now-recalled ranges have been involved in about 250 fires. At least 18 of those fires caused extensive property damage and seven involved pet deaths, according to the commission. About 40 injuries have been reported.
The recalled ranges were sold between May 2013 and August 2024 at Samsung.com as well as in retailers including Best Buy, Costco, Home Depot and Lowe's. ASSOCIATED PRESS

South Korean Firms in 'Crisis' Pursue a 6-Day Workweek: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move by some influential companies has raised concerns about work-life balance in a country where long hours at the office are common.
"Back in the day," said Lim Hyung-kyu, a retired Samsung Electronics executive now in his 70s, "my weeks were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday, Friday."
Mr. Lim joined Samsung, South Korea's largest company, in 1976 and rose through the ranks to chief technology officer. For much of his 30-plus years at Samsung, working on the weekends was normal -- and legal under the nation's labor laws. "I didn't mind," Mr. Lim said. "It was fun for me."
Things are different now. South Korean labor laws cap working hours to 52 a week: 40 standard hours with up to 12 for overtime. Weekends are generally considered off limits, and younger employees are mindful of their work-life balance in a way their parents or grandparents weren't.
But over the past few months, some influential South Korean companies have told executives to work longer hours, in some cases telling them to come to the office six days a week. Some people in South Korean business are predicting that lower-ranked employees and managers at smaller companies will feel pressure to follow suit.
"It's a signal that in South Korea, working six days a week is still acceptable," said Kim Seol, a representative of the Youth Community Union, a labor group that represents workers between the ages of 15 and 39.
The pressure on workers, especially young workers, can be intense in South Korea, which has a shrinking, aging population with one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Fears about job security and the rising costs of housing, child care and education have discouraged working-age Koreans from having children, contributing to a demographic crisis that looms over the economy.
In South Korea, the five-day workweek is only a generation old, introduced by labor laws in 2004, starting with the public sector and larger companies before spreading to smaller firms. A 52-hour legal limit on the workweek is also relatively new: It was introduced in 2018, a reduction from 68 hours per week.
For much of South Korea's postwar history, a time of rapid growth and reconstruction, workers were expected to be in the office Monday through Saturday. "Back then, it was hard for people to get by," said Mr. Lim, the retired Samsung executive. "Helping the company grow meant helping the country and, by extension, yourself."
Samsung, like South Korea's other multinational giants, has tracked the country's burst of development from poverty and war to an advanced, high-tech economy. It was founded in the late 1930s as a shop selling vegetables and dried fish, started making appliances and other electronics in the late 1960s, and is now a world leader in semiconductors, smartphones and other technologies with over 200,000 employees.
The companies now calling for executives to work longer hours have described the measures as a response to a downturn in business, citing a temporary crisis or emergency. Growth in South Korea has been patchy, with weak consumer spending putting a dent in corporate earnings. The economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter.
At HD Hyundai Oilbank, the refinery and gas station unit of an industrial conglomerate, about 40 executives started coming to the office on weekends in recent weeks to "respond to the crisis caused by sluggish business conditions," according to a company representative. HD Hyundai Oilbank's sales and profit dropped sharply last year because of falling oil prices.
In July, SK On, the battery and electric vehicle unit of a technology group, announced that it would go into "emergency mode," freezing executives' salaries and making them start their workdays earlier.
"Executives and leaders will lead by example and take on the large responsibility of navigating through a crisis," Lee Seok-hee, SK On's chief executive, said at a staff meeting, according to a company statement. The company, which has lost money in recent quarters, slowed production and warned of "unfavorable market conditions" in a financial report in April.
A spokesman from Samsung Electronics said that while it was not official company policy, "executives may voluntarily choose to work on weekends according to their professional needs." The conglomerate has been in the middle of a dispute with its largest union, whose members last week said they would go back to work after a strike over pay and working conditions.
Labor groups claim the "crisis" and "emergency" measures are mostly for show. "There is a cultural mind-set here that the longer someone works, the better the outcome," said Lee Sang Yoon, a policy deputy director at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the largest labor groups in the nation. "This is outdated."
Although the calls for weekend work apply only to the executive tier of these companies, other employees may feel pressure to do the same.
"Business culture in South Korea is a pyramid," said Mr. Kim of the Youth Community Union, with large companies at the top setting the tone for the country's business culture.
What's written in labor laws also does not always reflect the actual experience of employees. Workers in South Korea log some of the highest hours among advanced economies, putting in about 100 hours more per year than the average American worker, according to 2022 data compiled by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Eun Sung, a consultant in her 20s who lives in Seoul, said she often worked six days a week when on a project.
"We consider getting off at 2 or 3 a.m. decent," she said. She sees friends only once every few months, and her health has been affected by a lack of sleep, she added. While she enjoys consulting, she said she would consider moving to a country where she could have a better work-life balance.
Some companies have ways to get employees to put in longer hours, according to Ryu Jae Kang, head of a policy unit at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions. They may pay fixed salaries that already incorporate overtime hours, and not all hours for all types of work may be tracked.
The legal reduction of working hours over the years has been a sign of South Korea's development and a shift among people to focus more on their personal lives, said Joon Han, a sociology professor at Yonsei University.
Last year, President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is considered pro-business, proposed raising the cap on the workweek to 69 hours. It faced a backlash from the public and opposition political parties, and the president withdrew the plan.
Some are pushing to reduce working hours. A four-day workweek was part of the platforms of some politicians running in the nation's April parliamentary elections. In June, the government launched a work-life balance committee charged with exploring more flexible working practices.
"Times are changing," said Mr. Han of Yonsei University. "Young people don't want to be slaves to their companies anymore."

The Biden administration said on Tuesday that it would award up to $ 450 million in grants to a South Korean chipmaker, SK Hynix, to help build its new chip facility in Indiana, in what officials described as a milestone in rebuilding the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry.
With the announcement, the United States now has commitments from all five of the world's leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers to construct chip plants in the United States with financial assistance from the administration, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo said in a call with reporters on Monday. The Biden administration previously announced that it had reached agreements with Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Micron to help fund investments in the United States.
"These are the only companies in the world capable of producing leading-edge chips at scale," she said.
SK Hynix announced in April that it had committed to investing $ 3.87 billion in a facility in West Lafayette, Ind. Ms. Raimondo called that investment a "huge deal" because it meant that the United States would "have the most secure and diverse supply chain in the world for the advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence." SK Hynix makes advanced memory chips that are an essential component for creating A.I.
Commerce Department officials said that, with the SK Hynix grant, the United States had now allocated more than $ 30 billion of a $ 39 billion pot of funding that stems from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law aimed at building up domestic chip manufacturing and reducing America's dependence on Asia for vital semiconductors.
Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are manufactured in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990. Reversing the nation's declining share of global chip manufacturing has been a major priority for President Biden and a key component of his economic policy agenda.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, has estimated that the new investments will help the United States triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, raising America's share of world chip manufacturing to 14 percent by 2032.
Other companies have won much larger, multibillion-dollar grants. Federal officials awarded Intel up to $ 8.5 billion and TSMC up to $ 6.6 billion this year.
The roughly $ 30 billion in total public investment has been accompanied by commitments from private companies to invest more than $ 300 billion in the United States, Commerce Department officials said. That is helping to create more than 100,000 jobs, officials said.
None of the $ 39 billion has been distributed to companies yet, but the funds are expected to begin going out to them before the end of the year, a senior administration official said. The Commerce Department will decide how to allocate the remaining funding it has on the same timeline, according to the official.
Longer-term questions remain about the viability of some companies. Intel said on Thursday that it would slash more than 15,000 jobs, amounting to 15 percent of its work force, as the company tries to recover from a series of stumbles. Intel said it remained committed to its plan to expand its chip factories in the United States.

Declaring ‘Crisis,’ South Korean Firms Tell Managers to Work 6 Days a Week

SEOUL, South Korea — “Back in the day,” said Lim Hyung-kyu, a retired Samsung Electronics executive now in his 70s, “my weeks were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Friday, Friday.”
Lim joined Samsung, South Korea’s largest company, in 1976 and rose through the ranks to chief technology officer. For much of his 30-plus years at Samsung, working on the weekends was normal — and legal under the nation’s labor laws. “I didn’t mind,” Lim said. “It was fun for me.”
Things are different now. South Korean labor laws cap working hours to 52 a week: 40 standard hours with up to 12 for overtime. Weekends are generally considered off limits, and younger employees are mindful of their work-life balance in a way their parents or grandparents weren’t.
But over the past few months, some influential South Korean companies have told executives to work longer hours, in some cases telling them to come to the office six days a week. Some people in South Korean business are predicting that lower-ranked employees and managers at smaller companies will feel pressure to follow suit.
“It’s a signal that in South Korea, working six days a week is still acceptable,” said Kim Seol, a representative of the Youth Community Union, a labor group that represents workers between the ages of 15 and 39.
The pressure on workers, especially young workers, can be intense in South Korea, which has a shrinking, aging population with one of the world’s lowest fertility rates. Fears about job security and the rising costs of housing, child care and education have discouraged working-age Koreans from having children, contributing to a demographic crisis that looms over the economy.
In South Korea, the five-day workweek is only a generation old, introduced by labor laws in 2004, starting with the public sector and larger companies before spreading to smaller firms. A 52-hour legal limit on the workweek is also relatively new: It was introduced in 2018, a reduction from 68 hours per week.
For much of South Korea’s postwar history, a time of rapid growth and reconstruction, workers were expected to be in the office Monday through Saturday. “Back then, it was hard for people to get by,” said Lim, the retired Samsung executive. “Helping the company grow meant helping the country and, by extension, yourself.”
Samsung, like South Korea’s other multinational giants, has tracked the country’s burst of development from poverty and war to an advanced, high-tech economy. It was founded in the late 1930s as a shop selling vegetables and dried fish, started making appliances and other electronics in the late 1960s, and is now a world leader in semiconductors, smartphones and other technologies with over 200,000 employees.
The companies now calling for executives to work longer hours have described the measures as a response to a downturn in business, citing a temporary crisis or emergency. Growth in South Korea has been patchy, with weak consumer spending putting a dent in corporate earnings. The economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter.
At HD Hyundai Oilbank, the refinery and gas station unit of an industrial conglomerate, about 40 executives started coming to the office on weekends in recent weeks to “respond to the crisis caused by sluggish business conditions,” according to a company representative. HD Hyundai Oilbank’s sales and profit dropped sharply last year because of falling oil prices.
In July, SK On, the battery and electric vehicle unit of a technology group, announced that it would go into “emergency mode,” freezing executives’ salaries and making them start their workdays earlier.
“Executives and leaders will lead by example and take on the large responsibility of navigating through a crisis,” Lee Seok-hee, SK On’s CEO, said at a staff meeting, according to a company statement. The company, which has lost money in recent quarters, slowed production and warned of “unfavorable market conditions” in a financial report in April.
A spokesperson from Samsung said that while it was not official company policy, “executives may voluntarily choose to work on weekends according to their professional needs.” The conglomerate has been in the middle of a dispute with its largest union, whose members last week said they would go back to work after a strike over pay and working conditions.
Labor groups claim the “crisis” and “emergency” measures are mostly for show. “There is a cultural mindset here that the longer someone works, the better the outcome,” said Lee Sang Yoon, a policy deputy director at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, one of the largest labor groups in the nation. “This is outdated.”
Although the calls for weekend work apply only to the executive tier of these companies, other employees may feel pressure to do the same.
“Business culture in South Korea is a pyramid,” Kim said, with large companies at the top setting the tone for the country’s business culture.
What’s written in labor laws does not always reflect the actual experience of employees. Workers in South Korea log some of the highest hours among advanced economies, putting in about 100 hours more per year than the average American worker, according to 2022 data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Eun Sung, a consultant in her 20s who lives in Seoul, said she often worked six days a week when on a project.
“We consider getting off at 2 or 3 a.m. decent,” she said. She sees friends only once every few months, and her health has been affected by a lack of sleep, she added. While she enjoys consulting, she said she would consider moving to a country where she could have a better work-life balance.
Some companies have ways to get employees to put in longer hours, according to Ryu Jae Kang, head of a policy unit at the Federation of Korean Trade Unions. They may pay fixed salaries that already incorporate overtime hours, and not all hours for all types of work may be tracked.
The legal reduction of working hours over the years has been a sign of South Korea’s development and a shift among people to focus more on their personal lives, said Joon Han, a sociology professor at Yonsei University.
Last year, President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is considered pro-business, proposed raising the cap on the workweek to 69 hours. It faced a backlash from the public and opposition political parties, and the president withdrew the plan.
Some are pushing to reduce working hours. A four-day workweek was part of the platforms of some politicians running in the nation’s April parliamentary elections. In June, the government launched a work-life balance committee charged with exploring more flexible working practices.
“Times are changing,” Han said. “Young people don’t want to be slaves to their companies anymore.”

Samsung Employees Return to Work After Strike Fails to Win Concessions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The indefinite strike, the first in the electronics company's history, comprised only a sliver of its labor force and lasted less than a month.
Thousands of unionized workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea, who had declared an indefinite strike last month, had returned to work by Monday after failing to win concessions from the global tech giant.
It was the first unionized action in the decades-long history of Samsung, one of the world's biggest makers of computer chips. But the striking employees, numbering roughly 6,500 or so, accounted for only a fraction of union membership and a sliver of the company's total work force. Most of them were back at work by Monday, according to Lee Hyun Kuk, the vice president of the Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union.
For months, the union and the company have failed to reach an agreement on wages, bonuses and vacation days for the workers. In June, union members went on a single-day strike as a warning before starting the indefinite walkout in July. All along, Samsung emphasized that the labor action would not disrupt its operations, a position it reiterated last week.
But the financial burden of a prolonged, unpaid strike on employees forced union leaders to issue a back-to-work order last week. The union has a strike fund of about 80 million won, or roughly $ 60,000, but it has not disclosed if it has spent any of those funds.
"Twenty-five days into the strike, and we have nothing in our hands yet," Son Woo-mok, the president of the union, told members on Thursday. "I feel responsibility as the union leader that we haven't brought about any results to the union members who have been participating in the strike while going without pay."
The union, which has more than 31,000 members, plans to hold guerrilla strikes, or blitz walkouts, but didn't disclose the frequency or number of planned strikes. "This is not a loss, but a change of tactics," Mr. Son said.
Union leaders held a news conference last week outside the home of Samsung's chairman, Lee Jae-yong, in Seoul, imploring him to take action. But Mr. Lee was in Paris, meeting with other business leaders who were also attending the Olympics.
Last month, Samsung released the latest lineup of its electronic devices -- including the Galaxy Fold 6 phone and smartwatches -- as scheduled. The conglomerate's electronics division employs about 260,000 people worldwide.

Google Loses Antitrust Case On Search Tool: [National Desk]

Full text: The ruling on Google's search dominance was the first antitrust decision of the modern internet era in a case against a technology giant.
Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled on Monday, a landmark decision that strikes at the power of tech giants in the modern internet era and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business.
Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, like Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.
"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly," Judge Mehta said in his ruling.
The ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online -- and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech's power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago.
"This is the most important antitrust case of the century, and it's the first of a big slate of cases to come down against Big Tech," said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school who studies antitrust. "It's a huge turning point."
The decision is a major blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with online search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google's success, especially as the company spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month.
Monday's ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Judge Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.
Judge Mehta's ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90 percent of web searches, a number the company disputed.
The company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $ 18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times has reported.
"This landmark decision holds Google accountable," Jonathan Kanter, the top Justice Department antitrust official, said in a statement. "It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans."
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company would appeal the ruling.
"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available," he said. "As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use."
During the trial, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a "Google web" and that its relationship with Apple was "oligopolistic." If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.
Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.
Users choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.
"Google is winning because it's better," John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later in May.
The government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.
Judge Mehta sided with the government, saying Google had a monopoly over general online search services. The company's agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition, making it harder for rivals to challenge Google's dominance.
For more than a decade, those agreements "have given Google access to scale that its rivals cannot match," Judge Mehta wrote.
The government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.
Judge Mehta ruled that Google's monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.
"Unconstrained price increases have fueled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits," he said in the ruling.
Judge Mehta ruled in Google's favor on some lesser claims. Google offers advertisers many tools, including one that they use to manage advertising on different search engines. State attorneys general argued during the trial that Google had illegally excluded Microsoft's search engine, Bing, from aspects of those tools. But Judge Mehta ruled against their claim.
Legal scholars expect this decision to influence government antitrust lawsuits against the other tech giants. All of those investigations, conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, began during the Trump administration and have ramped up under President Biden.
The Justice Department has sued Apple, arguing that the company made it difficult for consumers to ditch the iPhone, and brought the other case against Google. The F.T.C. has separately sued Meta, claiming the company stamped out nascent competitors, and Amazon, accusing it of squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.
With those cases, the government is testing hundred-year-old laws originally used to rein in utility and other monopolistic companies like Standard Oil.
A victory for the government provides credibility for its broader attempt to use antitrust laws to take aim at corporate America, said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C.
"It creates momentum that supports their other cases," he said in an interview in June.
Google has also faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, where officials charged the company last year with undermining rivals in online advertising.
The last major U.S. court ruling on a tech antitrust case -- in the Justice Department's 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft -- cast its own shadow over the Google arguments. Judge Mehta repeatedly pressed lawyers to explain how the specifics of the case against Google could fit into the legal precedents.
The Microsoft antitrust case alleged that the tech giant combined practices like bullying industry partners and leveraging the popularity of its digital platform, from which users typically didn't switch, to stifle competition.
A District Court judge initially ruled against Microsoft on most counts of possible antitrust violations and ordered a breakup of the company, but an appeals court reversed some of those decisions. President George W. Bush's administration settled with the company in 2001.

WASHINGTON — Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled Monday, a landmark decision that strikes at the power of tech giants in the modern internet era and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business.

Mehta ruled that Google’s monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.
“Unconstrained price increases have fueled Google’s dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits,” he said in the ruling.
Mehta ruled in Google’s favor on some lesser claims. Google offers advertisers many tools, including one that they use to manage advertising on different search engines. State attorneys general argued during the trial that Google had illegally excluded Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, from aspects of those tools. But Mehta ruled against their claim.
Legal scholars expect this decision to influence government antitrust lawsuits against the other tech giants. All of those investigations, conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, began during the Trump administration and have ramped up under President Joe Biden.
The Justice Department has sued Apple, arguing that the company made it difficult for consumers to ditch the iPhone, and brought the other case against Google. The FTC has separately sued Meta, claiming the company stamped out nascent competitors, and Amazon, accusing it of squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.
With those cases, the government is testing 100-year-old laws originally used to rein in utility and other monopolistic companies such as Standard Oil.
A victory for the government provides credibility for its broader attempt to use antitrust laws to take aim at corporate America, said William Kovacic, a former chair of the FTC.
“It creates momentum that supports their other cases,” he said in an interview in June.
Google has also faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, where officials charged the company last year with undermining rivals in online advertising.
The last major U.S. court ruling on a tech antitrust case — in the Justice Department’s 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft — cast its own shadow over the Google arguments. Mehta repeatedly pressed lawyers to explain how the specifics of the case against Google could fit into the legal precedents.
The Microsoft antitrust case alleged that the tech giant combined practices such as bullying industry partners and leveraging the popularity of its digital platform, from which users typically didn’t switch, to stifle competition.
A district court judge initially ruled against Microsoft on most counts of possible antitrust violations and ordered a breakup of the company, but an appeals court reversed some of those decisions. President George W. Bush’s administration settled with the company in 2001.

WASHINGTON — Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled Monday, a decision that strikes at the power of Big Tech companies and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business.
Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, such as Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.
“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta said in his ruling.
The ruling is the most significant victory to date for U.S. regulators who are trying to rein in the power of tech giants in the internet era. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
The ruling did not include remedies for Google’s behavior. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.
The ruling capped a yearslong case — U.S. et al. v. Google — that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google’s dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google’s search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.
The company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times reported.
During the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor’s dominance had created a “Google web” and that its relationship with Apple was “oligopolistic.” If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.
Users choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company’s lawyers said.
“Google is winning because it’s better,” John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.
The government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.
The government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company’s power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.
During closing arguments, Mehta grilled the lawyers about factual statements and asked them to explain how their cases squared with legal precedent.
“The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public,” he said.

Full text: These features to let you wind down for bed, mute notifications and stay on a regular sleep schedule may help you get more rest.
The sleep-monitoring feature of smartwatches and other wearable gadgets can track how much shut-eye you're getting -- but what if you have trouble just falling asleep in the first place? While not meant to replace medical guidance, current smartphones come with tools intended to gently ease you into slumberland by putting you in the right frame of mind. Here's a short guide.
Set a Schedule
Along with encouraging watching what you eat and drink before bed, many doctors advise turning in and waking up at regular times each day. But you don't have to remember to set reminders or a nightly alarm, since most smartphones let you set up a routine sleep schedule for the week. The schedules can vary -- if you like to grab an extra hour on the weekends, you can have different bedtimes and wake-up alarms for specific days.
On an iPhone, open the iOS Health app, tap Browse at the bottom of the screen and, in the Health Categories menu, select Sleep. On the Sleep screen, you can set up regular bed and wake times for your week, and choose an alarm type.
On many Android phones, open the Clock app and tap the Bedtime icon at the bottom of the screen to set up a simple daily sleep schedule with an alarm type. You can also add a local weather forecast to greet you when you wake.
On Samsung's Galaxy phones, the Modes and Routines feature in the Settings menu can be used to set up a sleep schedule.
Minimize Distractions
Preventing your phone from keeping you too awake as you scroll before bed (or waking you up later with alerts) is another challenge.
In the iPhone's Health app, go back to the Sleep settings and tap Full Schedule & Options to choose when you want "wind down" reminders, to set sleep goals and to track how often you reach for your phone in bed. You can connect your schedule to Apple's Sleep Focus tool here, too.
If you haven't used the Focus tools, open the iPhone's main Settings, select Focus from the menu and choose Sleep mode. Based on your sleep schedule, Sleep Focus mutes all (or specific) notifications, including calls and other alerts, during your designated slumber hours. You can also choose a simplified set of lock and home screens to reduce visual stimulation.
Other items in the Settings menu will make your screen temporarily dimmer for reading in bed, like the Display & Brightness controls that make Dark Mode switch screen menus from white to black and the Night Shift setting that nudges the screen colors to warmer tones. (These may be set to turn on automatically, but you can adjust the hours.)
On Android phones, the Digital Wellbeing controls have their own sleep-friendly adjustments. Open Settings and tap the Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls option. Choose Bedtime Mode on the next screen. At the bottom of the screen, tap the Customize option to get to controls for automatically enabling your Do Not Disturb settings (which are in the Digital Wellbeing menu as well) and more.
In the Screen Options at Bedtime, you can turn your color screen to grayscale, keep the background dimmed and put the phone in dark mode. After you adjust your settings, your phone will revert to Bedtime Mode on your sleep schedule, but you can manually enable it, too.
Some Samsung phones may label similar settings Sleep in the Modes & Routines menu.
Fade Out
Your phone can provide soothing music or other audio to help you relax and drift off. Third-party subscription apps like Calm and Aura include a sonic library designed to help you unwind, but you have other options, too.
A short playlist or podcast episode can run itself out, but what if you'd like to fall asleep to your favorite audio stream on an iPhone and don't want the device to play all night? Open the Clock app and select Timers. In the menu under When Timer Ends, choose Stop Playing. Set the amount of time you'd like the stream to play and tap the Start button on the timer. Next, hit Play in the Music app (or on the widget in the iPhone's Standby mode) and listen until the timer runs out.
You can also tell Siri to start playing Apple Music -- and for how long. And Spotify's app for Android and iOS has its own sleep timer.
On most Android phones, you can choose a soothing background sound (like ocean waves) or another audio on the same Clock screen where you set up your sleep schedule. YouTube Music Premium subscribers can fade out to their favorite tunes.
Keep in mind that these tools are meant to help, but if you're having really serious sleep issues, please use the phone to contact a doctor.

Union Workers at Samsung Launch an Indefinite Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tech giant's largest union escalated its dispute with management after failing to reach an agreement over pay and working policies.
Unionized workers at Samsung Electronics said Wednesday they would go on an indefinite strike, an escalation of a rare labor dispute that could disrupt the technology giant's world-leading chip business.
An estimated 6,500 workers walked off the job on Monday for a planned three-day strike over pay and working conditions. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union decided to extend the strike after "hearing no word" from the company, according to Lee Hyun Kuk, the vice president of the union, which represents more than 31,000 workers, or a quarter of the work force at Samsung Electronics.
Samsung, South Korea's biggest private employer, has long been the world's largest maker of memory chips, which help computers and other electronics equipment store information. The company is also a leading manufacturer of logic chips, which make computers run, behind only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
The union said it has been negotiating with Samsung since January over vacation days and wages.
"As the strike goes on, the management's blood will dry out and they will eventually come to the negotiating table on their knees," the union said in a statement.
The union said its work stoppage this week has slowed some Samsung operations and production. A Samsung representative said the strike has not affected production and it would work to avoid disruptions in the future. The company remained "committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union," the representative said.
Because of the "high level of automation in the factories and the low actual need for manual labor," the impact of the strike was expected to be minimal, said Avril Wu, a senior research vice president at TrendForce, a market research firm.
"Our research team has consulted with buyers and sellers in the memory market, and neither side is particularly concerned about this issue now," she said.
In June, Samsung workers went on a one-day strike, the first in the company's history.
Union workers are demanding a wage increase by 3.5 percent, improved bonus policies and an extra day of paid vacation. Entry-level Samsung employees typically get over two weeks a year of vacation, some paid and some unpaid. The union also wants Samsung to agree to compensate workers for any lost wages during the strike.
While in recent years union workers have said that they received bonuses of as much as 30 percent, last year they got nothing. The average member earned about 80 million won last year, or around $ 60,000, before incentives, they said.
"We won't go back until all of the demands are met," Mr. Lee said.
Last week, Samsung said that it would report a larger-than-expected jump in operating profit for the second quarter, of $ 7.5 billion. The company's stock has recently set a series of multiyear highs as demand for chips to power A.I. applications has soared.
Kim Jae Won has worked in the memory chip division at Samsung since 2019. "I understand if the company is doing poorly they can't give us our bonuses," he said. "But the fact that the executives took home huge bonuses last year, I can't understand."
Mr. Kim attended a rally of workers outside a Samsung semiconductor factory on Monday. "I felt a sense of purpose and pride that thousands of members were there," he said.
For decades, Samsung was known for its aversion to organized labor, and unions have organized workers at the company only in the past several years.
Labor strikes in South Korea are not uncommon. Since February, over 10,000 doctors walked off the job in protest of government plans to increase the number of admitted medical students. Last spring, thousands of construction workers rallied over discontent with the country's labor policies.

Free Up Phone Space, Starting With Photos: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Deleting duplicates, bad shots and other unwanted files makes it easier to find the good pictures -- and gives you room to take more.
Are you getting ominous warnings about your phone's storage? Have you ever whipped out your phone to show someone a certain photo and had to scroll for minutes to find it? If you've accumulated gigabytes of images over the years, streamlining your photo library and dumping other unnecessary apps and files can let you reclaim that space. Here's a guide to doing just that by using free tools that are probably already on your phone.
Check Storage
Start your cleanup process by noting the space on your device -- and what's filling it up.
On many Android devices, open the Settings app and select Storage to check your available space.
On a Samsung Galaxy device, open the Settings app, select either Device Care or Device Maintenance and then tap Storage. On some phones, you can scroll right down to Storage.
On an iPhone, open the Settings app and select General and then iPhone Storage to see the amount of space left on your phone. The steps are similar for an iPad.
Delete Duplicates
Zapping identical copies of photos is an easy way to reclaim turf. While subscription apps for rounding up duplicate files of all types are available (like Duplicates Cleaner for Android or Phone Cleaner for iOS), consider the free options on your phone.
In Apple's iOS Photos app, tap the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen and scroll down to the Utilities area. Tap Duplicates. The next screen shows the photos and videos with multiple copies in your library, all next to a Merge button. The Merge option preserves the highest-resolution copy (and embedded information) and moves the lesser versions to the app's Recently Deleted album.
Samsung has a similar tool for tracking down duplicate files on its Galaxy devices. Tap the My Files icon and choose Analyze Storage from the menu. On the next screen, select Duplicate Files to see the list.
Google Photos has a duplicate-detection feature designed to spot an identical photo and prevent it from being added to the library. With Google's Files app for Android -- free in the Play store if it hasn't already been installed -- you can quickly check for photo duplicates and get other file-deletion suggestions.
Open the Files app, tap the Menu icon in the upper-left corner and choose Clean. The next screen offers a variety of things you can delete to conserve space, including any duplicates, downloads, screenshots, little-used apps and large files.
Personally Review
It can be tedious, but scrolling back and deleting the duds by hand is a precise way to prune your pictures and videos. If you have a huge library, breaking up the project into daily sessions when you're on mass transit (or otherwise waiting around) whittles down your collection incrementally. Don't forget to also check any third-party photo apps that store pictures.
A deleted photo doesn't evaporate immediately. Most systems keep all recently deleted photos and videos around for at least 30 days before permanent deletion, unless you manually empty the trash or deleted-items folder.
If you have photos you want to preserve and don't use online backup, export copies to a computer via email, Android Quick Share, Apple's AirDrop or another transfer method. (And be sure you have a backup system in place for your computer.)
Take Suggestions
Need more help? Apple's support site has tips, and the iPhone Storage screen offers recommendations for purging old files and apps. Samsung's site has ideas for Galaxy owners. In the user account settings, Google Photos has Free Up Space and Manage Storage tools that list files to review and delete.
Suggestions typically include relocating your photos from the phone to an online server or to an external SD memory card if your phone has a card slot, which lets you regain the space on your phone when you offload the files.
Apple's iCloud for Photos, Google Photos, Samsung Cloud or a service like Dropbox frees up space because the device is not physically storing the files, even though you can see the images on it. You get a complimentary amount of space to start, but must pay for more once you fill it.
When you delete a backed-up or synced photo -- on an iPhone, in Google Photos or wherever -- it disappears on all the devices connected to that account.
Get Sorted
After cleaning the photo library, you can further organize it. For years, Android and iOS have been automatically grouping images together into albums based on who's in them, where they were taken and other factors, but you can also create your own collections.
To move pictures into your own albums in Google Photos, Samsung's Gallery app or Apple's Photos, tap the option for a new album, name it and select the pictures you want to add to it. Apple's Photos can also create folders and then make separate albums inside those folders for grouping similar albums together.
Yes, it takes time to declutter your device, but you'll be able to find your pictures faster when you want to show them off and have room to install more stuff.
Photograph The Duplicates tool in Apple's Photos app, left, and the Clean option in Google's Files app for Android each offer easy ways to sort through and get rid of extra copies of files.; The Storage area of the system settings on your device reveals which apps and files are taking up more room -- and can serve as a sort of cleaning checklist.; Manually reviewing and deleting photos you don't want anymore -- either one by one or in a group -- gives you the chance to visually confirm your streamlining decisions.

In a Catholic Stronghold, Drag Goes Mainstream: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For many performers, drag is not only a cultural phenomenon, but also a political statement promoting social justice and gay rights.
Before he put on the glittery neon yellow tasseled jumpsuit, donned the yellow wig, and lip synced and danced onstage under colorful spotlights, Paul Hidacan went through his preshow routine in a busy dressing room. He pulled out a small white Bible from his bag, sat down and read a verse.
"I grew up in my church," said Mr. Hidacan, 21, who has attended service in cropped tops, skirts and boots, and started performing in drag last year. "I know there are some who raise their brows when they see me, but the pastors accept me."
In many places in the Philippines, drag is becoming more mainstream, and more popular. It is no longer confined to comedy bars, gay pageants and L.G.B.T.Q. spaces. New clubs devoted to drag are opening. Drag queens are on fashion magazine covers, and are pitching name-brand products like MAC Cosmetics, Shell gasoline, Durex condoms and Samsung phones. Students of at least one public university recently held a drag competition.
The new visibility of the art form has come largely because of changing mores around religion and gender, as well as the runaway success of the global TV franchise "RuPaul's Drag Race."
But for many performers, drag is not only a cultural phenomenon, but also a political statement promoting social justice and gay rights that they hope will transform Philippines society even more.
The Philippines is one of the biggest majority-Christian nations in the world. Roughly 80 percent of its population is Roman Catholic, and abortion is a crime. It is one of only two countries in the world where divorce remains illegal. Homosexuality is not illegal here, as it is in many other nations in the region, but there are few legal protections for gay Filipinos. Same-sex unions are not allowed.
Yet, expressions of gay identity are more welcome in the Philippines than in many other Asian nations. And surveys show that support for the gay minority is rising.
"What we are seeing is a transformation of what it means to be Catholic or Christian for the youth, who are looking for authenticity," said Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist of religion at the Ateneo de Manila University. "Sometimes they find this outside the institution or traditional practices."
Still, the church remains influential. More than two decades after a bill that would bar discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people was introduced, it remains stuck in the Philippines' Congress. There are laws protecting the rights of other groups, like women, children and Indigenous people.
Mr. Hidacan grew up in a religious family and was told to "control his gayness." But he defied these calls and pushed ahead into drag with a persona he calls Zymba Ding. The moniker is a play on Simba, the "Lion King" character, and the Filipino word bading, which means gay.
"Zymba is not my alter ego," Mr. Hidacan said. "She is an extension, a revelation of what Paul can do without religious restrictions," he added, referring to himself.
Mr. Hidacan is part of a new generation of drag artists. Like him, many of them are gay men in their teens or early 20s and are known as baby queens.
Timmy Flores, 19, started performing as Abigaile four years ago when he was a student at a Catholic high school. Like many artists working during the pandemic, he livestreamed his performances on Facebook, and the audience offered tips. Mr. Flores, who is gay, kept performing despite the opposition of his family members who wanted him to undergo conversion therapy.
"Drag is not just entertainment," he said, while fixing another artist's long blonde wig before a show at the Rampa Drag Club in Quezon City. "The mere fact that a man dresses as a woman in public is already a form of defiance."
A few performers, like Samantha Palambiano, are straight women. "Drag is an art form and a means of self-expression," said Ms. Palambiano, who performs as Kieffy Nicole. "Drag is genderless."
It is also a thriving business.
"There's a really big market for drag now," said Loui Gene Cabel, an owner of the Rampa Drag Club, which opened in January. "Straight females are now the main audience."
He added: "Before, drag performances were just intermission numbers. Now people go to clubs for them."
The rising popularity of drag has already helped changed some opinions. The siblings of the gay male artist who has performed as Arizona Brandy for a decade did not approve of drag. Her sister, at one point, gathered pastors to pray over her and convert her. But after Ms. Brandy reached the final round of the second season of "Drag Race Philippines" last year, her brother started supporting her.
"The Philippines is slowly moving forward," said Ms. Brandy, whose legal name is Genesis Vijandre. "Drag isn't limited by gender identity -- both for performers and the audiences."
Many in the Philippines were enthralled by the run of Marina Summers, a prominent Filipino drag queen, in the second season of "RuPaul's Drag Race: UK vs The World." Throngs of people queued outside the theater where she held a viewing party and show in March.
"Drag queens are excellent performers," said Imelda Del Carmen, 56, a fan of Ms. Summers. "They make people happy."
Drag performers do face some risks.
Amadeus Fernando Pagento, whose drag name is Pura Luka Vega, has been arrested twice and faces criminal charges of indecency and immorality for portraying Jesus Christ and performing a version of the Lord's Prayer in drag.
The case exposes the tension between the evolving views and entrenched legacies, said Athena Charanne Presto, who teaches sociology at the University of the Philippines.
"While more globally oriented younger generations may drive liberalization, the church's influence remains," Ms. Presto said.
But, she said, "many Filipinos find a way to reconcile faith and support for diverse identities."
In Tago, a rural town in the southern province of Surigao del Sur, Leord Abaro, 16, recently discovered drag through YouTube. Soon after, he started buying makeup and learning how to tuck his genitals.
His first performance in drag, as Macchaia Ra, came in February, in the middle of his small school that lies in the middle of a valley. He donned a waist-length wig and lip synced to the Taylor Swift song "Blank Space." In an interview a few weeks later, he said, "It's just the start for me."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Created by alumni from Meta and Google, Mistral is just a year old and has already raised more than $ 1 billion in total from investors, leading to eye-popping valuations.
Mistral, a French artificial intelligence start-up, said on Tuesday that it had raised 600 million euros, or about $ 640 million, from investors, a sign of robust interest in a company seen as Europe's most promising rival to OpenAI and other Silicon Valley A.I. developers.
Mistral is now valued at €5.8 billion, according to a person familiar with the investment, an eye-popping sum for a company founded just one year ago by alumni from Meta and Google. The company's valuation has roughly tripled since December, when it raised €385 million.
Investors in the latest round included the venture capital firms General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as Nvidia, Samsung, Salesforce, Cisco, IBM and BNP Paribas.
Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have poured money into generative A.I. technology, which can answer questions in humanlike prose, create images and write software code. Two weeks ago, Elon Musk raised $ 6 billion for his start-up, xAI. OpenAI has raised roughly $ 13 billion from Microsoft, while another California start-up, Anthropic, has raised more than $ 7.3 billion.
Mistral has positioned itself as a European alternative to the larger American tech giants and boasts that its products, like the chatbot Le Chat, are strong in a wider range of languages, including English. In contrast to firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, Mistral subscribes to the view that A.I. software should be open source, meaning that the programming codes should be available for anyone to download, copy, tweak and repurpose. Meta has also made its A.I. code open source.
In a sign of A.I.'s growing geopolitical significance, President Emmanuel Macron and others in the French government have given the company their full-throated support. Mr. Macron has called Mistral a sign of "French genius" and invited the company's chief executive, Arthur Mensch, to dinner at the presidential palace.
On Tuesday, Mr. Mensch said in a statement that the latest investment would help keep the company independent and fuel its expansion.

The Crash of the Galactic Starcruiser: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jenny Nicholson's granular critique of Disney's Galactic Starcruiser experience reflects the fraught relationship between studios and fans right now.
One of the most captivating pieces of entertainment I've seen so far this year is a four-hour-long YouTube video in which one woman describes her stay at a Disney World hotel. I'm as shocked by this as anyone.
To be clear: I was initially resistant when my partner encouraged me to watch Jenny Nicholson's epic "The Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel," which breaks down in microscopic detail her visit to Disney's Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. During the experience, now closed, guests on vacation were encouraged to live out their George Lucas dreams by participating in a role-playing game while staying in a structure on the outskirts of the park near Orlando, Fla.
Nicholson's monologue, which runs longer than "Lawrence of Arabia," has been viewed more than seven million times since it was uploaded last month and has been the talk of social media, yet I was still unprepared for how absolutely riveting it was. While it highlights a litany of problems with the hotel itself, the video can also be viewed as a diagnosis of the entertainment industry's current ills writ large. In her frustration, Nicholson becomes a valiant truth teller, clearly articulating how corporate greed betrays loyal fans to sell a cheaper and less emotionally enriching product. And she does this against a backdrop of stuffed animals and while wearing various costumes, including, at one point, a giant suit resembling a Porg, the puffin-like creature in "The Last Jedi."
Nicholson is a great storyteller, even in Twi'lek head-tails and a Rodian beanie. She lands somewhere between a friend letting you in on some great gossip and a Homerian poet of 21st-century pop culture, engaging in the oral traditions of the ancients, only the subject is theme parks and "Star Wars."
Here's the very abridged version of what she's talking about: In 2022, Disney opened the Galactic Starcruiser, billed as a "two-night adventure." (Think: A cruise, but on land.) Guests would spend their days and nights inside a largely windowless hotel built to look like a spaceship, and actors would engage them in a story in which the Resistance battles the First Order for control of the vessel. As Stormtroopers and aliens roamed the halls, the visitors would play games immersing them in the world via an app on their phones.
Nicholson spent upward of $ 6,000 for a two-person stay. What did she get for that exorbitant fee? Well, for starters, a tiny room. (The "Star Wars" locale her footage most reminded me of was the prison in the TV series "Andor.") Besides that, very little. She was barely able to crack the role-playing element. And, in a particular indignity, she was seated behind a pole during a dinner show and unable to see the alien singer Gaya. Nicholson repeatedly returns to the pole as an example of the poor design of the space, but also because it just seems to become an incredible symbol of how wrong her stay went.
Watching her explain it is a strange combination of delightful and enraging. She's got a charming knack for quippy asides, and her complaints are so well-documented that they never seem unreasonable. You feel for Nicholson because she clearly wanted to have fun. Despite her frustration with the Starcruiser, she bought merch. She dressed up. She even tried to invent a persona for herself when interacting with the cast. None of it worked.
Nicholson is nerdier than most, but she's also representative of a pure kind of fandom. She adores Disney and "Star Wars," and her complaints come from a place of true disappointment. That's why she can so effectively call out manipulation when she sees it. She is not an influencer paid to shill Disney's wares, and in one of the video's most viral moments she explains how you can spot someone who is, based on whether they use the convoluted official names for products. For instance, a paid influencer might say Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge instead of Star Wars Land. If you've spent any time on social media, you'll stop to consider how many times you've been sold a bill of goods by a TikTok or an Instagram Reel.
What also struck me about the video was how Nicholson's criticisms held true in other mediums. Too frequently corporations like Disney are asking audiences to accept whatever they are given no matter the quality. A critic might roll her eyes at the nonstop influx of projects based on pre-existing intellectual property -- and often I do -- but there's a reason studios keep going to that well: Fans. You can dismiss fandom as being blind to quality, but Nicholson proves that's not actually true. Putting out a lesser, cheaper product can mean taking advantage of what is often genuine love. Sometimes the quiet part is even said out loud: A recent trailer for "Deadpool & Wolverine" featured a QR code leading to a video of the Marvel star Ryan Reynolds telling "excited" fans that the movie is "as paper-thin as a sequel to 'Battlefield Earth."'
Nicholson argues that instead of making the Starcruiser the unique experience Disney promised, the company cut corners, betraying those who paid exorbitantly for what they assumed would be transportive. She also highlights how, when Disney decided to shut down the Starcruiser in September 2023, the enthusiastic cast members were the ones who probably paid the heaviest personal price.
Because it's both consumers and laborers who suffer. Take, for instance, a recent Bloomberg report revealing that Pixar is turning away from movies driven by the personal stories of directors and thinking more about spinoffs and sequels, even though the studio's biggest recent bomb, "Lightyear," was just that. And at Marvel, where fan commitment to the franchise has been stretched thin in recent years by consistently lesser quality films and television shows, overworked visual effects artists voted last year to unionize. "I grew up dreaming of working on Marvel films," one coordinator said in a statement, "so when I started my first job at Marvel, I felt like I couldn't complain about the unpaid overtime, the lack of meal breaks and the incredible pressure put on VFX teams to meet deadlines because I was just supposed to be grateful to be here at all." "Grateful to be here" is what it seems Disney expected Nicholson and other customers to say, too.
This mentality is evident in the glut of streaming television shows -- too many to watch, only some of them worthwhile -- and the number of superlong albums and alternate "versions" that musicians release to game the charts. If you're a Taylor Swift fan, for instance, you might buy minimally different "special" editions of her latest out of the need to be a completist.
Nicholson is so compelling because her righteous indignation is less about her personal financial loss and more about how devotees like her have been taken advantage of simply because they want to escape into a magical world. Call that desire silly, but that's what Disney promises time and time again whether that be in theme parks or onscreen. Fans like Nicholson take their passion for this material seriously. What she wants is that care to be reciprocated.
The great irony is that Nicholson herself produced what Disney couldn't: a comprehensive, entrancing experience that held my attention.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Apple, a latecomer to artificial intelligence, has struck a deal with OpenAI and developed tools to improve its Siri voice assistant, which it is set to showcase on Monday.
Each June, Apple unveils its newest software features for the iPhone at its futuristic Silicon Valley campus. But at its annual developer conference on Monday, the company will shine a spotlight on a feature that isn't new: Siri, its talking assistant, which has been around for more than a decade.
What will be different this time is the technology powering Siri: generative artificial intelligence.
In recent months, Adrian Perica, Apple's vice president of corporate development, has helped spearhead an effort to bring generative A.I. to the masses, said two people with knowledge of the work, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the effort.
Mr. Perica and his colleagues have talked with leading A.I. companies, including Google and OpenAI, seeking a partner to help Apple deliver generative A.I. across its business. Apple recently struck a deal with OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, to fold its technology into the iPhone, two people familiar with the agreement said. It was still in talks with Google as of last week, two people familiar with the conversations said.
That has helped lead to a more conversational and versatile version of Siri, which will be shown on Monday, three people familiar with the company said. Siri will be powered by a generative A.I. system developed by Apple, which will allow the talking assistant to chat rather than just respond to one question at a time. Apple will market its new A.I. capabilities as Apple Intelligence, a person familiar with the marketing plan said.
Apple, OpenAI and Google declined to comment. Apple's agreement with OpenAI was previously reported by The Information and Bloomberg, which also reported the name for Apple's A.I. system.
Apple's move into generative A.I. will test whether the company can once again enter a new market and redefine it. While Apple didn't make the first digital music player, smartphone or smartwatch, it transformed those categories with the iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch. Now, after two years of watching Microsoft, Meta, Google and Samsung integrate generative A.I. into products, Apple is going from observer to potential challenger.
Weaving generative A.I. into iPhones is also set to be a key moment for the technology, which can answer questions, create images and write software code. Apple will broaden generative A.I.'s reach to more than a billion users and determine how useful it is for everyday iPhone customers.
To date, the technology's promise has been undercut by its flaws. Google has introduced and pared back generative A.I. search abilities that recommended people eat rocks, while Microsoft has been criticized for the security vulnerabilities of a personal computer that uses A.I. to record every second of activity.
"We're still figuring A.I. out because it's so complicated," said Carolina Milanesi, president of Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. "Apple is pretty conservative when it comes to everything, so I don't know that they will 'wow' people. But they have to do this because it will be how we interact with technology going forward."
Wall Street investors, and not Main Street consumers, are a major reason Apple is jumping into A.I. The technology has lifted the values of Microsoft, a big player in generative A.I., and Nvidia, which sells A.I. chips. In January, Microsoft dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable public tech company.
The market reshuffle happened as Apple stayed silent about A.I. The company has a policy of not sharing future product plans, but as its stock position dropped, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, broke protocol and told Wall Street analysts in a call in May that it would soon introduce generative A.I. offerings.
Apple's share price has rebounded since Mr. Cook made that commitment. As of Friday, Apple's stock had risen 6 percent this year, less than Microsoft's 14 percent increase and Nvidia's 151 percent jump.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft over usage of copyrighted articles related to A.I. systems.)
Apple has long been under pressure to revamp Siri, which wowed people when it was released in 2011 but then did not change much over time. The talking assistant's shortfalls were eventually featured by the comedian Larry David during the final season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" in a scene where he yelled at Siri as it repeatedly provided the wrong directions.
Enter OpenAI, which has positioned itself at the forefront of the generative A.I. movement with ChatGPT. Apple plans to complement what OpenAI offers with technology that it developed in-house to do select iPhone tasks. Its system will help Siri set timers, create calendar appointments and summarize text messages.
The company also plans to promote its revamped Siri as more private than rival A.I. services because it will process many requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers. Apple's privacy focus proved to be a sticking point during negotiations with OpenAI and Google because it wanted to limit what iPhone data partners received, a person familiar with the negotiations said.
It's possible that Apple may look to offer the improved Siri as a service, analysts said. By charging $ 5 a month for people to use the talking assistant, the company could generate $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion in annual sales, according to Morgan Stanley.
Though it has been late to the generative A.I. race, Apple has pursued the idea of a digital personal assistant for about 40 years.
In 1987, it released a concept video showing a professor speaking to an assistant called the Knowledge Navigator, which could manage his calendar and pull up his lecture notes. The video helped inspire a group of A.I. researchers at SRI International, an independent research laboratory, to create a virtual assistant called Siri in 2008.
In 2010, Apple bought the technology for $ 200 million. The company released Siri a year later on the iPhone, demonstrating its ability to provide the time in Paris or pull up a list of 14 Greek restaurants.
"We set in motion a user-interface paradigm that no one has really improved upon," said Tom Gruber, a Siri co-founder who worked at Apple until 2018. "But we still don't have a personal A.I. -- an assistant that knows my life. With generative A.I., it's feasible now."

SAN FRANCISCO — Each June, Apple unveils its newest software features for the iPhone at its futuristic Silicon Valley campus.

Apple’s privacy focus proved to be a sticking point during negotiations with OpenAI and Google because it wanted to limit what iPhone data partners received, a person familiar with the negotiations said.
It’s possible that Apple may look to offer the improved Siri as a service, analysts said. By charging $5 a month for people to use the talking assistant, the company could generate $4 billion to $8 billion in annual sales, according to Morgan Stanley.
Though it has been late to the generative AI race, Apple has pursued the idea of a digital personal assistant for about 40 years.
In 1987, it released a concept video showing a professor speaking to an assistant called the Knowledge Navigator, which could manage his calendar and pull up his lecture notes. The video helped inspire a group of AI researchers at SRI International, an independent research laboratory, to create a virtual assistant called Siri in 2008.
In 2010, Apple bought the technology for $200 million. The company released Siri a year later on the iPhone, demonstrating its ability to provide the time in Paris or pull up a list of 14 Greek restaurants.
“We set in motion a user-interface paradigm that no one has really improved upon,” said Tom Gruber, a Siri co-founder who worked at Apple until 2018. “But we still don’t have a personal AI — an assistant that knows my life. With generative AI, it’s feasible now.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The South Korean tech giant is at odds with some of its employees as it is trying to reassure investors that its memory chip business can meet demand.
For the first time, workers at Samsung, the conglomerate that dominates the South Korean economy, went on strike on Friday.
The action comes as Samsung Electronics fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in the advanced artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping longstanding rivalries among global technology companies.
Workers in Samsung's chip division were expected to make up the majority of those who will not report to work on Friday for a planned one-day strike. Union representatives said that multiple rounds of negotiations over wage increases and bonuses had broken down.
"The company doesn't value the union as a negotiating partner," said Lee Hyun Kuk, the vice president of the Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union, the largest among five labor groups at the company. It says that it represents 28,000 members, about one-fifth of Samsung's global work force, and that nearly 75 percent voted in favor of a strike in April.
Mr. Lee said that union workers received no bonuses last year, while some had gotten bonuses of as much as 30 percent of their salaries in the past. "It feels like we've taken a 30 percent pay cut," he said. The average union worker earned about 80 million won last year, or around $ 60,000, before incentives, he said.
A Samsung Electronics representative said the company was trying to reach an agreement with the union but declined to comment further on the details of the negotiations.
The work stoppage had not affected Samsung's production or business activities, the company representative said. It was timed to fall between a national holiday and the weekend, on a day that many people in South Korea planned to take as vacation. It was not clear how many workers participated in the action. A small group of workers gathered in front of Samsung's headquarters in Seoul on Friday morning while organizers played protest songs over loudspeakers.
Still, it was awkward timing for the company, which has been trying to reassure clients and investors that its chip business can meet the demands of the artificial intelligence boom.
"Samsung has been a highly respected company in the memory semiconductor sector, they've been the leader for decades. But they lost the technology leadership to competitors," said Nam Hyung Kim, an analyst at the equity research firm Arete Research. "The union strike is nothing compared to a lot of the issues they are facing at this point," Mr. Kim said.
While so-called logic chips make computers run, memory chips let them store information. They are in everything from smartphones to refrigerators. Advanced computers use many of both types of chips, and generative artificial intelligence systems rely on extra-strength, high-bandwidth memory chips to create text, images and other kinds of content on demand.
Samsung has been the world's largest maker of memory chips for years, and reported about $ 1.4 billion in profit from its chip division in the first quarter of this year.
But that followed four straight quarters of losses. Samsung ended last year with its weakest earnings in more than a decade.
Despite the losses, Samsung remained the world's biggest memory chip maker by revenue and market share last year, according to TrendForce, a market research firm. But heading into the year, its local rival, SK Hynix, claimed the top spot in the market for the next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips just as demand for them took off. Companies developing artificial intelligence systems like Nvidia scrambled to buy them. Analysts say that SK Hynix anticipated this demand earlier than Samsung did. Samsung's foundry business, which makes chips designed by other companies, also lags behind rivals.
The result was the largest shortfall in the company's history, according to remarks Jun Young-hyun made to his colleagues when he took over the leadership of Samsung's chip division last month after an executive shake-up.
Mr. Jun previously led Samsung's chip business when it overtook Intel as the world's largest chip maker by revenue. And he ran its battery arm after the company discontinued a line of smartphones after several had spontaneously exploded.
A representative from Samsung said the company expected to increase its output of high-bandwidth memory products threefold over last year, and to double that again in 2025. The company said that it planned to invest about $ 200 billion by 2042 in a new semiconductor industrial complex south of Seoul that was being developed by the government, and that it planned to spend $ 40 billion on facilities in Texas.
This time, Mr. Jun's quest for a comeback comes as Samsung tries to move on from years of uncertainty while its top executive, Lee Jae-yong, was ensnared in a corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye.
Mr. Lee, South Korea's wealthiest person, according to Bloomberg News, is a scion of the family that founded Samsung, the largest of the family-run conglomerates known as chaebol that have transformed South Korea into an export superpower and influence nearly every facet of society.
In February, he was acquitted of additional charges related to a merger that helped him secure control over the company. Mr. Lee's legal trouble has kept Samsung's influence over South Korea's economy and politics in the spotlight.
Samsung was founded in 1938 by Mr. Lee's grandfather Lee Byung-chul as a shop selling vegetables and dried fish. It quickly expanded and set up Samsung Electronics in 1969 to manufacture televisions and refrigerators and, soon after, semiconductors.
Labor strikes in South Korea are not uncommon. Since February, over 10,000 young doctors walked off the job in protest of government plans to increase the number of admitted medical students. Last spring thousands of construction workers rallied over discontent with the president's labor policies.
For decades, Samsung was known for its aversion to organized labor, and unions have organized workers at the company only in the last several years.
Mr. Lee, the union representative, said that some employees had expressed fear about joining the union.
"Our goal on Friday isn't to affect the production line, but rather to send a message to the management that we have reached a certain level of maturation," Mr. Lee said.
After the vote in April, the union held multiple rallies. In a bid to appeal to the public for support, it planned the events to feel like a street festival and arranged for K-pop singers to entertain the crowd.
Since last week, when the union announced the strike day, a bus draped with a banner bearing the union's protest slogan -- "Labor oppression, union oppression, we won't take it anymore!" -- has been parked in front of Samsung's offices near Seoul's fashionable Gangnam district.
Workers agreed to collectively take the day off and then return to work but are prepared to take additional days in the future if they cannot come to an agreement with the company, Mr. Lee said.

Inside the Spectacular Flop Of a Bold A.I. Device: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Days before gadget reviewers weighed in on the Humane Ai Pin, a futuristic wearable device powered by artificial intelligence, the founders of the company gathered their employees and encouraged them to brace themselves. The reviews might be disappointing, they warned.
Humane's founders, Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, were right. In April, reviewers brutally panned the new $ 699 product, which Humane had marketed for a year with ads and at glitzy events like Paris Fashion Week. The Ai Pin was "totally broken" and had "glaring flaws," some reviewers said. One declared it "the worst product I've ever reviewed."
About a week after the reviews came out, Humane started talking to HP, the computer and printer company, about selling itself for more than $ 1 billion, three people with knowledge of the conversations said. Other potential buyers have emerged, though talks have been casual and no formal sales process has begun.
Humane retained Tidal Partners, an investment bank, to help navigate the discussions while also managing a new funding round that would value it at $ 1.1 billion, three people with knowledge of the plans said.
The developments amount to a face-plant by Humane, which had positioned itself as a top contender among a wave of A.I. hardware makers. The San Francisco company had raised $ 240 million from powerful Silicon Valley investors, including Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, and Marc Benioff, Salesforce's chief executive, who valued the start-up at $ 1 billion based on its enormous ambition and promise. Humane spent five years building a device to disrupt the smartphone -- only to flounder.
As of early April, Humane had received around 10,000 orders for the Ai Pin, a small fraction of the 100,000 that it hoped to sell this year, two people familiar with its sales said. In recent months, the company has also grappled with employee departures and changed a return policy to address canceled orders. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using the Ai Pin charging case because of a fire risk associated with its battery.
Its setbacks are part of a pattern of stumbles across the world of generative A.I., as companies release unpolished products. Over the past two years, Google has introduced and pared back A.I. search abilities that recommended people eat rocks, Microsoft has trumpeted a Bing chatbot that hallucinated and Samsung has added A.I. features to a smartphone that were called "excellent at times and baffling at others."
In an interview, Ms. Bongiorno and Mr. Chaudhri, who are married, declined to comment on a possible sale or fund-raising for Humane. They said their ambitions for the Ai Pin had not changed, but they acknowledged that there was a difference between testing a device and actually using it.
"You don't know everything before you launch," Ms. Bongiorno said. Given the product reviews, Mr. Chaudhri said, they "definitely wish that we were able to resolve some of those things a little bit differently."
HP didn't respond to requests for comment.
This account of Humane is based on interviews with 23 current and former employees, advisers and investors, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter or feared retaliation. Bloomberg earlier reported on the start-up's potential sale.
Many current and former employees said Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno preferred positivity over criticism, leading them to disregard warnings about the Ai Pin's poor battery life and power consumption. A senior software engineer was dismissed after raising questions about the product, they said, while others left out of frustration.
Mr. Chaudhri said his company, which had 250 employees at its peak, encouraged workers to offer feedback. The departures were a natural consequence of transitioning from creating a new device to sustaining it after its release, which he said appealed to "a different type of person."
Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno, who both worked at Apple, started Humane in 2019. They set out to create a lapel pin that clips to clothing with a magnet. The device gives users access to an A.I.-powered virtual assistant that can send messages, search the web or take photos. It is complemented by a laser that projects text onto the palm of a user's hand for tasks like skipping a song while playing music. It also has a camera, a speaker and cellular service.
From the beginning, current and former employees said, the Ai Pin had issues, which reviewers later picked apart.
One was the device's laser display, which consumed tremendous power and would cause the pin to overheat. Before showing the gadget to prospective partners and investors, Humane executives often chilled it on ice packs so it would last longer, three people familiar with the demonstrations said. Those employees said such measures could be common early in a product development cycle.
When employees expressed concerns about the heat, they said, Humane's founders replied that software improvements reducing power use would fix it. Mr. Chaudhri, who led design, wanted to keep the gadget's sleek design, three people said.
The device's battery was not big enough to last long. Test units ran out of power within hours, current and former employees said. Humane decided to provide customers with a backup battery and charging case, which increased the product's price more than $ 100, two employees said.
The problems contributed to Humane's pushing back the date when it would ship the device to April from October, employees said.
Some employees tried persuading the founders not to launch the Ai Pin because it wasn't ready, three people said. Others repeatedly asked them to hire a head of marketing. The role remained vacant before the product's release.
In October, Time magazine named the Ai Pin one of the best inventions of 2023. The next month, Humane revealed the product's details, promoting it in commercials.
But orders were slower than expected, three people said, leading Humane to reduce plans to produce more of the devices. Ms. Bongiorno declined to comment on sales.
In January, Humane laid off about 10 employees. A month later, a senior software engineer was let go after she questioned whether the Ai Pin would be ready by April. In a company meeting after the dismissal, Mr. Chaudhri said the employee had violated policy by talking negatively about Humane, two attendees said.
Ms. Bongiorno said the company couldn't comment on individual employees.
The founders said they had spoken with several reviewers as they evaluated the device and responded to questions about their experiences, which included concerns about the Ai Pin's temperature and inaccurate responses to some requests.
On April 11, reviews in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Verge blasted the Ai Pin's shortcomings. Marques Brownlee, a tech reviewer on YouTube with 19 million subscribers, headlined his review "The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed ... for Now."
After the reviews, Ms. Bongiorno said, "we pulled the team together and we said: 'OK, look, this is going to be painful. We're going to have to lean into painful feedback."'
Ms. Bongiorno and Mr. Chaudhri said Humane had since worked on the device's issues. The start-up has added more voice navigation options to the device, as well as sound effects, to make it easier to use. The updates include integrating OpenAI's newest chatbot system, GPT-4o, and one that is set to improve battery life by 25 percent and cut the device's response time to two seconds.
Those updates have addressed the questions raised by reviewers, the founders said. Ms. Bongiorno referred to the reviews and feedback as "a gift that we've been given."
Businesses are interested in the device, she added. Within 48 hours of its launch, more than 1,000 companies -- including in retail, medicine and education -- reached out to discuss potentially working together or building software for the pin, Ms. Bongiorno said.
Humane also signed wireless carrier deals to expand the Ai Pin to South Korea and Japan.
Some discussions, including with HP, turned into talks about a potential sale, as well as licensing Humane's technology, three people with knowledge of the situation said. The conversations led Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno to hire Tidal Partners, an investment bank that had advised Cisco on its recent $ 28 billion acquisition of the cybersecurity business Splunk.
Those talks have continued as Humane dealt with its discovery that a battery supplier had provided components that could pose a fire risk. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using their charging case accessory while it worked to find a new vendor.
Humane had enough money to release its device, people close to the company said, but was trying to raise more.
"We just want to build," Ms. Bongiorno said.
Mr. Chaudhri added, "We have to look at how best we fund that."

SAN FRANCISCO — Days before gadget reviewers weighed in on the Humane Ai Pin, a futuristic wearable device powered by artificial intelligence, the founders of the company gathered their employees and encouraged them to brace themselves. The reviews might be disappointing, they warned.

Full text: Stock markets in Mumbai have surged as big global investors hope India can become a source of growth. It won't be so easy.
Mumbai, India's financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff.
A postpandemic boom has pushed the value of India's stock market to about $ 5 trillion, putting it neck and neck with Hong Kong's. India's economy is among the fastest growing in the world. Wall Street can't ignore India anymore.
The point of entry is Mumbai, a port city of 26 million people, counting its suburbs. Mumbai has been given a makeover: Suspension bridges span its seaways, as well as its infamous slums, and new metro lines have been carved beneath its Art Deco and Indo-Saracenic facades and rumbling commuter railways.
Mumbai has been India's commercial hub for eight decades, but it was relatively unfamiliar to global finance until the past two years.
Now North American pension managers, sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf and Singapore, Japanese banks and private equity firms are clamoring for a piece of India's growth. Old hands and novices alike can rattle off reasons India's rise is inevitable.
Making money will be easier said than done, not least because Indian investors got here first. Compared with Indian companies' current profits, their stock prices are high.
Foreign investors have yet to throw in their full financial weight. Mumbai's markets were jittery in May, as Narendra Modi, the pro-business prime minister, fought for re-election. He is expected to win, but uncertainties have made far-flung investors feel cautious.
Despite all the hot money pouring into the Mumbai markets, India remains a tricky place for foreign companies to navigate, making direct investment risky. Demand for spending by India's potentially vast base of consumers has been lagging expectations -- the top of the income ladder is spending more than ever, while hundreds of millions of people are stuck near the bottom.
The simple reason for investors' enthusiasm is India's economy, which has strengths other big emerging economies are currently lacking. Foreign clients, an Indian bank executive said, "gravitate to India because it is showing reliable growth, its currency is stable, it's showing fiscal discipline." He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he works closely with the government.
If India looks better to global investors, China and Russia look worse. China's miraculous growth engine is sputtering, after three decades at full throttle, with threats of trade wars becoming routine. And Russia was effectively crossed off some lists of viable emerging economies after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the sanctions imposed on it by the United States, Europe and their allies.
That is one reason, the banker said, investors pushed Wall Street to make it easier to bet big sums of money on India.
The MSCI, an influential stock index of emerging markets started by Morgan Stanley, has increased India's weighting to more than 18 percent, from 8 percent in 2020, while reducing China's representation. It's not just stocks: In June, JPMorgan Chase will add Indian government bonds to its emerging-markets index. Both changes mean that mutual funds are buying more Indian financial assets.
Aashish Agarwal, India country head for the investment bank Jefferies, has been doing deals in Mumbai for more than 20 years. He said the case for investing in India was a no-brainer: Indian stocks are outperforming China's. India's markets also draw on a wider range of companies than many other emerging economies, he said.
"You can't think of Korea without Samsung, or Latin America without commodities," Mr. Agarwal said. "India, as an index, is arguably the most balanced you might find outside of the U.S."
The view looks equally sunny to Kevin Carter from Lafayette, Calif. He founded an investment firm, called EMQQ Global, that sells exchange-traded funds, which make it easy for ordinary people to invest in emerging markets. The value of one fund that focuses on India's internet and e-commerce sectors has grown nearly 40 percent in the past year.
India, he said, has the makings of what historically has helped emerging markets to succeed: a large population, especially of young people, and economic growth that is causing people to spend more.
With 1.4 billion people and counting, India is the world's most populous country. Most Indians are working age or will be soon, unlike residents of Europe or East Asia. India's economic growth rate, which hovered around 7 percent for the past couple of years, has compared favorably with a world average of 3.2 percent.
On Friday, on the eve of the election's last day, India's central bank delivered a happy surprise. Growth in the most recent quarter was even higher than economists expected, giving the past fiscal year an official rate of 8.2 percent.
Still, for some investors, there is an air of déjà vu. They remember a time almost 15 years ago when India was last thought to be ready to overtake China's rate of economic growth.
Those who bought the India hype then ended up disappointed. From 2008 to 2020, China's per-capita income quadrupled while India's grew by 2.5 times. That left India poor compared with the rest of the world.
The latest calculation by the International Monetary Fund placed India at 138 in national rankings of income, between the Republic of Congo and Nicaragua. China was in 65th place. But India is moving up, a lot faster than China can.
Along the way, India is spending heavily on public infrastructure, a hallmark of Mr. Modi's policies in 10 years in office.
In Mumbai itself, there were just three skyscrapers in 2008 -- it will have sprouted hundreds by the end of this year. The city's center of gravity has shifted from its downtown to the purpose-built Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC, a midtown sprawl of concrete spaghetti. The One BKC tower, home to Bank of America and Switzerland's insurance giant Swiss Re, as well as many others, was bought by Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity group, for a reported $ 300 million in 2019.
Mumbai, of course, is also home to the stock market, which has attracted the savings of India's own rapidly expanding investor class. Banks have made it easier for middle-income Indian families to invest directly. So many newbie investors have lost money on the risky trading of derivatives -- investment securities tied to other securities -- that the regulators want to rein them back in.
A stiffer test for India's economy will be whether it can draw more foreign direct investment -- the buying up of whole chunks of private businesses by investors or companies.
Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, a joint venture between the commerce ministry and private chambers of commerce, is trying to ease the way. Ms. Rai is well positioned for the job, having spent nearly 30 years at Intel, spanning India and America.
"I am a woman, I come from tech, from a multinational," she said, "and I'm based in India. All this sends a message."
More longer-term foreign funding would help strengthen and stabilize the Indian rupee. Investors who make such financial commitments also tend to bring technical expertise.
"We may be missing on capital and, in some places, we may be missing on technology," she said.
Ms. Rai has a lofty target -- $ 100 billion in foreign direct investment. That's higher than what India drew in 2021, which was a record, and much higher than it is now. The inflow sank 16.8 percent last year to just over $ 28 billion. Foreign investment shrank in many spots around the world in 2023, but India, like China, was hit especially hard. Ms. Rai nonetheless foresees a new cycle of investment activity centered on Indian companies in health care technology, clean energy and artificial intelligence.
Mr. Modi has promised a tenfold increase in India's economy by 2047, in time for the 100th anniversary of its independence. To get there, Ms. Rai noted, the country will need an even faster rate of growth, and that means more of "these investors that we're trying to draw in."

MUMBAI, India — Mumbai, India’s financial capital, has seen a lot of new faces over the past year. The heads of global banks have been trooping through, visiting its stock exchanges, buying property and hiring new staff.

Ties Binding the U.S. and China Are Strong, but Fraying: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The prospects for future commerce, and peace, are intertwined, our columnist writes.
If you follow the news, you know that tensions between the United States and China are high and that the commercial relationship between the two biggest trading nations on the planet has been fraying.
Yet, amid the ominous headlines about a possible "decoupling" of the United States and China, you may be surprised by how strong and binding their financial ties remain.
Many big U.S. companies depend on China for a substantial part of their income and rely on Chinese suppliers and factories for their products. The two economies are closely linked, and, as an old China hand, I think that's a good thing. It implies that even if relations deteriorate further, the countries have many incentives for pulling back from the brink of serious conflict.
Consider that while the publicly traded U.S. companies in the S&P 500 obtain almost 60 percent of their revenue domestically, the biggest source of their foreign sales is China. That's according to estimates from the financial data company FactSet, which said sales from China amounted to 7.1 percent of S&P 500 revenues for the 12 months through December. The second-largest foreign source was Japan, with 2.6 percent; followed by Germany and Britain, with 2.2 percent each; and then Taiwan, with 1.8 percent.
Numbers like these are critical in assessing U.S.-China relations, Dale Copeland, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said in an interview. "Expectations of future profits are a key and often neglected factor in international relations," he said. Mr. Copeland is the author of "A World Safe for Commerce: American Foreign Policy From the Revolution to the Rise of China."
"History shows that when a major power cuts off business and resources abruptly -- so that prospects for future commerce look dim -- the possibility of war becomes much greater," he added. "Fortunately, that hasn't happened so far with the United States and China. Greater conflict, even war -- aren't inevitable. There are still plenty of opportunities for future business and, I think, that is, and should be, a deliberate part of current U.S. policy."
The Case Against China
Corporate earnings provide only one perspective on a complex issue. But they are eye-opening because they seem to fly in the face of the drumroll of conflicts and restrictions between the United States and China.
From tariffs to technology bans to concerns about TikTok, the Biden administration has been cracking down on China, which, it says, is abusing longstanding commercial relationships, subsidizing local industries directly and indirectly, obtaining U.S. intellectual property illicitly and fundamentally threatening U.S. national security. U.S. intelligence estimated that China had "the capability to directly compete with the United States and U.S. allies" and, if unopposed, could "alter the rules-based global order" in its favor.
It's an election year in the United States and the country's new China policies build on a shift that began during the Trump administration. Donald J. Trump's advisers now say that if he is re-elected, he will aim for a full "decoupling" from China, though he has been inconsistent: He recently questioned the need to require the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell the app or shut it down in the United States, but as president, he tried to force a sale.
China's reaction to recent U.S. measures has been muted. But some further response is more likely if the United States keeps pushing for an allied commercial front that aims to prevent Chinese factories from exporting torrents of low-cost goods like electric vehicles, solar panels and steel that could hurt local industries and cause domestic dislocations in many countries.
Porous Barriers
The steepest targeted tariffs -- like the new 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles -- are on goods that aren't being imported in large volumes into the United States. That means that President Biden's new tariffs wouldn't change the overall picture much, an analysis by Oxford Economics, an independent research firm, suggested.
The trade-weighted average U.S. tariff on goods from all nations was just "1.6 percent before the Trump trade wars and it rose to as much as 3.1 percent," Ryan Sweet, the chief U.S. economist at the firm, said in an email. Before Mr. Biden's latest tariffs, the average U.S. tariff was 2.7 percent, he said, and the new tariffs would "permanently add 0.14 percent to the effective tariff rate."
But the effective tariff will drop below 2.3 percent over the next decade, he projected, as businesses figure out ways of avoiding "the Trump/Biden tariff hikes." That assumes the tariff wars don't worsen.
To put that into perspective, the World Bank calculated that the worldwide average tariff was 2.6 percent in 2017, before the U.S.-China conflict began. So the United States is still not a global outlier, even if it is no longer reducing trade barriers and lowering costs for consumers. At this point, as U.S. corporate earnings reports show, there are still vast opportunities for profitable commerce between the two countries.
The Chip Wars
What I find striking is that even companies that design, manufacture and create tools for advanced silicon chips continue to receive substantial revenues from China.
Recall that in 2022, the United States began to impose export controls on such companies from countries that used U.S. technology, restricting their sales to China. At the same time, with the Chips Act, the United States began subsidizing construction of domestic semiconductor foundries, effectively replicating parallel efforts that China had begun earlier.
I spoke with Chris Miller, a historian at the Fletcher School at Tufts University who wrote "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
U.S. restrictions are calibrated so that even some advanced chips are being shipped to China, he said. "It's the chips that are critical for A.I. that the U.S. is really targeting. Others are getting through."
Nvidia, the foremost designer of the chips that make artificial intelligence possible, is prohibited from shipping its most advanced products to China. That has dented its business there. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, said in an earnings call this past week that Nvidia's business in China had declined "because of the limitations on our technology." For 2023, FactSet estimated that China was Nvidia's third-biggest market, with 16.6 percent of its total sales, behind only the United States, with 44.3 percent, and Taiwan, with 22 percent.
In fact, all of the semiconductor companies I looked at -- Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Lam Research, KLA and Tokyo Electronics -- received substantial revenue from China in 2023. China was among the companies' top three markets, and, in most cases, ranked No. 1. Intel, for example, received 26.8 percent of its revenue from China.
The case of ASML, a Dutch company, is instructive. The company makes lithography machines that are needed to etch circuits for the smallest and most cutting-edge chips. Roger Dassen, the company's chief financial officer, said in an earnings call in April that the U.S. ban could eliminate 10 to 15 percent of its China sales.
Nonetheless, he said, "We're still looking at a strong sales level for China for this year." FactSet estimated that ASML received 25.8 percent of its revenues from China in 2023. Revenue from the United States was only 11.4 percent.
Consider Apple. It's not just that China accounted for 17.8 percent of the company's revenue in 2023, second only to the United States. It's that Apple routinely ships large quantities of tiny, advanced, state-of-the-art semiconductors in and out of China. "The regulations were written to allow this to happen," Mr. Miller said.
The iPhone 15 in my pocket contains a four-nanometer chip designed by Apple in California, made in Taiwan, shipped to China for assembly and then shipped back to consumers like me in New York. The iPhone 15 Pro already uses three-nanometer chips, and Apple is preparing to incorporate even more advanced two-nanometer chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. All this technology is beyond China's commercial capability. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
This past week, China conducted military exercises in the waters around Taiwan, issuing a "stern warning" against moves toward the island's independence. China was also demonstrating that it could cut off access to the advanced silicon chips that have become the jet fuel for the world's stock markets.
The peak of globalization may have passed, but peaks come and go. Long-term trends are what matter.
It's in everyone's interest that the United States and China coexist peacefully. In their search for profit, the world's businesses are still finding ways to make that happen.

PC Makers Turning to A.I. To Reverse Years of Decline: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft, HP, Dell and others unveiled a new kind of laptop tailored to work with artificial intelligence. Analysts expect Apple to do something similar.
The race to put artificial intelligence everywhere is taking a detour through the good old laptop computer.
Microsoft on Monday introduced a new kind of computer designed for artificial intelligence. The machines, Microsoft says, will run A.I. systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.
The new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use A.I. to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read, or websites they have browsed. Their A.I. systems will also automate tasks like photo editing and language translation.
The new design will be included in Microsoft's Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.
The A.I. PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the last two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.
But A.I. stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.
Microsoft wants to run A.I. systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of A.I. systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge A.I. systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.
"We are entering a new era where computers not only understand us, but can anticipate what we want and our intents," said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
Analysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more A.I. capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.
Whether the A.I. PC takes off depends on the companies' ability to create compelling reasons for buyers to upgrade. The initial sales of these new computers, which cost more than $ 1,000, will be small, said Linn Huang, an analyst at IDC, which closely tracks the market. But by the end of the decade -- assuming A.I. tools turn out to be useful -- they will be "ubiquitous," he predicted. "Everything will be an A.I. PC."
The computer industry is looking for a jolt. Consumers have been upgrading their own computers less frequently, as the music and photos they once stored on their machines now often live online, on Spotify, Netflix or iCloud. Computer purchases by companies, schools and other institutions have finally stabilized after booming -- and then crashing -- during the pandemic.
Some high-end smartphones have already been integrating A.I. chips, but the sales have fallen short because the features "are still not sophisticated enough to catalyze a faster upgrade cycle," Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. It will be at least another year, he said, before enough meaningful breakthroughs will lead consumers to take note.
At the event, Microsoft showed new laptops with what it likened to having a photographic memory. Users can ask Copilot, Microsoft's chatbot, to use a feature called Recall to look up a file by typing a question using natural language, such as, "Can you find me a video call I had with Joe recently where he was holding an 'I Love New York' coffee mug?" The computer will then immediately be able to retrieve the file containing those details because the A.I. systems are constantly scanning what the user does on the laptop.
"It remembers things that I forget," said Matt Barlow, Microsoft's head of marketing for Surface computers, in an interview.
Microsoft said the information used for this Recall function was stored directly on the laptop for privacy, and would not be sent back to the company's servers or to be used in training future A.I. systems. Pavan Davuluri, a Microsoft executive overseeing Windows, said that with the Recall system users would also be able to opt out of sharing certain types of information, such as visits to a specific website, but that some sensitive data, such as financial information and private browsing sessions, would not be monitored by default.
Microsoft also demonstrated live transcripts that translate in real time, which it said would be available on any video that streams across a laptop's screen.
Microsoft last month released A.I. models small enough to run on a phone that it said performed almost as well as GPT-3.5, the much larger system that initially underpinned OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot when it debuted in late 2022.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Chipmakers have also made advances, like adjusting a laptop's battery life to allow for the enormous number of calculations that A.I. demands. The new computers have dedicated chips built by Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones.
Though the type of chip inside the new A.I. computers, known as a neural processing unit, specializes in handling complex A.I. tasks, such as generating images and summarizing documents, the benefits may still be unnoticeable to consumers, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University.
Most of the data processing for A.I. still has to be done on a company's servers instead of directly on the devices, so it's still important that people have a fast internet connection, he added.
But the neural processing chips also speed up other tasks, such as video editing or the ability to use a virtual background inside a video call, said Brad Linder, the editor of Liliputing, a blog that has covered computers for nearly two decades. So, even if people don't buy into the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, they may end up getting an A.I. computer for other reasons.

The West Doesn't Grasp How Much Russia Has Changed: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Vladimir Putin's trip to Beijing this week, where he will meet with Xi Jinping and top Chinese officials, is another clear demonstration of the current closeness between Russia and China.
Yet many in the West still want to believe that their alliance is an aberration, driven by Mr. Putin's emotional anti-Americanism and his toxic fixation on Ukraine. Once Mr. Putin and his dark obsessions are out of the picture, the thinking goes, Moscow will seek to rebuild ties with the West -- not least because the bonds between Russia and China are shallow, while the country has centuries of economic and cultural dependence on Europe.
This wishful view, however appealing, overlooks the transformation of Russia's economy and society. Never since the fall of the Soviet Union has Russia been so distant from Europe, and never in its entire history has it been so entwined with China. The truth is that after two years of war in Ukraine and painful Western sanctions, it's not just Mr. Putin who needs China -- Russia does, too.
China has emerged as Russia's single most important partner, providing a lifeline not only for Mr. Putin's war machine but also for the entire embattled economy. In 2023, Russia's trade with China hit a record $ 240.1 billion, up by more than 60 percent from prewar levels, as China accounted for 30 percent of Russia's exports and nearly 40 percent of its imports.
Before the war, Russia's trade with the European Union was double that with China; now it's less than half. The Chinese yuan, not the dollar or the euro, is now the main currency used for trade between the two countries, making it the most traded currency on the Moscow stock exchange and the go-to instrument for savings.
This economic dependence is filtering into everyday life. Chinese products are ubiquitous and over half of the million cars sold in Russia last year were made in China. Tellingly, the top six foreign car brands in Russia are now all Chinese, thanks to the exodus of once dominant Western companies. It's a similar story in the smartphone market, where China's Xiaomi and Tecno have eclipsed Apple and Samsung, and with home appliances and many other everyday items.
These shifts are tectonic. Even in czarist times, Russia shipped its commodities to Europe and relied on imports from the West of manufactured goods. Russia's oligarchs, blacklisted by most Western countries, have had to adapt to the new reality. Last month, the businessman Vladimir Potanin, whose fortune is estimated at $ 23.7 billion, announced that his copper and nickel empire would reorient toward China, including by moving production facilities into the country. "If we're more integrated into the Chinese economy," he said, "we'll be more protected."
From the economy, education follows. Members of the Russian elite are scrambling to find Mandarin tutors for their kids, and some of my Russian contacts are thinking about sending their children to universities in Hong Kong or mainland China now that Western universities are much harder to reach. This development is more than anecdotal. Last year, as China opened up after the pandemic, 12,000 Russian students went to study there -- nearly four times as many than to the United States.
This reorientation from West to East is also visible among the middle class, most notably in travel. There are now, for example, five flights a day connecting Moscow and Beijing in under eight hours, with a return ticket costing about $ 500. By contrast, getting to Berlin -- one of many frequent European weekend destinations for middle-class Russians before the war -- can now take an entire day and cost up to twice as much.
What's more, European cities are being replaced as Russian tourist destinations by Dubai, Baku in Azerbaijan and Istanbul, while business trips are increasingly to China, Central Asia or the Gulf. Locked out of much of the West, which scrapped direct flights to Russia and significantly reduced the availability of visas for Russians, middle-class Russians are going elsewhere.
Intellectuals are turning toward China, too. Russian scientists are beginning to work with and for Chinese companies, especially in fields such as space exploration, artificial intelligence and biotech. Chinese cultural influence is also growing inside Russia. With Western writers like Stephen King and Neil Gaiman withdrawing the rights to publish their work in Russia, publishers are expanding their rosters of Chinese works. Supported by lavish grants for translators from the Chinese government, this effort is set to bring about a boom in Chinese books.
Chinese culture will not replace Western culture as Russians' main reference point any time soon. But a profound change has taken place. From the other side of the Iron Curtain, Europe was seen as a beacon of human rights, prosperity and technological development, a space that many Soviet citizens aspired to be part of.
Now a growing number of educated Russians, on top of feeling bitterness toward Europe for its punitive sanctions, see China as a technologically advanced and economically superior power to which Russia is ever more connected. With no easy way back to normal ties with the West, that's unlikely to change anytime soon.
In his dystopian novel "Day of the Oprichnik," Vladimir Sorokin describes a deeply anti-Western Russia of 2028 that survives on Chinese technology while cosplaying the medieval brutality of Ivan the Terrible's era. With every passing day, this unsettling and foresighted novel -- published in 2006 as a warning to Russia about the direction of travel under Mr. Putin -- reads more and more like the news.

A Longevity Upgrade, Finally, for Smartphones: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google and Samsung used to update smartphone software for only three years. That has changed.
Every smartphone has an expiration date. That day arrives when the software updates stop coming and you start missing out on new apps and security protections. With most phones, this used to happen after about only three years.
But things are finally starting to change. The new number is seven.
I first noticed this shift when I reviewed Google's $ 700 Pixel 8 smartphone in October. Google told me that it had committed to provide software updates for the phone for seven years, up from three years for its previous Pixels, because it was the right thing to do.
I was skeptical that this would become a trend. But this year, Samsung, the most profitable Android phone maker, set a similar software timeline for its $ 800 Galaxy S24 smartphone. Then Google said it would do the same for its $ 500 Pixel 8A, the budget version of the Pixel 8, which arrived in stores this week.
Both companies said they had expanded their software support to make their phones last longer. This is a change from how companies used to talk about phones. Not long ago, tech giants unveiled new devices that encouraged people to upgrade every two years. But in the last few years, smartphone sales have slowed down worldwide as their improvements have become more marginal. Nowadays, people want their phones to endure.
Samsung and Google, the two most influential Android device makers, are playing catch-up with Apple, which has traditionally provided software updates for iPhones for roughly seven years. These moves will make phones last much longer and give people more flexibility to decide when it's time to upgrade.
Google said in a statement that it had expanded its software commitment for the Pixel 8A because it wanted customers to feel confident in Pixel phones. And Samsung said it would deliver seven years of software updates, which increase security and reliability, for all its Galaxy flagship phones from now on.
Here's what to know about why this is happening and what you can do to make your phone last longer.
Why is this happening?
In the past, Android phone makers said the technical process of providing software updates was very complicated, so to stay profitable, they dropped support after a few years. But tech companies are now under intense external pressure to invest in making their devices last longer.
In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would ramp up law enforcement against tech companies that made it difficult to fix and maintain their products. That accelerated the "right to repair" movement, a piece of proposed legislation that required companies to provide the parts, tools and software to extend the lives of their products. In the last few years, states including California, New York, Minnesota and Oregon have enacted such legislation.
Google announced its new commitment for smartphones after it was pressured to make a similar move for its laptops. In September, the company agreed to expand software support for its Chromebook to 10 years, up from eight years, in response to a grass-roots campaign that highlighted how short-lived Google laptops were causing budget crunches in schools.
Nathan Proctor, a director at U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit largely funded by small donors that led the Chromebook campaign, said the new standard of seven years of support for smartphones would have a profound effect.
"It's a huge win for the environment," he said. "I want to see more of it."
What else do I need to do?
Software updates are one big part of what keeps a phone working well, but there are other steps to lengthen smartphone lives, similar to maintaining a car. They include:
Replace the phone battery every two years
The lithium-ion batteries in phones have a finite life. After about two years, the amount of charge they can hold diminishes, and it's wise to replace the battery.
Replacing a smartphone battery isn't easy, so it's best to get help from a professional. To find repair shops that service Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can contact Google and Samsung on their websites. You could also look up a reputable shop nearby with a review site like Yelp or Google Reviews. It typically costs about $ 100 to replace a battery.
For iPhones, customers can schedule a battery replacement appointment at an Apple retail store through the company's website. But in my experience, repair centers at Apple Stores are a gamble.
I recently booked an appointment to replace my iPhone 14's battery at the Apple Store in Emeryville, Calif. When I arrived, the employee said the battery was out of stock, and the nearest store that carried it was a 40-minute drive away.
This was frustratingly inefficient -- the Apple site should not have let me book an appointment at a store that didn't have the battery. Apple said in a statement that when a part needed for repair was not available, a retail employee would find the nearest store to complete the repair or order the replacement part and do the repair when the part arrived.
Instead, I booked an appointment at a local repair shop.
Protect it
Smartphones are still mostly made of glass, so to make a phone last seven years, it's wise to invest in a high-quality case. A screen protector is an extra safeguard, though many won't enjoy how it distorts the picture quality of the screen. Our sister site that reviews products, Wirecutter, recommends cases from brands like Smartish, Spigen and Mujjo, or cases from the phone makers themselves.
Unless you're very accident prone, I recommend against buying extended warranties because their costs can exceed the cost of a repair.
Clean it
Smartphones have very few moving parts, so there's little we have to do to physically maintain them. But most of us neglect cleaning the parts that we rarely look at: charging ports and speaker holes.
Over time, those holes are clogged up with dirt, pocket lint and makeup. That built-up debris can make a phone take longer to charge or a phone call more difficult to hear.
"It's the belly button lint of cellphones," said Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a site that publishes instructions and sells parts to repair electronics.
Fortunately, he added, you don't need a fancy tool. Just use a toothpick to dig out the gunk.
Should this change how I buy phones?
I always recommend buying a product based on the here and now -- what it can do for you today, as opposed to what companies say it will do in the future. You should continue to buy a phone based on this principle.
Plenty of people will choose to upgrade sooner for other reasons, like getting a new feature such as a better camera or a longer-lasting battery.
But those who just want to buy a phone that lasts as long as possible should pick one that will be economical to repair when things break. Mr. Wiens said Google's Pixel phones, whose parts are affordable, fit this criterion. Owners of those phones will now have longer-lasting software to keep up with the hardware.

U.S. Awards $120 Million to Chipmaker to Expand Plant in Minnesota: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The grant is the latest federal award in a series stemming from the CHIPS and Science Act meant to ramp up domestic production of vital semiconductors.
Federal officials will provide up to $ 120 million in grants to Polar Semiconductor to help the company expand its chip manufacturing facility in Minnesota, the Biden administration announced on Monday, the latest in a string of awards meant to strengthen the U.S. supply of semiconductors.
Commerce Department officials said the grant would help Polar upgrade technology and double production capacity at its facility in Bloomington, Minn., within two years. The company produces chips that are critical for cars, defense systems and electrical grids, federal officials said.
"We are making taxpayer dollars go as far as possible while crowding in private and state investment to create jobs, secure our supply chains and bolster manufacturing in Minnesota," said Laurie Locascio, the under secretary of commerce for standards and technology.
The funding stems from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022 to ramp up the domestic production of commercial semiconductors, the tiny chips crucial for most electronics, including smartphones, computers, cars and weapons systems. The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute to companies to incentivize the construction and expansion of new plants in the United States.
Scaling up domestic chip production is a major component of President Biden's economic policy agenda, which largely focuses on bolstering American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are produced in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Biden administration officials have so far announced awards of more than $ 29 billion. Last month, the Commerce Department announced up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to Micron to help the chipmaker build plants in New York and Idaho. Other chipmakers -- including Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have received multibillion-dollar awards. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three federal awards.
The United States is trying to ramp up domestic production of semiconductors in part to prevent the kinds of expensive and economically damaging chip shortages that cropped up during the pandemic. Federal officials said Polar's award would help head off those types of disruptions.
"During the Covid-19 pandemic, shortages of these chips were among the most acute bottlenecks," Ms. Locascio said. "Because of President Biden's leadership, the future of the semiconductor industry is being built right here in the United States."
Similar to other recipients, Polar will have to meet certain milestones before getting the payments, federal officials said. The company is also planning to claim federal tax credits that help reduce the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment.
Minnesota is also providing about $ 75 million in grants to Polar's expansion project, which is expected to cost more than $ 525 million. The company's expansion will create more than 160 manufacturing and construction jobs in Minnesota, federal officials said.
The federal award will help Polar establish itself as a U.S.-owned independent foundry, which will allow the company to expand its customer base, administration officials said. So-called foundry services involve the manufacturing of chips that are designed and marketed by other companies.
Surya Iyer, the president and chief operating officer of Polar, said that the money was critical for the company's expansion and that without it, a project of this size would not be possible.
"We're talking about a small single-digit percent expansion rather than the huge effort that we're going to put in now," Mr. Iyer said.

Full text: The United States will triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, the largest increase in the world, according to a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.
Billions in federal subsidies for semiconductor manufacturers are expected to help reverse a decades-long decline in America's share of global chip manufacturing.
The United States will triple its domestic chip manufacturing capacity by 2032, the largest increase in the world, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group. As a result, America's share of world chip manufacturing is expected to rise for the first time in decades, to 14 percent by 2032, up from about 10 percent today.
The report found that much of the industry's growth would be fueled by the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to encourage semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Absent that legislation, America's share of global chip manufacturing would have fallen to 8 percent by 2032, according to the report.
The United States is also expected to see a substantial boost in the domestic production of advanced logic chips, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones and autonomous vehicles. Bolstering the production of the most advanced semiconductors has been a central goal for the Biden administration. Federal officials contend that in order for the country to lead in major technological industries, it will need to have a more reliable supply of the most advanced semiconductors.
The 2022 CHIPS Act aimed to re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of semiconductors, the vital components that power everything from phones and computers to electric vehicles and weapons systems. In addition to providing grants to chipmakers, the law established federal tax credits that help companies defray the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment.
A key finding from the report is that the United States is expected to produce nearly 30 percent of all advanced logic chips by 2032, up from essentially zero today. Some companies that have recently received federal awards have committed to producing leading-edge semiconductors in the United States in the coming years, including Samsung, Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Biden administration officials have already announced awards totaling more than $ 29 billion in recent months. Those included up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to Micron to help the memory-chip maker build manufacturing plants in New York and Idaho. Other big chipmakers -- including Samsung, TSMC and Intel -- have also received awards. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems were the first three recipients of federal money.
Other governments, including the European Union, Japan and China, have also offered new or expanded incentives to entice chipmakers to build plants in recent years. Companies have made significant investments in response. Private-sector investment in semiconductor production is projected to grow to about $ 2.3 trillion between 2024 and 2032, according to the report. The United States is expected to capture about 30 percent of those capital expenditures, second only to Taiwan, the report found.
"Everyone else is growing pretty fast, but we're growing at a breathtaking speed," said John Neuffer, the president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which lobbied for the bill. "That's very much because of our policy responses through the CHIPS Act."
Chris Miller, author of the book "Chip War" and a professor at Tufts University, said the report showed there was "real evidence" that the incentives included in the CHIPS Act were "changing businesses' investment decisions." He added that the projected increase in America's production of advanced chips would also be a substantial change.
Still, challenges remain. A lack of construction workers, technicians and electricians could make it more difficult for companies to build and operate manufacturing plants, the report's authors wrote. They also maintain that "sustained support" may be necessary to further strengthen America's semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Federal officials could consider the need for future incentives, such as a permanent tax credit that is broadened to cover semiconductor design, the authors wrote.
"It will be critical for policymakers in the United States and elsewhere to 'stay the course' by extending current support as well as considering additional measures to strengthen resilience," the authors wrote.

Antitrust Law, a Judge and a Call About Google's Fate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amit P. Mehta, a judge in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, will issue a landmark antitrust ruling.
One of Amit P. Mehta's first cases after becoming a federal judge in late 2014 proved to be a crash course in antitrust.
Sysco, the nation's largest distributor of food to restaurants and cafeterias, was trying to buy the rival US Foods, and the Federal Trade Commission had sued to block the $ 3.5 billion deal, arguing that it would stifle competition.
Judge Mehta told lawyers on both sides that he would need help educating himself. Over the next few months, he was a tireless and bright student, according to lawyers for the government and Sysco, absorbing the details of antitrust law and asking sharp questions about precedents, economic theory and the food-distribution business.
After the trial in 2015, Judge Mehta wrote a comprehensive, closely reasoned 128-page opinion and ordered a temporary halt to the deal. Within days, Sysco abandoned its acquisition plan.
"I didn't like the result, but it was a well-thought-out, solid opinion," said Richard Parker, who represented Sysco and is now a partner at the international law firm Milbank.
Judge Mehta, 52, will soon be bringing his experience from that case to help make a landmark antitrust decision.
Joined by a group of state attorneys general, the Justice Department sued Google in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the company illegally protected its monopoly in internet search, partly by paying billions to persuade companies, including Apple and Samsung, to use its search engine. Google has countered that it did so to create the best experience for consumers.
Closing arguments started Thursday and will end Friday in the most significant federal suit challenging a tech giant since the government took on Microsoft in the 1990s. Judge Mehta's ruling is also likely to set a precedent for a series of U.S. antitrust cases that are already in the pipeline against companies including Amazon, Apple and Meta.
While the stakes are far higher today, Judge Mehta's handling of the Sysco case -- his previous major antitrust ruling -- fits a consistent pattern, according to 10 former law firm colleagues, former law clerks, antitrust experts and lawyers whose cases he has tried. They described the judge as smart and careful, a hard worker and a voracious learner who made a genuine effort to thoroughly weigh both sides of a case.
He doesn't have a voluminous record of antitrust rulings, aside from Sysco. While it's hard to predict the way he'll rule, his judicial conduct to date suggests that whatever he decides in U.S. et al. v. Google will most likely prove difficult to overrule on appeal.
"It's been an extremely long, arduous road, and that's not just this trial but the duration of the case," Judge Mehta said in November as testimony in the trial drew to a close. "I can tell you, as I sit here today, I have no idea what I'm going to do."
On Thursday, he grilled lawyers from both sides, attempting to poke holes in their cases. He prodded the Justice Department on its allegation that Google stifled innovation in search because of its monopoly, pointing out that search has changed dramatically in the past decade. But he also pushed Google to explain how Amazon and other companies could be considered rivals in search, saying most consumers wouldn't agree.
Judge Mehta tells his law clerks that a fair trial begins with hard work and preparation. You never know what may be important in a case, he says, so read every page, study every case law citation.
"You learn there's no bound to the hours he'll put in to get it right," said Alex Haskell, a former law clerk who recently left the White House, where he was a top legislative aide.
Judge Mehta declined an interview request through his chambers.
Born in India, he came to America with his family when he was 1 year old. His father, Priyavadan Mehta, was an engineer; his mother, Ragini Mehta, a laboratory technician. They settled in suburban Baltimore.
Judge Mehta graduated from Georgetown University and the University of Virginia School of Law with academic honors. He peeled off from a rising career at Zuckerman Spaeder, a litigation boutique, to become a public defender for five years, taking a salary cut for a different kind of opportunity.
"He really wanted to do that work, represent people who couldn't afford it," said William W. Taylor III, a founding partner of Zuckerman Spaeder.
The stint as a public defender gave Judge Mehta a wealth of courtroom experience -- good training for a future judge. He returned to Zuckerman Spaeder and later became a partner, working as a criminal and civil defense lawyer on a wide range of cases. In 2014, the Obama administration nominated him to be a federal judge, and he was confirmed that December.
Judge Mehta was randomly assigned to the Google case in October 2020, after the Trump administration's Justice Department filed its antitrust suit.
In the trial, Judge Mehta asked witnesses occasional questions, mostly for elaboration and clarification. He has also occasionally deployed humor in the otherwise-staid proceedings, joking on the trial's opening day that the courtroom full of lawyers had "the highest concentration of blue suits in any one location."
But his major role in shaping the case came before the trial began, in a ruling last August that narrowed its scope.
Judge Mehta decided that the government could proceed to trial with its allegation that Google illegally shielded its monopoly with multibillion-dollar deals to make its search engine the default on smartphones and browsers. But he ruled out other claims, including the charge that Google broke the law by boosting its own products in search results over those of specialized sites, like Amazon and Yelp.
Streamlining the case to what Judge Mehta deemed the core issues helped keep the trial testimony at 10 weeks, as scheduled.
Early in the trial, Judge Mehta closed the courtroom in large part to the press and public, bowing to arguments made by Google and other companies that it was necessary to protect confidential business information. After an outcry, Judge Mehta opened up the court three weeks into the trial.
Later, Judge Mehta conceded that this was a misstep. "I should have been a little bit more probing of the parties as to how much of it really needed to be under seal," he said in court on Oct. 19. "So I'll fess up to that."
Still, crucial court documents remained heavily or entirely redacted. And documents were not being routinely shared with the press, even ones without sensitive information. After The New York Times, supported by other news organizations, filed a motion for greater and more timely access to exhibits, Judge Mehta loosened things up somewhat and forced Google to unseal more documents. One notable disclosure: Google paid Apple and others more than $ 26 billion a year to make its search engine the default on smartphones and browsers.
It's unclear what Judge Mehta will rule, legal experts say, in part because he hasn't demonstrated an overarching antitrust ideology. But he is known for paying meticulous attention to the evidence and assessing whether it conforms to precedents in case law.
That fact-based, case-by-case approach appeared as he ruled on criminal suits against pro-Trump rioters who were involved in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Last May, Judge Mehta sentenced Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia and an organizer of the riot, to 18 years in prison after he was found guilty of seditious conspiracy. Mr. Rhodes, who pleaded not guilty, told the court he was a "political prisoner."
At his sentencing, Judge Mehta called Mr. Rhodes "an ongoing threat and peril to this country, to the republic and the very fabric of our democracy."
But Judge Mehta treated Matthew Mark Wood, one of the first rioters to enter the Capitol building, very differently. Mr. Wood, who was 23 when he participated in the riot, expressed remorse after pleading guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding. Prosecutors requested a sentence of 57 months. But Judge Mehta sentenced Mr. Wood to 12 months of home detention, telling him, "I don't think this sentence should ruin your life."
By all accounts, Judge Mehta is widely read and has diverse cultural tastes. In a music copyright case, he included a footnote that said he did not need any expert testimony when it came to hip-hop music and lyrics. He had listened to hip-hop for decades, he wrote, and his favorite artists, reflecting his age, included Jay-Z, Kanye West, Drake and Eminem.
Judge Mehta is a passionate sports fan, especially when it comes to the Baltimore Orioles. At an event to celebrate his appointment as a judge, Dr. Sanjay Desai, a friend since childhood and a professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, joked that the judge "will defend the Orioles no matter what the facts are."
Though his courtroom experience in antitrust is limited, Judge Mehta has been engaged in the field, serving as a judicial representative to the American Bar Association's antitrust division and occasionally speaking at its events.
He presents himself as a "generalist federal judge," then proceeds to show a sophisticated understanding of antitrust law, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.
"It's going to be difficult for a reviewing court to say, 'You got it wrong,"' said Mr. Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C. "They will be inclined to give Judge Mehta the benefit of the doubt that they can trust his work."

Biden Announces Billions In Grants to Make Chips: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The $ 6.1 billion for Micron, to shore up the domestic supply of semiconductors, comes after a key union endorsement and passage of an aid bill central to the president's foreign policy agenda.
President Biden, building on a week of favorable political developments, celebrated a $ 6.1 billion grant to Micron Technology on Thursday, saying it would help the United States become less reliant on Asian countries by bolstering the nation's supply of semiconductors.
"New factories are going up all across the country," Mr. Biden said at the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology in Syracuse, N.Y. "Communities like Syracuse are writing the great American comeback story."
The grant for Micron, the latest multibillion-dollar award that federal officials have made to chip manufacturers in the past few weeks, will help the company construct two leading-edge chip plants in New York and another facility in Idaho, Biden administration officials said. The federal government will also provide up to $ 7.5 billion in loans to Micron.
Ramping up domestic chip production is a major goal for Mr. Biden, whose economic policy agenda largely focuses on strengthening American manufacturing and bringing back jobs that have shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are made in the United States, down from about 37 percent in 1990.
Although the grant had been announced last week by Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Biden's trip gave the president a chance to celebrate another victory in what is shaping up to be a successful week for him. On Wednesday, he secured the endorsement of the North America's Building Trades Unions, largely because of his bipartisan infrastructure package. He is also fresh off signing a $ 95.3 billion package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after months of congressional gridlock, reaffirming a central focus of his foreign policy agenda.
And while he promoted his efforts to bolster manufacturing in Syracuse, Mr. Biden's Republican opponent in the 2024 election, former President Donald J. Trump, was in court just 200 miles southeast, in New York City, as his state criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records continued.
"My predecessor and his MAGA Republican friends have a very different view," Mr. Biden said, adding that some Republicans, including Representatives Brandon Williams and Elise Stefanik of New York, have criticized the CHIPS Act. "I guess they're not going to be here today to celebrate."
The grant's funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of semiconductors, the tiny components that power everything from phones and computers to cars and fighter jets. The law gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute as grants to encourage chipmakers to construct and expand manufacturing plants across the United States.
As part of their new announcement, federal officials said that Micron now planned to spend $ 50 billion to develop the first three plants over the next six years, and that the company would invest up to $ 125 billion in the United States over the next 20 years or more. The company has said it could build up to four manufacturing plants in New York.
"We are rebuilding upstate New York's economy one microchip at a time," Mr. Schumer said on Thursday. He said the investment was expected to create about 50,000 jobs in the Syracuse region. "This is the largest single private investment in all of New York State's history."
Micron's award brings the total announced federal grants to more than $ 29 billion. This month, U.S. officials awarded Samsung up to $ 6.4 billion in grants. Other big chipmakers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have also received awards recently. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
Micron is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. The plant in Idaho is expected to be ready for production in 2026, senior Biden administration officials said. The first plant in New York is expected to open in 2028, with the second ready for production in 2029.
At least $ 40 million of the grant will be set aside for Micron to develop and train its work force. On Thursday, Mr. Biden also announced the creation of four new "work force hubs" in upstate New York, Michigan, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. The hubs are for training and connecting workers to jobs created by new federal investments.
Micron is the last U.S. supplier of chips called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. Those chips play a vital role in computers and smartphones, acting like a scratchpad to temporarily store data that must be retrieved frequently. Leading-edge DRAM chips are critical for advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and wireless communications. All such leading-edge chips are currently manufactured in Asia, but administration officials said Micron's investments would allow the United States to produce its own supply.
Micron conducts most of its manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. Sanjay Mehrotra, the company's chief executive, has made an effort to bolster its U.S. production and win government subsidies for that expansion. But Mr. Mehrotra has reiterated that the timing of such spending will closely track supply and demand, and reflect the company's success in winning federal grants.
"Micron's leading-edge memory is foundational to meeting the growing demands of artificial intelligence," Mr. Mehrotra said in a statement. "We are proud to be making significant memory manufacturing investments in the U.S."

Full text: The Magnetic Heart of
the Milky Way
"The nation that controls magnetism will control the universe." So maintained Dick Tracy, the fictional detective in the comic strip by Chester Gould, in 1962.
But does magnetism control the universe, too?
About seven stars are born each year in the Milky Way, our home galaxy. They come from dust and to dust they eventually return. Now, a celestial image, an Impressionistic swirl of color in the center of the Milky Way, represents a first step toward understanding the role of those magnetic fields in the cycle of stellar death and rebirth.
The image was produced by David Chuss, a physicist at Villanova University and an international team of astronomers. The project is known as FIREPLACE, for Far-InfraRed Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration. The team's map reveals previously invisible details in a stretch of the central Milky Way 500 light-years wide.
The colors represent different temperatures of interstellar dust: Green indicates cool, dense dust; pink indicates warmer dust. Threaded through these hues are lines showing the directions of magnetic force in the clouds. The yellow streaks are jets of hot ionized gas, which emits radio waves. The jets were first recorded two years ago by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.
Every new generation of eyes sees a new version of our galaxy.
To map the galaxy's magnetic field lines, Dr. Chuss and his colleagues flew at 45,000 feet aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, a 747 outfitted for astronomy. A special spectrograph measured the direction of polarization of the infrared light emanating from the dust, revealing the directions of the magnetic fields point by point.
The center of the Milky Way is barely noticeable to the right of center in the map, just below a small blob that resembles a sideways figure eight. At the middle of the dusty blob is a monster black hole, around which the entire galaxy rotates like a carousel.
"The next step is to figure out what this all means," Dr. Chuss said in an interview. Embedded in this map could be clues to some of nature's deepest, most complex processes, including how stars, the sources of all light and life in the universe, come to be.
"It will provide the ability for new theories to be tested," Dr. Chuss said, "and guide the development of the next generation of astronomical exploration."

“The next step is to figure out what this all means,” Chuss said in an interview. Embedded in this map could be clues to some of nature’s deepest, most complex processes, including how stars, the sources of all light and life in the universe, come to be.
“It will provide the ability for new theories to be tested,” Chuss said, “and guide the development of the next generation of astronomical exploration.”

Chipmaker Micron to Use Billions for 3 New Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The grant to the memory chipmaker is the latest federal award aimed at boosting U.S. chip manufacturing.
The Biden administration will give Micron up to $ 6.1 billion in grants to help build its semiconductor plants in New York and Idaho, the latest multibillion dollar award aimed at ramping up the nation's production of vital semiconductors.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, announced the grant on Thursday and said the "monumental" investment would help the company construct two new chip manufacturing plants in New York by the end of the decade, along with another plant under construction in Idaho.
More than a year ago, Micron announced plans to expand its manufacturing footprint in the United States. In September 2022, the company said it would build a $ 15 billion factory in its hometown, Boise, Idaho, the first new U.S. memory chip plant in 20 years. A month later, Micron said it would build a giant manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., pledging to start with a $ 20 billion project by the end of the decade and spending as much as $ 100 billion over the next two decades or more. The complex could eventually include up to four new manufacturing plants.
A senior Biden administration official confirmed the award and said it would help create thousands of jobs. Company officials have said the investment is expected to create roughly 50,000 jobs, including about 9,000 direct positions at its plants.
The announcement is the latest award from federal officials to chipmakers in recent weeks. The funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as leader in the production of semiconductors, the foundational components that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and weapons systems. Equipped with $ 39 billion, the Commerce Department has distributed several grants to chip manufacturers as an incentive for them to build and expand facilities in the United States.
The initiative is intended to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors. Although semiconductors were invented in America, manufacturing has largely shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are currently made in the United States.
Micron's award brings the total announced grants to more than $ 29 billion. On Monday, U.S. officials awarded Samsung up to $ 6.4 billion in grants. Other big chipmakers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel -- have also received awards recently. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
Mr. Schumer, who helped rally Congress to pass the CHIPS Act, said Micron's award would help make sure that "America was no longer dependent on other countries for all kinds of vital chips." He said he had long pushed for Micron to receive a share of the federal grants.
"I always lobby heavily for New York to gain advantage and talked to the administration on many occasions about how Micron was important to the country as a whole," Mr. Schumer said in an interview. "But frankly, my advocacy for chips extends to the whole country."
Mr. Schumer said the award would help bolster the nation's production of critical memory chips, which the country is becoming "more and more dependent on."
Micron declined to comment, citing confidentiality requirements associated with CHIPS Act grants.
Based in Boise, Micron is the last U.S. supplier of chips called dynamic random access memories, or DRAMs. The components play a vital role in computers and smartphones, acting like a scratchpad to temporarily store data that must be retrieved frequently. Micron also has a major sideline in flash memory, a newer variety of chips that store data more permanently.
The DRAM business was a major global battleground in the 1980s and the 1990s, as companies from Japan and later South Korea used manufacturing muscle to drive down prices and squeeze competitors. Much larger U.S. companies, like Intel and Texas Instruments, left the business.
Micron, a much smaller company, managed to hang on as the industry consolidated to just three major players. The South Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix rank first and second place in memory revenues, respectively. The reduced competition has helped moderate the industry's business cycles somewhat, though all three companies last year suffered from severe pricing pressure.
DRAM and flash memory are mainstays of the computers found in data centers, as new applications require greater amounts of data and faster access to it. In the newest wrinkle, makers of specialty chips for artificial intelligence like Nvidia rely on a technology called high-bandwidth memory, which bundles multiple stacks of DRAM chips in packages along with processors that carry out calculations.
Micron, though largely managed through offices in San Jose, Calif., conducts most of its manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive, has spearheaded an effort to sharply boost its U.S. production footprint and win government subsidies for that expansion.
But Mr. Mehrotra has reiterated that the timing of such spending would closely track supply and demand conditions in the memory market, and also reflect the company's success in winning U.S. grants.
Micron is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment, Mr. Schumer said.

Your Guide to Smartphone Backups: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It doesn't take a lot of work to keep copies of your phone's photos, videos and other files stashed securely in case of an emergency.
What would you do if you permanently lost all the photos, notes and other files on your phone?
If you have a backup system in place, you'd likely know what to do next: Restore it all to a new phone. But if you haven't thought about it, fear not: The backup process has become so simplified that it takes just a few screen taps. Here's a quick overview of some ways you can keep your files safe, secure and up to date.
Getting Started
When you first set up your phone, you created (or logged into) a free account from Apple, Google or Samsung to use the company's software and services. For example, this would be the Apple ID on your iPhone, the Google Account on your Android phone or the Samsung Account on your Galaxy device.
With that account, you probably had five gigabytes of free iCloud storage space from Apple, or 15 gigabytes of online storage from Google and Samsung. This server space is used as an encrypted digital locker for your phone's backup app, but it can fill up quickly -- especially if you have other devices connected to your account and storing files there.
When you get close to your storage limit, you'll get warnings -- along with an offer to sign up for more server space for a monthly fee, usually a few dollars for at least another 100 gigabytes. (Note that Samsung's Temporary Cloud Backup tool supplies an unlimited amount of storage for 30 days if your Galaxy is in the repair shop or ready for an upgrade.)
But online backup is just one approach. You can keep your files on a local drive instead with a few extra steps.
Backing Up
Apple, Google and Samsung all have specific setup instructions for cloud backup in the support area of their sites. But the feature is easily located.
On an iPhone, tap your name at the top of the Settings screen and then tap iCloud. On many Android phones, tap System and then Backup. Here, you set the phone to back up automatically (which usually happens when it's connected to a Wi-Fi network and plugged into its charger), or opt for a manual backup that starts when you tap the button.
Backup apps usually save a copy of your call history, phone settings, messages, photos, videos and data from apps. Content you can freely download, like the apps themselves, are not typically backed up since they're easy to grab again.
If you don't want your files on a remote server, you can park your phone's backup on your computer's hard drive. Steps vary based on the hardware, but Apple's support site has a guide for backing up an iPhone to a Windows PC or a Mac using a USB cable.
Google's site has instructions for manually transferring files between an Android phone and a computer, and Samsung's Smart Switch app assists with moving content between a Galaxy phone and a computer.
Sync vs. Backup
Synchronizing your files is not the same as backing them up. A backup saves file copies at a certain point in time. Syncing your smartphone keeps information in certain apps, like contacts and calendars, current across multiple devices. When synchronized, your phone, computer and anything else logged into your account have the same information -- like that to-do list you just updated.
With synchronization, when you delete an item somewhere, it disappears everywhere. A backup stays intact in its storage location until updated in the next backup.
By default, Google syncs the content of its own mobile and web apps between phone, computer and tablet. In the Google Account Data settings, you can adjust which apps sync. Samsung Cloud has similar options for its Galaxy devices.
Apple handles data synchronization across its devices through its iCloud service. You can set which apps you want to sync in your iCloud account settings.
Other Options
You don't have to use the backup tools that came with your phone. Third-party apps for online backup -- like iDrive or iBackup -- are available by subscription. If you prefer to keep your iPhone backups on the computer, software like iMazing for Mac or Windows ( $ 60) or AltTunes for Windows ( $ 35 a year) are alternatives. Droid Transfer for Windows ( $ 35) is among the Android backup offerings.
If losing your camera roll is your biggest nightmare, Google Photos, iCloud Photos and other services like Amazon Photos and Dropbox can be set to automatically back up all your pictures and keep them in sync across your connected devices.
No matter the method you choose, having a backup takes some pain out of a lost, stolen or broken phone. Some photos and files can never be replaced, and restoring your iPhone's or Android phone's content from a backup is a lot easier than starting over.
Photograph Syncing your files, or keeping them updated in real time and across devices, is not the same as backing them up.; IPhone and Android both offer instructions on their phones for managing storage.; On iPhones, online backup is found within iCloud on the Settings screen. On many Android phones, tap System and then Backup.; There are several paid third-party backup apps, including iDrive. This article appeared in print on page B6.

Tapestry's Deal for Capri Clears Regulatory Hurdle
Tapestry's $ 8.5 billion deal to buy Capri Holdings has received regulatory clearance from the European Union and Japan, the companies said on Monday.
The merger, which would bring top labels such as Tapestry's Coach, Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman and Capri's Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace under one roof, is still awaiting clearance from U.S. regulators. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sought additional information on the planned merger from the two companies in November, months after the deal was announced.
A merger between the two companies would help Tapestry compete better with Paris-listed LVMH in the European luxury market, even as demand for expensive handbags and accessories remains choppy in the United States. The deal is expected to close this year and add to Tapestry's adjusted profits immediately, the companies said last year. REUTERS

Samsung Reclaims Spot as Top Maker of Phones
Apple's smartphone shipments dropped about 10 percent in the first quarter of 2024, with Samsung, at 20.8 percent market share, taking back the top phonemaker spot from Apple, according to data from the research firm IDC.
Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8 percent to 289.4 million units during January-March. South Korea's Samsung shipped more than 60 million phones during the period.
Apple's sales decline comes after its strong performance in the December quarter when it overtook Samsung as the world's No.1 phone maker. Now Apple is back to the second spot, with 17.3 percent market share, as Chinese brands such as Huawei gain market share.
Xiaomi, one of China's top smartphone makers, occupied the third position with a market share of 14.1 percent during the first quarter. REUTERS

G.M. Moves Headquarters Into Detroit's Downtown
General Motors is moving its headquarters deeper into downtown Detroit after spending more than 20 years in its riverfront home at the Renaissance Center, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The Michigan automaker will now place its global headquarters a few blocks away from the so-called RenCen, in a sleek new high-rise building called Hudson's, which will be the second-tallest skyscraper in Detroit.
G.M. remains the only member of the Big Three automakers to have its headquarters in Detroit. Ford Motor's home base is nearby in Dearborn, and Chrysler parent Stellantis has its main North American office in Auburn Hills.
The GM headquarters -- with its glowing logo pasted atop one of the towers -- became an important part of Detroit's skyline. The move to this location was "a milestone that helped spark a downtown renaissance," the company says on its website. REUTERS

U.S. Grants $6.4 Billion To Samsung: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The federal grants will support Samsung's new chip manufacturing hub in Taylor, Texas, along with the expansion of an existing site in Austin.
The Biden administration will give up to $ 6.4 billion in grants to Samsung, one of the world's largest chipmakers, the latest in a slew of awards intended to shore up domestic production of cutting-edge semiconductors.
The money will help Samsung, the South Korean company, fund its new chip manufacturing hub in Taylor, Texas, and expand an existing site in nearby Austin. Samsung will now build an additional manufacturing plant and upgrade a facility under construction in Taylor. It will increase its investment in Texas to roughly $ 45 billion, up from the $ 17 billion it announced more than two years ago, administration officials said on Sunday.
Federal officials said the grants would help create a U.S. hub for the development and production of leading-edge semiconductors. Aside from manufacturing chips, Samsung will now construct a research and development facility in Taylor as well as an advanced factory for packaging them, the final step before semiconductors can be used in electronic systems.
The announcement follows other awards that federal officials have made to semiconductor manufacturers in recent weeks. The initiative is funded by the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors, the vital components that power everything from phones and computers to cars and weapons systems. The legislation gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to dole out as grants as incentives to chipmakers to construct and expand plants in the United States.
The effort is intended to help reverse a decades-long decline in the U.S. share of global chip manufacturing. Although semiconductors were invented in America, only about 10 percent of the world's chips are currently made in the United States.
The Samsung grant is the third big award aimed at increasing U.S. production of the most sophisticated semiconductors. Last week, federal officials said they would award up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading maker of the most advanced chips. The administration also announced last month that Intel, a Silicon Valley chipmaker, would receive up to $ 8.5 billion in grants, which officials said would be the single largest grant under the new program.
Both Samsung and TSMC have committed to producing two-nanometer chips, using what is currently the world's most advanced production technology, in the United States in the coming years.
Samsung's investment also includes the construction of a new advanced packaging facility. Packaging typically involves encasing chips in combinations of plastic and metal that allow them to connect to other devices in a system. New packaging technologies have become a focal point for the industry as more companies have taken to bundling multiple small chips -- sometimes called chiplets -- in a package to boost computing power rather than trying to pack more capability into each semiconductor.
In addition, Samsung will build a research and development facility that will study advances in manufacturing processes, which add computing power and storage capability to chips. Among the largest chip manufacturers, only Intel currently conducts such research in the United States. Federal officials view Samsung's new research and development facility as vital for ensuring the country's access to cutting-edge developments in the field, senior Biden administration officials said.
As part of the award, Samsung will also directly supply chips to the Defense Department. The Austin facility's expansion is intended to support the production of chips used in industries that are critical for national security, including aerospace, defense and automotive.
In addition to receiving the grants, Samsung is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting the Texas factories with production equipment.
Samsung's award brings the total announced federal grants to more than $ 23 billion. GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems received the first three awards.
The pandemic set off a global shortage of semiconductors that crippled major industries and shed light on the vulnerabilities in the domestic supply chain for chips, motivating lawmakers to pass the CHIPS Act.
Federal officials view the lack of domestic manufacturing capacity as a major national security risk, given that the components power missiles, satellites and fighter jets. Cutting-edge semiconductors are also critical for major technological industries like artificial intelligence.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, emphasized that much of the semiconductor supply chain -- from research and development to packaging -- was concentrated in a few Asian countries.
"That leaves the U.S. supply chain incredibly vulnerable to disruption," Ms. Raimondo said on Sunday. "It's unsafe and it weakens our national and economic security."
Ms. Raimondo said the new investment would help create a "state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem" in Texas and re-establish the United States as a leader in the production of the most advanced semiconductors. In February, Ms. Raimondo said new investments would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade. Currently, the United States produces none.
In November 2021, Samsung first announced that it would build a $ 17 billion semiconductor factory in Taylor, responding to a push by the Biden administration and U.S. customers to ramp up chip production in the United States. The company will now upgrade the facility's manufacturing capacity. In addition to four-nanometer chips, the first plant will now produce two-nanometer chips. Samsung is expected to open the first facility in 2026, administration officials said.
The second plant will also manufacture two-nanometer chips and is slated to open in 2027, according to the officials. The research and development facility is expected to open in 2027, too, and the advanced packaging facility is set to open in 2028.
Lael Brainard, the director of the National Economic Council, said the Samsung award would be the "third and final leg" of the president's plan to bring leading-edge chip manufacturing back to the United States. About $ 40 million in grants will be set aside for the company to develop and train its workers, Ms. Brainard said. Samsung's investment is expected to create more than 4,500 manufacturing jobs and at least 17,000 construction jobs, federal officials said.
Similar to the other award recipients, Samsung will have to meet certain milestones before payments are made.
Samsung plays an unusually influential position in the industry by supplying two major varieties of semiconductors. It is the largest maker of memory chips, which store data in smartphones, computers and other products. But the company also makes and designs logic chips -- a category that includes processors that handle calculations in electronic hardware. And the company offers a service that manufactures such chips to order for other companies.
Most of Samsung's factories are in South Korea. But in 1996, the company built a facility in Austin, which initially produced memory chips and later shifted to logic chips for products such as Apple's iPhone. In recent years Apple has frequently turned to TSMC to manufacture chips that Apple designs, though Samsung also boasts some of the industry's most advanced production processes.

Full text: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plans to build an additional factory and upgrade another planned facility in Phoenix with the federal grants.
The Biden administration will award up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading maker of the most advanced microchips, in a bid to bring some of the most cutting-edge semiconductor technology to the United States.
The funds, which come from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, will help support the construction of TSMC's first major U.S. hub, in Phoenix. The company has already committed to building two plants at the site and will use some of the grant money to build a third factory in Phoenix, U.S. officials said on Sunday. TSMC will also increase its total investments in the United States to more than $ 65 billion, up from $ 40 billion.
Bringing the world's most sophisticated chip manufacturing to the United States has been a major goal for the Biden administration. TSMC announced that it would now produce two-nanometer chips at the hub, a significant step forward given that the United States currently produces none of the most advanced semiconductors.
Federal officials view the investment as vital for building up a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors, the small chips that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and fighter jets. Although semiconductors were invented in the United States, production has largely shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10 percent of the world's chips are made in the United States.
The award is the second largest by the federal government under a program intended to re-establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It was unveiled a few weeks after President Biden announced that Intel, another major chipmaker, would receive $ 8.5 billion in grants and up to $ 11 billion in loans during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
The CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022, gave the Commerce Department $ 39 billion to distribute as subsidies to encourage companies to build and expand chip plants across the United States. The program is a major pillar of Mr. Biden's economic policy agenda, which is centered on strengthening American manufacturing.
TSMC's award will bring the total announced grants to more than $ 16 billion. Three smaller companies, GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems, received the first awards.
In addition to the grants, the federal government will provide up to $ 5 billion in loans to TSMC. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment. About $ 50 million of the grants will be set aside to train and develop the company's work force, federal officials said.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said the investment would help the United States start manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones and the most sensitive military hardware.
"It's a national security problem that we don't manufacture any of the world's most sophisticated chips in the United States," Ms. Raimondo said on Sunday. "Now, because of this announcement, these chips will be made in the United States."
Earlier this year, Ms. Raimondo said new investments in semiconductor companies would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade.
TSMC's investment is expected to create about 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and more than 20,000 construction jobs, federal officials said. TSMC will have to meet certain construction and production milestones before payments are made.
The company has been counting on federal aid for years. Talks about a partly subsidized expansion in the United States began in 2019, during the Trump administration, according to company officials. TSMC first announced that it would build a new facility in Phoenix in May 2020, a project that company officials said would eventually require government subsidies to help address the higher cost of building and operating chip plants in the United States.
In December 2022, several months after the passage of the CHIPS Act, TSMC announced that it would build a second factory at the site, increasing its total investment to $ 40 billion from $ 12 billion.
But since TSMC started construction in 2021, various stumbling blocks have delayed the start of production. Last summer, TSMC pushed back initial production at its first factory to 2025 from this year, saying local workers lacked expertise in installing some sophisticated equipment. In January, the company said the second plant would not meet its original schedule of beginning manufacturing in 2026.
Production at the second facility is expected to begin in 2028, and production at the third factory is expected to start by the end of the decade, according to the Biden administration officials.
TSMC's expansion in the United States could have an outsize impact on the global supply chain for semiconductors, the vulnerabilities of which were laid bare by crippling chip shortages during the pandemic.
TSMC, which pioneered the idea of manufacturing chips to order for others that design them, operates massive factories in Taiwan that churn out the vast majority of the small components that supply processing power to computers, phones, networking gear, appliances and military gear. America's reliance on the company's factories, on an island that China does not recognize as independent and claims is part of its territory, has long worried U.S. officials.
New generations of production technology are often described in terms of nanometers, or billionths of a meter, a measure of key dimensions of microscopic circuitry. In December 2022, TSMC said it would produce three-nanometer chips at its second Arizona factory. It will now also introduce the next generation of technology, at two nanometers, in the second plant, Biden administration officials announced.
Such advances determine how many transistors can be packed on each small slice of silicon, which allow chips to perform calculations more quickly and store more data. In the past decade, TSMC supplanted Intel in delivering the most sophisticated production technology, producing components that Apple designs for its latest smartphones and Nvidia develops to power artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT.
Though the planned addition of two-nanometer technology represents a substantial advance, that does not necessarily mean that TSMC's U.S. factories will offer the latest technology at the same time as its factories in Taiwan. The company carries out research on new technologies on the island, and adapting those processes to high-volume manufacturing is typically done first in nearby buildings to speed the transition and reduce travel time for engineers.
It remains possible that Intel, which is racing to regain its lead in manufacturing technology, will offer the most advanced production technology in the industry by 2028 at U.S. factories. The company carries out its manufacturing technology research in Oregon.
Biden administration officials are expected to award more grants in the coming months to other big chipmakers that have invested in new or expanded domestic facilities in recent years, including Micron Technology and Samsung.

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will award up to $6.6 billion in grants to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the leading maker of the most advanced microchips, in a bid to bring some of the most cutting-edge semiconductor technology to the United States.
The funds, which come from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, will help support the construction of TSMC’s first major U.S. hub, in Phoenix. The company has already committed to building two plants at the site and will use some of the grant money to build a third factory in Phoenix, U.S. officials said Sunday. TSMC will also increase its total investments in the U.S. to more than $65 billion, up from $40 billion.
Bringing the world’s most sophisticated chip manufacturing to the United States has been a major goal for the Biden administration. TSMC announced that it would now produce 2-nanometer chips at the hub, a significant step forward given that the United States currently produces none of the most advanced semiconductors.
Federal officials view the investment as vital for building up a reliable domestic supply of semiconductors, the small chips that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and fighter jets. Although semiconductors were invented in the U.S., production has largely shifted overseas in recent decades. Only about 10% of the world’s chips are made in the U.S.
The award is the second largest by the federal government under a program intended to reestablish the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It was unveiled a few weeks after President Joe Biden announced that Intel, another major chipmaker, would receive $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
The CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022, gave the Commerce Department $39 billion to distribute as subsidies to encourage companies to build and expand chip plants across the U.S. The program is a major pillar of Biden’s economic policy agenda, which is centered on strengthening U.S. manufacturing.
TSMC’s award will bring the total announced grants to more than $16 billion. Three other smaller companies, including GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems, received the first awards.
In addition to the grants, the federal government will provide up to $5 billion in loans to TSMC. The company is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25% of the cost of building and outfitting factories with production equipment.

Full text: I am going to an eclipse watching party, but aside from the viewing glasses, which I already have, what should I wear? Dressing in theme seems silly, but I want to acknowledge the event.
Susan, Rochester, N.Y. It's human instinct, when celebrating a total solar eclipse -- a magical moment of real darkness in the middle of the afternoon -- to want to dress for the occasion. It's a way of marking its importance and making a memory, along with uttering cool phrases like "the path of totality."
So how best to do it today? Obviously, protective eyewear is the most important accessory. Otherwise, some unexpected fashion advice comes from scientists, who suggest wearing red and green. Those colors are generally associated with a different time of year and event, but apparently they are also a lot of fun to wear during a total eclipse, thanks to something called the Purkinje effect.
Discovered in 1819 by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkinje, the Purkinje effect refers to the way the cones and rods in the eye process light. When the light changes very quickly -- like during an eclipse! -- the reds get darker, and the greens become bright. So if you are outside during totality, you and those around you will also have fun checking out your magically morphing outfit.
Beyond that, there is ... well, a galaxy's worth of options. Though the presence of starship-inspired clothing has ebbed and flowed over time, what has been called "retro-Galactica" and "neo space age" has been on an upswing of late, perhaps because of NASA's plans to return to the moon. Or because of the obsession of titans like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk with the final frontier. Or even Zendaya's "Dune: Part II" promotion outfits, all that silver in Beyoncé's Renaissance tour and a general dissatisfaction with the planet we are on now.
When the national interest, moguls and pop culture mesh, powerful trends tend to emerge. To cite two examples: Prada is collaborating with Axiom Space, the private company making NASA's astronaut uniforms for the Artemis III mission. Christian Cowan worked with Adobe to create a dress at New York Fashion Week that was made of what looked like scales but turned out to be lots of tiny screens programmed to change colors and patterns at will.
Those garments are, of course, not available for purchase, but there are plenty of interstellar-ish alternatives. You may even have some in your wardrobe already. Think silver, transparency and sculptural white, fashion ingredients that have been shorthand for the space age since André Courrèges and Paco Rabanne first put lunar looks on the runway. Remember, you are likely to be outside, so certain practical considerations would not be out of place. But no matter what you wear, when the sun and the moon meet, that will be the most mind-blowing look of all.

Full text: What does ambition look like at 90? How do you explain the drive that makes people like Giorgio Armani, fully in command of his global design empire as he approaches his 10th decade, tick? When the artist Betye Saar wakes every day, she sets to work on creating the assemblages that are widely exhibited and avidly sought by collectors and major museums, artworks with origins she traces to her early girlhood in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Why bother? Wasn't retirement supposed to be the goal of a contented old age? Didn't the plan call for taking up needlepoint or golf? The old, as it happens, represent a rapidly growing global population: the proportion of those 65 and above is increasing at a faster rate than those below that age, according to World Population Prospects, a United Nations study. Between 2022, when the report was issued, and 2050, the global population of those over 65 is expected to rise from 10 to 16 percent. People are already working longer, and, as they do, it would appear that a road map is needed, a means of understanding what keeps people like Martha Stewart, at 82, not only undiminished by age but actively in the game.
Over the course of the past months, we asked what makes people like Ms. Stewart so seemingly unstoppable. Is there an explanation for why, besides prosperity and good health, some people are driven to chase their dreams long past the age when recent history suggests we were meant to be kicking back in our rocking chairs? -- Guy Trebay Below, Martha Stewart explains, in her own words, what continues to motivate her.
This year I made time to grow the best vegetables, monster vegetables, that I've ever grown in my life. My houses are never done. And I'm writing my autobiography. That's the scariest project for me because I don't really like everything about myself -- where I've been, what I've done.
I get up at 6:30 every morning. My housekeeper comes at 7, and I can't be in bed when she arrives. That would be very embarrassing. I'm a bad sleeper, in any case. At times I'd rather watch a documentary. Other times, I might be anxious, not for me but for my grandchildren. If I wake in the night, I read the headlines to make sure we're not being bombed.
Maybe a little uncertainty can help fuel ambition. When I left my job on Wall Street, I knew I had to create a career for myself. I became a caterer, catering parties every night. Still I thought, "Will there come a time when my granddaughter -- she's 12 -- is asked, "What did grandma do?" And all she can say is "Oh, she made parties for people." I thought, "I have to do something more than this." That was in the 1980s, when I wrote my first book, the one on entertaining.
At that time I wasn't keeping my eye on the home, even though I was known as a homemaker. It wasn't enough for a marriage. Maybe I regret not having had more children. Maybe I regret that my marriage ended abruptly. We'd been together 27 years. That used to be considered a long time, so when a long marriage ended, it was like somebody died. Maybe I would have liked getting married again. I didn't, but I don't mind. Still, I'm curious about what could have been.
My never-ending curiosity drives me. Will it stop? That's never even occurred to me.
Current and upcoming projects: Autobiography in progress; an untitled Martha Stewart documentary from R.J. Cutler, who directed "The September Issue," to stream on Netflix in 2024; a PBS documentary series, "Hope In the Water," set for broadcast in 2024; a partnership with Samsung for a 2023-2024 advertising campaign; a line of gardening clothes and accessories in collaboration with French Dressing Jeans and Marquee Brands.
This interview has been edited and condensed.

She's Questioning The Very Nature Of Our Museums: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Gala Porras-Kim has confronted the restitution of cultural artifacts and now -- with melting Antarctic ice -- climate change.
Inside the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, little pieces of Antarctica were melting: cross-sections of an ice core from the continent's Newall Glacier, each one about the size of a beverage coaster and encased in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag. The artist Gala Porras-Kim watched approvingly during a visit in March, pointing out the air pockets that had started to form.
"The ice cores are an archive of ancient air, because the air gets stuck in the layers of ice," she said, pointing at the display during an interview at the museum. This particular core, which Porras-Kim had obtained from the National Science Foundation's Ice Core Facility in nearby Lakewood, Colo., contained ice that had formed some 10,000 years ago, around the beginning of the Holocene period, in geological terms.
Porras-Kim, an interdisciplinary artist who often questions how museums collect material from previous civilizations, was also planning to debut what she called an "ice performance" at the opening of her solo exhibition on March 8: "Gala Porras-Kim: A Hand in Nature." That night, and at monthly intervals thereafter, an unsealed piece of the core would be placed on a silver tray and allowed to thaw. "The ancient air will get released into this room -- a reunion of this old air with the new air, mixing together," she said, describing it as an "organic de-accession process."
The exhibition at MCA Denver is the largest museum solo the 39-year-old artist has had in the United States. It follows her busy year of one-person exhibitions, at the U.C.L.A. Fowler Museum, the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul and the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo in Mexico City, among other venues. And next spring Porras-Kim, who is based in Los Angeles and London, will have a solo show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.
The artist brings a new and refreshing perspective to some of the most important, and confounding, questions in the field today: how to preserve and display the artifacts of ancient people and Indigenous cultures in prominent museums, and whether to keep them at all or engage in a process of restitution. Her art often unfolds through dialogues with directors, curators and conservators, memorialized in formal letters that suggest ways to restore a sense of spirituality and ritual to objects that have been wrested from their original contexts. In person she has an upbeat, optimistic way of speaking, conveying a persuasive confidence that museums can correct their troubled histories if they are willing to think more like artists.
Often, Porras-Kim's arguments are at odds with the museum's imperative to preserve what was taken. One of her projects, "Precipitation for an Arid Landscape," proposes that remnants of ceremonial offerings that had been dredged from a sacred cenote at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and moved to Harvard's Peabody Museum be "rehydrated" with rainwater and copal resin, because the Mayan god of rain, Chac, remains their rightful owner. "The rain is still around," Porras-Kim has said in previous interviews, and who can argue with that logic?
The child of two scholars -- her Colombian father is an "old-school historian" and her South Korean mother more "postmodern," she said -- Porras-Kim spent her early years in Bogotá, Colombia, and then moved to Spain. Her family eventually settled in Los Angeles, after her mother had enrolled in a Ph.D. program at U.C.L.A. and Porras-Kim and her father were able to obtain political asylum. Porras-Kim almost followed her parents into academia; after earning a Master of Fine Arts from CalArts, she earned another master's degree in Latin American Studies from U.C.L.A. She came back to art because, she said, it encompassed so many other fields. "I see museums as a box, a container, that is always changing to fit whatever the collection is."
The Denver exhibition is unusual for Porras-Kim in that the museum has no permanent collection for her to respond to. So she found another kind of collection nearby, at the Ice Core Facility, where about 25,000 meters of ice are neatly stashed in metal tubes within a giant freezer kept at -38 Celsius. About 2,000 meters a year are deaccessioned to make room for new samples; this is how Porras-Kim was able to obtain the cores for her exhibition.
"I have mixed emotions about seeing them melt," the facility's head curator, Curt La Bombard, said when Porras-Kim and I visited the exhibition. "But that's the point -- reaching a new audience that may not have been exposed to what we're doing in climate science. The last thing we want to do is dispose of these in such a way that they have no value for anybody."
At the MCA, several of the works present the carefully controlled museum environment as an illusion. Spores gathered from the storage facilities of the British Museum multiplied on an agar-soaked cloth; moisture piped across the gallery from a dehumidifier dripped through a graphite-saturated fabric, making an abstract drawing on a panel placed on the floor.
Porras-Kim also made a site-specific artwork out of a defect in the museum building: the large crack that almost bisects its picture window, which appeared a little over a year ago during a winter marked by extreme fluctuations in temperature. She has titled it "Currents through the fissure from controlling nature," and has placed a bench nearby so that visitors can sit and examine it.
"The museum is trying to regulate temperature within this box, but the climate doesn't care. The tension between the two is always going to make this crack," she explained as we looked out through the glass to the street below. As with the melting ice cores, which are displayed next to the broken window, she is most interested in the idea of air escaping a container. "The title is not so much about the crack, but how the air is coming through," she said.
Porras-Kim's art can be described as a new variant of institutional critique, the movement associated with 1970s-era works by artists such as Michael Asher and Hans Haacke; these artists were known for calling attention to the physical and social infrastructure of the art world. She studied at CalArts with Asher, and credits his radical but intellectually rigorous approach (as well as the highly conceptual and philosophical art of Charles Gaines, another of her teachers) as strong influences on her thinking about historical collections.
"How do we move from just prioritizing the material, when there are some things beyond the material that could be preserved better?" she said. "You see it easily when you look at conceptual art, which is immaterial. What are the conservation directions for something that is installed in your head?"
Leilani Lynch, the associate curator at the museum and the organizer of Porras-Kim's exhibition, says that she was drawn to the artist's work because it was "digging into the ways in which museums operate, but through a voice and a lens that felt distinct from the history of institutional critique." This show, she says, is about zooming out from the "microcosm of museum collections" to examine "values of preservation and conservation and the ways in which we are trying to persist as a civilization." Matthew Robb, a Mesoamerican specialist who organized Porras-Kim's exhibition last year at the Fowler Museum, appreciated Porras-Kim's "willingness to confront institutions on their own terms."
Porras-Kim's inquiries feel especially apt at a time of increasing self-scrutiny by museums, as they navigate calls for restitution and, in the United States, new federal regulations around the display of Native American cultural objects. "There's a great deal of anxiety that surrounds institutions, particularly since the pandemic era," the cultural consultant Andras Szanto, the author of a book on the future of museums, said. "It makes this kind of work feel very urgent because museums themselves are feeling their way and trying to arrive at the right balance. For an artist to be part of that conversation, but with nuance and complexity and not just landing the cheap shots, is a very welcome thing."
Her suggestions to museum staff, however, are sometimes at odds with the new directives to return objects to their geographic places of origin. "Most of the museums I've worked with have a singular, Western point of view," Porras-Kim said. "It's not as simple as saying we can copy-paste backward and just return something."
Back at the museum, the ice cores were shrinking in their plastic bags; after a few hours the pieces were about the diameter of a hockey puck, and surrounded by a froth of air bubbles. "One of the hardest parts of this has been to let the ice melt, because it hasn't melted in 10,000 years, but it's not about the water -- it's about the air," she said.
"This is a way of thinking about how the air, which we think has no age because it's around us all the time, has been collected and preserved," she told me. "There are some things that, once the vapor seal of history is opened, you cannot put them back."

What does ambition look like at 90? How do you explain the drive that makes people like Giorgio Armani, fully in command of his global design empire as he approaches his 10th decade, tick? When artist Betye Saar wakes every day, she sets to work on creating the assemblages that are widely exhibited and avidly sought by collectors and major museums — artworks with origins she traces to her girlhood in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Why bother? Wasn’t retirement supposed to be the goal of a contented old age? Didn’t the plan call for taking up needlepoint or golf? The old, as it happens, represent a rapidly growing global population: The proportion of those 65 and above is increasing at a faster rate than those below that age, according to World Population Prospects, a United Nations study. Between 2022, when the report was issued, and 2050, the global population of those over 65 is expected to rise to 16% from 10%. People are already working longer, and, as they do, it would appear that a road map is needed, a means of understanding what keeps people like Martha Stewart not only undiminished by age but actively in the game.
Over the past months, we asked what makes people like Stewart so seemingly unstoppable. Is there an explanation for why, besides prosperity and good health, some people are driven to chase their dreams long past the age when recent history suggests we were meant to be kicking back in our rocking chairs?
The Unstoppables is a series about people whose ambition is undimmed by time. All interviews have been edited and condensed.
— Martha Stewart, 82, Has ‘Never-Ending Curiosity’ (And a Few Regrets).
This year I made time to grow the best vegetables, monster vegetables, that I’ve ever grown in my life. My houses are never done. And I’m writing my autobiography. That’s the scariest project for me because I don’t really like everything about myself — where I’ve been, what I’ve done.
I get up at 6:30 every morning. My housekeeper comes at 7, and I can’t be in bed when she arrives. That would be very embarrassing. I’m a bad sleeper, in any case. At times I’d rather watch a documentary. Other times, I might be anxious, not for me but for my grandchildren. If I wake in the night, I read the headlines to make sure we’re not being bombed.
Maybe a little uncertainty can help fuel ambition. When I left my job on Wall Street, I knew I had to create a career for myself. I became a caterer, catering parties every night. Still I thought, “Will there come a time when my granddaughter — she’s 12 — is asked, “What did grandma do?” And all she can say is “Oh, she made parties for people.” I thought, “I have to do something more than this.” That was in the 1980s, when I wrote my first book, the one on entertaining.
At that time I wasn’t keeping my eye on the home, even though I was known as a homemaker. It wasn’t enough for a marriage. Maybe I regret not having had more children. Maybe I regret that my marriage ended abruptly. We’d been together 27 years. That used to be considered a long time, so when a long marriage ended, it was like somebody died. Maybe I would have liked getting married again. I didn’t, but I don’t mind. Still, I’m curious about what could have been.
My never-ending curiosity drives me. Will it stop? That’s never even occurred to me.
Current and upcoming projects : Autobiography in progress; an untitled Martha Stewart documentary from R.J. Cutler, who directed “The September Issue,” to stream on Netflix in 2024; a PBS documentary series, “Hope In the Water,” set for broadcast in 2024; a partnership with Samsung for a 2023-24 advertising campaign; a line of gardening clothes and accessories in collaboration with French Dressing Jeans and Marquee Brands.
— RUTH LA FERLA Betye Saar, 97, Is Making Some of the Best Work of Her Life.
Being raised during the Depression, we all learned to be creative with what we had on hand. At Christmas or on my birthday, I always got art supplies, and I was jealous that my siblings got bikes and stuff. I realize now that my parents were fostering my creativity.
An early influence on my becoming an artist was Simon Rodia. My grandmother lived in Watts, and we would walk by the Watts Towers when they were being built. I was fascinated by how he used bottle caps and corn cobs and broken plates — trash, essentially — to make art, to make something beautiful. Then, much later, in the 1960s, I saw the work of Joseph Cornell. He refined the use of found objects and materials and boxes, and I thought, “Wow, I’ve kind of been doing that, too.” I didn’t know it was called assemblage, but it made sense to me and set me in that direction as an artist.
The main challenge, I guess, to being an artist is how to make a living. But being a creative person means you have to find ways to do this. I studied design at UCLA, and after I graduated, I made greeting cards; I made jewelry; I got into printmaking and then sold my prints. I taught art classes in colleges all over the states. My creativity kept evolving with my needs as I got married and bought a house, had my daughters and put them through college. Through it all, I loved making art. It kept me going.
I still want to make art. Sometimes in the morning when I wake up, it’s hard to get out of bed, hard to get back into my body and get it to move. But I do it. Not everyone has a reason to get out of bed, something they love to do and that gives their life meaning. I am so lucky that I have that as part of my life. I don’t really think about my age, unless someone mentions it, though I guess I feel middle-aged — which for me is, like, 50 to 70. It would be kind of neat to live to 100, to have 100 revolutions around the sun. I’m pretty close.
Current and upcoming projects : Completed “Drifting Toward Twilight,” an installation at the Huntington Library in New York City; “Betye Saar: Heart of a Wanderer” exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston; “Betye Saar: Serious Moonlight” at the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, Switzerland; and completed a newly commissioned artwork for “Paraventi; Folding Screens from the 17th to the 21st Century” at the Fondazione Prada in Milan.
— GUY TREBAY Joan Collins, 90, Refuses to Be Defined by Age
I love writing; I love acting, going onstage and doing my little one-woman show; and I refuse to be defined by a number, by an age. I think that’s terribly old-fashioned and not relevant in today’s world.
But you have to be resilient in this business. Rejection is a part of it. I look with dismay at so many of my fellow actors, fallen by the way because of drink and drugs. My father — he was a theatrical agent — instilled in me that I should develop skin like a rhinoceros and be like a marshmallow on the inside.
You also need patience. This business is a waiting game. For example, a script was written for me about the Duchess of Windsor [Wallis Simpson]. I’ve been wanting to do it since the 1980s. We got a green light only a month ago. Years ago I thought it would be wonderful to do a picture about growing up with my sister, Jackie. It just hasn’t come off.
It would be set when we were children, during the Blitz. At the time I didn’t feel fear. I didn’t know about the bombings. We would pick up shrapnel in the streets, and in the evening I would put it in my cigar box. We would draw silly pictures of Hitler. We were evacuated 10 or 12 times. We would be in the tube stations, and people would be playing their harmonicas and singing.
A question I’m often asked is, “Why are you still working?” It’s such a fatuous thing to say. I keep on working because I love being busy. It’s tiring when I do my one-woman show, going to a new hotel every night. But it’s rewarding. The audience is so responsive. That buoys me.
Current and upcoming projects : “Behind the Shoulder Pads, Tales I Tell My Friends,” a memoir; “Joan Collins Unscripted,” a British theatrical tour.
— RUTH LA FERLA Giorgio Armani, 89, Doesn’t Think Much About Age
For those of us who grew up in the shadow of war, ambition was something natural, a vital drive. It was not so much a desire for fame and notoriety but rather an urge for personal fulfillment, a way to assert oneself outside the hardship and to overcome it. My mother and father taught me the value of commitment and hard work to get things done. It is a lesson that has never left me.
It took me some time to find my way. First, I studied medicine, then came La Rinascente [an Italian department store, where Armani worked in display] and Cerruti — fashion, in other words. That was the moment when I found my ambition, when I discovered the power of clothes not only to change the way you look but, more profoundly, to influence the way you are and behave.
I think the challenges — or problems — and the rewards of staying in the game go hand in hand if you do this work for as long as I have and if you remain present. The main pressure is staying relevant without giving in to the pressures of the moment, which often feel very urgent but are forgettable in the long run.
In truth, I don’t think about age much. In my head, I am the same age I was when I started Giorgio Armani. Situations and people change, but the challenges and problems are all the same in the end. My way of tackling them hasn’t changed — with great determination. Audiences evolve, however, and this cannot be underestimated. Stylistic coherence, therefore, must be elastic. Otherwise one becomes rigid. The ultimate gratification is to become a classic — outside of and above fashion — and to be identified with a style.
Current and upcoming projects : Designed 14 men’s, women’s and haute couture collections in 2023.

Is Apple Antitrust Suit An Echo of Microsoft?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prosecutors compare their new fight against Apple to the seminal case against Windows in the 1990s.
Impeding innovation. Reducing consumer choice. Extending dominance to other markets.
These are accusations that the Justice Department leveled against a technology giant it accused of running an illegal monopoly. But they aren't from this week's antitrust lawsuit against Apple -- they're from the case the department brought against Microsoft in 1998.
The move against Apple is, along with the Justice Department's 2020 lawsuit against Google over search, perhaps the most ambitious tech antitrust battle since the Clinton administration's effort to open up Microsoft's Windows operating system.
And federal prosecutors are explicitly connecting the Apple lawsuit to that earlier fight. "They're really presenting this case as a successor to that: Microsoft 2.0," said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.
But the comparison isn't perfect. And it isn't clear whether the Justice Department will be able to achieve here what it claims to have done by suing Microsoft.
The Justice Department sees a direct connection between the two cases. "Microsoft" appears 26 times in the Apple complaint. And prosecutors say Apple wouldn't have achieved its current towering success had it not been for the government's fight against Microsoft:
The iPod did not achieve widespread adoption until Apple developed a cross-platform version of the iPod and iTunes for Microsoft's Windows operating system, at the time the dominant operating system for personal computers. In the absence of the consent decree in United States v. Microsoft, it would have been more difficult for Apple to achieve this success and ultimately launch the iPhone.
In the 1998 case, the Justice Department argued that Microsoft illicitly sought to protect its Windows software from competition like the Netscape Navigator browser and Apple's QuickTime multimedia software.
This week, the agency said Apple was doing something similar, unlawfully restricting competition by denying rivals access to key iPhone features like its contactless payment chip. "Each step in Apple's course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly," prosecutors wrote in Thursday's lawsuit.
The Justice Department sees another opportunity. Any hold Microsoft had on the emerging internet economy, the agency says, was broken, allowing companies like Google, Facebook and, yes, Apple, to prosper.
"Today, we stand here, once again, to protect competition and innovation for the next generation of technology," Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said at Thursday's news conference.
Others say the Microsoft case's legacy is less clear. Hurwitz told DealBook that the reality was more complicated. Netscape failed in part because a botched upgrade turned off users, while Microsoft missed out on the dawn of internet 2.0 services because of bad strategic decisions.
"In terms of actual industrial changes, I think the case yielded very little," Hurwitz said.
The comparison of the lawsuits falls short in several ways. For one, the Apple case is more ambitious, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. While both cases accused companies of using exclusivity to hamper rival technologies, the more recent case also demands that Apple ease operability across platforms, like ensuring that text messages from iPhone and Android devices work the same.
Then there is the matter of defining market share. In 1998, over 80 percent of Intel-based personal computers used Windows software. By contrast, the iPhone had about 64 percent of the U.S. smartphone market at the end of last year, according to one estimate. (Globally, it's closer to 20 percent.) That said, federal prosecutors say Apple controls 70 percent of what they call the "performance" smartphone market, which also includes high-end devices by Samsung and Google.
And technology advances more quickly than it did in 1998. Smartphones could evolve in unexpected directions by the time the Apple case wraps up, potentially limiting the case's effect on innovation. "Technology is racing ahead like a Formula 1 automobile," Kovacic said, "and antitrust is riding a bicycle trying to catch up."
The Microsoft fight does underscore the risks Apple faces. Regardless of what the earlier antitrust lawsuit accomplished, Microsoft was tied up in litigation for years, a costly distraction. Apple -- which is already battling tighter regulations around the world -- will have to devote some of its considerable resources to defending itself here.
"That might open up opportunities for competitors," Hurwitz said. But he added, "That's not necessarily the best way of facilitating competition in the market." -- Michael J. de la Merced and Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Microsoft poached an artificial intelligence pioneer. The Windows maker hired Mustafa Suleyman, a former Google executive, and most of the staff at Inflection AI, the start-up he co-founded. Suleyman will lead Microsoft's consumer A.I. business.
The Federal Reserve reiterated expectations to cut rates three times this year. The central bank held interest rates steady at about 5.3 percent, with inflation not yet at the Fed's 2 percent target. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said the economy was performing strongly, a sign that a recession may not be needed to bring down inflation.
The Biden administration issued one of its toughest climate rules yet. New Environmental Protection Agency regulations will require most cars sold in the United States to be electric or hybrid by 2032. The rules will gradually limit allowed tailpipe emissions, but will give carmakers more time to adapt than previously planned.
Donald Trump's social media company merged with a shell company. Shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corporation voted to give the parent company of Truth Social its stock market listing. The transaction will add $ 3 billion to Trump's wealth, potentially providing a new cash source to pay his mounting legal bills.
Redditors on the Reddit I.P.O.
Reddit is the first social media company to go public since Snap in 2017. It is also the first to do so in the meme stock era, making its own users one of the biggest risks to its share price. Leading up to the initial public offering on Thursday, some wondered if Reddit users on forums like WallStreetBets, which helped power the rise of meme stocks, would try to manipulate the company's share price as they did for GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. But Ivan Cosovic, the managing director of the data company Breakout Point, told DealBook that chatter in the community had been "a mix of short-term excitement driven by FOMO and long-term skepticism based on fundamentals."
Mentions of RDDT, Reddit's stock ticker symbol, on WallStreetBets peaked after its shares started trading Thursday afternoon, rising to be on a par with mentions of the chipmaker Nvidia, a favorite stock of retail investors. But they amounted to just 5 percent of the daily mentions of GameStop in January 2021, when the forum helped drive the retailer's stock up more than 1,700 percent. And they petered out shortly after Reddit's shares listed.
Opinions on the forum largely varied between two extremes. "This is a death sandwich, which exists purely as VC exit liquidity," read one popular post. Another said users bashing Reddit's stock in the forum "all use it for 12 hours a day and would be helpless without it."
How China views the new U.S. crackdown on TikTok
Dan Wang is a leading observer of contemporary China. As a tech analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, and through his well-read newsletter, Wang has charted the country's rise as a fast-growing high-tech economy and, more recently, its slowdown and rising tensions with the United States.
Wang is now a visiting scholar at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center and writing a book about the relationship between China and the U.S. The interview has been edited and condensed.
How does China see the latest TikTok fight?
Chinese state media and the government have made it clear that this is very unwelcome. China feels that ByteDance is a very, very successful company that is being bullied in America because it is Chinese. The Chinese people are affronted by the U.S. government declaring it a national security threat. And Beijing has passed laws that recommendation algorithms are subject to Chinese export controls, so the sense is that the government will not allow a sale to go through.
Is the Chinese government using the case as a propaganda tool?
State media is keeping its powder dry because there are still several steps before ByteDance might have to sell TikTok in the U.S. These include Senate passage, the White House's signature, as well as the legal challenges that ByteDance is sure to bring. Before this looks imminent, state media is not rallying citizens to object too much.
What does it look like when state media mobilizes the public?
In 2022, Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and a lot of Western companies made anodyne statements. Chinese state media seized on one company, H&M, which made a fairly typical statement that it did not source from Xinjiang or tolerate forced labor in its supply chains. China's Communist Youth League reposted a statement on social media saying that you cannot both make money in China as well as criticize China. That incited a consumer boycott. H&M products disappeared from pretty much all e-commerce sites, and H&M stores disappeared from online maps. The company was essentially erased from the Chinese internet, and it was really difficult to buy its products or find its physical stores.
How could China retaliate toward U.S. companies?
The more important question is: Does Beijing decide that this act is worthy of retaliation? I spent all four years of President Trump's trade war living in China, and Beijing was highly forbearing toward U.S. companies.
First, Beijing realizes that big U.S. companies are major employers in China, like Apple, through Foxconn, as well as Tesla. Second, Beijing realizes that American businesses are its last best friends left in Washington, and it would prefer that American companies continue to lobby Congress to maintain ties. It would also prefer that Elon Musk doesn't spend all day tweeting about how terrible China is.
Is China playing a long game?
Beijing might well treat this as a pretty substantial propaganda victory if the U.S. government forces a sale or actually bans TikTok. It would play into Beijing's hands to say that the U.S. has been talking about free speech for a long time but this illustrates that the U.S. is a hypocrite.
How is the fact that Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary, is working on a bid to buy TikTok perceived?
If it is successful, it would be viewed as in bad taste -- not just in China but pretty much everywhere -- that an official who ordered a sale then ends up actually owning it. For Beijing, it would be the cherry on the cake in terms of its propaganda.

Apple Aims To Rewrite Patent Rules: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After losing two complaints before the U.S. International Trade Commission, Apple has stepped up its lobbying to change the agency's practices.
Over the past decade, some of Apple's biggest regulatory headaches have come from a little-known federal agency called the U.S. International Trade Commission. The agency's patent judges have found Apple guilty of appropriating innovations in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches. And recently, they forced Apple to remove a health feature from Apple Watches.
Now the tech giant is pushing back. While it defends itself from patent complaints before the I.T.C., Apple has begun lobbying lawmakers to help rewrite the agency's rules.
The company has been campaigning across Washington for legislation that would make some patent owners ineligible to bring complaints before the I.T.C. It has sought to influence the language of committee reports that could affect how the agency levels punishments. And it has added to its lobbying might by enlisting one of the agency's former commissioners.
The lobbying effort comes as Apple is enmeshed in a multiyear legal battle with two U.S. medical device makers over technology in the Apple Watch. The companies, AliveCor and Masimo, filed complaints in the I.T.C. against Apple in 2021 for appropriating innovations they had developed to measure the heart's electrical activity and people's blood oxygen levels.
After losing both cases, Apple this year removed the technology to measure blood oxygen in its watches, which infringed on Masimo's patent. It is appealing the I.T.C.'s decision. A similar punishment is on hold as court proceedings continue related to the I.T.C.'s finding that Apple infringed on AliveCor's innovations with the Apple Watch's electrocardiogram feature.
Apple is trying to blunt the agency's signature power. Unlike traditional patent courts, where juries or judges typically issue fines, the I.T.C.'s judges can discipline a company that violates a patent by banning imports of the infringing product.
Because Apple makes all its signature devices overseas, a block on the import of its devices would be perilous to the company. To avoid that penalty in the future, the company says, it wants the agency to put the public interest of a product ahead of a ban. The company is betting that the court would then give more credence to Apple's argument that Americans would be harmed by an import ban because they would lose access to the communication and health features in iPhones and Apple Watches.
An Apple spokeswoman said the existing law requires that the I.T.C. consider how the public interest could be affected before ordering an import ban. But it said public data showed that the agency had made public-interest evaluations in only one-fifth of cases it had heard since 2010. As a result, its lobbyists have been talking with White House and congressional leaders about the I.T.C., as well as other issues such as privacy and domestic manufacturing.
Adam Mossoff, a patent law expert and a professor at George Mason University, said Apple was misinterpreting the law, which requires the I.T.C. to block a product if it finds that it infringes on a patent. An import ban is supposed to be overruled only if there's a proven threat to health or safety, he said. Blocking sales of an Apple device wouldn't qualify as harmful.
"The problem with their lobbying is that they're trying to neuter a well-functioning court by closing its doors to Americans who have had their rights infringed," he said.
When Congress set up what became the I.T.C. in 1916, it wanted to protect American innovation by allowing the U.S. government to ban the import of products with stolen technology. But as manufacturing moved overseas, the federal agency's court system became a forum for disputes between U.S. companies.
The I.T.C.'s judges, who are appointed by the commission, hold hearings with different standards for patent disputes than those that govern District Court cases. The cases are fast and compressed and can culminate with the judge's punishing a patent abuser by blocking its products.
Before a ban is put into effect, a company that's found guilty can appeal to the White House for a reprieve. But it's rare for an administration, which oversees the agency, to go against a judge's recommendation.
Apple has become the pre-eminent example of how the I.T.C. can be used. Because the company manufactures almost all its products overseas, the judges who have found it guilty of infringing on patents in smartphones, semiconductors and smartwatches say it should be punished by blocking the import of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.
Apple has largely escaped the import bans. In 2013, the Obama administration vetoed the I.T.C.'s plan to block iPhone imports after the agency determined that Apple had infringed on one of Samsung's smartphone patents. In 2019, Apple agreed to pay Qualcomm a royalty for some wireless technology patents, heading off an I.T.C. ruling that could have blocked iPhone sales. And after losing the Masimo case, Apple agreed to remove the infringing health feature to dodge an Apple Watch ban.
For years, Apple avoided the kind of lobbying that was customary for a large corporation. It kept a small office in Washington staffed by just a few people and employed only one lobbying firm, two people familiar with the company's practices said. But as regulatory challenges to its business have risen, its policy team has swelled to include dozens of people and 11 lobbying firms.
In the face of the patent complaints from AliveCor and Masimo, Apple's team in Washington gave priority to lobbying to change the I.T.C. In 2022, it began working with the ITC Modernization Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of companies that includes Samsung, Intel, Dell, Google, Verizon and Comcast. The group worked with members of Congress as it wrote the Advancing America's Interest Act in 2019 and supported its reintroduction in 2023.
The bill's backers -- Representatives David Schweikert, a Republican from Arizona, and Donald S. Beyer Jr., a Democrat from Virginia -- have promoted it as a way to curb abuse of the I.T.C. by patent trolls. It would prohibit patent holders from suing unless they manufactured a product that used the patented technology or had licensed the technology to someone else already.
AliveCor and Masimo are medical companies that have focused on selling products to health care providers and consumers more than licensing innovations to consumer technology companies like Apple.
Last year, Apple's lobbyists filed three reports disclosing that it had campaigned on behalf of the bill, according to Open Secrets, a campaign finance research nonprofit. It also added to its lobbying ranks by hiring Deanna Tanner Okun, a former I.T.C. chair who works for the law firm Polsinelli. (The hiring was previously reported by Politico.)
The lobbying campaign coincided with an effort to argue in Washington that an I.T.C. ban on Apple Watch imports would deprive people of a device that was crucial to their health, two people familiar with the lobbying said.
In addition to lobbying directly on legislation, Apple worked with a member of Congress to put language on Page 97 of a committee report for the 2024 Appropriations Bill, said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado. The language would require the I.T.C. to review how it determined the value to the public of a product before suggesting a ban and to report to Congress on that process.
"To me, this went around the legitimate process," said Mr. Buck, who is leaving Congress this month. He told Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky who is on the Rules Committee, that he had 10 votes and would block the bill unless the language was removed. Mr. Massie's office confirmed that the language had been removed at Mr. Buck's request but declined to comment further.
An Apple spokeswoman disagreed with Mr. Buck's claims that its lobbying circumvented the legitimate legislative process. She said its public federal lobbying reports detailed how it worked on issues important for its products and customers.
The spokeswoman also pointed to the Senate's passage of a committee report with a sentence expressing its support of the I.T.C.'s doing thorough analysis of the public health implications of a product ban before issuing one, which is what Apple wants in the future.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The award, announced by President Biden at a plant in Arizona, is the biggest the government has made under a new program that aims to rebuild the nation's semiconductor manufacturing industry.
President Biden on Wednesday awarded $ 8.5 billion in grants to Intel, a major investment to bolster the nation's semiconductor production, during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.
Speaking from the Intel campus in Chandler, Ariz., Mr. Biden said the award would support thousands of new manufacturing jobs, including ones that do not require a college degree.
"It's going to transform the semiconductor industry," Mr. Biden said. "Where the hell is it written saying that we're not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world again?"
The award, which will go to the construction and expansion of Intel facilities around the United States, is the biggest the federal government has made with funding from the CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022 to help re-establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.
The Biden administration, equipped with $ 39 billion in subsidies to distribute, is spearheading an ambitious effort to ramp up production of the tiny chips that power everything from smartphones to computers and cars. The effort is at the center of Mr. Biden's goal to reduce America's reliance on foreign countries: Although semiconductors were invented in the United States, only about 10 percent of the world's chips are made domestically.
"Nearly all manufacturing of leading-edge chips across the entire industry moved overseas to Asia years ago," Mr. Biden said. "That's why today's investment is such a big deal: We will enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America."
In addition to the grants, the federal government is planning to award Intel up to $ 11 billion in loans on what the company characterized as generous terms. Intel is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the expense of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $ 100 billion over five years.
The grants are intended to help fund the company's construction plans in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The projects are expected to create more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and roughly 20,000 construction jobs, according to Biden administration officials.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose department is overseeing the distribution of the grants, said the award would help ramp up the country's production of the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones, supercomputers and the most sensitive military hardware. The United States currently produces none.
Ms. Raimondo said the Intel award would be the single largest grant to a chipmaker under the new program. The investment will help put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's leading-edge chips by the end of the decade, she said.
"This investment will enable Intel to produce leading edge, the most sophisticated chips in the world that will power our economic and national security," Ms. Raimondo said at the Intel campus on Wednesday.
In Arizona, the money will help fund Intel's recent construction of two advanced plants and the modernization of another facility. The money will also help establish an entirely new site near Columbus, Ohio, starting with two factories, in its first move to a new U.S. region in more than 40 years.
In Rio Rancho, N.M., Intel will use the federal funds to transform two plants into advanced packaging facilities, where chips are assembled together to enhance performance and reduce costs. The company will also expand and modernize an innovation hub in Hillsboro, Ore., which is expected to further the company's technological leadership and development of new innovations.
Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies view the semiconductor investments as a key way to try to turn around perceptions of the economy among voters in battleground states like Arizona.
"We have not been talking to folks about the issues that President Biden has been delivering on, and that's what we are determined to do," Yolanda Bejarano, the Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman, said on Tuesday, adding that Democrats would need to talk more about the effects of the semiconductor investments.
Although Intel will have to meet certain milestones before the money is distributed, senior Biden administration officials said they expected the funds to start flowing to the company by the end of this year.
Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday evening that the government incentives represented a proud moment for his company and a major achievement for politicians of both parties. Though satisfied with the incentives earmarked for Intel, he said officials might need to invest more in the industry to reverse decades of shifting investment from the United States to countries in Asia.
"It doesn't get fixed in one three- to five-year program," Mr. Gelsinger said. "I do think we'll need at least a CHIPS 2 to finish that job."
Intel is the fourth company to receive a federal award under the new program, and brings the total announced grants to more than $ 10 billion. The first three grants -- to GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems -- were to makers of legacy chips, which are created with older production processes but are still used in many products like cars and dishwashers.
Biden administration officials are expected to announce more awards in the coming months to other major chipmakers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Micron Technology. Those companies have also made major investments in new or expanded semiconductor manufacturing plants in the United States in recent years.
The United States' dependence on Asia for its chips has become even more pronounced with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nearly all chips used to power the latest generative A.I. services were manufactured in Taiwan by T.S.M.C., though designed by the Silicon Valley company Nvidia.
Intel has been trying to change that by developing new manufacturing technology, beginning to build chips designed by other companies and lobbying heavily for the legislation. The investment in Intel is intended to help enable U.S. companies to lead in the A.I. industry by ensuring there is a domestic supply of advanced chips.
About $ 50 million of federal funding will be set aside for Intel to spend on training and developing "a new generation of workers for the semiconductor industry," Mr. Biden said. Many semiconductor companies and industry groups have voiced concerns about potential shortages of technicians, engineers and other workers to fill all of the positions that will be created once the facilities are constructed.
In total, private companies have announced more than $ 240 billion in semiconductor and electronic manufacturing investments since Mr. Biden took office, according to administration officials. Some chipmakers, however, have run into obstacles while trying to expand their domestic manufacturing capacity, resulting in delays.

Apple Talking to Google About A.I. for iPhone: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A partnership would extend the long relationship between the companies that has helped deliver everything from maps to search on Apple's devices.
Apple is in discussions with Google about using the search giant's generative artificial intelligence model called Gemini for its next iPhone, as the company races to embrace a technology that has upended the tech industry.
The talks are preliminary and the exact scope of a potential deal hasn't been defined, three people with knowledge of the discussions said. Apple has also held discussions with other A.I. companies, one of these people said, as it looks to tap into the power of a large language model capable of analyzing vast amounts of data and generating text on its own.
Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, has promised investors that the company will introduce new generative A.I. capabilities this year. The company's smartphone rivals, Samsung and Google, have already added Gemini to their newest devices to edit videos and summarize audio recordings.
Apple and Google declined to comment. Bloomberg reported earlier on their talks.
An Apple-Google deal on generative A.I. would extend one of technology's most longstanding partnerships. Since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Google has been a critical contributor to the device's success. It initially provided Google Maps for navigation and the default search engine on the iPhone's Safari browser, now a lucrative agreement for which Google pays Apple more than $ 18 billion a year.
Google's discussions to provide generative A.I. capabilities for the iPhone would be the latest example of its filling a gap in Apple's products. Apple's effort to develop its own large language model, the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, has been running behind, two people familiar with its development said.
Apple's delay in releasing an A.I. product has been costly. After a decade-long run as the world's most valuable public company, it was dethroned this year by Microsoft, which has aggressively pursued A.I. The technology has been heralded for its potential to disrupt businesses and create trillions of dollars in economic value.
Despite its delays, Apple has the potential to be a big player in A.I. The company has more than two billion devices actively in use, making it an attractive partner for Google and others. Its reputation for protecting customers' private information could also be helpful in a future where A.I. services help manage people's calendars or health data.
A deal could bring the Gemini model to iPhones around the world, giving Google access to a massive user base and making generative A.I. even more mainstream. Virtually overnight, Google could have more consumers using its A.I. than its chief rival, OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT -- making a pact with Apple a tantalizing prospect.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Apple's selecting Google as an A.I. supplier would be a crucial vote of confidence in the search giant after a number of setbacks to its A.I. ambitions. The company's first A.I. chatbot, Bard, debuted to middling reviews last March and struggled to attract as many users as ChatGPT.
In February, Google debuted a new chatbot, Gemini. The chatbot ran into problems last month when users found that its image generator produced illustrations of historical figures that were not racially accurate and refused in most instances to generate images of white people, leading to accusations of bias. Google disabled the ability to create images of people and vowed to fix the problem.
In a note on Tuesday, a Bernstein Research analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, called an Apple-Google deal a "win-win," giving Apple generative A.I. for iPhones and validating Google's work on Gemini. He also said Apple didn't have to own an A.I. model on iPhones to profit from it and could instead take a commission from Google, which currently charges $ 19.99 per month for its Gemini Advanced app.
Companies haven't yet cashed in on generative A.I. The costs associated with running large language models in the cloud are staggering, and consumers and business customers are only starting to pay for the emerging technology. But they are optimistic that profits will increase as the capabilities of A.I. systems improve and the costs decline for building the data centers to power the systems.
A new deal between Apple and Google could draw scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The Justice Department is in the final stages of a lawsuit against Google for harming competition by paying Apple to be the default search engine on the iPhone and other services. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the nonjury trial, is expected to deliver a verdict this year.

Tips for Actually Using Your Phone as a Phone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The latest smartphone software includes tools to help you more easily connect with the people you want to contact -- and avoid those you don't.
With everything a smartphone can do these days, it's often easy to overlook one of the device's most basic functions: voice calls. Communicating by telephone has become more complicated in a world of robocalls and automated voice trees, but your phone may already have the tools to make talking to people (or not) easier. Here are a few suggestions.
Quickly Contact Businesses
Need to call a business that's not in your contacts list? Just search for the company online with Apple's Siri, the Google Assistant (or its new Gemini helper) or Samsung's Bixby. When you see the establishment listed in the search results, just tap the phone icon or telephone number to place the call -- or command the virtual assistant to do it.
(If sharing information with your assistant or using artificial-intelligence programs causes concern, read the software's privacy policy to see how the company is using your data.)
Screen Unwanted Callers
Don't waste valuable time on calls you didn't mean to answer. On an iPhone, open the Settings app, select Phone and scroll down to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Calls from numbers that aren't in your contacts list will now be muted and sent directly to voice mail.
Apple's Live Voicemail feature in iOS 17 offers a real-time transcription of messages being recorded -- and you have the option to connect with callers while they're leaving you a message, much like how it worked in the old days with answering machines. You can also send an incoming call right to Live Voicemail by tapping the Voicemail icon on the call screen. Live Voicemail can be toggled off or on in the Phone app's settings.
Android-based phones have their own call-management tools, but they vary by the model and software version. To see what is available for you, open the Phone app, tap the Menu icon (the three vertical dots) in the top-right corner and select Settings.
Google's own Pixel phones have several useful features, like the Call Screen tool that has the Google Assistant pick up and ask who's calling. Google's Phone app also has a Caller ID & Spam option, which can help identify callers and block spam calls. Samsung has a similar Smart Call feature in the Phone settings for its Android-based Galaxy devices, and its Bixby assistant can answer for you with the Text Call feature.
Call-screening features can be toggled off and on, for when you are expecting a call from someone not in your contacts list. And in Google's Contacts app, you can even route calls from selected numbers directly to voice mail.
Hand Off the Hold Queue
Apps and websites have taken over several customer-service tasks like rebooking flights, but sometimes you need to talk to a human. Many companies now use an automated callback service so you don't have to languish on hold, but in other cases the Google Assistant may be able to wait on your behalf.
Hold for Me, which became available on Google's Pixel phones in 2020, is one method. You need to enable Hold for Me in the Google Phone app's settings first, but when you later make a call and get put on hold, tap the Hold for Me option on the phone's screen. The Google Assistant waits and alerts you when a representative is on the line.
If you don't have a Pixel phone, there's the similar "Talk to a Live Representative" experiment from Google's Search Labs. It's available in the Google app for iOS and Android; tap the lab-flask icon in the upper-left corner to get to Search Labs. "Talk to a Live Representative" -- which is live until the end of 2024 -- lists the 1-800 numbers for several airlines and other businesses, and lets you request a call and calls you back when the representative is there. It's still experimental, though, and may not work consistently.
Don't Miss Calls
If you need to keep your ringer silenced but don't want to miss an important call, use a visual or vibration notification to alert you.
In iOS 17, go to the main Settings app to Accessibility and then Audio & Visual to LED Flash for Alerts. In Android 14, tap the Settings, go to Notifications and select Flash Notifications to get to the options for camera- and screen-flash alerts. You'll see a pop of light or color when you receive a call.
Flash-sensitive people should use the vibration alternative instead. In the Sound & Haptics settings on an iPhone, you can assign custom vibrations to callers. Android-powered phones, including the Pixel and Galaxy models, have their own adjustable vibration options.
You'll likely find even more helpful tools in your phone's settings once you start poking around. And you can enjoy the irony of using 21st-century software to assist with a communications method that has been around for 148 years as of this month.
Photograph The "Talk to a Live Representative" experiment in Google's Search Labs makes the call, waits on hold and alerts you when a live person is ready to talk.; Google's Android 14 system can visually alert you when a call comes in, although those with a sensitivity to flashing lights might want to stick with vibrations to quietly announce incoming calls.; There are many ways to help you avoid spam, identify incoming callers, or route certain calls straight to your voice mail, as in these options on Android.; Your smartphone's search engine can often help you find the right business, and you can call the company's number with one tap. Or you can command a virtual assistant to do all the work for you. (PHOTOGRAPHS VIA GOOGLE) This article appeared in print on page B4.

Google Settles Smaller Lawsuits in Preparation for Bigger Fights: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tech giant has recently spent more than $ 1 billion to resolve several legal claims as more battles with the Justice Department loom.
In December, Google spent $ 700 million to resolve states' claims that its Play Store had strong-armed app makers into high fees and tough terms. About six weeks after that, Google paid $ 350 million to end a lawsuit accusing it of improperly sharing users' private information.
On Monday morning, a Massachusetts company called Singular Computing said it had resolved its lawsuit with Google, involving claims that the tech giant had stolen its chip designs. Singular said in a news release that it had "entered into a settlement and patent license agreement with Google."
Google is also on the verge of a fourth legal settlement in three months to end claims that it has misrepresented the privacy settings of its Chrome web browser.
In just a few months, Google has spent well over $ 1 billion to clear the decks for court fights that could prove far more damaging to the company and that could reshape the entire internet industry: two suits brought by the Department of Justice, targeting Google's search engine and its advertising business.
The Justice Department accused Google of rigging the search market through preferential deals with phone makers like Apple and Samsung. The company will return to court in May for closing arguments in what is likely to be the biggest legal test for a tech company since U.S. v. Microsoft more than two decades ago.
In the other federal lawsuit, expected to go to trial in September, the Justice Department said Google "corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry" by taking control of the wide swath of tools that advertisers and publishers depended on to buy and sell ads. Google has denied wrongdoing in both cases, saying that its search engine promotes online competition and that its ad technology has provided a financial lifeline to publishers and other online businesses.
Google said in a statement that it was not clearing the decks for future litigation and had won dozens of cases in U.S. courts in the past year.
"When it makes sense, we settle cases to avoid prolonged, uncertain and costly litigation," José Castañeda, a Google spokesman, said. "And when we need to defend ourselves and the industry, we do."
The Justice Department could ask the court to prohibit Google's preferential deals with browser makers, and it could argue that distribution platforms for its search engine, such as the Chrome browser or Android operating system, should be spun out of the company.
The department has already argued that Google should be forced to spin off its advertising technology unit, to loosen the ad industry's dependence on the company. Any divestiture would be a costly and time-consuming process, chipping away at the company's revenue and influence.
Most of the recent settlements also followed the company's stunning loss to Epic Games, the maker of the hit game Fortnite, in a high-profile trial in December. Epic had claimed that Google undermined competition for app makers through high fees and stringent rules, and a San Francisco jury agreed. Google has started its appeal of the verdict, but a federal judge may order the company to accept more payment methods and app stores on Android's mobile operating system.
Douglas Melamed, a visiting fellow at Stanford Law School, said that "in this time of quite dramatic change in regulatory and legal risk for all these big technology platforms," Google might be thinking it was time to resolve smaller cases "just so we don't have it hanging over us."
Google's patent case with Singular revolved around some of the company's most important chips -- used to run artificial intelligence -- called tensor processing units. Singular had said its founder, Joseph Bates, met with Google from 2010 to 2014 and discussed his chip designs. Years later, Google's T.P.U.s infringed on two of Dr. Bates's patents, Singular argued when it filed its suit in late 2019.
Singular has cited an email from Jeff Dean, Google's chief scientist, in which he wrote that Singular's designs were "really well suited" to Google's chip initiatives. The parties agreed to settle the case in January.
Singular had sought $ 1.67 billion in damages. The companies declined to comment on the financial terms of their settlement. In its statement, Singular said Google had agreed to a patent license. The tech giant did not admit to being at fault.
"As we showed in court, Singular's patent doesn't apply to our tensor processing units, which were independently designed and built by Google engineers using Google technology over many years," Mr. Castañeda, the Google spokesman, said.
Dr. Bates, Singular's founder, said the company's goal was to give universities supercomputers, which he hopes "may help limit the concentration of power A.I. provides the big tech companies."
In the $ 700 million settlement with attorneys general for all 50 states, Google agreed to allow app makers to offer their own billing systems and app stores on Android devices. But crucially, Google can continue charging large companies fees regardless of how consumers pay, though app makers get a discount for processing their own transactions. If the states' claims had not been settled, they would have been heard during Epic's trial.
In December, Google said it would settle a class-action case that alleged the settings of its private browsing tab in Chrome, called incognito mode, weren't very private. The suit said Google had misled users by continuing to track their online activity in incognito mode.
The case had already created negative headlines for Google, including the disclosure that its chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, wrote to Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, complaining that incognito mode was difficult to market because it was "not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging."
A federal judge in California ordered Google to pay sanctions for missing discovery deadlines, making it cover some of the legal bills for the plaintiffs' lawyers, led by the high-profile lawyer David Boies. Google said in a statement that it had "cooperated with exhaustive discovery." A trial was scheduled to start in early February, and would have brought more disclosures about Google through evidence and testimony. The company said in December that it would settle the case, and an official settlement is expected to land this month.
"We settled because we essentially got what we could have gotten if we went to trial and won," Mr. Boies said in an interview.
In February, Google said it would pay $ 350 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit about a privacy breach at its defunct social media site, Google+. The service had inadvertently given developers access to users' information from 2015 to 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2018, and Google was accused of concealing the issue from users and regulators even after it fixed the problem.
The company had settled with Google+ users for $ 7.5 million in 2020, but the shareholder lawsuit persisted. Google had tried multiple times to get the case thrown out, including in 2022 when it unsuccessfully asked the Supreme Court to intervene. In the end, the only way to make the case go away was forging a deal.
It's possible in several of these cases that Google would have had to pay more money in damages than it settled for if they had remained in court, Mr. Melamed and other legal experts said.
"The problem with litigation is whenever you walk into court, there's an 80 percent chance that anything can happen, including you can get arrested," Mr. Melamed said, recounting the words of a friend. "It's just so unpredictable."

Migrants Pay a Price To Toil in South Korea: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Though a shrinking population makes imported labor vital, migrant workers routinely face predatory employers, inhumane conditions and other abuse.
Samsung phones. Hyundai cars. LG TVs. South Korean exports are available in virtually every corner of the world. But the nation is more dependent than ever before on an import to keep its factories and farms humming: foreign labor.
This shift is part of the fallout from a demographic crisis that has left South Korea with a shrinking and aging population. Data released this week showed that last year the country broke its own record -- again -- for the world's lowest total fertility rate.
President Yoon Suk Yeol's government has responded by more than doubling the quota for low-skilled workers from less-developed nations including Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, the Philippines and Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands of them now toil in South Korea, typically in small factories, or on remote farms or fishing boats -- jobs that locals consider too dirty, dangerous or low-paying. With little say in choosing or changing employers, many foreign workers endure predatory bosses, inhumane housing, discrimination and other abuses.
One of these is Chandra Das Hari Narayan, a native of Bangladesh. Last July, working in a wooded park north of Seoul, he was ordered to cut down a tall tree. Though the law requires a safety helmet when doing such work, he was not given one. A falling branch hit his head, knocking him out and sending blood spilling from his nose and mouth.
After his bosses refused to call an ambulance, a fellow migrant worker rushed him to a hospital, where doctors found internal bleeding in his head and his skull fractured in three places. His employer reported only minor bruises to the authorities, according to a document it filed for workers' compensation for Mr. Chandra without his approval.
"They would not have treated me like this if I were South Korean," said Mr. Chandra, 38. "They treat migrant workers like disposable items."
The work can be deadly -- foreign workers were nearly three times more likely to die in work-related accidents compared with the national average, according to a recent study. Such findings have alarmed rights groups and foreign governments; in January the Philippines prohibited its citizens from taking seasonal jobs in South Korea.
But South Korea remains an attractive destination, with more than 300,000 low-skilled workers here on temporary work visas. (Those figures do not include the tens of thousands of ethnic Korean migrants from China and former Soviet republics, who typically face less discrimination.) About 430,000 additional people have overstayed their visas and are working illegally, according to government data.
Migrant workers often land in places like Pocheon, a town northeast of Seoul where factories and greenhouses rely heavily on overseas labor. Sammer Chhetri, 30, got here in 2022 and sends $ 1,500 of his $ 1,750 monthly paycheck to his family in Nepal.
"You can't make this kind of money in Nepal," said Mr. Chhetri, who works from sunrise to dark in long, tunnel-shaped plastic greenhouses.
Another Nepalese worker, Hari Shrestha, 33, said his earnings from a South Korean furniture factory have helped his family build a house in Nepal.
Then there is the allure of South Korean pop culture, its globally popular TV dramas and music.
"Whenever I call my teenage daughter back home, she always asks, 'Daddy, have you met BTS yet?"' said Asis Kumar Das, 48, who is from Bangladesh.
For nearly three years, Mr. Asis worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, in a small textile factory for a monthly salary of about $ 2,350 -- which he did not regularly receive.
"They have never paid me on time or in full," he said, showing an agreement his former employer signed with him promising to pay part of his overdue wages by the end of this month.
Mr. Asis is far from alone. Migrant workers annually report $ 91 million in unpaid wages, according to government data.
The Labor Ministry said it is "making all-out efforts" to improve working and living conditions for these workers. It is sending inspectors to more workplaces, hiring more translators and enforcing penalties for employers who mistreat workers, it said. Some towns are building public dormitories after local farmers complained that the government was importing foreign workers without adequate housing plans.
The government has also offered "exemplary" workers visas that allow them to bring over their families. Officials have said that South Korea intends to "bring in only those foreigners essential to our society" and "strengthening the crackdown on those illegally staying here."
But the authorities -- who plan to issue a record 165,000 temporary work visas this year -- have also scaled back some services, for instance cutting off funding for nine migrant support centers.
In the decades after the Korean War, South Korea exported construction workers to the Middle East and nurses and miners to Germany. By the early 1990s, as it emerged as an economic powerhouse churning out electronics and cars, it began importing foreign workers to fill jobs shunned by its increasingly rich local work force. But these migrants, classified as "industrial trainees," were not protected by labor laws despite their harsh working conditions.
The government introduced the Employment Permit System, or E.P.S., in 2004, eliminating middlemen and becoming the sole job broker for low-skilled migrant workers. It recruits workers on three-year visas from 16 nations, and in 2015 also started offering seasonal employment to foreigners.
But severe issues persist.
"The biggest problem with E.P.S. is that it has created a master-servant relationship between employers and foreign workers," said Kim Dal-sung, a Methodist pastor who runs the Pocheon Migrant Worker Center.
That can mean inhumane conditions. The "housing" promised to Mr. Chhetri, the agriculture worker, turned out to be a used shipping container hidden inside a tattered greenhouse-like structure covered with black plastic shading.
During a bitter cold snap in December 2020, Nuon Sokkheng, a Cambodian migrant, died in a heatless shack. The government instituted new safety regulations, but in Pocheon many workers continue to live in substandard facilities.
If E.P.S. workers have abusive employers, they often have only two choices: endure the ordeal, hoping that their boss will help them extend or renew their visa, or work illegally for someone else and live in constant fear of immigration raids, the Rev. Kim said.
In December 2022, Ray Sree Pallab Kumar, 32, lost most of the vision in his right eye after a metal piece thrown by his manager bounced off a steel-cutting machine and hit him. But his employers, in southern Seoul, sought to blame him for the accident, according to a Korean-language statement they tried to make him sign even though he didn't understand it.
Migrants also say they face racist or xenophobic attitudes in South Korea.
"They treat people differently according to skin colors," said Mr. Asis, the textile worker. "In the crowded bus, they would rather stand than take an empty seat next to me. I ask myself, 'Do I smell?"'
Biswas Sree Shonkor, 34, a plastics factory worker, said his pay remained flat while his employer gave raises to and promoted South Korean workers he helped train.
Mr. Chandra said that even worse than workplace injuries like the one he suffered in the arboretum was how managers insulted foreign workers, but not locals, for similar mistakes.
"We don't mind doing hard work," he said. "It's not our body but our mind that tires."

POCHEON, South Korea — Samsung phones. Hyundai cars. LG TVs. South Korean exports are available in virtually every corner of the world. But the nation is more dependent than ever before on an import to keep its factories and farms humming: foreign labor.

Full text: Spurred by population growth and new patron support, artists from China, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines are getting more recognition from museums and the market.
Last year, Meeson Pae, a Korean American multidisciplinary artist, walked through the Frieze Los Angeles art fair and thought, "One day, I hope to be here."
This year, she will be, in the booth presented by the gallerist Anat Ebgi at the fair, at the Santa Monica Airport, which opens to V.I.P.'s on Thursday and to the public on Friday.
Pae is just one of the dozens of Asian artists, gallerists, curators and collectors in Los Angeles who over the last few years have been gaining recognition and attention from the city's galleries, museums and the marketplace. The art world's recent emphasis on equity and inclusion is moving beyond a focus on Black and Latino contributions to include Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, who have a long history in the city but until recently have tended to be left out of any discussion of the art market, and may have experienced discrimination -- even racist incidents -- during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Los Angeles, Asian Americans represent the third largest racial group, behind Latinos and whites. And California's Asian American and Pacific Islander population grew by 25 percent over the past decade, faster than any other ethnic group in the state.
This heightened sensitivity to inclusion has been making its way into the Los Angeles art world. Of the 98 galleries in Frieze Los Angeles this year, seven are from Asia -- up from only two in 2022. Three are participating for the first time.
And several U.S. galleries are highlighting Asian artists, including Lehmann Maupin, which will show Kim Yun Shin, the octogenarian Korean sculptor who just joined the gallery. Rachel Uffner will feature the mystical landscapes of Erica Mao, a Taiwanese American artist; and the Tina Kim gallery will show Jennifer Tee, a Chinese-Indonesian Dutch artist.
A first retrospective by Pacita Abad, a Filipino American artist, was recently at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, while the rising art star Mire Lee, of Korea and Amsterdam, was selected for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in October.
And Pace, in its booth here, will include work by the Chinese artist Li Songsong, whose thickly layered pigments will have their solo showing at the gallery's Los Angeles space in March.
"You enter any museum in any major city in the U.S. and it's full of Asians looking at art," said Isa Lorenzo, the founder of Silverlens, a Manila- and New York-based gallery that promotes Filipino art and will be in Frieze L.A. for the first time. "So why wouldn't they be able to enter a gallery or museum and see themselves?"
Similarly, at the Felix art fair, a satellite gathering at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, which opens Wednesday, Fridman Gallery of Manhattan is featuring works on paper by Azuki Furuya, a Japanese artist who recently earned an M.F.A. from Brooklyn College
Some galleries in Los Angeles are now run by Asians, including Make Room, which is owned and directed by Emilia Yin. In 2022 she was named one of Forbes's "30 Under 30," as a new force in the contemporary art world.
Yin started the gallery six years ago. "I was not seeing the kind of show that I felt connected to," she said. "It's got to start somewhere."
Art from Asia has also become an integral part of the program of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) over the last 20 years, one of many institutions increasingly highlighting shows of work from Japan, China and Korea with patrons' support.
Its permanent Asian art collection "has grown exponentially" said Stephen Little, the museum's curator of Chinese art and head of its Chinese, Korean, and South & Southeast Asian departments."Being on the Pacific Rim and surrounded in L.A. by many different Asian communities, we look to Asia," Little added.
LACMA on Sunday opened "Korean Treasures," 35 artworks -- including traditional paintings, calligraphic folding screens and ceramics -- recently donated by a former trustee, Chester Chang of Los Angeles, and his son, Cameron C. Chang. It was the largest gift of Korean art in the museum's history.
LACMA is nearing the end of a 10-year partnership with Hyundai, the South Korean auto company, to underwrite art and technology as well as Korean art scholarship, the longest and largest commitment from a corporate sponsor in the museum's history.
The Hammer Museum is bringing to town a show that explores the daring artists who emerged after the Korean War, "Only the Young: Experimental Art in Korea, 1960s-1970s," a collaboration with the Guggenheim in New York and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Korea.
The Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles this month opened "Scratching at the Moon," billed as "the first focused survey of Asian American artists in a major Los Angeles contemporary art museum."
"Given the Asian population in Southern California, it's pretty remarkable that there hasn't been a show like this before," said Anne Ellegood, the executive director of the I.C.A. "It feels like a bit of a moment and it's really important -- there simply hasn't been enough visibility for Asian and Asian American artists in the mainstream art world."
Various other galleries have been highlighting the work of Asian Americans. Perrotin is inaugurating its Los Angeles gallery during Frieze Week with a solo exhibition dedicated to the Japanese artist Izumi Kato. Blum gallery is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary with "Thirty Years: Written with a Splash of Blood," a survey of Japanese art from the 1960s to today.
Jeffrey Deitch, in 2022, presented "Wonder Women," featuring the work of "Asian American and diasporic women and nonbinary artists" -- like Zoé Blue M. and Tidawhitney Lek -- in a show curated by Kathy Huang. "What is the major innovation of the art world in the past decade?" Deitch asked. "It's been this opening up and embracing of the art community looking at great artists who have been neglected."
Several major East Asian collectors have over the last few years propelled the movement as they gained a higher profile in Los Angeles. Dominic Ng, 65, the Hong Kong-born chairman and chief executive of East West Bank, with headquarters in Pasadena, has just committed to a $ 10 million gift toward LACMA's expansion and future exhibitions.
Ng and his wife, Ellen, have helped LACMA build its collection of Chinese contemporary art, including buying a 12-foot-long Zeng Fanzhi painting, from 2018, for its permanent holdings.
The piece by Zeng, "who is considered by many to be China's greatest living artist," Ng said in a statement at the time, "contributes to the ongoing cultural exchange between the East and the West." LACMA recently announced that an exhibition of new works by Zeng, "Near and Far/Now and Then," will open during the Venice Biennale this spring in an installation by the architect Tadao Ando.
In 2007, East West Bank bought a $ 2-million collection of Chinese contemporary art for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Today there is an East West Bank Gallery at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures because of a $ 5 million gift, and an East West Bank Art Terrace at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco (named after Ng made a $ 5 million gift).
"My approach is, whenever there is an opportunity to support an art exhibition that helps give exposure to East Asian art, we're going to step up," Ng said in a recent interview.
(Other collectors include Miky Lee, the Samsung heiress, vice chair of the South Korean media conglomerate CJ Entertainment and executive producer of the film "Parasite," who serves on the board of the Hammer and as vice chair of the Academy Museum.)
But many Asian artists say they just want to be known and recognized for their work, not their ethnicity. Greg Ito, a fourth-generation Japanese American artist, whose grandparents met in an American internment camp, was born in Los Angeles. He said his work "is not about the Japanese American experience," but instead explores universal themes such as love and loss.
"Do I want my art to be about me being Asian? No," added Ito, who has a solo show opening at Ebgi's New York gallery in March. "It's more about the current state of the human condition."

LOS ANGELES — Last year, Meeson Pae, a Korean American multidisciplinary artist, walked through the Frieze Los Angeles art fair and thought, “One day I hope to be here.”
This year she will be, in the booth presented by gallerist Anat Ebgi at the fair, at the Santa Monica Airport, scheduled to open to VIPs Thursday and to the public Friday.
Pae is just one of the dozens of Asian artists, gallerists, curators and collectors in Los Angeles who over the past few years have been gaining recognition from the city’s galleries, museums and marketplace. The art world’s recent emphasis on equity and inclusion is moving beyond a focus on Black and Latino contributions to include Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, who have a long history in the city but until recently have tended to be left out of any discussion of the art market, and may have experienced discrimination — even racist incidents — during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Los Angeles, Asian Americans represent the third largest racial group, behind Latinos and whites. And California’s Asian American and Pacific Islander population grew by 25% in the past decade, faster than any other ethnic group in the state.
This heightened sensitivity to inclusion has been making its way into the Los Angeles art world. Of the 98 galleries in Frieze Los Angeles this year, seven are from Asia — up from only two in 2022. Three are participating for the first time.
And several U.S. galleries are highlighting Asian artists, including Lehmann Maupin, which will show Kim Yun Shin, an octogenarian Korean sculptor who just joined the gallery. Rachel Uffner will feature the mystical landscapes of Erica Mao, a Taiwanese American artist; and the Tina Kim gallery will show Jennifer Tee, a Chinese Indonesian Dutch artist.
A first retrospective by Pacita Abad, a Filipino American artist, was recently at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and rising art star Mire Lee, of Korea and Amsterdam, was selected for Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in October.
Pace, in its booth here, will include work by Chinese artist Li Songsong, whose thickly layered pigments will have their solo showing at the gallery’s Los Angeles space in March.
“You enter any museum in any major city in the U.S. and it’s full of Asians looking at art,” said Isa Lorenzo, founder of Silverlens, a Manila- and New York-based gallery that promotes Filipino art and will participate in Frieze LA for the first time. “So why wouldn’t they be able to enter a gallery or museum and see themselves?”
Similarly, at the Felix art fair, a satellite gathering at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, which opened Wednesday, Fridman Gallery of Manhattan is featuring works on paper by Azuki Furuya, a Japanese artist who recently earned an MFA from Brooklyn College.
Some galleries in Los Angeles are now run by Asians, including Make Room, which is owned and directed by Emilia Yin. In 2022 she was named one of Forbes’ “30 Under 30,” as a new force in the contemporary art world.
Yin started the gallery six years ago.
“I was not seeing the kind of show that I felt connected to,” she said. “It’s got to start somewhere.”
Art from Asia has become an integral part of the program of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) over the past 20 years. LACMA is one of many institutions increasingly highlighting shows of work from Japan, China and Korea with patrons’ support.
Its permanent Asian art collection “has grown exponentially,” said Stephen Little, the museum’s curator of Chinese art and head of its Chinese, Korean, and South & Southeast Asian departments.
“Being on the Pacific Rim and surrounded in LA by many different Asian communities, we look to Asia,” Little added.
LACMA on Sunday opened “Korean Treasures,” 35 artworks — including traditional paintings, calligraphic folding screens and ceramics — recently donated by a former trustee, Chester Chang of Los Angeles, and his son, Cameron C. Chang. It was the largest gift of Korean art in the museum’s history.
LACMA is nearing the end of a 10-year partnership with Hyundai, the South Korean auto company, to underwrite art and technology as well as Korean art scholarship, the longest and largest commitment from a corporate sponsor in the museum’s history.
The Hammer Museum is bringing to town a show that explores the daring artists who emerged after the Korean War, “Only the Young: Experimental Art in Korea, 1960s-1970s,” a collaboration with the Guggenheim in New York and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Korea.
The Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles this month opened “Scratching at the Moon,” billed as “the first focused survey of Asian American artists in a major Los Angeles contemporary art museum.”
“Given the Asian population in Southern California, it’s pretty remarkable that there hasn’t been a show like this before,” said Anne Ellegood, executive director of the ICA. “It feels like a bit of a moment, and it’s really important; there simply hasn’t been enough visibility for Asian and Asian American artists in the mainstream art world.”
Various other galleries have been highlighting the work of Asian Americans. Perrotin is inaugurating its Los Angeles gallery during Frieze Week with a solo exhibition dedicated to Japanese artist Izumi Kato. Blum gallery is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary with “Thirty Years: Written with a Splash of Blood,” a survey of Japanese art from the 1960s to today.

Chipmakers Seek Billions In Subsidies: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said new investments would put the U.S. on track to produce roughly 20% of the world's most advanced logic chips by the end of the decade.
Companies that produce the most advanced semiconductors have requested more than $ 70 billion in federal subsidies, roughly twice the amount of funding that is available, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday.
In an effort to revitalize domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, the federal government is distributing $ 39 billion in subsidies as an incentive for companies to produce more of the tiny chips that power everything from smartphones to cars and fighter jets. The funding is meant to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and reduce the country's reliance on foreign sources of chips. Currently, just 12 percent of chips are made in the United States.
The grants have so far proven popular among companies. In a speech on Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Ms. Raimondo said her department had received more than 600 statements of interest.
Federal officials have had to be "tough with companies," Ms. Raimondo said, adding that she has pushed company executives to "do more for less." She added that the level of interest also meant that officials would "have to say no to excellent companies."
Ms. Raimondo emphasized the need to bolster domestic production of the most technologically advanced chips, which are made largely in Taiwan.
Federal officials plan to award about $ 28 billion of the grants to firms that make such leading-edge chips, Ms. Raimondo said. Those semiconductors -- which are produced by companies including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel and Samsung -- are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones, supercomputers and the most sensitive military hardware.
"It's very hard, but it's our job to stretch the money as far as possible," Ms. Raimondo said in an interview on Monday.
She said the new federal investments would put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world's most advanced types of logic chips by the end of the decade -- currently, it produces zero, Ms. Raimondo said.
While companies might receive only a portion of the amount they originally requested, Ms. Raimondo said she was "very confident" that companies would still "do what they said they would do" with the money, in part because the government will hand out funding as certain milestones are met.
Ms. Raimondo emphasized that manufacturers could also benefit from other types of financial support besides the federal grants. The Commerce Department is able to support up to $ 75 billion in loans and loan guarantees to advance projects. Firms can also receive tax credits reimbursing them for 25 percent of project construction.
"It is a significant amount of money that each company will be receiving," she said.
Interest in the program has been so robust that federal officials, who originally aimed to help create at least two new large-scale manufacturing clusters to produce leading-edge logic chips, now expect to exceed that goal, Ms. Raimondo said.
During the event, Ms. Raimondo said the need for more chip production in the United States was heightened by the rise of artificial intelligence.
"A.I. will be the defining technology of our generation," she said. "You can't lead in A.I. if you don't lead in making leading-edge chips. And so our work in implementing the CHIPS Act just got a whole lot more important."
Federal officials have so far made three grant awards under the new program to companies that produce legacy chips, which are created with older production processes but continue to be used in a variety of products like cars and dishwashers. This month, the Biden administration awarded $ 1.5 billion to the New York chipmaker GlobalFoundries, which officials said would help secure a stable supply of chips for key auto suppliers and manufacturers.
Projects that will be completed by 2030 are receiving priority for awards, Ms. Raimondo said.
Private companies have announced $ 200 billion in semiconductor manufacturing investments since President Biden signed the CHIPS Act in 2022 and before federal officials have "put a single dollar out," Ms. Raimondo said.
Although there has been an uptick in investments, some chipmakers have run into obstacles while trying to expand their manufacturing footprint in the United States. TSMC, Intel, Microchip Technology and others have adjusted their production schedules as a sales slump in many types of chips has put pressure on the firms to manage their spending on new projects.
While the bulk of the money is set aside to cover the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities, the CHIPS Act also includes $ 11 billion to support research into new chip technologies.
Biden administration officials are already facing questions about the potential for another round of subsidies for chip manufacturers. Ms. Raimondo said officials could accomplish the goals of the program with the funding that was already available, but more money may be needed to further strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

Full text: Danni Liu and David Choi, who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy as a child, quickly embraced the joys and challenges in their relationship together.
On his Hinge dating profile, Yuwoon Choi answered a prompt: "All I ask is that you ... be open to dating someone in a wheelchair."
The prompt, in conjunction with his profession as general counsel at Samsung, caught Danni Liu's eye when she came across his profile in May 2023. She matched with him and started a conversation, but he responded at snail's speed. She thought he wasn't interested.
Four days after they matched, Mr. Choi, 37, asked her out on a date for the following Saturday. (Not the upcoming Saturday.)
"He had me waiting for two weeks, basically," Ms. Liu, 30, said. "From my experience, if someone really likes you, they want to see you sooner."
But in his defense, when they connected, he was in a "pessimistic streak," he said. "Having a disability obviously brings challenges to dating. I felt, maybe I'm just not going to find the one."
Mr. Choi, who goes by David, was very much interested in Ms. Liu, but he was "playing defensive," he said. He was hesitant to pour himself into a potential connection because he anticipated that it wouldn't work out anyway. And he didn't propose to meet that upcoming Saturday because his assistant was off that day and wouldn't be able to drive him to the date.
On the morning of their first date, Mr. Choi explained to Ms. Liu that he has muscular dystrophy, a disability that weakens muscle strength. When he was 6, he started falling a lot. At age 14, he began using a wheelchair.
Ms. Liu went to Google to learn more about muscular dystrophy, and she found out that it was also likely to shorten his life span. But that didn't dissuade her.
When Ms. Liu was 16, her father died in a car accident. As an only child, she and her mother had leaned on each other for support ever since. "I know that even though he's not around, it doesn't change the fact that we had a good time when he was alive," she said.
Ms. Liu and Mr. Choi met for lunch at Hi-Collar, a Japanese restaurant in Manhattan's East Village. He showed up early, and when she arrived, she was "a little shocked," she said. "I think I only pictured him in a manual wheelchair, and then I saw his power chair."
They ordered pasta and fried rice for the two of them to share. But when the food came, he said he wasn't hungry. He couldn't reach the communal dishes, and he didn't want to ask her for help.
"I've never wanted to take a girl aback by the type of needs I have or the challenges I have on the first date," Mr. Choi said. "People have different comfort levels with interacting with someone with a disability."
While Mr. Choi has a calm demeanor, Ms. Liu, who works with toddlers with autism and developmental delays as an applied behavior analysis therapist, is more bubbly. "It's pretty easy for me to start a conversation with anyone, to ask them questions," she said.
Indeed, they were having a great conversation. The two talked about the churches they attend and the countries they've visited. They talked about where they grew up: He was born in Seoul, grew up in Singapore and lived in Edgewater, N.J.; she was born and raised in Beijing and then moved to Manhattan for graduate school at Columbia.
An hour and a half into their first date, the restaurant was closing, but they still had a lot to discuss. She suggested they go to a cafe. They tried to go to a few cafes nearby, but they all had a step or two leading to the entrance, which made them inaccessible for Mr. Choi. Finally, they ended up at a restaurant in the East Village for drinks.
They asked for a table, but the hostess said that if they wanted drinks, they could only sit at the bar. "Can you make an exception for us?" Mr. Choi asked, after which the hostess led them to a table.
Ms. Liu had noticed that at Hi-Collar, Mr. Choi drank his water with a straw. So she asked the waiter for a straw and put it in his glass.
"Her asking that showed me she was paying attention to me and to my needs, and she wasn't awkward about it," Mr. Choi said, adding that he tends to feel self-conscious on dates. That gesture made him feel more comfortable and relaxed around her.
And Ms. Liu was feeling attracted to him, with the physical proximity of sitting next to him as opposed to across from each other. The conversation was flowing even more naturally. They even started being silly with each other.
Then, Ms. Liu had to leave. She was running late to dinner with a friend. They said their goodbyes, and that they wanted to see each other again.

Three days later, Mr. Choi attended an event at the New-York Historical Society, near her Upper West Side apartment. He texted her that he was in her neighborhood, so she told him to stop by her place. (Ms. Liu's mother was staying at her apartment at the time. She can't speak English, and he can't speak Mandarin, so they just smiled at each other.)
When Ms. Liu and Mr. Choi had some alone time together, she asked him if she could hold his hand, and he said yes. She was hoping he would kiss her, but he didn't. After she rode the elevator with him down to the ground level of her apartment building, she asked him if she could hug him. She was a bit sad when, again, he didn't kiss her. (He just wanted to respect her boundaries, he said.)
On their third date, one week after they met in person, Ms. Liu made the first move and kissed him. They had spent hours at Fornino, a pizza restaurant in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and then wandered around at a nearby park, sat down and soaked in the view of the Statue of Liberty. It was here that Mr. Choi told her that he really likes her, and that he would love to date her.
She agreed to be his girlfriend on their fifth date, and on the sixth date, she met his parents.
Over the months to come, Ms. Liu got to know his parents well. "They're also first-generation immigrants like me -- we're on the same wavelength," Ms. Liu said. She was surprised by how similar their cultures were. She also grew up listening to K-pop and learned some Korean, which she was able to practice with his parents.
In July, Mr. Choi's parents invited Ms. Liu's mother to their home in Harrington Park, N.J., for dinner. Mr. Choi and Ms. Liu were both a bit nervous, in part because of the language barrier. But Ms. Liu was the translator, and everyone was eating, laughing and having a great time.
"I remember sitting back at certain moments and just kind of observing, taking it all in," Mr. Choi said, "and being like, 'This could really work."' Mr. Choi's father started studying Mandarin every day to be able to communicate with Ms. Liu's mother.
They both grew fond of each other's parents. For Mr. Choi, her mother's love for him was "healing," he said. And Ms. Liu loved being pampered by his parents, who made her food and treated her to dinners.
Through trips to Broadway shows, movies, jazz clubs and museums, the couple got to know each other better and fell deeply in love. Three months after their first date, she sent his father a birthday card that read: "Don't you worry about David. I'll take care of him."
On Dec. 15, Mr. Choi proposed at the High Line. Ms. Liu's two friends took her and her mother to the elevated park for a walk, where he surprised her with a diamond ring in his hand. They then had dinner with family and friends at Eat Offbeat, a restaurant in Chelsea Market.
Ms. Liu, who works at the social services organization CARES, graduated from Jinan University in Guangzhou, China, with a bachelor's degree in teaching Chinese as a second language. She has a master of social work degree from Columbia and a master of special education from Arizona State University.
Mr. Choi is general counsel at Samsung SDS America, which provides cloud and digital logistics services. He has a bachelor's degree in political science from N.Y.U. and a law degree from Columbia Law School.
On Jan. 2, the couple were married at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, accompanied by Mr. Choi's parents and assistant and Ms. Liu's mother. Wanyi Mai, a city clerk, officiated. They then went to Jing Fong, a dim sum restaurant in Chinatown.
After their wedding, the couple moved into an apartment together in Jersey City, N.J.
"I can make sure that he exercises every day and eats healthy," Ms. Liu said.
Has he been eating healthy? "He ate Cheetos today," she said. "I have to pick my battles."
Mr. Choi has also been a vital support system for Ms. Liu, she said: "He encourages me when I feel discouraged and frustrated. He comforts me when I am anxious. He celebrates my joy and recognizes my successes and acts of kindness."
She's determined to help him with his health through physical and occupational therapy and acupuncture. And Mr. Choi has been receptive to her encouragement. Before meeting her, he had given up on such efforts: "I didn't really see the point," he said.
"Meeting Danni has definitely just changed the meaning and purpose of life for me," Mr. Choi said. "She's given me motivation -- I do have a family, and we do plan to have kids. She's given me something to fight for."

Where The Manhattan Marriage Bureau
Fashionably Late Mr. Choi was 30 minutes late to the wedding because the car that was supposed to take him to the ceremony had a flat tire. His assistant threw off his suit and worked to replace the tire.
A Big October Wedding The couple will have a larger wedding celebration in October at the Church of the Ascension in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with 120 guests. They're considering Mr. Choi's family's dog, Dooboo ("tofu" in Korean), to be the ring bearer. No dance party -- just dinner and good vibes.

Full text: AEG, the entertainment giant, is trying to organize large-scale training camps marketed to fans, as other sports have done. Will it work?
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Dan Perkin and Scott Bissmeyer, work buddies on vacation, sat on metal bleachers watching the Portland Timbers play the San Jose Earthquakes in the first of four preseason Major League Soccer games that day.
They had spent $ 125 each on V.I.P. day passes, which included food, drink and access to tents to keep cool. Self-described "M.L.S. road trippers," they have visited numerous M.L.S. stadiums, and have watched teams in Tucson, Ariz., where as many as 11 clubs came together for preseason training in the past.
But this year, with 12 M.L.S. teams -- along with two from the United Soccer League and four from the National Women's Soccer League -- gathered at a 1,000-acre property outside Palm Springs, Calif., for preseason training, Mr. Perkin and Mr. Bissmeyer decided to check it out.
"Compared to Tucson, they put on a nice operation here," Mr. Perkin said of the site, the Empire Polo Club, best known as the annual site of the Coachella Music Festival. "If you're going to drive six hours, we might as well treat ourselves."
M.L.S. -- and, more specifically, the entertainment conglomerate AEG, which owns the L.A. Galaxy, one of the league's 10 original franchises -- is hoping more fans start thinking like Mr. Perkin and Mr. Bissmeyer.
Pro sports leagues have for years tried to make money off their preseasons by marketing them to fans who want an up-close look at their team in a casual -- and less expensive -- setting. Major League Baseball has its spring training in Florida and Arizona, complete with exclusive jerseys and caps. National Football League teams open practices to fans during their training camps each summer. The National Basketball Association holds its Summer League in Las Vegas.
But during its 30-year history, M.L.S. had not had many large-scale training camps marketed to fans. The league experimented with the concept in the late 1990s, but the effort fell apart. Teams in warm-weather states prefer to stay home while other teams fly to Sun Belt states to train. Some teams prefer to travel to Spain, Mexico and beyond to prepare for the season. This month, Inter Miami flew to Asia and Saudi Arabia to showcase Lionel Messi, though an exhibition game in Hong Kong went awry when the Argentine star didn't play.
In late 2021, however, Dan Beckerman, chief executive of AEG, had an idea. What if the Empire Polo Club could be repurposed to host M.L.S. teams in February, a relatively quiet part of the calendar? Mr. Beckerman thought AEG could marshal its subsidiaries to sell sponsorships, tickets, merchandise and food to give the event the feel of baseball's spring training, where fans are able to see a number of teams playing close to one another.
"I wondered if we could create something like the Cactus League with some meaningful competition and quality fields," Mr. Beckerman said, referring to baseball's spring training in and around Phoenix. "But I had no idea if it could work."
Mr. Beckerman said cold-weather soccer clubs had for years asked the Galaxy if they could train at their facilities in Carson, Calif. But with only eight fields, there was never enough space. So despite the potential awkwardness of one M.L.S. team's making money off its rivals, Mr. Beckerman asked Tom Braun, the Galaxy's president of business operations, if the polo club, much of it lush Bermuda grass lawns, could be used.
Mr. Braun had a commitment from six teams before he discovered that many of the fields had divots from the polo horses and concert festivals. The Galaxy's head groundskeeper, Shaun Ilten, patched together enough fields in time for the inaugural training camp in 2022 that, because of Covid restrictions, did not have fans.
The teams were pleased, and last year a dozen clubs showed up and AEG sold tickets and sponsorships. This year, the Coachella Valley Invitational, as it's known, had 18 teams. Food trucks and exclusive merchandise like bucket hats and team decals were added. Attendance was expected to grow about 40 percent, to about 30,000 fans over the seven match days. The invitational ends on Saturday, with the N.S.W.L. teams playing; the M.L.S. season began this week.
"This is our version of thinking out of the box," Mr. Braun said. "Our hope is to get teams to commit to this for the long term."
Preseason games don't count toward the standings, but they are essential to coaches, who need to evaluate their players, and doing that on high-quality fields is critical to preventing injuries. AEG promises teams two dedicated practice fields each and access to four- and five-star hotels with at least 40,000 square feet for meetings, training rooms and equipment. The teams pay their way to California and for the hotels, as well as for what Mr. Braun called a "reasonable" rental fee for the fields.
There are no locker rooms, so players come to the polo club dressed in their soccer gear. Each team is assigned a dedicated groundskeeper to meet the requests of each coach. AEG provides goals, tents and other equipment, and it spent about $ 2 million renting high-end gear for a makeshift gym.
"We're certainly in the business of making money, but we want this to run efficiently," Mr. Braun said, adding that the event was a "long-term build, but I wouldn't put it past being a moneymaker in the short term."
Still, he said, it won't succeed unless the teams are happy.
"You look at the backdrop, the pitches, it's perfect," said Phil Neville, the coach of the Timbers. "We're traveling 11 months of the year, so we don't need more air travel on top of that."
Mr. Neville and other coaches liked working with the players in semi-isolation. It allows their teams to bond over dinner, rounds of golf or games of the tabletop soccer hybrid known as teqball. The addition of fans, as well as small scoreboards and announcers, also helped give the games a more authentic feel.
"It's definitely more organized this year, where we get here and play," said Keaton Parks, a midfielder on New York City F.C. "Last year, it felt more like a youth tour where we sat around awhile waiting to play."
Mr. Parks and other players trained in a country-club atmosphere. One of the two game fields abutted a rose garden with a large fountain amid palm trees and snow-capped mountains in the distance. The Tack Room Tavern, a stone's throw from the fields, had a menu that included the "Saddle Up Breakfast" and Peach Bellinis.
White picket fences served as borders around the field and trainers' tables stood on the sidelines. As games finished, players crossed paths with the next teams, often stopping to hug friends and former teammates. Fans with Sharpies, shirts and soccer balls asked for autographs and posed for selfies.
Based on the reaction of many fans, the experiment is off to a good start. Maria De Luca, who lives in Toronto, was sitting with her sons, Emi, 10, and Mati, 11, watching Minnesota United play Chicago Fire F.C. She thought paying $ 25 for a day pass was a bargain, and it allowed the soccer-loving boys, who both wore Messi Argentina shirts, to meet the players and see the game up close. She said they would return next year because her husband attended an annual conference in Palm Springs.
"Soccer is like everything to these guys," she said, pointing to her boys. "I think this can get big."

INDIO, Calif. — On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Dan Perkin and Scott Bissmeyer, work buddies on vacation, sat on metal bleachers watching the Portland Timbers play the San Jose Earthquakes in the first of four preseason Major League Soccer games that day.
They had spent $125 each on VIP day passes, which included food, drink and access to tents to keep cool. Self-described “MLS road trippers,” they have visited numerous MLS stadiums and have watched teams in Tucson, Arizona, where as many as 11 clubs came together for preseason training in the past.
But this year, with 12 MLS teams — along with two from the United Soccer League and four from the National Women’s Soccer League — gathered at a 1,000-acre property outside Palm Springs, California, for preseason training, Perkin and Bissmeyer decided to check it out.
“Compared to Tucson, they put on a nice operation here,” Perkin said of the site, the Empire Polo Club, best known as the annual site of the Coachella Music Festival. “If you’re going to drive six hours, we might as well treat ourselves.”

Plans for U.S. Chip Manufacturing Hit Obstacles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Delays in finishing new factories are emerging, just as the Biden administration begins handing out money to stoke domestic production.
In December 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the key maker of the world's most cutting-edge chips, said it planned to spend $ 40 billion in Arizona on its first major U.S. hub for semiconductor production.
The much ballyhooed project in Phoenix -- with two new factories, including one with more advanced technology -- became a symbol of President Biden's quest to spur more domestic production of chips, the slices of silicon that help all manner of devices make calculations and store data.
Then last summer, TSMC pushed back initial manufacturing at its first Arizona factory to 2025 from this year, saying local workers lacked expertise in installing some sophisticated equipment. Last month, the company said the second plant wouldn't produce chips until 2027 or 2028, rather than 2026, citing uncertainty about tech choices and federal funding.
Progress at the Arizona site partly depends on "how much incentives that the U.S. government can provide," Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in an investor call.
TSMC is just one of several chip makers running into obstacles with their U.S. expansion plans. Intel, Microchip Technology and others have also adjusted their production schedules, as a sales slump in many kinds of chips pressures the companies to manage their spending on new infrastructure. New chip factories are hugely complex, involving thousands of construction workers, long construction timelines and billions of dollars of machinery.
The delays come as the Biden administration begins dispensing the first major awards from a $ 39 billion pot of money aimed at building up the U.S. semiconductor industry and reducing the nation's dependence on technology manufactured in East Asia. On Monday, the administration said it would award $ 1.5 billion in grants to the chipmaker GlobalFoundries to upgrade and expand facilities in New York and Vermont that make chips for automakers and the defense industry.
But the issues that companies like TSMC face with their projects could undercut this fanfare, raising questions about the prospects of success for President Biden's industrial policy program. The investments are expected to figure heavily in Mr. Biden's re-election campaign over the next few months.
"Nothing has failed yet," said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow and the director of the energy, economics and security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. "But we're going to have to see some progress and those factories actually coming online in the next few years for the program to be considered a success."
The Commerce Department is responsible for handing out federal money from the 2022 CHIPS Act to spur domestic chip production. In addition to the grant to GlobalFoundries, the department has issued two small production grants so far. It is expected to give much larger awards in the billions of dollars to chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron in the coming weeks and months.
The government is locked in complex negotiations with these major chipmakers over the amount and timing of the awards. Companies are also still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department about which investments will qualify for a new tax credit aimed at advanced manufacturing, which had been expected before the end of 2023.
Any delays in the process could hurt the United States as it races to reduce global dependence on chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and China, analysts said. Rival countries are offering their own incentives to court chip manufacturers. TSMC, for example, plans to add production in Japan and Germany as well as in the United States.
The longer the U.S. government waits to distribute benefits, "the more other geographies are going to snap up these investments, and more leading-edge investments will be made in East Asia," said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation. "So the clock is ticking."
A Commerce Department official disputed suggestions that it had been slow in handing out incentives. He said the department was taking time to protect taxpayer interests and push companies to do more to bolster the domestic chip supply chain.
A White House official said the chip companies' schedule changes were minor adjustments that were common at complex projects like the new production sites. He added that forecasts suggested there would be overwhelming demand for these chips when the facilities started making them.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman said that officials there had provided clarity on tax credits to companies planning investments and were working to issue additional guidance as quickly as possible.
The CHIPS Act authorized grants and other incentives to boost U.S. chip production, plus tax credits for investments in factories and manufacturing equipment. More than 600 companies and organizations had submitted statements of interest in the grants, the Commerce Department said, while it estimates pledges of private investment so far at $ 235 billion.
But most expansion plans were set when chips were scarce several years ago, after a pandemic-fueled burst of consumer spending on electronic products. That demand dried up, leaving chip makers stuck with big inventories of unsold components and little immediate need for new factories.
"Companies are rethinking how and what and when investments will occur," said Thomas Sonderman, the chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturer that has won Defense Department subsidies and is aiming for CHIPS Act funding.
One chip maker feeling the pinch is Microchip, an Arizona company. Two years ago, Microchip was swamped with orders. It applied for CHIPS Act funding to stoke production and stands to receive $ 162 million. Yet as sales have slumped, it recently announced two separate two-week factory shutdowns.
Microchip still plans to upgrade its factories in Oregon and Colorado that are set to receive CHIPS Act grants, said Ganesh Moorthy, its chief executive. But ordering machines to increase production capacity will have to wait until business conditions improve.
"We've paused on expansion," Mr. Moorthy said.
Intel, which is expanding production, has also adjusted purchases of costly factory tools. The company recently said it didn't expect to start manufacturing in Ohio, where it is spending $ 20 billion on two new factories, in 2025 as it originally expected. The change was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Still, Intel said neither construction on that site, nor plans to expand in the United States and three other countries, had slowed.
"The strategy is not changing from quarter to quarter," said Keyvan Esfarjani, the executive vice president who oversees Intel's manufacturing operations. "We're staying on course."
Some chip makers, such as Texas Instruments and Micron Technology, are plowing forward with expanding chip production for competitive reasons. New factories can help make higher-quality chips, more of them and for cheaper.
Micron is pushing ahead with building a $ 15 billion factory in Boise, Idaho, its hometown, and plans an even bigger manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., despite a downturn in the market for its memory chips, which store data in devices like smartphones and computers.
Scott Gatzemeier, a Micron vice president overseeing the expansion, said construction projects that took several years should be based on future chip demand rather than current conditions. Renting massive cranes and other equipment and securing construction workers, he added, are big expenses that might need to be repeated if a project is halted.
"Once you start, you don't want to stop," he said.
Other chip makers are unwilling to start construction without government money. Mr. Sonderman of SkyWater, for example, said his company's plans for a $ 1.8 billion facility in Indiana are contingent on obtaining funds through a portion of the CHIPS Act targeting research.
At TSMC's Arizona site, unforeseen problems have piled up over the past year.
Last summer, construction unions in the state raised issues about workplace safety and objected to TSMC's bringing workers from Taiwan to help install sophisticated equipment in the first factory. Delays in installing machines led to an announcement in July about the production delay.
In December, TSMC and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council agreed on ground rules at the site for safety, workplace training, site staffing and other issues. In an emailed statement, Mr. Liu, who recently announced plans to retire, sounded hopeful that worker tensions were over.
He acknowledged "challenges" in building the first Phoenix factory, but said TSMC was still "the fastest player" among its peers in completing such projects. While he told analysts in January that the company would delay the start of production at the second factory, also known as a fab, worker skills aren't likely to be among the reasons.
"We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother," Mr. Liu said. "The workers in Arizona learn things quickly."

Full text: Retro-photography apps that mimic the appearance of analog film formats make your digital files seem like they're from another era.
Like the allure of vinyl records, classic video games and even the early internet, the fascination with older photography standards like point-and-shoot cameras or 35-millimeter film persists -- even in people too young to remember when that gear was cutting edge. The appeal of "vintage" photography goes beyond nostalgia and Instagram filters, judging by the huge number of apps designed to emulate the film, lenses and visual quirks of predigital photos and movies.
Despite the irony of using a high-end smartphone camera to produce imperfect images that appear oversaturated, jittery, low-contrast, unfiltered or otherwise analog, going for a retro look can help you practice your composition skills. If you're not ready to buy original equipment, you can still evoke a different time period's creative sensibility. Here's an overview.
Getting Started
Before you dive in, here are some things to keep in mind. First, make sure you can reverse any editing on an original image; making duplicates for your experiments is a safe backup. Second, be aware that some apps capture content with the effects embedded, leaving you with a permanently vintage-looking photo or video.
You may not need extra software, depending on the visual effect you want to achieve. Apple, Google and Samsung all include a variety of filters in their default photo apps, as well as built-in editing tools. You might get satisfactory results by manually adjusting the color saturation, the tint and other elements to make the photo look as if an ancient film camera had taken it.
Exploring Apps
For a wider range of editing features, Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends Adobe Lightroom and Google's Snapseed for Android or iOS. Adobe Photoshop Express also includes a collection of filters, themes and borders for your photos. (Adobe's apps are free with in-app purchases, and Snapseed is free.)
For specific historical looks (like a 1970s Polaroid, for example), there are apps with filters and algorithms designed to emulate certain analog film stocks, camera lenses and other factors, like simulated light leaks and dust speckles. Just enter "vintage" or "retro" when you search the app store for camera or photography programs. Some apps charge for extra filters, require a subscription or have technical requirements, so read the specifications.
Hipstamatic for the iPhone is one of the best-known retro camera apps -- and may be considered an antique itself, as it was first released in 2009. Its original incarnation, now called Classic Camera (free to try; $ 2.99 with in-app purchases), is still around and uses filter combinations to mimic the look of prints taken with a cheap plastic 1980s camera. Damon Winter, a Times photographer, even used the app for a 2010 assignment in Afghanistan. Last year, the company released Hipstamatic X, an update with hundreds of filters and tools and its own online photo-sharing community (free trial; $ 29.99 a year to subscribe).
FIMO Analog Camera for Android and iOS (free to try, $ 29.99 a year) is a similar app for emulating prints produced from various film types.
Making 'Vintage' Video
For giving a classic look to your moving pictures, Google has a set of filters and effects for videos edited in the Google Photos app for Android and iOS. Samsung's Video Editor offers filters, as does Apple's Photos app and its free iMovie and Clips video-editing apps.
But again, there are specialized apps. Super 16 for Android and iOS (free to try; $ 23.49 for a six-month subscription) has about 70 customizable filters for photos and videos and can be used to record directly -- or to apply effects on existing videos.
Similar software, Nexvio's 8mm Vintage Camera app ( $ 9.99 per year) for the iPhone, lets you record clips in the style of a black-and-white noir movie, a grainy '70s art-house film and more.
Modernize Old Photos
Just as you can make new photos look old, you can make old photos look newer -- by colorizing them. If you'd like to experiment, Colorize (free trial; $ 18.99 a year) uses artificial intelligence to convert monochrome images, as does the Colorize Images app (free trial; $ 9.99 a year); both apps are available for Android and iOS.
Some genealogy services -- including MyHeritage and Ancestry -- offer a free photo colorization tool for subscribers to use on files uploaded to the site.
Depending on the original, the results may be wildly garish or -- in the best-case scenario -- hard to distinguish from a genuine color image. This may be considered sacrilege to historians and fans of black-and-white photography, but for projects like compiling a family tree, the modernization could make the people in the photos feel more relatable.
Time-shifting images to the past or present is not for everyone, but for those who are curious, the apps are generally less expensive than trawling eBay's used camera section or getting film developed. Just remember, light leaks and dust specks are features (and not bugs) these days.
Photograph Both Apple's Photos app, left two images, and Google Photos include a basic set of filters and effects that can be applied to photos.; The older Hipstamatic Classic Camera brings an old-fashioned viewfinder and plenty of filters to emulate vintage photo styles. Filters can also be used on existing photos.; MyHeritage is among the commercial genealogy services that offer free photo colorization to members researching their family history This article appeared in print on page B7.

India Pushes iPhone Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: India is quietly grabbing from China more manufacturing of Apple's iPhones and other electronics gear.
It is happening in South Indian industrial areas on muddy plots that were once farmland.
In Sriperumbudur, people call Apple "the customer," not daring to say the name of a company that prizes its secrets.
But some things are too big to hide. Two gigantic dormitory complexes are springing up from the earth. Once finished, each will be a tight block of 13 buildings with 24 rooms per floor around an L-shaped hallway. Every one of those pink-painted rooms will have beds for six workers, all women. The two blocks will house 18,720 workers apiece.
It's a ready-made scene from Shenzhen or Zhengzhou, the Chinese cities famous for their iPhone production prowess. And it's no wonder.
Sriperumbudur, in the state of Tamil Nadu, is the home of the expanding Indian fortress of Foxconn, the Taiwanese-based company that has long played the largest role in producing iPhones. And as recently as 2019, about 99 percent of them were made in China.
India, as part of a national manufacturing drive, is chipping away at that dominance, when many companies are looking to spread their work to countries other than China. An estimated 13 percent of the world's iPhones were assembled in India last year, and about three-quarters of those were made in Tamil Nadu. By next year, the volume produced in India is expected to double.
But despite almost 10 years of a "Make in India" initiative promoted by the country's powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, manufacturing as a share of the economy has stalled out. At about 16 percent, it is a shade lower than when Mr. Modi took office in 2014, and far lower than that of China, or of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea when those Asian tigers took off.
India desperately needs more skilled jobs, and factory work creates them like nothing else. Last year, India overtook China to become the world's most populous country, and its working-age population is speeding ahead. But turning that demographic bulge into an actual advantage means making India's workers more productive. Half of them still depend on small farming.
Tamil Nadu might point the way forward. The state of 72 million people is now succeeding in ways that have eluded India as a whole. The national government started subsidizing electronics manufacturing across the country in 2021, setting off a gold rush in places like Noida, next to New Delhi.
But for Tamil Nadu, that incentive is not an essential lure. T.R.B. Rajaa, Tamil Nadu's minister of industries, can rattle off the state's inbuilt advantages: schools, transport, engineering graduates.
"We never compare our growth with other Indian states," he said. "We chart ourselves to the growth of Scandinavian countries and how we can beat that."
Mr. Rajaa and other boosters of Tamil Nadu are proud of the human capital their state has built up, and especially of its women. Many of them work in formal jobs, while few women in other states do: 43 percent of all Indian female factory employees work in Tamil Nadu, which is home to 5 percent of the national population.
Parts of Tamil Nadu are already working as industrial champions. A long belt of car and car-part manufacturers stretches down the coast from its capital, Chennai. In the western Coimbatore valley, factories specialize in die-casting and pump manufacturing. There is a knitwear cluster in Tiruppur, and the country's biggest maker of matchsticks is in Sivakasi.
It is striking that India is plunging into such high-end goods as the iPhone. India has never become internationally competitive making things like T-shirts or sneakers, getting its clock cleaned by smaller and formerly less developed countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.
This is not the first time this century that India was expected to move up the ranks of high-value electronics manufacturing. Nor the first time that Tamil Nadu seemed like the best launchpad for it. In 2006, Finland's Nokia, then a cellphone colossus, built a big factory at the center of Sriperumbudur's government-planned industrial estate. It was supposed to make millions of phones a year, for India and the rest of the world. The smartphone, and the global financial crisis in 2009, knocked down those dreams.
But the roots never died. Sriperumbudur was initially attractive because of its experience in auto manufacturing. Hyundai had set up shop in 1996, soon after India opened up its economy to more foreign investment and Tamil Nadu formed its first state development agency. Glassmaking and basic electrical goods followed. After a lull, the old Nokia site was built over by Salcomp, a local company that makes high-end power chargers, now for companies like Apple. The plants of a dozen other known and rumored Apple suppliers have sprouted around it, along with Samsung, Dell and most other big multinational electronics companies.
On Friday, India's Republic Day, Young Liu, the chief executive of Foxconn, was in New Delhi to be awarded the Padma Bhushan, the country's third-highest civilian honor. "Let's do our part," he said, "for manufacturing in India and for the betterment of society."
A flourishing network of small, medium and large businesses contributes to Tamil Nadu's success. One of them is Sancraft Industries in Sriperumbudur, a company with about $ 5 million in revenue that makes molded plastic parts for a handful of companies that feed the iPhone machine.
A company founder, Amit Gupta, said that Nokia had "brought the ecosystem here" and that its Finnish engineers had done a lot to usher in global standards. His experience working with an early client, Schneider Electric, a French company, taught him how to integrate his operations with more recent arrivals from South Korea, Taiwan and China.
As host to an international supply chain, Tamil Nadu has drawn restaurants and grocery stores catering to Western and East Asian tastes. "It's like a small version of China here," said Mr. Gupta, who worked in Shenzhen 15 years ago.
In India and abroad, there is no shortage of excitement about the prospect of India's supplanting China in at least some part of global supply chains. By last year, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, was showing up in India with his palms pressed in namaste, inaugurating the country's first Apple stores.
All told, more than 130 Fortune 500 companies are doing business in Tamil Nadu.
The electronics campuses in Sriperumbudur look remarkably alike. Gardened grounds and parking lots filled with dozens of white buses separate low-slung assembly plants. The buses shuttle thousands of workers to and from their homes, in villages 30 to 60 miles away.
Inside one Apple supplier, blue-smocked workers in surgical masks walked past banks of white-aluminum-cladded machinery on paths marked by yellow arrows stuck on the floor. Low ceilings, long clear sightlines and placards exhorting good behavior in English and Tamil completed the effect.
There are more to come. Corning, the American glassmaker, is setting up a factory that could produce iPhone's Gorilla Glass screens, and Vietnam's VinFast Auto has announced a $ 2 billion facility to make electric vehicles.
Mr. Rajaa, the state industry minister, isn't stopping at $ 1,000 smartphones, either. He and other officials in Tamil Nadu are trying to attract more businesses making cheaper things, too, in greater volume. If the rest of the country could follow Tamil Nadu, India might be able to produce enough of the less-skilled jobs its young and growing population needs.
Mr. Rajaa spent the first week of January regaling foreign investors with plans that included a budding new industrial cluster, focused on non-leather footwear. About 140 miles south of Sriperumbudur, Nikes, Adidases and Crocs are just starting to roll off the lines in Perambalur.

Mexico Bests China In Imports To the U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States bought more goods from Mexico than China in 2023 for the first time in 20 years, evidence of how much global trade patterns have shifted.
In the depths of the pandemic, as global supply chains buckled and the cost of shipping a container from China soared nearly twentyfold, Marco Villarreal spied an opportunity.
In 2021, Mr. Villarreal resigned as Caterpillar's director general in Mexico and began nurturing ties with companies looking to shift manufacturing from China to Mexico. He found a client in Hisun, a Chinese producer of all-terrain vehicles, which hired Mr. Villarreal to establish a $ 152 million manufacturing site in Saltillo, an industrial hub in northern Mexico.
Mr. Villarreal said foreign companies, particularly those seeking to sell within North America, saw Mexico as a viable alternative to China for several reasons, including the simmering trade tensions between the United States and China.
"The stars are aligning for Mexico," he said.
New data released on Wednesday showed that Mexico outpaced China for the first time in 20 years to become America's top source of official imports -- a significant shift that highlights how increased tensions between Washington and Beijing are altering trade flows.
The United States' trade deficit with China narrowed significantly last year, with goods imports from the country dropping 20 percent to $ 427.2 billion, the data shows. American consumers and businesses turned to Mexico, Europe, South Korea, India, Canada and Vietnam for auto parts, shoes, toys and raw materials.
Mexican exports to the United States were roughly the same as in 2022, at $ 475.6 billion.
America's total trade deficit in goods and services, which consists of exports minus imports, narrowed 18.7 percent. Overall U.S. exports to the world increased slightly in 2023 from the previous year, despite a strong dollar and a soft global economy.
U.S. imports fell annually as Americans bought less crude oil and chemicals and fewer consumer goods, including cellphones, clothes, camping gear, toys and furniture.
The recent weakness in imports, and drop-off in trade with China, has partly been a reflection of the pandemic. American consumers stuck at home during the pandemic snapped up Chinese-made laptops, toys, Covid tests, athleisure, furniture and home exercise equipment.
Even as concerns about the coronavirus faded in 2022, the United States continued to import a lot of Chinese products, as bottlenecks at congested U.S. ports finally cleared and businesses restocked their warehouses.
"The world couldn't get access to enough Chinese goods in '21, and it gorged on Chinese goods in '22," said Brad Setser, an economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Everything has been normalizing since then."
But beyond the unusual swings in annual patterns in the last few years, trade data is beginning to provide compelling evidence that years of heightened tensions have significantly chipped away at America's trading relationship with China.
In 2023, U.S. quarterly imports from China were at roughly the same level as they were 10 years ago, despite a decade of growth in the American economy and rising U.S. imports from elsewhere in the world.
"We are decoupling, and that's weighing heavily on trade flows," Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of the United States and China.
Economists say the relative decrease in trade with China is clearly linked to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and then maintained by the Biden administration.
Research by Caroline Freund, the dean of the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, showed that trade with China fell for products that have high tariffs, like screwdrivers and smoke detectors, while trade in products that do not have tariffs, like hair dryers and microwave ovens, continued to grow.
Ralph Ossa, the chief economist for the World Trade Organization, said that trade between the United States and China had not collapsed, but that it had been growing about 30 percent more slowly than trade between those countries and the rest of the world.
There were two episodes in recent history where U.S. trade with China slowed notably, he said. The first was when trade tensions between the countries escalated in 2018. The second was when Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting the United States and its allies to impose strict sanctions and further reshuffling global trade relationships.
"There was a period where geopolitics didn't really matter for trade much, but as uncertainty increases in the world, we do see that trade becomes more sensitive to these positions," said Stela Rubinova, a research economist at the World Trade Organization.
Some economists caution that the U.S. reduction in trade with China might not be as sharp as bilateral data shows. That is because like Hisun, the Chinese vehicle producer, some multinationals have shifted portions of their manufacturing out of China and into other countries but continued sourcing some raw materials and parts from China.
In other cases, companies may simply be routing goods that are actually made in China through other countries to avoid U.S. tariffs.
U.S. trade statistics do not record such products as coming from China, even though a significant portion of their value would have been created there.
Ms. Freund, who wrote a recent paper on the subject, said the two countries' trade relationship was "definitely being attenuated, but not as much as the official statistics suggest."
Still, geopolitical risks are clearly pushing companies to look to other markets, particularly those with low costs and stable trading relationships with the United States, like Mexico.
Jesús Carmona, the president for Mexico and Central America at Schneider Electric, the French electrical equipment giant, said that the Biden administration's 2022 climate law and geopolitical tensions stemming from the war in Ukraine were both factors pushing companies toward Mexico.
When China appeared to align with Russia in the conflict, "it triggered all sorts of alarms," Mr. Carmona said. "People realized we cannot have such dependencies on China, which we built up over the last 40 years as we were making China the factory of the world."
Schneider, which already had a substantial presence in Mexico with nine factories and nearly 12,000 employees, decided in 2021 that it needed to grow further in the country. Now, after opening new manufacturing sites and expanding existing plants, the company has about 16,000 employees in Mexico, with plans for that number to soon reach about 20,000.
Schneider sends about 75 percent to 80 percent of its production in Mexico to the United States, including an array of products like circuit breakers and panels used to distribute and regulate electrical power.
While foreign direct investment in developing countries fell 9 percent in 2023, the flow of such investment to Mexico surged 21 percent last year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Another economy caught in the shifting tides between the United States and China has been South Korea. Like Mexico, South Korea is subject to lower tariffs because it has a free trade deal with the United States. In December, U.S. imports from South Korea were the highest on record.
South Korean firms have also particularly benefited from President Biden's new climate legislation. The U.S. government is offering tax credits for consumers who buy electric vehicles, but it has set certain limits on sourcing parts of those cars from China.
As major manufacturers of electric vehicle batteries and components, South Korean firms have seized the opportunity to participate in newly expanding U.S. vehicle supply chains. One Korean battery manufacturer, SK On, has invested $ 2.6 billion in a factory in Georgia and is building new facilities in Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky in partnership with Hyundai and Ford.
Min Sung, the chief commercial officer of SK On, said that China was getting more restrictive for Korean businesses. Meanwhile, the U.S. constraints on China benefiting from electric vehicle tax credits had given Korean businesses "more space to play."
"In order for business to survive, you always find the market that's got more potential," Mr. Sung said.
As major South Korean companies like SK, LG, Samsung and Hyundai build new facilities to make products in the United States, that also appears to be increasing U.S. trade with South Korea since companies are importing some materials, machinery and parts from their home countries to supply the new facilities.
In December, Korean exports to the United States surpassed Korean exports to China for the first time in 20 years, driven by shipments of vehicles, electric batteries and other parts.
Mr. Sung agreed that increasing American skepticism of China was pushing the United States and South Korea closer together.
"It's never been stronger than the last couple of years between two allies," he said.

Samsung's Leader Acquitted Of Stock Price Manipulation: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lee Jae-yong's case had raised questions about the immense power that chaebol leaders wield and the legal system holding them to account in South Korea.
A South Korean court on Monday acquitted Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's top executive, on charges of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud, the latest twist in the billionaire's legal troubles tied to a merger that helped him secure control of the nation's largest company.
A Seoul district court judge said that there was not enough evidence to prove the prosecutors' charges against Mr. Lee and 13 other current and former Samsung officials, including the accusation that the primary intent of the merger was to strengthen Mr. Lee's power over the conglomerate, against the business interests of each Samsung affiliate that merged.
Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of five years and a fine of 500 million won against Mr. Lee, 55. He has denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have the option to appeal the decision to a higher court. Neither Samsung Electronics nor the prosecutors' office immediately commented after the verdict.
Mr. Lee's lawyers said in a statement that the decision "clearly confirmed the legality" of the merger and the accounting of its affiliates.
Samsung is the largest and most successful of the South Korean conglomerates known as chaebol. The group's electronics arm, Samsung Electronics, alone accounts for about one-sixth of the country's exports. Mr. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, is South Korea's wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg News, which estimated his net worth at about $ 9 billion.
Some South Koreans speak proudly of the chaebol for having helped transform the country from a war-ravaged agrarian economy into a global export powerhouse. But others have increasingly scrutinized whether they stifle smaller businesses or make corrupt deals with government officials without facing enough repercussions.
Most chaebol scandals have stemmed from the families' attempts to ensure that the next generation inherits control, such as arranging for scions to buy shares of subsidiaries at discounted prices.
Business experts in South Korea said that they were surprised by Monday's verdict, which they said raised concerns about the fairness of the country's markets and the credibility of its judiciary.
"This case confirms a judicial system that is more backward than it was in the past," said Sung-In Jun, an economics professor at Hongik University in Seoul, "and how powerless the South Korean political and judicial authorities are in front of the chaebol."
Mr. Lee's legal troubles began when massive protests in Seoul led to the 2016 impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye on charges of collecting or seeking bribes from Samsung and other chaebol and for abusing her power. Ms. Park was jailed in 2017 and pardoned and released in 2022.
Mr. Lee was arrested in 2017 on charges of bribing Ms. Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to win the government's support for a 2015 merger of two Samsung subsidiaries at the center of the corruption scandal. He was the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics at the time.
Prosecutors had said the merger was a step in Mr. Lee's effort to transfer the control of Samsung from his father, Lee Kun-hee, who was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014 and had been twice convicted and pardoned of bribery and tax evasion years before. A New York-based hedge fund, Elliott Management, launched a campaign urging shareholders to vote against the merger. But the country's National Pension Service, which was a major shareholder of one of the subsidiaries, voted in favor of the merger in return for Mr. Lee's bribes, prosecutors said.
A Seoul district court in 2017 sentenced Mr. Lee to five years in prison for offering 8.9 billion won in bribes to Ms. Park and to Ms. Choi.
His case wound its way through the court system over the next two years, with Seoul's High Court reducing his sentence and releasing him from prison in 2018. The nation's Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 2019.
While he waited for the retrial in 2020, Mr. Lee was indicted on a charge of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud, the case whose verdict was announced on Monday. But prosecutors were unable to arrest him because a court had refused to issue an arrest warrant.
The prosecutors had accused Mr. Lee and other current and former Samsung officials of committing those crimes in the 2015 merger. His lawyers said the merger had taken place in accordance with the law.
During the retrial on the bribery charges in 2021, the Seoul High Court sentenced Mr. Lee to two and a half years in prison, finding the bribes had totaled 8.6 billion won.
Later that year, the Justice Ministry released him on parole, along with 800 other prisoners, on a holiday commemorating the end of Japan's colonial rule over Korea at the end of World War II. South Korea often paroles or pardons prisoners on important national holidays.
Business analysts were split on whether Mr. Lee's time in prison had an impact on his empire. Samsung Electronics became the world's most profitable technology company while he was in prison. Others said Samsung was postponing key decisions with Mr. Lee in jail and fell behind competitors like TSMC.
At the time of his release in 2021, he was still banned from employment at Samsung for five years. That was lifted in 2022 when he won a pardon from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who as a prosecutor had led the investigation of Mr. Lee.
Two months later, Samsung Electronics named Mr. Lee executive chairman, elevating him less than 15 months after he was released from prison for bribery.

Why the Requirement For SAT or ACT Scores Returned to Dartmouth: [Correction]

Full text: Why other schools may follow Dartmouth's lead.
Dartmouth College announced this morning that it would again require applicants to submit standardized test scores, starting next year. It's a significant development because other selective colleges are now deciding whether to do so. In today's newsletter, I'll tell you the story behind Dartmouth's decision.
Training future leaders
Last summer, Sian Beilock -- a cognitive scientist who had previously run Barnard College in New York -- became the president of Dartmouth. After arriving, she asked a few Dartmouth professors to do an internal study on standardized tests. Like many other colleges during the Covid pandemic, Dartmouth dropped its requirement that applicants submit an SAT or ACT score. With the pandemic over and students again able to take the tests, Dartmouth's admissions team was thinking about reinstating the requirement. Beilock wanted to know what the evidence showed.
"Our business is looking at data and research and understanding the implications it has," she told me.
Three Dartmouth economists and a sociologist then dug into the numbers. One of their main findings did not surprise them: Test scores were a better predictor than high school grades -- or student essays and teacher recommendations -- of how well students would fare at Dartmouth. The evidence of this relationship is large and growing, as I explained in a recent Times article.
A second finding was more surprising. During the pandemic, Dartmouth switched to a test-optional policy, in which applicants could choose whether to submit their SAT and ACT scores. And this policy was harming lower-income applicants in a specific way.
The researchers were able to analyze the test scores even of students who had not submitted them to Dartmouth. (Colleges can see the scores after the admissions process is finished.) Many lower-income students, it turned out, had made a strategic mistake.
They withheld test scores that would have helped them get into Dartmouth. They wrongly believed that their scores were too low, when in truth the admissions office would have judged the scores to be a sign that students had overcome a difficult environment and could thrive at Dartmouth.
As the four professors -- Elizabeth Cascio, Bruce Sacerdote, Doug Staiger and Michele Tine -- wrote in a memo, referring to the SAT's 1,600-point scale, "There are hundreds of less-advantaged applicants with scores in the 1,400 range who should be submitting scores to identify themselves to admissions, but do not under test-optional policies." Some of these applicants were rejected because the admissions office could not be confident about their academic qualifications. The students would have probably been accepted had they submitted their test scores, Lee Coffin, Dartmouth's dean of admissions, told me.
That finding, as much as any other, led to Dartmouth's announcement this morning. "Our goal at Dartmouth is academic excellence in the service of training the broadest swath of future leaders," Beilock told me. "I'm convinced by the data that this will help us do that."
It's worth acknowledging a crucial part of this story. Dartmouth admits disadvantaged students who have scores that are lower on average than those of privileged students. The college doesn't apologize for that. Students from poor neighborhoods or troubled high schools have effectively been running with wind in their face. They are not competing fairly with affluent teenagers.
"We're looking for the kids who are excelling in their environment. We know society is unequal," Beilock said. "Kids that are excelling in their environment, we think, are a good bet to excel at Dartmouth and out in the world." The admissions office will judge an applicant's environment partly by comparing his or her test score with the score distribution at the applicant's high schools, Coffin said. In some cases, even an SAT score well below 1,400 can help an application.
Questions and answers
In our conversations, I asked Beilock and her colleagues about several common criticisms of standardized tests, and they said that they did not find the criticisms persuasive.
For instance, many critics on the political left argue the tests are racially or economically biased, but Beilock said the evidence didn't support those claims. "The research suggests this tool is helpful in finding students we might otherwise miss," she said.
I also asked whether she was worried that conservative critics of affirmative action might use test scores to accuse Dartmouth of violating the recent Supreme Court ruling barring race-conscious admissions. She was not. Dartmouth can legally admit a diverse class while using test scores as one part of its holistic admissions process, she said. I've heard similar sentiments from leaders at other colleges that have reinstated the test requirement, including Georgetown and M.I.T.
And I asked Beilock and her colleagues whether fewer students might now apply to Dartmouth. Coffin, the admissions dean, replied that such an outcome might be OK. He noted that the test-optional policy since 2020 had not led to a more diverse pool of applicants and that Dartmouth already received more than enough applications -- 31,000 this year, for 1,200 first-year slots. "I don't think volume is the holy grail," he said.
Finally, I asked Beilock whether she was satisfied with Dartmouth's level of economic diversity, which is slightly below that of most similarly elite colleges. She said no. "We have aspirations to bring it up," she said. Reinstating the test requirement, she believes, can help Dartmouth do so.

Apple's Vision Pro May Blow Your Mind, and Your Budget: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The new headset teaches a valuable lesson about the cost of tech products: The upsells and add-ons will get you.
When Apple unveiled the Vision Pro virtual reality goggles last year at a technology conference, many in the audience gasped at the price: $ 3,500. That's more than quadruple the cost of a new iPhone and 14 times the cost of a competing headset from Meta.
The headset, which Apple has marketed as a computer, movie player and gaming machine, will arrive in stores on Friday. Ahead of its release, the discussion has focused on its price: Many have wondered why people would pay so much to do what they could already do with their computers, TVs and game consoles.
Yet the true cost of owning the Vision Pro is probably even higher. Try $ 4,600. That's because the price shoots up with the add-ons and accessories that many people would want to buy, including:
Apple's $ 200 carrying case to protect the Vision Pro on the go.
A pair of earphones, such as Apple's $ 180 AirPods, to listen to music privately.
A spare $ 200 battery pack to get more use from the headset (because with only two hours of battery life, the headset won't last long enough to play a feature-length movie).
$ 100 prescription lens inserts for those who use glasses.
A spare $ 200 cushion to make the goggles fit another member of the family.
An additional $ 200 for the larger data storage option (512 gigabytes instead of the 256 gigs on the base model) to hold more videos and apps on the device.
And those are just the extras that many consider must-haves. Other options, including Apple's $ 500 extended warranty coverage, a $ 70 video game controller and a very uncool $ 50 battery holder to clip onto your pants, could drive the price well above $ 5,000 -- before tax.
While I have your attention with these breathtaking numbers, we can all learn a valuable lesson from the Vision Pro about "phantom costs," the add-ons that significantly inflate the amount we spend. For electronics, including smartphones, computers and virtual reality headsets, they can include cases and charging gadgets.
A clear grasp of the true cost of tech ownership is crucial for any consumers trying to stay in control of their budget, said Ramit Sethi, a personal finance adviser. He said he had learned about phantom costs when he bought a Honda Accord about 20 years ago. He initially thought he was spending $ 350 a month on the car, to pay off his loan. The true cost ended up $ 1,000 a month after he added up maintenance, insurance, gas, parking and tolls.
"Companies count on you not being able to run the math," said Mr. Sethi, who hosts a podcast on money psychology. "The bigger the purchase, the more money you invisibly spend."
These lessons apply to any tech products we regularly use, not just Apple hardware. Let's run through the phantom costs of a Windows computer and a Samsung phone.
Windows Computer
Microsoft sells its Surface Laptop 5 at a starting retail price of $ 1,000. But after some extras are added in the Microsoft store, it's more realistically a $ 1,950 laptop -- nearly double the sticker price.
The extras include:
$ 500 for more memory.
A pair of earphones, such as Microsoft's $ 250 headphones.
$ 200 for the Microsoft dock that charges the laptop and connects it to an external display.
Here, the biggest phantom cost is memory, which is important for helping the computer smoothly run multiple apps at the same time. Typically, computer makers sell their base models with a modest amount of memory that isn't likely to be enough to keep the computer running fast for many years, so it's wise to buy the model with extra memory.
The $ 1,000 base model of the Surface Laptop 5 comes with only eight gigabytes of memory, but most people are likely to need double that to smoothly run the latest Windows operating system and new apps and games. The model that includes 16 gigabytes costs an extra $ 500.
Samsung Phone
Samsung's new high-end smartphone, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, has a starting price of $ 1,300. But it's more realistically a $ 1,540 phone.
In the last five years, many smartphone makers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, stopped shipping phones with basic accessories like earphones and charging bricks, a shift that increased their profit margins. And in an echo of the way computer makers upsell memory, the base model of a smartphone typically includes a modest amount of data storage that isn't likely to be enough to hold your photos, videos and apps for the long haul.
First, a quick aside on storage. An average photo takes up five megabytes, according to Samsung. So shooting 3,000 photos would take up roughly 15 gigabytes. Popular mobile games like Fortnite and Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis gobble up dozens of gigabytes. On Netflix, each hour of video downloaded for offline viewing takes up about a gigabyte. Long story short, data storage can run out fast, so why get 256 gigabytes when you could spend about $ 100 more for double that?
Unless you already own accessories to work with your new phone, you'll have to tack on these extras:
$ 30 for the Samsung charging brick.
$ 40 for a Samsung protective case.
$ 50 for the Samsung wireless earbuds.
An extra $ 120 to get 512 gigabytes to hold more photos and apps. (As of this writing, this data upgrade is free for a limited-time promotion.)
That's not including the cost of using the phone with a modest wireless phone plan for, say, $ 70 a month. With wireless service included, the cost of owning this Samsung phone over three years is about $ 112.77 a month, or $ 4,060 total.
Bottom Line
The point is not to shame people about buying tech, but to raise awareness of what we're actually spending on new gadgets, which is a lot more than we think, Mr. Sethi said. That's why the best practice for most people buying tech products is to hold on to them for as long as they can. This way they maximize the value they get not just from the devices but from the many extras they bought for them along the way.
For comparison purposes, the examples above showed the costs of extras like headphones and cases if you bought them directly from the device makers. A simple method to save money would be to shop around for cheaper third-party alternatives, but the purchases would still nonetheless be phantom costs that drove up the overall price of your tech.
This all brings us to the biggest phantom cost of regularly buying products like new phones and Apple's Vision Pro: the price you pay for being an early adopter.
"The more you buy a new phone, the more the people around you expect you to have the newest thing, and the more you create an identity that you always have the newest thing," Mr. Sethi said. "That's the biggest phantom cost of all."

Full text: What do you call a galaxy without stars?
Earlier this month, radio astronomers announced that they had discovered the darkest galaxy ever not quite seen, a cloud of hydrogen gas resembling our own Milky Way galaxy in many respects, such as its mass and rotation, but with no stars that anyone can discern.
"What we might have here -- might -- is the discovery of a primordial galaxy, a galaxy that is so diffuse, it hasn't been able to form stars readily," Karen O'Neil of the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia told a news conference at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans on Jan. 8.
That same week, a group of Spanish astronomers led by Mireia Montes, a research fellow at the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics, revealed the discovery of another nearly starless galaxy they called Nube, Spanish for "cloud."
"With our present knowledge, we do not understand how a galaxy with such extreme characteristics can exist," Dr. Montes said in a statement released by the institute. Dr. Montes is the first author of the new paper, which was published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.
And so, we can add "dark galaxies" to "dark matter," "dark energy" and the other terms of darkness already in the cosmic lexicon.
Dark galaxies are entities whose stars are so sparse and faint that their light cannot be discerned other than as a thin, transparent haze that doesn't seem to contain any stars at all. (Early on, dark galaxies were referred to as "low surface-brightness galaxies" or "ultra-diffuse galaxies," but time and jargon march on.) As astronomers continue to probe deeper into the skies with more powerful and smarter eyes, dark galaxies have begun popping up more frequently, challenging long-held views about the formation and evolution of galaxies.
The accidental galaxy
These dim ghosts are hard to find and even harder to study, requiring hours or days of observation to bring their visible starlight into focus. One way is to scan the heavens with radio telescopes tuned to the frequency of the interstellar hydrogen gas that pervades galaxies.
Dr. O'Neil was part of such a study, involving a variety of telescopes, of some 350 low-surface-brightness galaxies. "I mistyped the coordinates to the galaxy I intended to observe, resulting in the telescope pointing to a different part of the sky than intended," she recounted recently in an email. The telescope landed on something she had never seen before.
"It's a galaxy made only out of gas -- it has no visible stars," she said. "Stars could be there, we just can't see them."
The galaxy, known as J0613+52, is about 270 million light-years away. It is swimming amid two billion solar masses worth of primordial hydrogen that was produced in the Big Bang, but the galaxy is not forming any stars, probably because the gas is too diffuse to clump together into the clouds that become stars. Moreover, there are no galaxies nearby with a gravitational influence that could trigger such clumping.
"J0613+52 appears to be both undisturbed and underdeveloped," Dr. O'Neil said. "This could be our first discovery of a nearby galaxy made up of primordial gas."
A diminutive Nube
The other new dark galaxy, Nube, is much smaller than J0613+52 but equally intriguing, Dr. Montes said.
The name was suggested by the 5-year-old daughter of her colleague Ignacio Trujillo, because the galaxy's stars are so thinly spread across such a large volume that the collective was almost undetectable.
Dr. Trujillo was looking at some images from a strip of sky that had been recorded by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a long-running survey of the universe, when he saw a small, mysterious blur of light. After training the Gran Telescopio Canarias, currently the largest optical telescope in the world, on the faint patch of light, he concluded that it was a small galaxy. It was so transparent that he could see other, more distant galaxies behind it.
The team estimates that Nube is a dwarf galaxy only one-tenth as bright as others of its type, yet 10 times larger than other galaxies with a comparable number of stars.
"To show what this means to anyone who knows a little astronomy, this galaxy is one-third the size of the Milky Way but has a mass similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud," she said, referring to a galaxy that is a satellite to the Milky Way and is visible in the Southern Hemisphere.
Invisible scaffolding
Over the last century, beginning with work in the 1930s by Fritz Zwicky, a Bulgarian-born Swiss astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, astronomers have slowly concluded that most of the universe is composed of stuff we can't see. The galaxies are swaddled in clouds of so-called dark matter, which outweighs the ordinary atomic matter that we and stars are made of by 6 to 1. Nobody knows what dark matter is, but its gravity is what pulls ordinary matter into clouds that light up into stars and galaxies.
The prevailing view for the last 40 years has held that dark matter comprises hypothetical, exotic particles called weakly interacting massive particles, or wimps. Leftovers from the Big Bang, wimps are invisible and slow, compared with the speed of light, and can only be detected through their gravitational effect on other objects. In computer simulations, this "cold dark matter" reproduces the large-scale structures seen in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.
But in computer simulations of smaller-scale structures, this model of dark matter breaks; in dwarf galaxies, for instance, such dark matter should result in higher central concentrations of stars than are actually observed. Many astrophysicists attribute this discrepancy to their inability to model complex, messy phenomena like shock waves and magnetic fields -- so-called gastrophysics -- that prevail when atoms get close together.
Moreover, particle physicists have failed to produce or detect any of these hypothesized particles in the lab. Some scientists have proposed the existence of other versions of dark matter. Those include "fuzzy" or "warm" dark matter, composed of hypothetical, ultralight particles called axions, and even a whole "dark sector" of invisible particles and forces that would create galaxies with a different footprint.
The study of dark galaxies offers a unique opportunity to explore the origin and evolution of galaxies -- and to test ideas about the dark matter that pervades them.
Because of the optical haze in Nube, Dr. Montes said, astronomers can see the shape of the dark-matter halo that underlies the dwarf galaxy. This shape -- resembling a banana, cigar or surfboard -- seems incompatible with the predicted behavior of cold dark matter and more in line with fuzzy dark matter. Such a conclusion would revolutionize physics and cosmology but is far from settled.
Jeremiah P. Ostriker, an expert at Columbia University on the evolution and structures of galaxies, agrees. In low-mass galaxies, he said, the cold dark matter model predicts that there should be more stars in the center of the galaxy and progressively fewer toward the edges. But other types of dark matter could clump differently, resulting in a more even distribution of starlight.
"These new low-surface-brightness systems fit better with fuzzy dark matter than with cold dark matter," he said in an email.
Dr. Montes and her co-authors aren't so sure. "Although fuzzy dark matter could relieve some of the small-scale tensions appearing in the cold dark matter scenario, more work is needed to assess this model," they wrote in their paper.
Dr. O'Neil and her team are hoping to detect visible starlight from the invisible galaxy J0613+52. Doing so would help them figure out what kinds of stars inhabit such a galaxy. "If we do not detect it, that, too, is exciting, as it will mean we have detected something whose stellar content is far more diffuse than anything seen to date," she said.
And suppose they find nothing? At what point is something too dark even to be called a galaxy?
"This is a very interesting question," she said. Traditionally, the term galaxy referred to a collection of stars and gas; then, dark matter was added.
"Now it seems that the need for stars may not be necessary in the definition," she said. "This new type of object really opens up and forces us to revise the concept of what a galaxy is."

As Apple Cracks Down, Beeper Customers Lose Service: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Beeper Mini customers were using their Mac computers to connect to iPhone messaging on their Android phones. Now, they say Apple has blocked the messaging service on their Macs.
When Apple blocked the Beeper Mini app last month from giving Android users access to the tech giant's messaging service, Beeper encouraged customers to use their Mac computers instead to connect and continue sending messages.
But in recent days, dozens of Beeper customers have reported that they no longer have access to Apple's messaging service on their Android phones or their Mac computers. Several have called Apple's customer support and been told that the company had revoked their Mac's access to iMessage because of irregular activity. None had been warned that they would be losing the service.
For Beeper customers, many of whom prefer Android devices to iPhones but favor Mac computers over PCs, Apple's move shows just how far the company will go to maintain control over its services. In these instances, Apple cut off one of the services that it provided with its computers because it had objected to the way its customers used it.
"Legally, they're probably in the clear because of their terms of service, but it's still kind of crappy," said Matvei Vevitsis, who noticed this month that he could no longer send his mother iMessages through his 12-inch MacBook.
Apple declined to comment. After The New York Times contacted Apple, some Beeper customers began reporting that they had been unblocked in recent days.
The maneuver is the latest in a tit-for-tat between Apple and Beeper that has gotten the attention of antitrust regulators. Last year, the Justice Department met with Beeper's leadership team about Apple's actions, and the Federal Trade Commission said in a blog that it would scrutinize "dominant" players that "use privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability" between services.
Beeper Mini debuted on Dec. 5 as an app that offered Android phone users the ability to send encrypted messages to iPhones. It made it possible for people with Samsung and Google devices to send high-resolution videos and use perks like animations, which had previously been reserved for iPhone customers. Within three days, the app had added 100,000 customers.
But Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created security and privacy risks.
Beeper then came up with a solution to maintain its service. It asked customers to use their Mac computers to get a registration code for iMessage and to use that to log into Beeper on an Android device.
Mr. Vevitsis, 31, said he had used a MacBook from around 2015 to connect Beeper to Apple's messaging service on his Samsung Galaxy phone. A self-proclaimed tech tinkerer, he prefers using Android phones because the system is more customizable than an iPhone. But his mother has an iPhone, and he wanted to be able to send her high-quality photos and videos.
Early this year, Beeper stopped working, and Mr. Vevitsis was no longer able to send his mother messages. He opened his MacBook and tried to message her directly but had the same problem, so he called Apple support.
"Apple told me my iMessage had been flagged for spam," he said. The Apple support representative had offered to unblock him, but that didn't solve the problem. Ultimately, he downloaded an app that allowed him to create an alternative serial number for his MacBook and was able to begin using iMessages again.
Beeper said more than two dozen of some 3,500 customers had reported similar outages on their Macs. Several of those customers spoke with The Times and provided records and details of their conversations with Apple support.
Ghazi Shami, the founder of Empire, an independent music company in San Francisco, said he had run into similar trouble. Like Mr. Vevitsis, Mr. Shami prefers using a Galaxy to an iPhone, but many musicians send audio recordings with iMessage. Mr. Shami would connect to Beeper using his iMac Pro desktop so that he could send and receive those recordings from his phone.
But late last year, he said, Beeper stopped working and iMessage shut down on his iMac, which Apple priced at $ 5,000 when it was released in 2017.
"I don't think it's in the spirit of Silicon Valley to block someone's serial number because they were testing beta software," Mr. Shami said. "It's like they're reprimanding schoolchildren."

Vision Pro: We've Been Here Before: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Starting with Google Glass, all have been plagued with the same issues, even as Apple plunges into the market with its Vision Pro.
After years of anticipation, Apple's first major new product in nearly a decade has arrived. The $ 3,500 Vision Pro, a face computer that resembles ski goggles, will be released next week.
So, what can we expect?
The device, which includes high-resolution displays and sensors that track eye movements and hand gestures, is one of Apple's most ambitious products. It bills the headset as the beginning of an era of "spatial computing," which blends data with the physical world to make our lives better. Imagine giving a presentation with digital notes shown in the corner of your eye, for example.
I was among the first group of journalists to try the Vision Pro last year and walked away impressed with the quality of the picture but ultimately not sure that people would want to wear it. My skepticism was colored by my experience wearing more than a dozen headsets in the last 12 years from companies like Google, Meta, Snap, Samsung and Sony, including virtual reality goggles that plugged into bulky desktop computers and smart glasses that shot photos. The devices were intended to create immersive experiences for getting things done by moving the body instead of typing on keyboards.
Broadly speaking, the problem with headsets has less to do with technology and more to do with behavior: People quickly get tired of wearing a computer on their face, the devices end up in closets, and software developers lose interest in making apps. Sales of mixed reality and virtual reality headsets fell 8.3 percent last year, according to the research firm IDC, though they may rebound this year with Apple entering the market.
Even though Apple has a reputation for being late to the party with superior products, as it was with music players and smartphones, the Vision Pro is not guaranteed to be a breakthrough hit, especially with its breathtaking price.
"Is this Apple entering a market late but coming in with the best product and therefore will be successful?" asked Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst and former Apple marketing director. "Or is there not an existing market because there are no $ 3,500 headsets aimed for the mass market?"
To better understand how an Apple face computer may (or may not) fit into our lives in the future, it's worth taking this moment to look back at the many face computers I've worn that set the scene for the Vision Pro.
Smart glasses
In 2012, Google unveiled a mixed-reality headset, Google Glass. It was essentially a headband with a camera and a monocle, positioned above your right eye, that contained a transparent display showing calendar and maps software. To demonstrate its exciting potential, Google produced a video of people wearing the face computer while leaping out of an airplane.
When I tried an early prototype of Google Glass that year, the only working feature was a maps app that showed directions as I walked around a path. This could be useful, in theory, to keep my eyes on the road while driving or bicycling, but at a significant cost: I looked like a "Star Trek" character.
Sure enough, after Google Glass made its public debut, pandemonium ensued. A blogger in San Francisco was assaulted for wearing one. Memes emerged, including the term "Glasshole" for anyone who could potentially be recording video of people without their permission. Google eventually marketed the monocle as a business device, but finally killed the product in 2023.
After Google Glass flopped, the tech industry regrouped and tried to address the design and privacy issues. In 2016 and 2021, Snap and Meta released stylish glasses with cameras and tiny lights that indicated when a user was recording. Both products were unpopular. I recently tested the second-generation Meta glasses and concluded that while they looked satisfyingly hip, the privacy concerns remained because no one noticed when I was taking pictures of them.
Smartphone-powered virtual reality
The tech industry was also eager to sell people on a different type of headset for virtual reality. The headsets, which looked like plastic goggles, blocked out your view of the outside world to immerse yourself in a 3-D digital environment and experience something as if you were actually there -- by moving your head around to look at the Grand Canyon, for example.
To make virtual reality headsets an easier sell, tech companies like Google and Samsung tried relying on smartphones for their screens and computing power. In 2015, Samsung collaborated with the virtual reality company Oculus to design Gear VR, a headset into which the user could insert a smartphone to look at virtual reality content. In 2016, Google released Daydream VR, a similar product for Android phones.
While the products lowered the cost for people to try VR, I ran into problems with them. The smartphones running VR software became very hot, their batteries drained rapidly and the applications were gimmicky -- one simulation I tried involved staring at a virtual dinosaur. Google killed Daydream VR in 2019, and Samsung announced the end of its VR content services in 2020.
Plugged-in VR
In 2016, Oculus, which Meta had acquired for $ 2 billion two years earlier, released the Oculus Rift, a high-end VR system that plugged into a powerful desktop computer. The full bundle, which included the headset, a game controller and a computer, cost $ 1,500. With 30 games at launch, the product was marketed as a next-generation gaming device.
Virtual reality games were designed to let you move around as if you were inside the game. A shooting game could involve looking for guns and bending over and using motion controllers to pick them up and fire them at opponents.
Other similar products followed, including Sony's $ 400 PlayStation VR, a headset that plugged into PlayStation consoles. For years, the PlayStation headset dominated the high-powered virtual reality space because it lowered costs by eliminating the need to buy a separate computer. The second-generation PlayStation headset came out last year.
Nonetheless, a Sony executive recently called virtual reality a "challenging category" because VR had not changed much for the games industry. Most people still prefer to play video games on a television.
In my experience testing all of these products over the years, they shared the same flaws: The headsets felt heavy, the hardware and wires created clutter in a living room, and there weren't many compelling games to play.
Stand-alone headsets and mixed reality
Stand-alone headsets, which cram the computer, display and sensor technologies into one product, have become the most convenient VR products to date. Since 2019, Meta's Quest headsets, which range from $ 250 to $ 1,000, have used this approach, but the products are still not mainstream hits.
Last year, Meta released the $ 500 Quest 3, its first consumer headset with a focus on mixed reality, which uses cameras to see into the real world while using the headset. When firing a gun inside a shooting game, you can take cover behind the couch in your living room, for example. In my tests, I concluded that while the graphics had greatly improved, the headset felt too heavy on my neck after about 15 minutes. I also felt unimpressed with the games and the device's short battery life of two hours.
This brings us all to the product in question: the Vision Pro, which Apple is marketing as a productivity tool to replace your laptop with a virtual screen and digital keyboard, a 3-D movie player and a gaming device.
At 21 ounces, the Vision Pro is just as heavy as Meta's products, and my eyes and neck felt similarly fatigued after I wore it for half an hour.
The Apple headset's battery, a separate brick that connects to the goggles via a wire, delivers two hours of life like Meta's -- not enough to finish most feature-length movies, let alone get much work done.
As for games, no major game studio has yet announced any made specifically for the Vision Pro. The headset does include an app for looking at a 3-D dinosaur, though.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "If China takes Taiwan, they will turn the world off, potentially," Donald Trump told Fox News recently, apparently referring to a potential seizure of one company that is central to, well, pretty much everything. Indeed, it's arguably the most important company in the world.
The company Trump alluded to, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or T.S.M.C., is the only corporation I can think of in history that could cause a global depression if it were forced to halt production.
These days it seems impossible to have a conversation about geopolitics or economics without coming back to T.S.M.C., which makes about 90 percent of the world's most advanced chips. If the lights went out here in Hsinchu, in the company's ultraclean and ultrasecure buildings, you might not be able to buy a new phone, car or watch. Armies could run out of precision-guided missiles and hospitals could struggle to replace advanced X-ray and M.R.I. machines. It might be like the Covid-19 supply chain chip disruption -- times 10 -- and T.S.M.C., unfortunately, is situated in a region where war is possible and could threaten production.
"Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the best-managed companies and important companies in the world," Warren Buffett said last year. But he sold his $ 4 billion stake in T.S.M.C. because, he said, "I don't like its location."
Some believe -- it appears this may be Trump's view -- that T.S.M.C. is so valuable that it might tempt China to try to grab Taiwan, and then bring the world to its knees.
"The more you talk about silicon, the less rational people become," Mark Liu, the chairman of T.S.M.C., told me.
So let's try to have a nuanced conversation about T.S.M.C., its significance and its vulnerabilities.
For starters, T.S.M.C.'s factories, or fabs, would probably be useless to China after an invasion, even if engineers remained on the job and even if the fabs weren't bombed by American or Taiwanese defenders to keep them out of China's hands. That's because the chips are designed in other countries and require international networks to keep production going. To China, T.S.M.C. would be about as useful as a dead phone.
What happens in these fabs -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the work is done by nonunion, unprotesting machines -- is astonishing. T.S.M.C. has transformed an industry that now measures its work in nanometers (billionths of a meter). A human red blood cell is around 7,000 nanometers wide, and T.S.M.C. is now developing 1.4-nanometer chips.
"There's nothing like the T.S.M.C. plants," Matt Pottinger, a longtime Asia hand who was deputy national security adviser under Trump, told me. "It's really black magic."
But black magic requires enormous amounts of energy -- T.S.M.C. single-handedly consumes perhaps 7 percent of Taiwan's electricity -- and that creates a risk. Even if China couldn't take over T.S.M.C. fabs, it could disrupt production as a way of putting pressure on Taiwan and the West simply with cyberattacks on the grid.
"It'd be pretty easy for China to bring down the power networks," Pottinger said. Alternatively, China could impose a partial blockade with the same effect. Either could quickly ripple through the global economy.
Which means it would also ripple through China's economy. T.S.M.C. chips are crucial inputs for Chinese manufacturing, so Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, and others have described the chip industry as Taiwan's "silicon shield" -- meaning that China wouldn't dare attack because that would destroy its own economy.
I'm as skeptical of this argument as I am of the notion that China will invade Taiwan to grab T.S.M.C. The silicon shield reminds me of the 1909 best-selling book "The Great Illusion," which was translated into 25 languages and predicted that Europe was so economically interdependent that warfare was obsolete. World War I and World War II killed its sales.
It's definitely not optimal that the global economy depends on chips from an area vulnerable to earthquakes and war. That's one reason America is investing some $ 39 billion through the CHIPS Act to manufacture chips domestically. But bringing a big chunk of advanced chipmaking back to America is already proving more difficult than passing the legislation.
It's immensely challenging for America to replicate the ecosystem in Taiwan that supports chip manufacturing, from the expertise in constructing fabs to the companies that clean the gowns worn inside them. And America is a plodding bureaucracy where it's harder and more expensive to get environmental approvals and building permits than it is in other countries.
A sign of trouble: Both T.S.M.C. and Samsung have already had to delay plans for new plants in the United States. There's some uncertainty about how advanced those American-made chips will be, and 18 months after President Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law, the American subsidies are slow going out the door.
And a cautionary tale: T.S.M.C. built a fab in Washington State in the late 1990s, and for many years it was an expensive headache.
"It was just a series of ugly surprises," Morris Chang, the founder of T.S.M.C., said on a podcast in 2022. Despite enormous effort and 25 years of experience, the costs of production at that plant are still 50 percent higher than in Taiwan, Chang added.
Perhaps because he's 92 years old and retired, Chang is candid about the challenges of the American strategy.
"I think it will be a very expensive exercise in futility," he said of the U.S. efforts. "The U.S. will increase onshore manufacturing of semiconductors somewhat. But all of that will be very high cost increase, high unit cost. It will be noncompetitive in the world markets."
Perhaps it makes sense for the United States to manufacture noncompetitive chips to safeguard access to them, but let's recognize that there are trade-offs: The tens of billions of dollars spent on fabs subsidies would also boost American competitiveness if they were spent to reduce child poverty and improve American education. If Americans were as good at math as the Taiwanese, our fabs might work better, too.
Given how difficult it is to move production, the best way to safeguard the manufacturing of chips may be to work harder than ever to deter and avoid war in the Taiwan Strait. More on that in a forthcoming column.

How to Cut Down Your Screen Time but Still Get Things Done: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's Routines and Apple's Shortcuts combine multiple steps into one command to make your phone or tablet do more of the work for you.
Worried about smartphone addiction after seeing your latest screen-time statistics? A certain amount of phone use is often necessary these days, but repetitive tasks pile on the minutes. Google's Assistant Routines and Apple's Shortcuts app are two free options that may help -- by condensing several actions into one tap or command. Here's how to get started.
Google's Routines
Say you'd like to ease into the day with a personalized audio briefing -- for example, the day's weather forecast, commuting conditions, your meeting schedule, and a news summary or podcast. You'd prefer to listen while getting ready for work, but you do not want to keep interacting with the phone. Here's where the Google Assistant for Android or iOS comes in, with an easy way to do all that in a Routine.
Download the app if you don't have it, then open the Google Assistant settings by voice ("Hey, Google, open Assistant Routines") or by tapping the Settings icon; choose Apps, then Assistant and then Routines. The Routines screen offers several suggestions for different scenarios, like a routine for those work-from-home days, a routine that plays music and adjusts your smart thermostat when you arrive home and a routine for winding down at bedtime. Tap "Set up routine" on the one you want to use, and edit its actions to your liking.
You can design your own routine from scratch, too. Tap the + button at the top of the screen, and then, from the menu, select the actions you want to include. Pick a starter phrase or condition that will activate the routine, and follow the rest of the onscreen instructions.
To manually run a routine, say your starter phrase; iOS users should have the Google Assistant app open. Routines can be activated automatically by a specific time or event, like sunrise or sunset. Android users can make a home-screen icon that runs the Routine with a tap. (Action Blocks, a Google accessibility tool for Android, can also make home-screen shortcuts for common actions.)
Routines run on Assistant-compatible smart speakers, watches and other devices as well; Samsung has similar "Modes and Routines" tools for its Galaxy devices. The Google Guidebooks site has an illustrated tutorial for setting up a Routine.
Apple's Shortcuts
Apple's Shortcuts app for iPhone, iPad and Mac lets you string together separate actions for a larger task into one little script. The app has gotten easier to use over the years, and recent updates have added more features. Just ask Siri to "open Shortcuts," swipe through your screens until you find it or download it from the App Store.
The app includes a large collection of ready-made shortcuts that do things like estimate the travel time to meetings or convert text into audio. To see the included shortcuts, tap the Gallery icon at the bottom of the screen. To add a shortcut to your personal collection, tap the + button on its tile.
In the app, tap the Shortcuts icon at the bottom of the screen to see your collection. You can fire off a shortcut by tapping it or by asking Siri to run it. Some shortcuts appear on the Share menu, or you can add home-screen icons for them. Your shortcuts sync with other devices using the same Apple ID, including an Apple Watch. Additionally, Shortcuts can run automatically when prompted by a specific time or by a certain event.
If you don't see an existing shortcut for something you want to do, create your own (like a shortcut to open the Google Assistant app). Start by tapping the + sign in the upper-right corner of the Shortcuts app. Next, add steps (in the order they should occur) from the menu of actions and apps.
For example, if you have a regular FaceTime call with the same group of friends, you can condense those multiple steps into one. Tap the Add Action button, select All Actions from the menu and choose FaceTime from the list. Tap the grayed-out Contact button and add a name from your Contacts list. After you add the first name, tap the + button and repeat the steps until you have added everyone else. Name the shortcut, then tap the Done button.
You can save the shortcut to your home screen by tapping the Share menu icon and choosing Add to Home Screen. Tap it to call everyone in the group -- or tell Siri to run that shortcut by name.
Certain shortcuts can be complicated to construct, and it may take a few tries to get your creation to work. The Shortcuts User Guide on Apple's support site has detailed instructions for creating more complex sequences for chores you want to automate, like transcribing voice memos to notes.
Routines, Shortcuts and other automations probably won't cure a serious smartphone addiction. However, they can help you spend fewer minutes squinting at a screen -- and save time in the long run.

The Tech That Needs Fixing in 2024 And What Got Fixed Last Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The best tech, from universal power charging to foldable phones, solved practical problems. But the worst tech, including self-driving cars and cryptocurrency, put us in harm's way.
Tech companies would like us to believe that their products tell a story about progress. Faster phones! Better cameras! Brighter screens! Yet despite all the improvements, there are pieces of tech that have been flawed for years.
Text messaging technology, which created what many call the "green vs. blue bubble" disparity, has made texting between Apple and Android phones a subpar experience for nearly as long as smartphones have existed. Newer inventions, such as self-driving cars and cryptocurrency, continue to put people in harm's way.
To give credit where it's due, there were some improvements last year that were big wins for consumers. We now have a common power cable for charging our many gadgets. So-called foldable smartphones that open and close like a book now have consumer-friendly software. Companies also made strides in wireless phone service technology, which greatly simplified the process for people to switch phone plans and save lots of money.
With the start of a new year, let's look ahead at the tech that needs improvement this year and reflect on the solutions we found in 2023.
The Tech That Needs to Be Fixed in 2024
Text Messaging
"Who's the green bubble?" Among smartphone users, this has become a common question inside group texts. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But when texts are sent between iPhone users and Android users, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
The technological incompatibility between smartphones has created a deeper sociological divide. In schools, children with Android phones are often mocked and excluded from activities by those with iPhones, according to education experts. And some adults using dating apps perceive messages sent through a green bubble to be a "red flag" for a potential suitor's financial instability because some Android phones cost less than iPhones.
Later this year, a big part of these texting issues will be fixed. Apple said it planned to adopt rich communication services, a modern texting standard that Google and Android phone makers use for messaging. Text messages sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but videos and images will load in high resolution, and features like location sharing and read receipts will also work inside texts. But it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to end the bubble war.
Self-Driving Cars
The rise and fall of Cruise, a self-driving car company, is a cautionary tale for Silicon Valley's modus operandi of placing innovation above all else, including public safety. In October, a few months after California regulators allowed Cruise and Waymo to fully operate paid driverless taxi services, a Cruise vehicle struck a San Francisco pedestrian and dragged the victim for 20 feet.
Shortly after, regulators ordered Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, to halt its robotaxi service. The company cut 25 percent of its work force, and Kyle Vogt, the company's chief executive, resigned.
Here's hoping 2024 is a better year for autonomous driving technology. Waymo, the driverless car company spun out of Google, continues to test its services with far less controversy. Waymo cars are still not as proficient as a competent driver -- in my experience, they can struggle to find pickup zones, stop abruptly and take inefficient routes -- but then again, many human drivers can be just as annoying.
Cryptocurrency
For the average person experimenting with cryptocurrency, the premise of the technology has been dubious from the start: You buy virtual currency through a decentralized system of computers, similar to the way Wikipedia is run by a decentralized network of writers. This, in theory, offers privacy and gives consumers more control of their money than a traditional bank does.
The spectacular implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange underscored the sheer risks of hoarding money in a decentralized financial service. When FTX declared bankruptcy in 2022, those with holdings there lost their money, although they could still recoup some in the bankruptcy process. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was convicted in November of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, which involved stealing $ 10 billion from customers to finance political contributions, venture capital investment and lavish purchases, including a five-bedroom penthouse in the Bahamas.
Other than the inherent risks of entrusting cash with an unregulated and relatively unknown group, there is still no strong use case for cryptocurrency for the average person. While there may be plenty of things to buy with crypto, the transaction process, which involves using third-party crypto wallet apps, remains more complex and time-consuming than making traditional payments with a credit card or bank service.
The Tech That Was Fixed in 2023
Chargers
Everyone is familiar with this scenario: You're on the road and thought you packed your charging cables for your phone, laptop and earbuds. But you realize that just one wire was left at home, so it's off to the drugstore to buy another. This annoying predicament was exacerbated by companies (namely Apple) that designed their products to work with proprietary chargers.
Thanks to a new European mandate requiring all portable devices to use a common charger, we're now a step closer to the dream of carrying just one charger for all of our devices. Last year, new iPhones no longer shipped with the Lightning port that Apple had been using for more than a decade. Instead, they shipped with USB-C, the oval-shaped charging port that is commonly used by many laptops, Android phones and audio accessories. What a relief.
Foldable Phones
For the last four years, smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola have been hyping smartphones that can be folded or unfolded to decrease or increase their screen size. The devices received little fanfare because they were cumbersome to use, their software was gimmicky -- and, at nearly $ 2,000, they were more than double the cost of traditional handsets.
Last year, Google released the Pixel Fold, a foldable phone that fixed many of the problems and gave a clear answer for why the category should exist. Unfolded, it transforms into a tablet that makes reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. Folded up, it becomes a regular smartphone that is not too chunky inside a pocket. In my tests, its camera was also excellent, and battery life was long.
The remaining issue is price. At $ 1,800, the Pixel Fold may be inaccessible to most people. But the maturation of the technology offers an exciting glimpse of what's to come for smartphones and screens in general.
eSIMs
When it began arriving on smartphones about six years ago, eSIM technology, the digital equivalent of the SIM card that carries your phone number, was tough to recommend. The technology was intended to simplify the process of activating a new phone line when you're taking a smartphone abroad and connecting to a foreign network, for instance. But in the early days, eSIMs were a mixed bag. Some plans failed to activate, and others charged exorbitant rates for stingy amounts of cellular data.
In 2023, eSIM technology reached a high point. Now dozens of trustworthy mobile network operators offer fast, reliable wireless services for much less than traditional carriers. The steps to activate eSIMs are now simpler, too.
That all leads to benefits that could help you save thousands of dollars over a few years on wireless service. For one, when traveling abroad, you can easily use eSIM to activate a phone plan and pay a few dollars for a generous bucket of cellular data (for example, $ 4.50 for one gigabyte of data in Italy using the eSIM app Airalo).
For domestic wireless service, if you subscribe to AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon, you can use eSIM to experiment with cheaper phone plans offered by discount carriers like Visible, Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile that cost as little as $ 25 a month -- and break up with your big carrier once you've found a satisfying phone plan.

Tech companies would like us to believe that their products tell a story about progress. Faster phones! Better cameras! Brighter screens! Yet despite all the improvements, there are pieces of tech that have been flawed for years.
Text messaging technology, which created what many call the “green vs. blue bubble” disparity, has made texting between Apple and Android phones a subpar experience for nearly as long as smartphones have existed. Newer inventions, such as self-driving cars and cryptocurrency, continue to put people in harm’s way.
To give credit where it’s due, there were some improvements last year that were big wins for consumers. We now have a common power cable for charging our many gadgets. So-called foldable smartphones that open and close like a book now have consumer-friendly software. Companies also made strides in wireless phone service technology, which greatly simplified the process for people to switch phone plans and save lots of money.
With the start of a new year, let’s look ahead at the tech that needs improvement this year and reflect on the solutions we found in 2023.
The Tech That Needs to Be Fixed in 2024
Text Messaging
“Who’s the green bubble?” Among smartphone users, this has become a common question inside group texts. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emoji and animations. But when texts are sent between iPhone users and Android users, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
The technological incompatibility between smartphones has created a deeper sociological divide. In schools, children with Android phones are often mocked and excluded from activities by those with iPhones, according to education experts. And some adults using dating apps perceive messages sent through a green bubble to be a “red flag” for a potential suitor’s financial instability because some Android phones cost less than iPhones.
Later this year, a big part of these texting issues will be fixed. Apple said it planned to adopt rich communication services, a modern texting standard that Google and Android phone makers use for messaging. Text messages sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but videos and images will load in high resolution, and features like location sharing and read receipts will also work inside texts. But it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to end the bubble war.
Self-Driving Cars
The rise and fall of Cruise, a self-driving car company, is a cautionary tale for Silicon Valley’s modus operandi of placing innovation above all else, including public safety. In October, a few months after California regulators allowed Cruise and Waymo to fully operate paid driverless taxi services, a Cruise vehicle struck a San Francisco pedestrian and dragged the victim for 20 feet.
Shortly after, regulators ordered Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, to halt its robotaxi service. The company cut 25% of its workforce, and Kyle Vogt, the company’s chief executive, resigned.
Here’s hoping 2024 is a better year for autonomous driving technology. Waymo, the driverless car company spun out of Google, continues to test its services with far less controversy. Waymo cars are still not as proficient as a competent driver — in my experience, they can struggle to find pickup zones, stop abruptly and take inefficient routes — but then again, many human drivers can be just as annoying.
Cryptocurrency
For the average person experimenting with cryptocurrency, the premise of the technology has been dubious from the start: You buy virtual currency through a decentralized system of computers, similar to the way Wikipedia is run by a decentralized network of writers. This, in theory, offers privacy and gives consumers more control of their money than a traditional bank does.
The spectacular implosion of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange underscored the sheer risks of hoarding money in a decentralized financial service. When FTX declared bankruptcy in 2022, those with holdings there lost their money, although they could still recoup some in the bankruptcy process. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was convicted in November of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, which involved stealing $10 billion from customers to finance political contributions, venture capital investment and lavish purchases, including a five-bedroom penthouse in the Bahamas.
Other than the inherent risks of entrusting cash with an unregulated and relatively unknown group, there is still no strong use case for cryptocurrency for the average person. While there may be plenty of things to buy with crypto, the transaction process, which involves using third-party crypto wallet apps, remains more complex and time-consuming than making traditional payments with a credit card or bank service.
The Tech That Was Fixed in 2023
Chargers
Everyone is familiar with this scenario: You’re on the road and thought you packed your charging cables for your phone, laptop and earbuds. But you realize that just one wire was left at home, so it’s off to the drugstore to buy another. This annoying predicament was exacerbated by companies (namely Apple) that designed their products to work with proprietary chargers.
Thanks to a new European mandate requiring all portable devices to use a common charger, we’re now a step closer to the dream of carrying just one charger for all of our devices. Last year, new iPhones no longer shipped with the Lightning port that Apple had been using for more than a decade. Instead, they shipped with USB-C, the oval-shaped charging port that is commonly used by many laptops, Android phones and audio accessories. What a relief.
Foldable Phones
For the past four years, smartphone makers like Samsung and Motorola have been hyping smartphones that can be folded or unfolded to decrease or increase their screen size. The devices received little fanfare because they were cumbersome to use, their software was gimmicky — and, at nearly $2,000, they were more than double the cost of traditional handsets.
Last year, Google released the Pixel Fold, a foldable phone that fixed many of the problems and gave a clear answer for why the category should exist. Unfolded, it transforms into a tablet that makes reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen. Folded up, it becomes a regular smartphone that is not too chunky inside a pocket. In my tests, its camera was also excellent, and battery life was long.
The remaining issue is price. At $1,800, the Pixel Fold might be inaccessible to most people. But the maturation of the technology offers an exciting glimpse of what’s to come for smartphones and screens in general.
eSIMs
When it began arriving on smartphones about six years ago, eSIM technology, the digital equivalent of the SIM card that carries your phone number, was tough to recommend. The technology was intended to simplify the process of activating a new phone line when you’re taking a smartphone abroad and connecting to a foreign network, for instance. But in the early days, eSIMs were a mixed bag. Some plans failed to activate, and others charged exorbitant rates for stingy amounts of cellular data.
In 2023, eSIM technology reached a high point. Now dozens of trustworthy mobile network operators offer fast, reliable wireless services for much less than traditional carriers. The steps to activate eSIMs are now simpler, too.
That all leads to benefits that could help you save thousands of dollars over a few years on wireless service. For one, when traveling abroad, you can easily use eSIM to activate a phone plan and pay a few dollars for a generous bucket of cellular data (for example, $4.50 for one gigabyte of data in Italy using the eSIM app Airalo).
For domestic wireless service, if you subscribe to AT&T, T-Mobile or Verizon, you can use eSIM to experiment with cheaper phone plans offered by discount carriers like Visible, Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile that cost as little as $25 a month — and break up with your big carrier once you’ve found a satisfying phone plan.

U.S. Is Close To Bringing Antitrust Suit Against Apple: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Justice Department officials are in the late stages of investigating the iPhone maker, focusing on how Apple has used its other products and services to defend against threats to its core business.
The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple and could file a sweeping antitrust case taking aim at the company's strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone as soon as the first half of this year, said three people with knowledge of the matter.
The agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company's devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active.
Specifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple's payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said.
Senior leaders in the Justice Department's antitrust division are reviewing the results of the investigation so far, said two of the people. The agency's officials have met with Apple multiple times, including in December, to discuss the investigation. No final decision has been made about whether a lawsuit should be filed or what it should include, and Apple has not had a final meeting with the Justice Department in which it can make its case to the government before a lawsuit is filed.
The Justice Department is closing in on what would be the most consequential federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple, which is the most valuable tech company in the world. If the lawsuit is filed, American regulators will have sued four of the biggest tech companies for monopolistic business practices in less than five years. The Justice Department is currently facing off against Google in two antitrust cases, focused on its search and ad tech businesses, while the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon and Meta for stifling competition.
The Apple suit would likely be even more expansive than previous challenges to the company, attacking its powerful business model that draws together the iPhone with devices like the Apple Watch and services like Apple Pay to attract and keep consumers loyal to its products. Rivals have said that they have been denied access to key Apple features, like the Siri virtual assistant, prompting them to argue the practices are anticompetitive.
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment for this article. Apple also declined to comment.
The company has previously said that its practices do not violate antitrust law. In defending its business practices against critics in the past, Apple said that its "approach has always been to grow the pie" and "create more opportunities not just for our business, but for artists, creators, entrepreneurs and every 'crazy one' with a big idea."
The company prides itself on the way the iPhone integrates hardware and software to create a seamless customer experience. In 2020, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said during testimony before a congressional antitrust committee that the company redefined mobile phones with "its effortless user experience, its simplicity of design and a high-quality ecosystem." He added that Apple competed against Samsung, LG, Google and other smartphone makers, which offer a different approach.
"Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business," Mr. Cook said at the time. "That is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any product category."
The case would add to the growing regulatory pressure both domestically and abroad cutting into Apple's business, currently valued at $ 2.83 trillion.
This year, European regulators are expected to force Apple to accommodate app stores beyond its own under the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 to rein in tech giants. Similar actions against the App Store have been taken or are under consideration in South Korea and Japan.
Additionally, the European Commission said in 2021 that Apple had violated its antitrust laws by imposing app store fees on competitors to its Apple Music product. The commission's investigation into the issue is continuing.
The resolution of the Justice Department's investigation could be affected by the details of how Apple complies with European regulations, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was ongoing.
Apple is facing the increased regulatory pressure as its business slows. Last year, the company reported its annual revenue fell 2.8 percent, to $ 383 billion, its first decline in a fiscal year since 2019, as sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs slowed. Still, the company sold more than 200 million iPhones and accounted for nearly three-quarters of the smartphones sold worldwide that were priced above $ 600, analysts estimate.
When the Justice Department started its tech investigations in 2019, it prioritized its antitrust review of Google over Apple because it lacked the financial resources and personnel to fully evaluate both companies, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That changed in 2022 after the department's budget increased.
The investigation has encompassed a wider span of Apple's business interests than previously reported, said six people with knowledge of the meetings. That includes how Apple has blocked cloud gaming apps, which let users stream a multitude of titles to their phones, from being offered in its App Store.
Investigators spoke with executives at Tile, the Bluetooth tracking service, about Apple's competing AirTag product and the company's restrictions to outside parties on access to the iPhone's location services. Executives at Beeper, a start-up that made iMessage available on Android phones, spoke with investigators about how Apple blocked it from making it possible to offer messaging across competing smartphone operating systems. Investigators also had conversations with banks and payment apps about how Apple prevents them from accessing the tap-to-pay function on iPhones.
Tile and Beeper declined to comment for this article.
They have also looked at how the Apple Watch works better alongside the iPhone than other competing smartwatches. Users of Garmin devices have complained in Apple's support forums about being unable to use their watches to reply to certain text messages from their iPhones or tweak the notifications they receive from the iPhone that they have connected to their watch.
Apple's new privacy tool, App Tracking Transparency, which allows iPhone users to explicitly choose whether an app can track them, drew scrutiny because of its curtailing of user data collection by advertisers. Advertising companies have said that the tool is anticompetitive.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, encouraged the Justice Department to look at the issue in its conversations with the agency, two of the people said. The company -- which makes most of its money from advertising -- said in 2022 that it could lose roughly $ 10 billion in revenue that year because of the changes. Meta declined to comment. Investigators have also examined Apple's policy of applying fees to purchases made inside of iPhone apps, which companies like Spotify and the dating app powerhouse Match Group say is anticompetitive.
In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple over the App Store's requirement that developers use the tech giant's payment system. A federal judge found that Apple didn't have a monopoly in mobile games, dealing a major blow to Epic's claim.
When Epic Games sued Google over similar claims, it got a different result. A jury ruled in December that Google's app store policies had violated antitrust laws. Google plans to appeal the verdict.
The Justice Department last sued Apple in 2012, accusing it of conspiring with book publishers to raise the price of digital books. Apple lost the case and paid a $ 450 million settlement.

One Path Diverges Into Two: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since the turn of the millennium, when the French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec emerged as international product design prodigies while still in their 20s -- hailed as the most famous French design stars since Philippe Starck -- they have taken equal credit for almost everything they have brought into the world.
A modular office desk with the propped-elbow informality of a French farmhouse table. A bright green room divider that spreads chaotically like algae. A fat, curvy sofa that resembles a piece of overripe fruit. Elemental furnishings for the Bourse de Commerce, an 18th-century commodities exchange in Paris transformed into a contemporary art museum.
It was impossible to know where one sibling's contributions ended and the other's began.
Their work is enshrined in the permanent collections of the Pompidou Center in Paris, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Design Museum in London and the Museum of Modern Art.
For a decade, however, the Bouroullecs have been quietly following forking paths. And now they have brought their partnership to an end. They recently moved out of their shared studio in the 10th Arrondissement in Paris and into individual spaces nearby, where they will turn out projects -- often for the same clients -- under their own names.
"I want a different type of direction," said Ronan, 52, on a recent call from France. "It's really an organic happenstance."
In a separate conversation, Erwan, 47, said that creation was "a burning energy, like you burn from the desire of making something. The pressure was not possible anymore for us to cope with."
Both brothers spoke of their tendency to clash energetically (and according to several accounts, publicly) as a constructive force that had become corrosive. They fought over the legions of details, large and small, that arise in the long and ponderous process of turning a sketch into a mass-manufactured object.
"It was sometimes funny, they really had big arguments and shouting during work sessions," recalled Rolf Fehlbaum, the chairman emeritus of Vitra, the Swiss producer of many Bouroullec (pronounced BOOR-el-eck) classics. "It was not embarrassing to them that everybody could listen, but it was useful. They were productive fights."
Ronan said of their skirmishes, "No one who was not a brother could have faced it." At a certain point, he added, the confrontations became disabling "because I think both of us already fight with ourselves."
But now that the Bouroullecs have lost their own best external critics -- each other -- and are lighting out into independent territories, what will be the effect on their work and their cultural impact? Have they absorbed so many common skills and habits through their long and intense collaboration that their designs will continue to look like emanations from a single brain? Or will they diverge creatively as well as professionally?
"I think we're going to see in the future maybe the differences that we cannot really see today," said Clémence Krzentowski, a founder of Galerie Kreo, a Parisian space that has produced limited editions of some of the brothers' most adventurous designs and, until a couple of years ago, exhibited their personal artworks collectively. (A solo show of Ronan's latest drawings and ceramics is on view there through Jan. 13; his works are also on Artsy.)
Their designs continue to be mainstays of major museum exhibitions, from the Bourse to biennials to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. But for those who were paying attention, the last year has served as a test of their solo public identities.
In April, Flos, an Italian lighting company with many Bouroullec projects under its belt (including a leather ceiling lamp called Belt), presented the brothers for the first time as individual creative forces. Flos showed Ronan's set of three ceramic lamps with light beams pointing in different directions, and Erwan's triangular columns that disguise the illumination source entirely.
The Danish textile company Kvadrat introduced fabrics inspired by Ronan's intensely colored fine art drawings, abstractions that seem to ripple from their surfaces like materials conjured from air. It has also made Erwan the creative director of a division reinventing the roller blind.
And now there is "Ronan Bouroullec," a book Phaidon published this fall filled with hundreds of photographs the elder sibling took from 2014 through 2022 and originally posted on Instagram. (The subtitle is "Day After Day.")
Erwan receives tribute in the book's brief introductory text and acknowledgments. But this is Ronan's visual diary -- "a self-portrait," as he described it -- with repeated glimpses of his daughter, his cats, his house in the brothers' native Brittany and the artworks that his acquaintances said have become increasingly central to him.
Product design is rife with teamwork. Most of the objects created for domestic life -- furniture, flatware, flower vases, light fixtures -- are developed by cohorts, most of whose members wouldn't dream of getting personal credit, much less becoming famous names.
But sometimes this world hatches celebrities, like the vacuum king James Dyson, the impish maximalist Philippe Starck, the Apple Computer visionary Jony Ive and the edgy Pop artisan/potter Jonathan Adler, not to mention architects like Zaha Hadid who flourished separately through their furniture.
And sometimes designers make their marks as people related by marriage or family ties, tugging at the mysterious bonds of intimacy, or feeding on competitive energy.
When Anders Byriel, the chief executive of Kvadrat, described the Bouroullecs as "the Charles and Ray Eames of our time," he was not just complimenting the brothers' era-defining ingenuity -- their wraparound seating that creates private nooks (Alcove for Vitra), their lights that hang from the ceiling like jungle vines (Aim for Flos), or their modular, sound-absorbing textiles that look like sculpture (Cloud for Kvadrat). He was comparing them with creative (albeit married) partners who labored -- who knows how equitably? -- behind a seamless facade. (Decades after the Eameses died, in a testament to the mysteriousness of intimate creative associations, the question of who did what and how well is still being debated.)
According to more than a dozen clients and friends interviewed for this article, the Bouroullecs have always shown contrasting temperaments and affinities. Some described Ronan as the more "poetic" of the two, sensitive to color and savoring artisanal processes like glassblowing and ceramics, while Erwan leaned into technological advancements and into products like the brothers' Serif television for Samsung.
Of the pair, Erwan has "a harder line, a harder edge, a harder personality," said Gregg Buchbinder, the owner of the American furniture company Emeco, which is getting ready to roll out an aluminum-mesh-and-wood bench called Truss on which Erwan took the lead. "He is very clever and creative, very tenacious," Buchbinder said.
"You know that fox and hedgehog of Isaiah Berlin?" Fehlbaum said. He was referring to the British philosopher who divided thinkers into "hedgehogs," or people who filter all experience through a single lens, and "foxes," who entertain a flurry of ideas.
Erwan is the hedgehog, Fehlbaum said, "interested in systems, going deeply into variations." Ronan, who whips through approaches to a design problem and bounces between painting, photography, sculpture and architecture, is the fox.
In the beginning there was no fraternal monolith, just Ronan, who found his way to design at the age of 15 after a provincial childhood in Brittany that he has said bored him to tears. He embraced the applied arts with the passion of someone on a juice fast who capitulates to a corned beef sandwich. Or as he has often described it, he got on a speeding train and never got off.
His big break came in 1997, when he exhibited a prototype for a modular kitchen at a Paris design fair that caught the eye of Giulio Cappellini, who was there scouting talent. An Italian entrepreneur, creative director and star maker, Cappellini asked to meet the kitchen's designer.
"I was waiting 10 minutes, 15 minutes. Nothing happened, why?" Cappellini recalled. He was told that Ronan was very shy and was so unnerved by the invitation that he was off smoking a cigarette. Cappellini pulled out his own pack and went to join him. Ronan's gyroscope-shaped Monofiore vase was the first of their many productions.
"Other designers do beautiful projects, but they look more or less all the same," Cappellini said. "With the Bouroullecs, every time, it was a surprise."
Erwan had entered the picture when he was still in art school and Ronan needed an extra pair of hands. The five-year age gap meant that the brothers had not been close as children, Ronan said. But "coming from the countryside, it was like when in summer you have to cut the grass. Everyone comes to help."
By 1998, when Erwan was 22, the brothers began using both names on all their designs, including a signature early piece, an enclosed bedroom on legs called Lit Clos that had the carefree attitude of a treehouse. Designed by Erwan and presented at the 2000 Milan Furniture Fair by Cappellini, it was produced only in a limited edition. It was a sensation anyway.
Rolf Hay, who with his wife, Mette, founded the Danish furniture company Hay in 2002, recalled looking to the Bouroullecs as designers who could put his young business on the right track. In 2002, the brothers' combined age was 55. The next year, Phaidon published their first monograph.
"To be honest, we were always working with them individually," Hay said of the brothers. "How much they were sharing has always been for me a little bit difficult to understand."
And now what? Hay, like many others in the Bouroullec sphere, isn't treating the separation like a divorce that requires picking sides. The company will continue working with both brothers independently and will see how the creativity flows now that the circuit between them is broken.
The bond may be stronger than it appears. "I can see when they look at each other there's something very, very strong between them," Hay said. "There's something very sensitive, and there's a lot of love."
Clients say they are not optimistic about a rapprochement. With the Bouroullecs, design has its Hall and Oates, though one can still hope for an Eagles outcome. "If they get back together, it will be like a comeback concert," Byriel said.
The brothers still have joint custody of the brand they created product by product, installation by installation, from little shelves that jut from the wall like Neolithic ledges to towering fountains studded with crystals on the Champs-Élysées.
The office that continues to manage their business is located between their new, independent workplaces. "You can't have such a success and such a collaboration" and dismantle and rebuild it easily, Erwan said. "Yes, for sure we will find ways of collaborating, but will it be for work? I'm not sure. I don't know."

Since the turn of the millennium, when French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec emerged as international product design prodigies while still in their 20s — hailed as the most famous French design stars since Philippe Starck — they have taken equal credit for almost everything they have brought into the world.
A modular office desk with the propped-elbow informality of a French farmhouse table. A bright green room divider that spreads chaotically like algae. A fat, curvy sofa that resembles a piece of overripe fruit. Elemental furnishings for the Bourse de Commerce, an 18th-century commodities exchange in Paris transformed into a contemporary art museum.
It was impossible to know where one sibling’s contributions ended and the other’s began.
Their work is enshrined in the permanent collections of the Pompidou Center in Paris, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Design Museum in London and the Museum of Modern Art.
For a decade, however, the Bouroullecs have been quietly following forking paths. And now they have brought their partnership to an end. They recently moved out of their shared studio in the 10th Arrondissement in Paris and into individual spaces nearby, where they will turn out projects — often for the same clients — under their own names.
“I want a different type of direction,” said Ronan, 52, on a recent call from France. “It’s really an organic happenstance.”
In a separate conversation, Erwan, 47, said that creation was “a burning energy, like you burn from the desire of making something. The pressure was not possible anymore for us to cope with.”
Both brothers spoke of their tendency to clash energetically (and according to several accounts, publicly) as a constructive force that had become corrosive. They fought over the legions of details, large and small, that arise in the long and ponderous process of turning a sketch into a mass-manufactured object.
“It was sometimes funny, they really had big arguments and shouting during work sessions,” recalled Rolf Fehlbaum, the chair emeritus of Vitra, the Swiss producer of many Bouroullec (pronounced BOOR-el-eck) classics. “It was not embarrassing to them that everybody could listen, but it was useful. They were productive fights.”
Ronan said of their skirmishes, “No one who was not a brother could have faced it.” At a certain point, he added, the confrontations became disabling “because I think both of us already fight with ourselves.”
But now that the Bouroullecs have lost their own best external critics — each other — and are lighting out into independent territories, what will be the effect on their work and their cultural impact? Have they absorbed so many common skills and habits through their long and intense collaboration that their designs will continue to look like emanations from a single brain? Or will they diverge creatively as well as professionally?
“I think we’re going to see in the future maybe the differences that we cannot really see today,” said Clémence Krzentowski, a founder of Galerie Kreo, a Parisian space that has produced limited editions of some of the brothers’ most adventurous designs and, until a couple of years ago, exhibited their personal artworks collectively. (A solo show of Ronan’s latest drawings and ceramics is on view there through Jan. 13; his works are also on Artsy.)
Their designs continue to be mainstays of major museum exhibitions, from the Bourse to biennials to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. But for those who were paying attention, the last year has served as a test of their solo public identities.

Seeking a Big Edge in AI, South Korean Firms Think Smaller

SEOUL, South Korea — ChatGPT, Bard, Claude. The world’s most popular and successful chatbots are trained on data scraped from vast swaths of the internet, mirroring the cultural and linguistic dominance of the English language and Western perspectives. This has raised alarms about the lack of diversity in artificial intelligence. There is also the worry that the technology will remain the province of a handful of American companies.
In South Korea, a technological powerhouse, firms are taking advantage of the technology’s malleability to shape AI systems from the ground up to address local needs. Some have trained AI models with sets of data rich in Korean language and culture. South Korean companies say they’re building AI for Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian audiences. Others are eyeing customers in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and in industries like medicine and pharmacy.
This has fueled hopes that AI can become more diverse, work in more languages, be customized to more cultures and be developed by more countries.
“The more competition is out there, the more systems are going to be robust: socially acceptable, safer, more ethical,” said Byong-Tak Zhang, a computer science professor at Seoul National University.
While there are some prominent non-American AI companies, such as France’s Mistral, the recent upheaval at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has highlighted how concentrated the industry remains.
The emerging AI landscape in South Korea is one of the most competitive and diverse in the world, said Yong Lim, a professor of law at Seoul National University who leads its AI Policy Initiative. The country’s export-driven economy has encouraged new ventures to seek ways to tailor AI systems to specific companies or countries.
South Korea is well positioned to build AI technology, developers say, given it has one of the world’s most wired populations to generate vast amounts of data to train AI systems. Its tech giants have the resources to invest heavily in research. The government has also been encouraging: It has provided companies with money and data that could be used to train large language models, the technology that powers AI chatbots.
Few other countries have the combination of capital and technology required to develop a large language model that can power a chatbot, experts say. They estimate that it costs $100 million to $200 million to build a foundational model, the technology that serves as the basis for AI chatbots.
South Korea is still months behind the U.S. in the AI race and may never fully catch up, as the leading chatbots continue to improve with more resources and data.
But South Korean companies believe they can compete. Instead of going after the global market like their U.S. competitors, companies like Naver and LG have tried to target their AI models to specific industries, cultures or languages instead of pulling from the entire internet.
“The localized strategy is a reasonable strategy for them,” said Sukwoong Choi, a professor of information systems at the University at Albany. “U.S. firms are focused on general-purpose tools. South Korean AI firms can target a specific area.”
Outside the U.S., AI prowess appears limited in reach. In China, Baidu’s answer to ChatGPT, called Ernie, and Huawei’s large language model have shown some success at home, but they are far from dominating the global market. Governments and companies in other nations like Canada, Britain, India and Israel have also said they are developing their own AI systems, though none has yet to release a system that can be used by the public.
About a year before ChatGPT was released, Naver, which operates South Korea’s most widely used search engine, announced that it had successfully created a large language model. But the chatbot based on that model, Clova X, was released only this September, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut.
Nako Sung, an executive at Naver who has led the company’s generative AI project, said the timing of ChatGPT’s release surprised him.
“Up until that point, we were taking a conservative approach to AI services and just cautiously exploring the possibilities,” Sung said. “Then we realized that the timeline had been accelerated a lot,” he added. “We decided we had to move immediately.”
Now, Naver runs an AI model built for Korean language speakers from the ground up using public data from the South Korean government and from its search engine, which has scraped the country’s internet since 1999.
Clova X recognizes Korean idioms and the latest slang — language that U.S.-made chatbots like Bard, ChatGPT and Claude often struggle to understand. Naver’s chatbot is also integrated into the search engine, letting people use the tool to shop and travel.
Outside its home market, the company is exploring business opportunities with the Saudi Arabian government. Japan could be another potential customer, experts said, since Line, a messaging service owned by Naver, is used widely there.
LG has also created its own generative AI model, the type of artificial intelligence capable of creating original content based on inputs, called Exaone. Since its creation in 2021, LG has worked with publishers, research centers, pharmaceutical firms and medical companies to tailor its system to their data sets and provide them access to its AI system.
The company is targeting businesses and researchers instead of the general user, said Kyunghoon Bae, the director of LG AI Research. Its subsidiaries have also begun using its own AI chatbots. One of the chatbots, built to analyze chemistry research and chemical equations, has been used by researchers building new materials for batteries, chemicals and medicine.
“Rather than letting the best one or two AI systems dominate, it’s important to have an array of models specific to a domain, language or culture,” said Honglak Lee, the chief scientist of LG’s AI research arm.
Another South Korean behemoth, Samsung, last month announced Samsung Gauss, a generative AI model being used internally to compose emails, summarize documents and translate text. The company plans to integrate it into its mobile phones and smart home appliances.
Other major companies have also said they are developing their own large language models, making South Korea one of the few countries with so many companies building AI systems. KT, a South Korean telecommunications firm, has said it is working with a Thai counterpart, Jasmine Group, on a large language model specialized in the Thai language. Kakao, which makes an eponymous super app for chats, has said it is developing generative AI for Korean, English, Japanese, Vietnamese and Malaysian.
Still, the United States’ dominance in AI appears secure for now. It remains to be seen how closely countries can catch up.
“The market is convulsing; it’s very difficult to predict what’s going to happen,” Lim said. “It’s the Wild West, in a sense.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Koo Bon-moo, chairman of South Korean conglomerate LG, died in 2018, there wasn't much question, at least publicly, of who would next preside over the company.
LG, a $ 10 billion corporate empire, is governed by the principle of male primogeniture. Succession was effectively settled 14 years earlier when Mr. Koo and his wife adopted their eldest nephew, Koo Kwang-mo. The adoption was necessitated by tragedy and tradition after the couple's teenage son died in 1994, and their efforts for another male heir resulted in a second daughter.
The Koo family has controlled LG since it was founded in 1947, and the transition that elevated Kwang-mo to the helm seemed seamless, burnishing the family's reputation for harmony.
It wasn't.
The former chairman died, at age 73, without a will. What followed was a power struggle within the Koo family and LG over the inheritance of his estimated $ 1.5 billion fortune -- including his 11 percent stake in the company. Now, five years later, the former chairman's widow and two daughters are suing Koo Kwang-mo, accusing him and other LG executives of deception to steal their rightful inheritance to bolster his claim to the company.
The women said they want their full inheritance, but they are not seeking control of LG.
The lawsuit not only pits the matriarch of one of South Korea's wealthiest families and her daughters against the adopted male heir, who is now one of the country's most influential business figures. It also challenges LG's patriarchal tradition that allows the oldest male successor to seize power and wealth, leaving female family members as afterthoughts in the company.
Omnipresent in South Korea, LG is a holding company comprising 11 publicly traded businesses, including LG Chem, the country's largest materials and chemicals firm, and LG Electronics, whose televisions, dishwashers and other home appliances are popular worldwide.
The Koo family is one of a few wealthy clans -- along with the Lee family at Samsung, Hyundai's Chung family and SK's Chey family -- who run the conglomerates known as chaebols that have dominated South Korea's economy for decades.
In a legal filing that reads like a Korean drama script involving one of the country's biggest corporate employers, the former chairman's widow, Kim Young-shik, and her daughters, Koo Yeon-kyung and Koo Yeon-sue, accused LG executives of colluding with Koo Kwang-mo and his biological father to swindle them.
In transcripts of secretly recorded conversations filed in the legal documents, Koo Kwang-mo pleads with his adopted mother not to challenge the inheritance because it will hurt LG's image and his leadership of the company, potentially tarnishing his reputation among the Korean public.
"The scariest thing is the public opinion," he said, according to the transcript. "How are they going to look at this situation? 'Someone got greedy,' or that I didn't come visit and do a good job of caring for my mother."
In addition, the women accused Ha Beom-jong, the former chairman's aide and now LG's president, of misleading them to believe that there was a will that left everything to Koo Kwang-mo. Without a will, South Korean law states, the widow would be entitled to inherit one-third of the estate with the remainder divided equally between the two daughters and Kwang-mo.
Instead, the women said they were duped into an agreement in which roughly 75 percent of the estate went to Kwang-mo. The lawsuit, filed in Seoul Western District Court, seeks to redistribute the estate according to the legal standard.
"We cannot stand having our rights, protected under the constitution and the law, be disregarded just because we are women," the women said in a notice filed with the lawsuit.
Yulchon LLC, a law firm representing Kwang-mo, said in a statement that the inheritance is "a legally settled matter" that was resolved four years ago after extensive negotiations, and that there have been about 10 rounds of consultations and several revisions since the chairman's death. It also noted Ms. Kim had signed a document agreeing that Kwang-mo should receive the LG shares and assets related to controlling the company.
While LG is not a party to the lawsuit, it has also staged a vigorous defense of Kwang-mo in public statements. LG also suggested that the women were trying to challenge Koo Kwang-mo for company control, something that they deny.
"Any attempt to shake LG's tradition and management rights cannot be tolerated," the company said in a statement earlier this year.
LG's Deep Roots
The Koo lawsuit is one of several recent legal proceedings involving chaebols that highlight the challenges of family succession and control.
Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's executive chairman, is entangled in a criminal case accusing him of breaking the law to clear the way for the merger of two group affiliates that helped strengthen his control of the company. Mr. Lee has denied any wrongdoing.
Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK, the conglomerate behind the country's biggest mobile carrier, is embroiled in a divorce after 34 years of marriage. Last year, a Seoul court awarded his former wife about $ 50 million -- roughly 1 percent of his net worth -- but not any of his 17.5 percent stake in the company. She is appealing the ruling.
Woochan Kim, a finance professor at Korea University Business School, said these legal disputes will make it harder for the conglomerates to maintain control within the family.
"Family succession will cease to exist for very large Korean chaebols," Dr. Kim said.
LG was founded by Koo In-hwoi, Kwang-mo's great-grandfather, when the country was still emerging from Japanese colonial rule, and rival governments were being formed in the north and south, setting the stage for the Korean War. Originally called Lak Hui (pronounced "lucky") Chemical, the company's breakthrough product was a cosmetics cream. After changing its name to Lucky Goldstar, it produced goods for a modernizing Korea, including the country's first toothpaste, radio and washing machine.
By the time Koo Bon-moo, the founder's grandson and the oldest son of six siblings, took over in 1995, the company, now called LG, was deeply embedded in Korean life. LG built apartments, established an economic research institute and started a baseball team.
A year before Mr. Koo became chairman, his 19-year-old son died of a heart attack a few days after his high school graduation, leaving the family with one daughter but no male heir. Ms. Kim, the chairman's widow, said they tried for another son. Two years later, in her mid-40s, she gave birth to a daughter, Yeon-sue.
In a statement, Yeon-sue, now a 27-year-old musician, said that for her parents, the pain of losing a son was compounded by the succession issue.
"That's the way it is in my family," she wrote. "I used to feel guilty about the fact that I wasn't born a son."
Without a male heir, Ms. Kim said her father-in-law pressured them to adopt Kwang-mo -- then 26. He was the oldest son of Bon-moo's eldest brother, Koo Bon-neung. A decade after her son's death, Ms. Kim said she and her husband relented.
"For my father-in-law, that was really important," she said.
In 2017, Bon-moo was 72 and still seemed healthy, planning for the company's future and hiking on the weekends. He went to the doctor because his face appeared slightly lopsided, and he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.
Bon-moo's brain surgery in April 2017 went smoothly but after a second operation in December, he suffered a seizure that left him unable to speak, sending his health into a downward spiral. He died in May 2018.
His death raised a possible succession battle. During his illness, the company was being run by one of his other brothers, Koo Bon-joon, who had led one of LG's most high-profile businesses. Koo Kwang-mo, who was 40 at the time, had been an LG executive for a decade but had accrued little management experience.
Bon-moo's ashes were scattered among trees, as was his wish. In the blur of the funeral proceedings, his wife and daughters claim, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials started angling for control.
Without notifying them, the women say, Kwang-mo's biological father and LG officials enlisted a locksmith to help them pry open the former chairman's safes at the company office and a vacation home.
Then Mr. Ha, who had been Bon-moo's aide, and another employee came to the family's stately home in Seoul and told them that the senior Koo had left a will, according to the women in interviews with The Times. His wishes, they recalled the employees telling them, were that all his shares and the chairmanship go to his adopted son, in keeping with family custom since LG's founding. Mr. Ha has denied in court testimony that he ever told the family there was a will.
"The person my father trusted the most and supposedly knew everything came to us and said there was a will, and based on that, it all goes to Kwang-mo," Koo Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, 45, said in an interview.
Succession Question
While LG is a publicly traded company with 220,000 employees, its finance department does more than handle the company's books. It also manages the personal assets and bank accounts of family members. Employees kept the personal seals for family members and routinely inked documents on their behalf.
In court testimony, Mr. Ha said that there wasn't a will but a memo with Bon-moo's wishes signed a few days before his first surgery. It was later shredded in the routine destruction of documents, he said, adding that he showed it to the women and Kwang-mo shortly after the former chairman's death. The women say they never saw it.
Ms. Kim, 71, said she was told she needed to forgo inheriting any of her husband's shares to ensure Kwang-mo's succession and prevent any challenge from her late husband's brother, Bon-joon. She said she went along with it, but she questioned Mr. Ha about whether Bon-moo truly wanted his daughters to receive no shares. She said Kwang-mo eventually agreed to give roughly a fifth of Bon-moo's shares, worth about $ 270 million by current share prices, to his two sisters.
They said while the older Koo was alive, they never questioned the family's patriarchal ways. Their expectation, they said, was that Kwang-mo, as his adoptive father and grandfather had before him, would make sure everyone in their extended family was financially taken care of and would carry out ancestral rites that are Korean tradition.
Yeon-kyung, the eldest daughter, said she was told that the terms of the inheritance should be guarded with utmost secrecy, so much so that she didn't talk to her husband or consult an attorney. The agreement was read out to her and her mother once, and they were never given a copy, she said.
The women said that they were told that they would receive the former chairman's cash, other investments and the family's home in Seoul, and that Kwang-mo would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in inheritance tax. South Korea levies a tax of at least 50 percent on inherited assets over $ 2.3 million.
Through the agreement, Kwang-mo strengthened his claim to be chairman. Before the former chairman's death, Kwang-mo owned 6.1 percent of LG shares. Koo Bon-joon, the brother who was running the company, held 7.6 percent. By inheriting most of the former chairman's stock, Kwang-mo's stake grew to about 15 percent.
He became the chairman of LG in June 2018. Bon-joon agreed to leave the company, but he wouldn't go away empty-handed.
LG announced in November 2020 that it was going to spin off five affiliate businesses into a new holding company with Bon-joon as the chairman.
The U.S. hedge fund Whitebox Advisors protested the move, calling it a "solution to a succession problem" that gave priority to family needs but went against the interests of outside investors in the company.
In response, Mr. Ha, the former aide who was now promoted to LG's chief financial officer, told investors the plan "will diversify investment risk and provide an opportunity" for LG and the new company.
Shareholders approved the spinoff. Shares of the new company, LX Holdings, started to trade publicly in May 2021. Bon-joon sold most of his LG shares later that year and used the proceeds to buy shares in his new company.
"Running a public company as a private fiefdom for the benefit of a controlling shareholder adversely affects minority investors and is a disincentive for outside investment," Simon Waxley, head of equity arbitrage at Whitebox, said in a statement to The New York Times.
Inheritance Dispute
The women said they continued living their lives normally. Yeon-kyung, who studied social work, said she remembered her father's wishes that she get involved in running LG's charitable foundations, and started working at one of them as an adviser in 2021.
Around that time, Yeon-kyung said, she felt something was amiss when she applied for a store credit card to get a discount on a gift for a friend, but was rejected because she had too many loans. She said that came as a surprise to her.
Realizing how little she, her sister and her mother knew about their own finances, she started going from bank to bank to pull years' worth of statements. There were large inheritance tax payments and loans against their LG shares that didn't comport with their understanding that Kwang-mo alone would shoulder the tax. When they started asking questions to LG's finance team, they felt they were getting partial or evasive answers, Yeon-kyung said.
They were told a copy of the inheritance agreement was kept in storage away from Seoul and would take weeks to retrieve.
As the women pieced together the state of their finances, they said, they realized that Kwang-mo had also received more cash and investment assets than they thought they had agreed to.
"Isn't that strange, it was our money but we didn't know how much we had," Yeon-kyung said. "It started to seem odd."
Growing mistrustful, Yeon-kyung said she and her mother began secretly recording conversations with Kwang-mo and Mr. Ha in 2022. Throughout the year, the exchanges grew tense, and at times, emotional, according to excerpts from transcripts, which the plaintiffs have cited as evidence that they were misled by the men now running LG.
In one recording from November 2022, Ms. Kim complained to Kwang-mo that they were treated by the finance staff as if they could be ignored because they were women.
"All this time has passed, and now that we look into it, so much was done without our knowledge," she said, according to a transcript.
"The 'our' you mention doesn't include me, right?" Kwang-mo asked in return.
Kwang-mo sent his mother a letter in January clarifying the unexplained withdrawals from her accounts. He said that, unbeknown to him, "the employees" were short on funds to pay the inheritance tax under his name, so they paid it under her name using her assets, but that they had planned to pay her back. Still, he asked her not to assert her inheritance rights.
"If the elders each asserted their rights under the inheritance law, LG's management control would not have been passed down to the 4th generation as it is now," he wrote in the letter.
A month later, the women filed suit.
In September, Kwang-mo came to the family home for Chuseok, a major Korean mid-autumn holiday, when more than 100 extended family members got together for the customary ancestral rites.
The family carried out the elaborate ceremony, paying their respects to deceased family members as they always had, but an awkwardness hung between Kwang-mo and his adoptive mother and sisters. He seemed to avoid them, ducking into different rooms in the cavernous home, the women said.
"He didn't make eye contact, or talk," Ms. Kim said. "He just hurriedly left."

Full text: Conglomerates that sprawl across the society trace their roots to the nation's rise into a world power and have been tightly controlled for generations.
For decades, South Korea's economy has been dominated by a handful of family-run conglomerates that hold outsize wealth and influence and factor into nearly every aspect of life in the country.
Because of their political heft, the chaebol, as these families are known, have long been a matter of immense public interest. The marriages, deaths, estrangements and legal troubles of these families are chronicled in the South Korean press. Fictional chaebol families have been depicted in Korean dramas. The Lee family of Samsung, the Koos of LG, the Cheys of SK, the Shins of Lotte and the Chungs of Hyundai are household names that have tightly held the reins of the companies that are some of the country's largest private sector employers.
Their power has been increasingly scrutinized -- both inside and outside South Korea -- as an economic vulnerability, deepening inequalities and fostering corruption.
Chaebol families have controlled South Korea's biggest companies for generations.
The chaebol system is a legacy of South Korea's history. After an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953, the country's military dictators anointed a handful of families for special loans and financial support to rebuild the economy. The companies expanded quickly and moved from industry to industry until they morphed into sprawling conglomerates.
Even as the companies grew in size, wealth and influence, and sold shares on stock exchanges, they remained under family control -- typically run by a chairman who also presided as head of the family. Generational leadership changes have sometimes unsettled chaebol families, forcing companies to split or spin off into smaller groups.
More than two decades ago, during a family struggle, Hyundai was divided among the founder's six sons. The eldest son took control of Hyundai Motor, now one of South Korea's biggest companies. Under Chung Eui-sun, the founder's grandson, the family is still in charge of the global automaker.
These conglomerates make up a sizable portion of South Korea's economy.
South Korea's rapid rise from postwar poverty to a major developed economy in a couple of decades was closely tied to the rise of chaebol companies. Their early successes boosted wages and living standards, and drove the country's exports.
The total sales of the five largest conglomerates have consistently made up more than half of South Korea's gross domestic product in the past 15 years, topping 70 percent in 2012, according to the book "Republic of Chaebol" by the economist Park Sang-in. Their businesses also permeate South Korean life -- from hospitals to life insurance, from apartment complexes to credit cards and retail, from food to entertainment and media, not to mention electronics.
Chaebol families have had cozy relationships with the political leadership.
Patronage from political leaders was crucial to the chaebol companies' growth into industrial conglomerates, particularly under the regime of Park Chung-hee, who came to power in a coup and ran the country for two decades until his assassination in 1979. For Mr. Park, the chaebol were an instrumental part of his ambition to enrich and industrialize South Korea. To that end, his government steered funds to companies that were cooperative with his agenda, protected them from competition and spared them of public accountability.
While the close ties between the government and the businesses have lessened in recent decades, political leaders still frequently turn to them for support or counsel. In turn, the companies have at times been shielded as being too vital to the economy to be broken up or scrutinized -- something critics have assailed as a "too big to jail" problem.
This summer, chaebol heads traveled with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on a trip to Europe as part of South Korea's bid for the World Expo. They also accompanied him on his visit to the United States to meet with President Biden and were among the guests at a White House state dinner.
Several scandals have tarnished their public image.
Chaebol companies have become enmeshed in political corruption cases.
One of South Korea's biggest political scandals in recent years demonstrated the close ties between the political leaders and the family-run conglomerates.
Park Geun-hye, the country's former president, was ousted from office in 2017 and later sentenced to prison after she was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and other criminal charges. Ms. Park and a longtime confidante were found to have collected or demanded bribes from three chaebol conglomerates: Samsung, SK and Lotte. Ms. Park was pardoned in 2021 after serving almost five years of a 20-year prison sentence.
Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest chaebol, was also sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for his role. He was paroled and later pardoned by President Yoon in 2022, a move that allowed him to return to running the company.

Full text: As the year winds down, take the time to explore iOS 17 and Android 14 with new wallpaper and widgets or by creating a digital diary.
As the year winds to a close, many frenzied smartphone users haven't had the chance to explore major updates to the Google and iPhone operating systems that arrived this fall. As you finally get a breather -- or maybe even a new phone in your gift haul -- why not start with some of the more personally engaging features that can help you ease into Android 14 or iOS 17? Here are some highlights.
Express Yourself
Google's release of Android 14 was focused largely on improving security and accessibility features. But Google has also added fresh ways to customize phone screens with new wallpaper, app widgets and shortcuts. To get started, open the Settings app, select Wallpaper & Style and make your choices to personalize your device.
Apple has plenty of options in its iOS 17 Wallpaper settings, but with last week's iOS 17.2 update, users can get deeply personal in a different way with the new Journal app included with the software; it's also in the App Store. Journal is a free digital diary for recording thoughts and feelings through text, images and topic suggestions. You can back up your encrypted entries to your iCloud account, where you get five gigabytes of free online storage before Apple starts charging.
Apple's multimedia Journal is similar to third-party apps like Day One and Journey, which have free and paid premium versions. While Google has not yet added its own dedicated diary app to Android, some people use the company's free Keep and Docs apps for their pensive moments.
Search Your World
Image-based search adds another dimension to activities like shopping, museum-going, travel or just walking around town. Apple's existing Visual Look Up feature for identifying objects in photos got a boost in iOS 17 and now works on videos as well. To use it, just open a photo or pause a video on your phone and tap the Info icon (the third from the left) at the bottom of the screen. If more information is available about the image subject, tap Look Up to see the search results.
(Another trick with Visual Look Up: When you see a glowing white outline around the main object in a photo, tap it to open a pop-up menu. Select Add Sticker to save a silhouetted copy of the object that you can send in a message or insert from the iPhone's emoji keyboard.)
Google Lens, introduced in 2017, has steadily become more accurate with its pairing of object identification and relevant internet search results. Say you're in a museum and want more information on the artwork you're looking at through your phone's camera. Tap the adjacent Google Lens icon to see the articles Google Search rounds up.
Google Lens works on objects in still photos and exported frames from video clips. It is available as an Android app but is integrated elsewhere, including in the stand-alone Google app for Android and iOS.
Both Apple's Visual Look Up and Google Lens can recognize, copy and translate text in images you see through the camera. Check each company's privacy policy if you have data-collection concerns.
Blast Off
Android's developers have been sneaking little surprises into the system's code for years, and this year's update brings a hidden game. To uncover it, open the Settings app and scroll down to About Phone. Tap it and then tap Android Version.
On the next screen, quickly tap Android Version three times to start the game. On the game screen, press and hold the Android 14 logo until the phone begins to vibrate and a tiny spaceship appears. Press your finger on the screen to get steering controls and use the position information in the corner to fly to different stars.
Slip Into Standby
Apple's iOS 17 includes a Standby feature that turns the iPhone lock screen into a smart display for showing off the time, temperature, photos, music, recipes and other apps. When enabled in iPhone Settings, the Standby mode kicks on when the phone is charging and sitting stable in the horizontal screen orientation.
If you don't care for the default widgets, press and hold your finger on either side of the screen to choose new ones from the list of Standby-compatible options. The Night Mode option in the settings gives the screen a red tint if you decide to use the phone as a bedside clock.
Third-party apps like Zetabit Tecnologia's Standby Mode Pro give Android-based phones a similar function, as does the "always on display" setting for lock screens on recent Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets.
These hands-free options also serve as a reminder that it's good to put the phone down occasionally and enjoy the holidays.

Once you find the Android 14 logo, press it until the phone begins to vibrate like a rocket taking off. This article appeared in print on page B5.

Full text: The tech giant will pay $ 700 million and allow app makers to collect payments directly from consumers in a settlement it hopes will help resolve other legal challenges.
Google said on Monday that it would allow developers on its Play app store to offer direct payment options to users and would pay $ 700 million to settle an antitrust suit brought by state attorneys general, in the company's latest move to navigate increased regulatory scrutiny of its power.
The suit, brought in July 2021, accused Google's app store of abusing its market power and forcing aggressive terms on software developers. The tech giant is facing several antitrust challenges in the United States, including a trial in which the federal government claims Google has abused its dominance in online search.
In its announcement on Monday, Google said it would now allow apps to charge consumers directly rather than having to charge through Google. The company will pay $ 630 million to create a settlement fund for consumers, as well as pay $ 70 million into a fund to be used by the states. To highlight the choice that users have in how they download apps, Google reaffirmed that phone makers, like Samsung, that use the Android mobile operating system can continue installing multiple app stores on their devices in addition to Google's Play Store.
The settlement was announced in September, though details were not released.
Google hopes that the settlement will act as a template for resolutions with other critics of its Play Store policies, including Epic Games -- the maker of the popular game Fortnite -- which won an antitrust lawsuit against Google last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.
"This settlement builds on Android's choice and flexibility, maintains strong security protections and retains Google's ability to compete with other OS makers and invest in the Android ecosystem for users and developers," Wilson White, Google vice president of government affairs, wrote in a blog post.
The settlement is Google's latest concession regarding its app store, which has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years over claims of monopolistic behaviors. The Google Play Store has drawn complaints because it is one of two main marketplaces for mobile apps along with Apple's App Store. Google charges app makers a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and up to 30 percent for purchases made within popular apps that are downloaded from the store.
In 2021, the South Korean government passed a law forcing Google and Apple to allow app makers to charge customers directly. Since then, Google has offered alternative billing options in the country. It also preemptively introduced a pilot program that offered users a choice in how they were billed in the United States before the settlement took place.
The settlement will reduce those fees by four percentage points when app makers handle their own transactions, although consumers would not necessarily see a reduction in fees because app developers could pocket the discount. It will also allow developers to show different pricing options when users make a purchase.
Google settled the government claims with attorneys general from all 50 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. If the suit had gone to court, the states would have made their case in a joint trial that would have been heard alongside lawsuits filed by Epic and the dating-app company Match Group, which had sued on similar grounds.
But Google and the attorneys general announced that they had reached an "agreement in principle" in September, two months before the start of the trial. The parties had to wait until a week after the Epic verdict to release the details of the September settlement.
In October, Google also settled with Match.
Epic went on to win its case last week, convincing a nine-person federal jury in San Francisco that Google's levies and aggressive terms on developers amounted to antitrust violations, which hurt the gaming company's business prospects. Judge James Donato of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California will decide the remedies needed to address Google's conduct next year.
Google has said it will appeal the verdict in the Epic trial. Google's lawyers argued it was impossible for the company to act as a monopoly because its Android mobile operating system and Play Store compete against Apple's iOS software and its App Store, which is much more popular in the United States.
Apple largely prevailed in a similar lawsuit that was brought by Epic and decided by a judge, though the U.S. Supreme Court may decide to pick up the case next year.
Mr. White, of Google, wrote in the blog post that the company was "disappointed" by last week's verdict but said the case with Epic was "far from over."

Apple to Pause Selling New Versions of Its Watch: [Correction]

Full text: The move, which comes after a ruling by the International Trade Commission, could create a run on watch sales in the week before Christmas.
Apple said on Monday that it would pause sales of its flagship smartwatches online starting Thursday and at retail locations on Christmas Eve.
Two months ago, Apple lost a patent case over the technology its smartwatches use to detect people's blood oxygen levels. The company was ordered to stop selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 after Christmas, which could set off a run on sales of the watches in the final week of holiday shopping.
The move by Apple follows a ruling by the International Trade Commission in October that found several Apple Watches infringe on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, Calif.
In court, Masimo detailed how Apple poached its top executives and more than a dozen other employees before later releasing a watch with pulse oximeter capabilities -- which measures the percentage of oxygen that red blood cells carry from the lungs to the body -- that were patented by Masimo.
To avoid a complete ban on sales, Apple had two months to cut a deal with Masimo to license its technology, or it could appeal to the Biden administration to reverse the ruling.
But Joe Kiani, the chief executive of Masimo, said in an interview that Apple had not engaged in licensing negotiations. Instead, he said that Apple had appealed to President Biden to veto the I.T.C. ruling, which Mr. Kiani knows because the administration contacted Masimo about Apple's request.
"They're trying to make the agency look like it's helping patent trolls," Mr. Kiani said of the I.T.C.
Apple didn't respond to requests for comment on Mr. Kiani's remarks. In a statement, the company said, "Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers."
The Biden administration didn't immediately respond to request for comment.
Mr. Kiani said that he was willing to sell Apple a chip that Masimo had designed to provide pulse oximeter readings on the Apple Watch. The chip is currently in a Masimo medical watch, called the W1, that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The device uses algorithms to process red and near-infrared light to determine how oxygen-rich is the blood in arteries.
"If they don't want to use our chip, I'll work with them to make their product good," Mr. Kiani said. "Once it's good enough, I'm happy to give them a license."
Apple introduced its first watch with pulse oximetry in 2020. It has included the technology, which it calls "blood oxygen," in subsequent models. But unlike Masimo's W1 device, Apple hasn't had its watches cleared by the F.D.A. for use as a medical device for pulse oximetry.
The Apple Watch accounts for nearly $ 20 billion of the company's $ 383.29 billion in annual sales, according to Bernstein Research, a financial research firm. Apple is the largest smartwatch seller in the world and accounts for about a third of all smartwatch sales, according to Counterpoint Research, a tech research firm.
Apple has had success persuading presidents in the past to veto I.T.C. rulings. In 2013, the Obama administration overturned a ban on the sale of some iPhones and iPads, after the court determined that Apple had violated a patent that Samsung owned.

Military Supplier Awarded First CHIPS Act Grant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The award, which will go to BAE Systems, is part of a new government program aimed at creating a more secure supply of semiconductors.
The Biden administration announced on Monday that BAE Systems, a defense contractor, will receive the first federal grant from a new program aimed at shoring up American manufacturing of critical semiconductors.
The company is expected to receive a $ 35 million grant to quadruple its domestic production of a type of chip used in F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as satellites and other defense systems. The grant is intended to help ensure a more secure supply of a component that is critical for the United States and its allies.
The award is the first of several expected in the coming months, as the Commerce Department begins distributing the $ 39 billion in federal funding that Congress authorized under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The money is intended to incentivize the construction of chip factories in the United States and lure back a key type of manufacturing that has slipped offshore in recent decades.
The decision to select a defense contractor for the first award, rather than a commercial semiconductor facility, was meant to emphasize the administration's focus on national security, officials said.
At an event at BAE Systems in Nashua, N.H., Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that the United States had become "dangerously reliant" on a few countries in Asia for its chips, including technology that goes into military systems. Posters showing a pilotless drone, fighter pilots and a jet engine were displayed behind her.
"In order to defend our great country, we need to make the chips that go into military equipment in the United States of America, by Americans," Ms. Raimondo said. "And that's what this is about."
In the coming months, the Biden administration is expected to announce much larger grants for major semiconductor manufacturing facilities run by companies like Intel, Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC. Ms. Raimondo said that within the next year, the department would announce 10 or 12 grants to other companies, some of them worth several billions of dollars and other in the tens of millions.
Speaking after the event, Ms. Raimondo said that the commerce department had "purposefully" chosen a relatively small award as its first grant but said bigger sums to other firms would be announced next year. Awards for facilities that make the most advanced chips are likely to be announced in the first months of 2024, she said in an interview.
"Fundamentally, you'll see, all over the country, big expansions in semiconductor manufacturing and the supply chain," she said.
Semiconductors originated in the United States, but the country now manufactures only about a tenth of chips made globally. While American chip companies still design the world's most cutting-edge products, much of the world's manufacturing has migrated to Asia in recent decades as companies have sought lower costs.
Chips power not only computers and cars but also missiles, satellites and fighter jets, a reality that has prompted officials in Washington to deem the lack of domestic manufacturing capacity a serious national security vulnerability.
A global shortage of chips during the pandemic shuttered car factories and dented the U.S. economy, highlighting the risks of supply chains that are outside of America's control. The chip industry's high reliance on Taiwan, a geopolitical flashpoint, is also considered an untenable security threat given that China sees the island as a breakaway part of its territory and has talked of reclaiming it.
"When we talk about supply chain resilience, this investment is about shoring up that resilience and ensuring that the chips are delivered when our military needs them," said Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser.
The BAE chips that the program would help fund are produced in the United States, but administration officials said the money would allow the company to upgrade aging machinery and make the facility more efficient, ultimately halving the cost of the chips made at the factory.
BAE, partly through operations purchased from Lockheed Martin, specializes in chips called monolithic microwave integrated circuits that generate high-frequency radio signals and are used in electronic warfare and aircraft-to-aircraft communications.
The company's Nashua facility, which employs roughly 3,700 people, is part of the Pentagon's "trusted foundry" program, which produces chips for defense-related needs under tight security restrictions. BAE is a British arms and aerospace company; the award will go to its U.S. subsidiary.
Like other grants under the program, the funding would be doled out to the company over time, after the Commerce Department carries out due diligence on the project and as the company reaches certain milestones. The company has also promised to undertake work force training programs as part of the grant, including a program at the local community college.
The Biden administration is hoping to create a thriving U.S. chip industry, which would encompass the industry's most cutting-edge manufacturing and research, and factories pumping out older types of chips and various types of suppliers to make the chemicals and other raw materials that chip facilities need.
Part of the program's focus has been establishing a secure source of chips to feed into products needed by the American military. The supply chains that feed into weapons systems, fighter jets and other technology are opaque and complex. Chip industry executives say that some military contractors have surprisingly little understanding of where some of the semiconductors in their products come from. At least some of the chip supply chains that feed into American military goods run through China, where companies manufacture and test semiconductors.
Since the chips legislation was first introduced in early 2020, chips companies have announced more than $ 220 billion in new U.S. manufacturing facilities in hopes of winning some portion of the federal money. The law also offers a 25 percent tax credit for funds that chip companies spend on new U.S. factories.
The funding will be a test of the Biden administration's industrial policy and its ability to pick the most viable projects while ensuring that taxpayer money is not wasted. The Commerce Department has spun up a special team of roughly 200 people who are now reviewing company applications for the funds.
Tech experts expect the law to help reverse a three-decade-long decline in the U.S. share of global chip manufacturing, but it remains uncertain just how much of the industry the program can reclaim.
While the amount of money available under the new law is large in historical proportions, it could go fast. Chip factories are packed with some of the world's most advanced machinery and are thus incredibly expensive, with the most advanced facilities costing tens of billions of dollars each.
Industry executives say the cost of operating a chip factory and paying workers in the United States is higher than in many other parts of the world. East Asian countries are still offering lucrative subsidies for new chip facilities, as well as a large supply of skilled engineers and technicians.
Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of "Chip War," a history of the industry, said there was "clear evidence" of a major increase in investment across the semiconductor supply chain in the United States as a result of the law.
"I think the huge question that remains is how enduring will these investments be over time," he said. "Are they one-offs or will they be followed by second and third rounds for the companies involved?"

Full text: The case could reshape the rules of how other businesses can make money on the Android operating system.
A jury ruled on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws to extract fees and limit competition from Epic Games and other developers on its Play mobile app store, in a case that could rewrite the rules on how thousands of businesses make money on Google's smartphone operating system, Android.
After deliberating for a little more than three hours, the nine-person federal jury sided with Epic Games on all 11 questions in a monthlong trial that was the latest turn in a three-year legal battle.
The jury in San Francisco found that Epic, the maker of the hit game Fortnite, proved that Google had maintained a monopoly in the smartphone app store market and engaged in anticompetitive conduct that harmed the videogame maker.
Google could be forced to alter its Play Store rules, allowing other companies to offer competing app stores and making it easier for developers to avoid the cut it collects from in-app purchases.
Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will decide the remedies needed to address Google's conduct next year. Google said it would appeal the verdict.
Throughout the trial, Google's lawyers and executives had argued that it competed against Apple's App Store, which is more popular in the United States, making it impossible to operate an Android monopoly.
The verdict provided a lift to Epic's yearslong quest to weaken the power that Google and Apple have over the mobile app ecosystem, and it came two years after Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple -- a ruling that both sides are trying to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. That verdict was decided by a judge.
In pursuing the case against Google, filed in 2020, Epic had sought to keep more of the revenue it generates from in-app purchases and offer an app store that would compete with Play on the Android operating system.
Google was fighting Epic's claims at the same time that it was defending itself in another antitrust trial in Washington, D.C. The Department of Justice and dozens of states have accused the company of illegally maintaining a search and advertising monopoly, in a landmark antitrust case that could reshape tech power when it is decided next year.
On the Play Store, Google charges app makers a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and up to 30 percent for purchases made within popular apps that are downloaded from the store. Google says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases.
Google plans to appeal the verdict and will "continue to defend the Android business model," Wilson White, a Google vice president of government affairs, said in a statement. He added that the trial had "made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles."
Epic said in a blog post that the verdict was "a win for all app developers and consumers around the world" and "proved that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation."
Tim Sweeney, Epic's chief executive, posted "Free Fortnite!" on X, formerly called Twitter, after the verdict.
Epic instigated the battle with Google, by allowing customers to make in-app purchases directly with Epic, bypassing Google and violating its rules. Google quickly banned Fortnite, and Epic responded by filing the lawsuit.
The jury found that Google had violated antitrust laws in two markets, the Android Play Store and the Android's in-app billing system. It also found that Google willfully maintained monopoly power, allowing it to impose unreasonable restraints on other market players' ability to compete.
The jury took issue with Google's efforts to pay large developers to continue using the Play Store, in an initiative called Project Hug. Epic's lawyers had painted the effort as "bribes" to major app makers, which Google had denied.
"Such a clear verdict is going to make it much harder for Google to beat it back in post-trial briefing and on appeal," Paul Swanson, an antitrust lawyer at the firm Holland & Hard, said in an interview. He added that the district court process could wrap up in a few months, and Google's appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit could take 12 to 18 months.
The jury also faulted Google's agreements with Android phone makers like Samsung, which force them to pre-install Google applications on their devices and establish other rules by which they must abide.
During the trial, Epic's lawyers said Google had deleted some internal chat messages that may have been relevant to the case, which undercut the search company's credibility, Mr. Swanson said.
"Google's concern was that a jury would look at all of these issues they've examined for several weeks and put it through a lens of 'can I even trust Google?"' Mr. Swanson said. "The stark reality is that Google finally had to face its consumers in the court of law."

Full text: While texting technology will soon get better, the "blue versus green bubble" disparity is far from over.
For more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have faced a major problem in how we communicate: the "green versus blue bubble" disparity.
When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
Over time, the annoyance and frustration that built up between blue and green bubbles evolved into more than a tech problem. It created a deeper sociological divide between people who judged one another by their phones. The color of a bubble became a symbol that some believe reflects status and wealth, given a perception that only wealthy people buy iPhones.
Now part of this problem will soon be addressed.
This month, Apple announced that it would improve the technology used to send texts between iPhone and Android users, starting next year, by adopting a standard that Google and others integrated into their messaging apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will look higher-quality and security features like encryption may eventually arrive, Apple said.
But that's where the good news ends. The bubble culture war is far from over.
On dating apps, green-bubble users are often rejected by the blues. Adults with iPhones have been known to privately snicker to one another when a green bubble taints a group chat. In schools, a green bubble is an invitation for mockery and exclusion by children with iPhones, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology's impact on families.
"This green-versus-blue issue is a form of cyberbullying," said Jim Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense, which works with thousands of schools that have shared stories about tensions among children using messaging apps.
That means it's now on us to do better and tamp down digital elitism. The solutions, including third-party messaging apps that work consistently between different phones, have been around for years. The rest is about modifying our behavior.
Go Beyond the Defaults
Tech companies are well aware of the power of defaults. Whatever technology comes loaded on a device is what the vast majority of people are likely to use, because it requires the least amount of effort. The reason that we confront the blue-versus-green bubble issue is that we stick to the default texting app that is tied to our phone numbers.
Yet we have options. Third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal have bridged the gap between iPhones and Androids for years. They link user accounts to phone numbers, which makes contacting people similar to using a standard text-messaging app. These apps also include features like encryption, support for group chats, the ability to send high-resolution photos and videos -- and, yes, fun emojis and stickers.
So the next time you exchange numbers with someone on a different phone platform, consider asking the person to keep in touch through an alternate messaging app. This could be a tall order for people who are less technologically inclined, like relatives who barely know how to use their phone. In that case, lend them a hand with setting up their phones. Most Android phones, for example, can be modified to automatically send and receive all messages from a third-party app.
If third-party apps don't sound appealing, there are other avenues for texting. Plenty of younger people congregate on apps like Discord, Snapchat and Instagram, which have messaging abilities that work consistently between different types of phones.
It comes down to whether you care more about your tech preferences or about your relationships with people, said Irina Raicu, an internet ethics director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.
"Smooth and easy means without any friction or any effort, but sometimes you might need to make more effort just because somebody has a different phone than you," she said. "Relationships require effort."
Drop the Elitism
In a popular meme on TikTok and YouTube, a man poses a question to random women on the street: "He's a 10, but he has an Android phone. What's his new rating?" Most women respond with "1" or "0" and make comments along the lines of "The green bubble, not good -- it's, like, cheap."
Let's zoom in on the stereotype. It's true that Android phones can be more affordable than iPhones because various companies make a wider range of them, including budget models that cost as little as $ 100.

These complaints can influence our children to behave in more negative ways, Mr. Steyer said. For several years, teenagers with Android phones have shared stories about converting to iPhones because they were being left out of iMessage group chats about homework and extracurricular activities.
The onus is on adults to demonstrate to children that many of these tech issues can be addressed -- and to remind them that a person's phone is just a phone, not much more.
Those adults should include the executives of Apple and Google, who have leaned into the bubble war to try to persuade users to join their platforms, Mr. Steyer said.
At a tech conference last year featuring Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, an iPhone user in the audience asked whether Apple would make improvements to its messaging app so he could send clearer videos to his mother, who used an Android phone. Mr. Cook flippantly told the questioner to buy his mother an iPhone, a response that many critics deemed elitist.
Apple and Google declined to comment.
"Rise above this -- show some maturity here," Mr. Steyer said. "You don't want to bully or shame other people over the color of their bubble or the type of their phone."

Apple Is Doing Its Part to End Green Bubble Shaming. It’s Our Turn.

For more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have faced a major problem in how we communicate: the “green versus blue bubble” disparity.
When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
Over time, the annoyance and frustration that built up between blue and green bubbles evolved into more than a tech problem. It created a deeper sociological divide between people who judged one another by their phones. The color of a bubble became a symbol that some believe reflects status and wealth, given a perception that only wealthy people buy iPhones.
Now part of this problem will soon be addressed.
In November, Apple announced that it would improve the technology used to send texts between iPhone and Android users, starting next year, by adopting a standard that Google and others integrated into their messaging apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will look higher-quality and security features like encryption may eventually arrive, Apple said.
But that’s where the good news ends. The bubble culture war is far from over.
On dating apps, green-bubble users are often rejected by the blues. Adults with iPhones have been known to privately snicker to one another when a green bubble taints a group chat. In schools, a green bubble is an invitation for mockery and exclusion by children with iPhones, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that focuses on technology’s impact on families.
“This green-versus-blue issue is a form of cyberbullying,” said Jim Steyer, the CEO of Common Sense, which works with thousands of schools that have shared stories about tensions among children using messaging apps.
That means it’s now on us to do better and tamp down digital elitism. The solutions, including third-party messaging apps that work consistently between different phones, have been around for years. The rest is about modifying our behavior.
Go Beyond the Defaults
Tech companies are well aware of the power of defaults. Whatever technology comes loaded on a device is what the vast majority of people are likely to use, because it requires the least amount of effort. The reason that we confront the blue-versus-green bubble issue is that we stick to the default texting app that is tied to our phone numbers.
Yet we have options. Third-party messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal have bridged the gap between iPhones and Androids for years. They link user accounts to phone numbers, which makes contacting people similar to using a standard text-messaging app. These apps also include features like encryption, support for group chats, the ability to send high-resolution photos and videos — and, yes, fun emojis and stickers.
So the next time you exchange numbers with someone on a different phone platform, consider asking the person to keep in touch through an alternate messaging app. This could be a tall order for people who are less technologically inclined, like relatives who barely know how to use their phone. In that case, lend them a hand with setting up their phones. Most Android phones, for example, can be modified to automatically send and receive all messages from a third-party app.
If third-party apps don’t sound appealing, there are other avenues for texting. Plenty of younger people congregate on apps such as Discord, Snapchat and Instagram, which have messaging abilities that work consistently between different types of phones.
It comes down to whether you care more about your tech preferences or about your relationships with people, said Irina Raicu, an internet ethics director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.
“Smooth and easy means without any friction or any effort, but sometimes you might need to make more effort just because somebody has a different phone than you,” she said. “Relationships require effort.”
Drop the Elitism
In a popular meme on TikTok and YouTube, a man poses a question to random women on the street: “He’s a 10, but he has an Android phone. What’s his new rating?” Most women respond with “1” or “0” and make comments along the lines of “The green bubble, not good — it’s, like, cheap.”
Let’s zoom in on the stereotype. It’s true that Android phones can be more affordable than iPhones because various companies make a wider range of them, including budget models that cost as little as $100. But the top-selling Android phone brand, Samsung, makes flagship Galaxy phones that cost $800 to $1,100, or roughly the same as Apple’s iPhones.
There’s also no evidence that everyone buying iPhones is wealthy. One in five Americans believes that a new iPhone is worth going into debt for, according to a survey by WalletHub, a personal finance research firm.
People choose their phones for various reasons, including features like screen size, camera quality and battery life. While budget may be a factor, a green bubble is not a strong indicator of a person’s income or social status.

When Posts Are Misread As Abusive: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google has a zero-tolerance policy for child abuse content. The scanning process can sometimes go awry and tar innocent individuals as abusers.
When Jennifer Watkins got a message from YouTube saying her channel was being shut down, she wasn't initially worried. She didn't use YouTube, after all.
Her 7-year-old twin sons, though, used a Samsung tablet logged into her Google account to watch content for children and to make YouTube videos of themselves doing silly dances. Few of the videos had more than five views. But the video that got Ms. Watkins in trouble, which one son made, was different.
"Apparently it was a video of his bottom," said Ms. Watkins, who has never seen it. "He'd been dared by a classmate to do a nudie video."
Google-owned YouTube has A.I.-powered systems that review the hundreds of hours of video that are uploaded to the service every minute. The scanning process can sometimes go awry and tar innocent individuals as child abusers.
The New York Times has documented other episodes in which parents' digital lives were upended by naked photos and videos of their children that Google's A.I. systems flagged and that human reviewers determined to be illicit. Some parents have been investigated by the police as a result.
The "nudie video" in Ms. Watkins's case, uploaded in September, was flagged within minutes as possible sexual exploitation of a child, a violation of Google's terms of service with very serious consequences.
Ms. Watkins, a medical worker who lives in New South Wales, Australia, soon discovered that she was locked out of not just YouTube but all her accounts with Google. She lost access to her photos, documents and email, she said, meaning she couldn't get messages about her work schedule, review her bank statements or "order a thickshake" via her McDonald's app -- which she logs into using her Google account.
Her account would eventually be deleted, a Google login page informed her, but she could appeal the decision. She clicked a Start Appeal button and wrote in a text box that her 7-year-old sons thought "butts are funny" and were responsible for uploading the video.
"This is harming me financially," she added.
Children's advocates and lawmakers around the world have pushed technology companies to stop the online spread of abusive imagery by monitoring for such material on their platforms. Many communications providers now scan the photos and videos saved and shared by their users to look for known images of abuse that had been reported to the authorities.
Google also wanted to be able to flag never-before-seen content. A few years ago, it developed an algorithm -- trained on the known images -- that seeks to identify new exploitative material; Google made it available to other companies, including Meta and TikTok.
Once an employee confirmed that the video posted by Ms. Watkins's son was problematic, Google reported it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit that acts as the federal clearinghouse for flagged content. The center can then add the video to its database of known images and decide whether to report it to local law enforcement.
Google is one of the top reporters of "apparent child pornography," according to statistics from the national center. Google filed more than two million reports last year, far more than most digital communications companies, though fewer than the number filed by Meta.
(It is hard to judge the severity of the child abuse problem from the numbers alone, experts say. In one study of a small sampling of users flagged for sharing inappropriate images of children, data scientists at Facebook said more than 75 percent "did not exhibit malicious intent." The users included teenagers in a romantic relationship sharing intimate images of themselves, and people who shared a "meme of a child's genitals being bitten by an animal because they think it's funny.")
Apple has resisted pressure to scan the iCloud for exploitative material. A spokesman pointed to a letter that the company sent to an advocacy group this year, expressing concern about the "security and privacy of our users" and reports "that innocent parties have been swept into dystopian dragnets."
Last fall, Google's trust and safety chief, Susan Jasper, wrote in a blog post that the company planned to update its appeals process to "improve the user experience" for people who "believe we made wrong decisions." In a major change, the company now provides more information about why an account has been suspended, rather than a generic notification about a "severe violation" of the company's policies. Ms. Watkins, for example, was told that child exploitation was the reason she had been locked out.
Regardless, Ms. Watkins's repeated appeals were denied. She had a paid Google account, allowing her and her husband to exchange messages with customer service agents. But in digital correspondence reviewed by The Times, the agents said the video, even if a child's oblivious act, still violated company policies.
The draconian punishment for one silly video seemed unfair, Ms. Watkins said. She wondered why Google couldn't give her a warning before cutting off access to all her accounts and more than 10 years of digital memories.
After more than a month of failed attempts to change the company's mind, Ms. Watkins reached out to The Times. A day after a reporter inquired about her case, her Google account was restored.
"We do not want our platforms to be used to endanger or exploit children, and there's a widespread demand that internet platforms take the firmest action to detect and prevent CSAM," the company said in a statement, using a widely used acronym for child sexual abuse material. "In this case, we understand that the violative content was not uploaded maliciously." The company had no response for how to escalate a denial of an appeal beyond emailing a Times reporter.
Google is in a difficult position trying to adjudicate such appeals, said Dave Willner, a fellow at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center who has worked in trust and safety at several large technology companies. Even if a photo or video is innocent in its origin, it could be shared maliciously.
"Pedophiles will share images that parents took innocuously or collect them into collections because they just want to see naked kids," Mr. Willner said.
The other challenge is the sheer volume of potentially exploitative content that Google flags.
"It's just a very, very hard-to-solve problem regimenting value judgment at this scale," Mr. Willner said. "They're making hundreds of thousands, or millions, of decisions a year. When you roll the dice that many times, you are going to roll snake eyes."
He said Ms. Watkins's struggle after losing access to Google was "a good argument for spreading out your digital life" and not relying on one company for so many services.
Ms. Watkins took a different lesson from the experience: Parents shouldn't use their own Google account for their children's internet activity, and should instead set up a dedicated account -- a choice that Google encourages.
She has not yet set up such an account for her twins. They are now barred from the internet.

Microsoft Case's Legacy Shapes a Google Trial: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lawyers for the Justice Department and Google as well as the judge in a monthslong trial have invoked the landmark case against Microsoft from the 1990s.
Antitrust trials are full of long stretches of detailed, often tedious testimony punctuated by telling moments. In the two-month Google antitrust trial that is nearing its conclusion, one of those moments came in a brief exchange in October.
While cross-examining a witness for the Justice Department, John Schmidtlein, Google's lead trial lawyer, tried to describe how this suit differed from the landmark antitrust case brought against Microsoft in the 1990s. The barriers to competition in search today, Mr. Schmidtlein said, are less daunting than Microsoft's stranglehold on personal computer software.
The judge cut him off. "Let's move on," said Judge Amit P. Mehta, who wrote in an opinion earlier in the year that he would use the Microsoft case as a guiding framework. "I think I can figure out what the Microsoft case was about."
The antitrust fight against Microsoft in the 1990s has loomed over the government's showdown with Google. The Justice Department and a group of states say the search giant is running the Microsoft monopoly playbook, just in a different tech market, while Google argues that it is hardly as powerful as Microsoft was back in the day.
The Microsoft antitrust case is also the lone example of the government's embarking on -- and winning -- a sweeping suit against a tech giant for illegally protecting its monopoly. Microsoft combined old-style practices, like bullying industry partners to stifle competition, with newer ideas in economics.
One of those new ideas included the dynamics of digital markets, which reinforce the power of a dominant company. In tech markets, there can be a powerful "network effect" as a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it, attracting still more users and investment. Once on a digital platform, users tend not to switch. These concepts of digital platform economics are crucial to the Google case.
While the eventual ruling by Judge Mehta, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, will hinge largely on his assessment of the facts and evidence presented in the trial, his decision must also be built on the precedents established by previous cases.
"Microsoft is his legal road map," said Andrew I. Gavil, an antitrust expert and law professor at Howard University.
Testimony in the trial, which began in September, is expected to end by Thanksgiving. A ruling by the judge -- a bench trial, without a jury -- will come next year.
The government's argument focuses on the power of data and the notion that the search business is an accelerating flywheel, which becomes an insurmountable barrier to rivals. More users generate more data to train Google's search algorithms, improving the quality of its search, attracting more users and advertisers.
Data does matter, Google's lawyers have said, but it has diminishing returns. Microsoft's Bing, for example, has plenty of data, but Google is the runaway leader in search, it says, because of its greater investment in smart people to create better software. Its defense has largely been a parade of company engineers and executives testifying to the time, work and money that go into improving its search engine.
In another echo of the Microsoft antitrust fight, contracts that Google signed with other tech companies to protect its business have emerged as a key part of the trial. In both cases, the government said the contracts were illegal.
Microsoft's contracts were deals with personal computer makers and internet services to not offer browsing software from Netscape, the early leader. Microsoft feared that the browser -- a layer of software on top of Microsoft's operating system -- could undermine the powerful hold its Windows software had on the tech industry.
The Microsoft contracts were take-it-or-leave-it deals. PC makers worried that Microsoft might refuse to give them access to its Windows desktop software or charge them more for it. Windows dominated the PC market and served as the gateway to the internet before smartphones.
Google's contracts are different. They involve big payments to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to make Google the featured search engine on their devices and browsers. Google paid $ 26.3 billion for such pay-for-default deals in 2021, the company disclosed in testimony. The government argues that Google paid so much to illegally exclude competitors and potential rivals, effectively buying much of the search market and hoarding still more data.
"So Google did it with carrots instead of sticks," said Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. At one point in the trial, Judge Mehta called the default payment deals the "heart of the case."
Google argues that it competes fairly for the default deals, that its payments to device makers can lower costs to consumers, that it makes it easy for users to switch search engines -- and that its grip on the market pales in comparison with Microsoft's chokehold in the PC era.
Antitrust experts add that Microsoft's campaign was mainly intended to stifle a potential rival, and that it had little pro-competitive justification for its acts.
"The conduct was harsher in Microsoft; it's more subtle with Google," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.
If the government and states prevail in the Google case, the question becomes: What will Judge Mehta determine is the appropriate remedy?
The remedy phase comes after a judge decides there has been a violation, and then determines what action should be taken to try to restore competition. That could involve another round of court hearings, with testimony from both sides.
Banning the pay-for-default deals would be an obvious step, and that would mirror the outcome in the Microsoft case. In the end, Microsoft was prohibited from making exclusive deals that thwarted competition and was ordered to disclose more technical information to potential rivals.
There are already calls for stronger sanctions to encourage competition this time. Tim Wu, a professor of law at Columbia University and former technology policy official in the Biden administration, calls for ordering Google to spin off its Chrome browser, a major distribution channel for its search engine, in addition to outlawing Google's payment deals.
Yet Judge Mehta would necessarily be guided by legal precedent -- and by Microsoft most of all.
"The government has crafted this case to look as much like Microsoft as they could," said Mr. First of New York University. "To push the boundary in the remedy phase would be a real challenge."

Google Head Runs Gantlet Of Testifying On 2 Coasts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, testified on Tuesday for the second time in two weeks to defend his company against monopoly claims.
Two weeks ago, Google had a big day in Washington. President Biden signed an executive order to create artificial intelligence safeguards that could affect Google's most pressing projects, and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken gave the company an award for its work in aiding Ukrainian refugees and promoting women's economic security.
Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, had spent much of the day on a witness stand at a federal courthouse about two miles from the White House, defending his company from claims that it crushed rivals in the search and online advertising markets.
On Tuesday, Mr. Pichai testified again, this time in San Francisco, to confront claims brought by the video game company Epic Games that his company broke the law, wielding monopolistic power over app developers on Android's Google Play Store.
Mr. Pichai over the last month has become the face of Google's antitrust court fights on both sides of the country. And his visits to the witness stand underscore the growing importance for Big Tech leaders to be sharp witnesses for their companies, whether in an antitrust trial or in hearings on Capitol Hill.
Testifying under oath is a task that many tech chief executives might be asked to do in the coming years, with Amazon, Meta and others facing their own antitrust court fights. It is not a task at which many executives have excelled.
Though he was never called to the witness stand to testify, Bill Gates, who was chief executive of Microsoft in the last big technology antitrust case brought by the Justice Department more than two decades ago, came across as combative and evasive in depositions.
Over the last few years, executives including Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI's Sam Altman (and, of course, Mr. Pichai) have been asked to testify before Congress for various reasons, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Zuckerberg has at times exasperated lawmakers with vague responses, while Mr. Altman appeared to charm senators in a hearing this year.
The main duty on the witness stand for Mr. Pichai -- a low-key and detail-focused executive -- has been to keep the temperature low under questioning and keep to the central point of Google's antitrust defense: that it is an innovative company that has maintained its leadership through innovation and hard work instead of illegal monopolistic behavior.
On Tuesday, Mr. Pichai ran into aggressive questioning by a lawyer for Epic, Lauren Moskowitz, who asked him to provide yes-or-no responses.
That led to at least one small revelation: Mr. Pichai confirmed that his company gave Apple 36 percent of the search revenue generated on iPhones, and said the total payment "was well over $ 10 billion" last year. Ms. Moskowitz asserted that the figure was at least $ 18 billion.
Lawyers for Google and Apple fought on Tuesday morning to keep the figures concealed, emphasizing a need for corporate privacy that has carried through both of Google's trials. Judge James Donato rejected their requests, saying, "Just coming in and saying we're kind of sensitive with this isn't going to fly."
Ms. Moskowitz was trying to counter Google's claim that it cannot be considered a monopoly because of its rivalry with Apple. If that were the case, she argued, why did it give Apple preferential treatment over other companies like Samsung, which she said received a 16 percent share of the search revenue from its devices?
"We compete fiercely with Apple, at the operating system, the smartphone and the app store level," Mr. Pichai said later, when questioned by a Google lawyer. "The competition has been good for consumers and developers."
The Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust suit against Google in October 2020, arguing that the company's default-search deals with phone makers and browser companies helped it illegally maintain a monopoly.
Google called Mr. Pichai, 51, to the stand two weeks ago. Rather than sit in the witness box, Mr. Pichai stood at a lectern for almost four hours, wearing a microphone, as though he were delivering a speech at a corporate conference. His handlers said he had to stand because of a sprained lower back.
He spoke of his background, getting a telephone as a preteen in Chennai, India, and understanding then the power of technology, before he deftly answered questions about his company's competitive standing, relationship with Apple and the default-search contracts the government argues were illegal.
Mr. Pichai tried to refute the government lawyer's arguments that Google paid Apple billions of dollars a year to keep it out of the search market. He presented a different story, saying his company wanted to be the iPhone's default search engine because of the "value" of that spot, and the need to ensure Apple would safeguard the user experience.
"I felt the deal had done well since 2016," Mr. Pichai said. "It was continuing to increase search usage, search revenue."
In cross-examination, Mr. Pichai repeated the rationale for the deal so many times that for a moment, he seemed to lose patience with the line of questioning, saying, "I just gave all the reasons" for the deal.
Adam Kovacevich, a tech industry lobbyist at the Chamber of Progress who spent 12 years working at Google, said Mr. Pichai's testimony gave the court a high-level view of how the company made strategic decisions.
"He did fine," Mr. Kovacevich said of Mr. Pichai's performance. "The biggest thing to me is when you're in that position, your first objective is to not be Bill Gates in the Microsoft trial. Your No. 1 objective is to come off as responsive and reasonable."
Excerpts from Mr. Gates's combative, videotaped testimony were shown in court more than two decades ago. The Microsoft co-founder, antitrust lawyers say, undermined his and his company's credibility with the judge in the case.
In San Francisco, Mr. Pichai was questioned on topics ranging from why he erroneously marked emails as subject to attorney-client privilege (to prevent them from being forwarded) to whether Facebook and Amazon could have provided competition to Google's Play Store when they had smartphone ambitions.
"There are nuances in these questions," he said with a smile when Ms. Moskowitz started to speak over him. "I'm trying to answer your question."
Several times, Judge Donato asked Ms. Moskowitz to "be quiet" to let Mr. Pichai speak.
There will be one big difference between the lawsuits: The antitrust trial in Washington does not have a jury. The decision will be made by a judge. In San Francisco, Mr. Pichai had to appeal to a nine-person jury that could be open to the idea that a giant tech company is exploiting much smaller outfits. Tim Sweeney, Epic's chief executive, is also expected to testify in the trial.
Google and Epic declined to comment.
Epic, the maker of the hit game Fortnite, brought the claim against Google in 2020, in an attempt to sidestep the 15 to 30 percent fees from subscriptions and in-app purchases that it must pay Google.
The game developer antagonized Google and Apple by telling users to pay for in-app transactions directly through Epic. In response, Google and Apple suspended Fortnite from their app stores. Epic claims Google also bullied other companies to force them to drop deals with Epic before it was banned from the app stores.
Google faces another Justice Department antitrust lawsuit that accuses it of illegally abusing its monopoly power over the technology that delivers ads online.
A trial in that case could begin as soon as next year, but it is too early to know whether Mr. Pichai will be called to testify.
Mr. Pichai has tried to prevent Google employees from being distracted by the litigation. He has encouraged them to "keep doing what you're doing" and has allocated a relatively small number of employees to work on the Justice Department case -- hundreds out of more than 180,000.
But Mr. Pichai's court appearances have taken time away from his other obligations as a company leader, including his plan to reclaim Google's primacy in the fast-growing field of generative A.I.
In the middle of Mr. Pichai's October testimony, the secretary of state, Mr. Blinken, was honoring Google's subsidiary in Poland for its work in fostering women's economic security and helping Ukrainian refugees. Hours later, Mr. Biden hosted a signing ceremony at the White House, but Mr. Pichai's handlers could not R.S.V.P. yes because there was a chance he might have still been in court when it began.
"It's not the best use of his time," Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research, a London-based investment research firm, said in an interview. "No C.E.O. wishes to spend their time being grilled by government lawyers."

SAN FRANCISCO — Two weeks ago, Google had a big day in Washington. President Joe Biden signed an executive order to create artificial intelligence safeguards that could affect Google’s most pressing projects, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave the company an award for its work in aiding Ukrainian refugees and promoting women’s economic security.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, had spent much of Monday, Oct. 30, on a witness stand at a federal courthouse about 2 miles from the White House, defending his company from claims that it crushed rivals in the search and online advertising markets.
On Tuesday, Pichai testified again, this time in San Francisco, to confront claims brought by the video game company Epic Games that his company broke the law, wielding monopolistic power over app developers on Android’s Google Play Store.
Pichai over the last month has become the face of Google’s antitrust court fights on both sides of the country. And his visits to the witness stand underscore the growing importance for Big Tech leaders to be sharp witnesses for their companies, whether in an antitrust trial or in hearings on Capitol Hill.
Testifying under oath is a task that many tech CEOs might be asked to do in the coming years, with Amazon, Meta and others facing their own antitrust court fights. It is not a task at which many executives have excelled.
Although he was never called to the witness stand to testify, Bill Gates, who was CEO of Microsoft in the last big technology antitrust case brought by the Justice Department more than two decades ago, came across as combative and evasive in depositions.
Over the last few years, executives including Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI’s Sam Altman (and, of course, Pichai) have been asked to testify before Congress for various reasons, with varying degrees of success. Zuckerberg has at times exasperated lawmakers with vague responses, while Altman appeared to charm senators in a hearing this year.
The main duty on the witness stand for Pichai — a low-key and detail-focused executive — has been to keep the temperature low under questioning and keep to the central point of Google’s antitrust defense: that it is an innovative company that has maintained its leadership through innovation and hard work instead of illegal monopolistic behavior.
On Tuesday, Pichai ran into aggressive questioning by a lawyer for Epic, Lauren Moskowitz, who asked him to provide yes-or-no responses.
That led to at least one small revelation: Pichai confirmed that his company gave Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on iPhones and said the total payment “was well over $10 billion” last year. Moskowitz asserted that the figure was at least $18 billion.
Lawyers for Google and Apple fought Tuesday morning to keep the figures concealed, emphasizing a need for corporate privacy that has carried through both of Google’s trials. Judge James Donato rejected their requests, saying, “Just coming in and saying, ‘We’re kind of sensitive with this,’ isn’t going to fly.”
Moskowitz was trying to counter Google’s claim that it cannot be considered a monopoly because of its rivalry with Apple. If that were the case, she argued, why did it give Apple preferential treatment over other companies like Samsung, which she said received a 16% share of the search revenue from its devices?
“We compete fiercely with Apple, at the operating system, the smartphone and the app store level,” Pichai said later, when questioned by a Google lawyer. “The competition has been good for consumers and developers.”
The Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust suit against Google in October 2020, arguing that the company’s default-search deals with phone makers and browser companies helped it illegally maintain a monopoly.

For Zuckerberg, the 'Next Chapter' Is WhatsApp: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Facebook bought WhatsApp for $ 19 billion nearly a decade ago, Mark Zuckerberg made a promise: The Facebook chief said he wouldn't meddle often with the messaging app so as not to mess with a good thing.
Mr. Zuckerberg stuck to that philosophy as WhatsApp amassed more than two billion users globally -- until 2019, when he began tapping the app's growth and business potential.
Now WhatsApp has become increasingly crucial to Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and other apps. More than half of Americans ages 18 to 35 who own a cellphone have installed WhatsApp, according to the company's studies, making it one of Meta's fastest-growing services in its most mature market. Ads on Facebook and Instagram that push users to WhatsApp and its sister messaging service, Messenger, are also growing so rapidly that they may reach $ 10 billion in revenue this year, the company recently said.
"If you're envisioning what will be the private social platform of the future, starting from scratch, I think it would basically look like WhatsApp," Mr. Zuckerberg, 39, said in a recent interview.
WhatsApp's momentum is a reminder that Meta remains at heart a business powered by its family of social apps. Although Mr. Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars in recent years on his future-facing vision of the immersive digital world of the metaverse and on artificial intelligence, apps like WhatsApp are bringing in new users and revenue. That makes it one of the keys to his company's future, enabling Meta to explore costly, experimental and unproven products.
WhatsApp has also become a backbone of Meta's business in what Mr. Zuckerberg has declared to be "a year of efficiency." After global economic uncertainty last year caused an advertising slump, Meta cut nearly a third of its staff. It remains reliant on its core apps to deliver steady sales growth and to appeal to Wall Street.
In the interview, Mr. Zuckerberg positioned WhatsApp as a "next chapter" for his company. The messaging app could become a cornerstone for business messaging, he said, as well as a primary conversation app.
"Now that everyone has mobile phones and are basically producing content and messaging all day long, I think you can do something that's a lot better and more intimate than just a feed of all your friends," he said.
A decade ago, WhatsApp was a very different app -- by design. Jan Koum and Brian Acton, two engineers who had worked together at Yahoo, built WhatsApp as a fast, free and secure way to exchange messages with friends and family.
Importantly, WhatsApp used a data connection instead of mobile carriers' SMS messages, which often cost money. The service also didn't store people's messages on its servers. And it didn't have some bells and whistles that other apps, like iMessage, do, which allowed it to run quickly and easily on even slow data connections.
WhatsApp quickly took off, with hundreds of millions of people around the world downloading it in just a few years. That caught the attention of Mr. Zuckerberg, who snapped up WhatsApp in 2014 after it received overtures from Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent, two people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Zuckerberg initially left most decisions about WhatsApp to its founders, who had stayed on after Facebook bought the app. Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton bristled at talk of making money and advertising, and put a priority on safety and security on the messaging service. In April 2016, WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption, which keeps messages from being intercepted or viewed by parties outside the conversation.
"It felt like Facebook was keeping WhatsApp in its back pocket for a long time, as a kind of 'green field' opportunity for monetization," said Eric Seufert, an independent mobile analyst who follows Meta. "It has almost been more valuable for them as this unknown quantity, where they often said, 'Who knows how big the business could be?"'
But by 2019, Mr. Zuckerberg was champing at the bit to assert more control over his company's apps, tying them together so they would share data and technology. That led to the departures of WhatsApp's founders and other employees. Mr. Acton joined a rival company, Signal; Mr. Koum now focuses on philanthropy and buying high-end, air-cooled Porsches. Some former WhatsApp executives later accused Mr. Zuckerberg of breaking promises he had made concerning privacy when he bought the company.
Mr. Zuckerberg has since built WhatsApp into a more fully fleshed-out messaging service and business. WhatsApp has added more features, ranging from simple emoji reactions and message forwarding to disappearing messages and supporting the app across other devices, like Macs and Windows desktop computers.
For most of its life, WhatsApp had been more popular with users outside the United States. But with the new features, more Americans began trying the app. In the United States, it has grown fastest with young people in Miami, New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, according to the company's studies. A Snapchat-like feature that allows users to post temporary text, photo and video updates, called Status, has become the world's most used Stories product, Meta said.
WhatsApp also began offering paid tools and custom apps for businesses that wanted to use the platform to communicate with consumers. Chevrolet, Lenovo, Samsung and L'Oreal now use some of those tools, and WhatsApp has forged business and advertising partnerships in Latin America and India with companies such as Amazon and Uber.
In 2017, WhatsApp introduced "click-to-message" advertising, which is an ad format that businesses can buy to place inside a Facebook feed. When users click on the ad on Facebook, it links them to a brand's WhatsApp account, where they can talk with customer service representatives or take an action like booking a flight or buying goods. The ads have become Meta's fastest-growing ad format, the company said.
Nissan spent the past year building chatbots on WhatsApp that can help the automaker talk with its customers in Brazil and route them to a local car dealership. Between 30 to 40 percent of Nissan's new sales leads in Brazil now come through WhatsApp, the auto company said, and the service has reduced its response time to customers to a matter of seconds from an average of 30 minutes.
"You're not being intrusive because you're willing to help customers at their own pace," Mauricio Greco, marketing director for Nissan Brazil, said in an interview. "This is about giving our salespeople the tools they need, because they actually want to sell."
Nikila Srinivasan, a Meta vice president of product management, said the company was also building its payments infrastructure and working with companies in India, Brazil and Singapore to allow people to pay for purchases directly inside WhatsApp. More than 200 million businesses use WhatsApp's professional business apps, she said.
Still, WhatsApp is contending with competitors and regulatory hurdles. Its biggest rival is iMessage, Apple's native messaging app, which comes installed on every iPhone and Mac. It is also grappling with smaller but well-loved upstarts like Signal and Telegram, which is especially popular in Europe.
In Europe, WhatsApp may be forced to integrate with competing messaging services as part of the requirements under a new law, the Digital Markets Act, Mr. Seufert said. The company has said it has begun the difficult technical work of making sure that WhatsApp users can send messages to rival apps in the region.
Some regulators have also pushed against encryption, a key feature of WhatsApp and iMessage, saying it makes it more difficult for the authorities to monitor or catch criminals.
Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, has defended WhatsApp's privacy controls and said he would fight "tooth and nail" against any country that wanted to weaken its encryption.
One sign of how WhatsApp is evolving is Channels, a feature that was unveiled in September. Channels lets people follow status updates from influencers like Bad Bunny, the musician who dropped a reference to WhatsApp in his track "Moscow Mule" last year, without divulging their phone number or contact information. WhatsApp now has more than 225 channels, including one for The New York Times, that each have more than a million followers.
The goal is to make WhatsApp a household name, whether it is to shop, chat or stay on top of news and events, Mr. Cathcart said.
"The conversation has moved from 'WhatsApp is the app I use outside the U.S. when I travel,"' he said. "It's becoming significantly more mainstream."

For most of its life, WhatsApp had been more popular with users outside the United States. But with the new features, more Americans began trying it. In the United States, it has grown fastest with young people in Miami, New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, according to the company’s studies. A Snapchat-like feature that allows users to post temporary text, photo and video updates, called Status, has become the world’s most used Stories product, Meta said.
WhatsApp also began offering paid tools and custom apps for businesses that wanted to use the platform to communicate with consumers. Chevrolet, Lenovo, Samsung and L’Oreal now use some of those tools, and WhatsApp has forged business and advertising partnerships in Latin America and India with companies such as Amazon and Uber.
In 2017, WhatsApp introduced “click-to-message” advertising, which is an ad format that businesses can buy to place inside a Facebook feed. When users click on the ad on Facebook, it links them to a brand’s WhatsApp account, where they can talk with customer service representatives or take an action such as booking a flight or buying goods. The ads have become Meta’s fastest-growing ad format, the company said.
Nissan spent the past year building chatbots on WhatsApp that can help the automaker talk with its customers in Brazil and route them to a local car dealership. Between 30% and 40% of Nissan’s new sales leads in Brazil now come through WhatsApp, the auto company said, and the service has reduced its response time to customers to a matter of seconds from an average of 30 minutes.
“You’re not being intrusive because you’re willing to help customers at their own pace,” Mauricio Greco, marketing director for Nissan Brazil, said in an interview. “This is about giving our salespeople the tools they need, because they actually want to sell.”
Nikila Srinivasan, a Meta vice president of product management, said the company was also building its payments infrastructure and working with companies in India, Brazil and Singapore to allow people to pay for purchases directly inside WhatsApp. More than 200 million businesses use WhatsApp’s professional business apps, she said.
Still, WhatsApp is contending with competitors and regulatory hurdles. Its biggest rival is iMessage, Apple’s native messaging app, which comes installed on every iPhone and Mac. It is also grappling with smaller but well-loved upstarts including Signal and Telegram, which is especially popular in Europe.
In Europe, WhatsApp may be forced to integrate with competing messaging services as part of the requirements under a new law, the Digital Markets Act, Seufert said. The company has said it has begun the difficult technical work of making sure that WhatsApp users can send messages to rival apps in the region.
Some regulators have also pushed against encryption, a key feature of WhatsApp and iMessage, saying it makes it more difficult for authorities to monitor or catch criminals.
Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, has defended WhatsApp’s privacy controls and said he would fight “tooth and nail” against any country that wanted to weaken its encryption.
One sign of how WhatsApp is evolving is Channels, a feature unveiled in September. Channels lets people follow status updates from influencers such as Bad Bunny, the musician who dropped a reference to WhatsApp in his track “Moscow Mule” last year, without divulging their phone number or contact information. WhatsApp now has more than 225 channels, including one for The New York Times, that each has more than 1 million followers.
The goal is to make WhatsApp a household name, whether it is to shop, chat or stay on top of news and events, Cathcart said.
“The conversation has moved from ‘WhatsApp is the app I use outside the U.S. when I travel,’” he said. “It’s becoming significantly more mainstream.”

Full text: Teleprompter! Makeup! Auction houses no longer play exclusively to the art world as viewers flock to YouTube, Instagram and TikTok to see how the one percent spends.
As Sotheby's and Christie's prepare for the start this week of the major New York auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art -- at which a 1932 Picasso is expected to bring in more than $ 120 million -- teams of tech experts, producers and show directors are readying their salesrooms as if they were CNN Central.
They have made more space for roving video cameras, LED screens and expert lighting by shrinking their once-valued seating for collectors and dealers by some 30 percent. Just like a television station, both auction houses have added control rooms filled with producers and directors who watch every camera angle and monitor where the action is in the salesroom. Their attention is not only on auctioneers but on the banks of telephone bid-takers who drive the nightly drama, advising their clients from London to Hong Kong to Doha when competing bids are received. These livestream feeds can "capture the energy of the moment," Gillian Gorman Round, Christie's chief marketing officer, promised.
But the massive preparation is not for the benefit of the art world and its V.I.P. clients: Auction houses are now playing to millions of viewers from all over the world, who stream the action live on social media sites including YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram Live, as well as their own websites -- riveted by how the one percent spends its money.
What began as a way of doing business during the pandemic has become the new voyeuristic evening entertainment during the big May and November sales. "Twenty years ago, people thought you had to be the member of an elite club to walk through an auction house door," recalled Adrien Meyer, Christie's global head of private sales and one of the company's chief auctioneers. "Now you can see a sale sitting on your couch in your underpants."
While many buyers still attend the sales -- some observing from the comfort of skyboxes above the auction floor -- online viewing appeals to people who simply don't want to sit in a salesroom for three hours, the length of a typical major auction.
Both companies admitted that fewer big collectors are coming to the sales, preferring to watch the highlights online at home. "This is the age of discretion," said Sandy Heller, a veteran art adviser who has helped put together some of the world's major collections. "And what's more discreet than watching a sale at home on your iPad?"
Even a seasoned auction-goer like Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund billionaire and owner of the Mets, said, "It sure makes life easier to be able to watch these sales online."
Auction houses ramped up their livestream sales during the pandemic shutdown in 2020, "when people couldn't see art or go to an auction," said Charles Stewart, the chief executive of Sotheby's. "It was a massive and long overdue moment for us to expand digitally and rethink the physical experience."
The first Christie's auction livestreamed during the pandemic drew about 100,000 people, according to the auction house. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie's Americas, recalled that the sale, in July 2020, featuring Impressionist, modern, postwar and contemporary art, was a simple production, shot with just one camera. But it helped "launch what is effectively now a Broadway show," he said.
The big three auction houses have since hired production companies and added more channels, transforming these events into what Stewart of Sotheby's calls "must-see TV," borrowing the famous advertising slogan from NBC. (While Phillips, the smaller, boutique auction house, has not shrunk its salesrooms, it, too, has made its big auctions available on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and, in China, WeChat, Weibo and Red.)
The worldwide reception has surprised experts everywhere. From May 2022 to May 2023, views of Christie's auctions rose 25 percent, from 3.7 million to 4.6 million, with 10 cameras now capturing the events. (These numbers do not include people watching auctions afterward on YouTube.) "We never expected these numbers," said Bonnie Brennan, president of Christie's Americas. "It's the power of social media."
While the majority of those watching online are unlikely to have millions to spend on art -- and buyers must register with the auction houses to bid -- many end up perusing Sotheby's and Christie's websites, where they may discover something to buy at other price points, including watches, handbags and jewelry. "We see luxury items as a gateway to art," Brennan added. "It's about the democratization of access."
She added that while the actual number of buyers has remained steady, "the way they are buying has changed dramatically, with 80 percent of bids coming from online channels around the world." Sotheby's reported that 91 percent of its bids in 2022 were executed online.
(The Art Basel and UBS Survey of Global Collecting recently reported that sales at Christie's, Sotheby's, Phillips and Bonhams auction houses were down by 16 percent in the first six months of 2023, over the same period a year earlier.)
Online buyers tend to be younger than the average collector. "They have the confidence that these digital tools are effective, and they feel more in control," Brennan explained. Another major change: the number of collectors who are bidding on and often buying art and objects without having seen them.
Three years ago, Sotheby's tested a sale with socially distanced bidders in three cities. An Asian collector bid more than $ 70 million -- sight unseen -- for a triptych by the painter Francis Bacon. (It ended up selling to an undisclosed telephone bidder for $ 84.6 million, with fees. According to Sotheby's, the winning buyer had seen the painting.)
Both auction houses said sophisticated technology has given buyers confidence to acquire works without viewing them in person. Computer software similar to that used by real estate firms or furniture stores can virtually show potential bidders what a living room would look like with a particular work of art hanging over the fireplace or in the entrance hall. Christie's has a hologram that replicates an object in three-dimensions. When it was selling a Degas "Little Dancer" sculpture from the estate of the philanthropist Anne Bass, the work was too delicate to travel, so experts showed it virtually. It sold for $ 41.6 million.
"Given that these sales are so highly produced," said Heller, the art adviser, clients "can have a much better experience simply streaming" rather than being in the room where it happens.
With such large audiences, and so much at stake, Sotheby's auctioneers do far less ad-libbing. An editorial team now writes the scripts for the major sales with a succinct description of each artwork projected on a teleprompter.
"Talking with a teleprompter makes it smoother, more professional," explained Oliver Barker, chairman of Sotheby's Europe and one of its star auctioneers, who now fields bids not just from the salesroom and telephone bidders but also from online, making the process far more challenging than it once was. (Christie's auctioneers have the same complications but only use a teleprompter for salesroom announcements, not for actual auctions.)
Professional hair and makeup experts are on hand for auctioneers and the now-visible banks of telephone bid-takers. "I tell the experts there's to be no scowling; no bad behavior," Gorman Round, of Christie's, said.
Just like a television show, Sotheby's even has advertisers. The phrase "in partnership with Samsung" can be seen in the Sotheby's auction room; on its website and on promotional videos. (The consumer electronics giant pays an undisclosed flat fee). Christie's said it doesn't have the same kind of advertising, but during the pandemic its male auctioneers wore Brioni suits and the women were dressed in Alexander McQueen. Both fashion houses are owned by Kering, which is part of Groupe Artemis, the holding company that also owns Christie's.
Just as Super Bowl parties fire up sports viewers, auction parties are becoming popular, too. Fans online like to talk too.
On the night of Sept. 6, Sotheby's London salesroom had some 300 collectors and fans watching Barker wield his gavel for the first auction of art, objects, ephemera, and costumes of the late British singer and song writer Freddie Mercury. In the days that followed, according to Sotheby's, there were about 9.5 million views of the sale on TikTok. The entire collection, which ultimately brought in $ 50.4 million, created a new community of online enthusiasts.
"Incredible!" one wrote. "Love watching these ... as if I have two pennies to rub together."
As the bidding heated up and the numbers rose, so did emotions:
"Am sat here eating beans on toast because my electricity bill is so big. It's either eat or heat. World makes me sick."
Another declared the sale a "vulgar display of wealth."
But social media has developed a new group of celebrities in their own right: Auctioneers are frequently being recognized on the street or in their local supermarkets. Facebook has a group of fans of Oliver Barker, the Sotheby's auctioneer, who call themselves the BarkerHeads.
"Who is the auctioneer? ❤️❤️❤️," read one online post, referring to Barker.
"I love watching this," wrote another. "But I want to reach into the screen and fix his bowtie." The Christie's auction floor in New York has a sophisticated lighting system for professionally produced online streaming. (PHOTOGRAPH VIA SOTHEBY'S) (C1); Top, Christie's New York control room is set for action. The events draw advertisers along with millions of views worldwide.

Epic Games Puts Google On Defense: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Fortnite creator accuses Google of stifling app competition, a challenge on top of a federal suit claiming the tech giant abuses its search dominance.
For two months, Google has squared off against the Justice Department in court in Washington over claims that the company is abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to crush rivals, a high-stakes antitrust case that could reshape the world's most popular search engine. Now, it's facing another legal challenge closer to home.
On Monday, Epic Games, the company behind the hit game Fortnite, will appear in federal court in San Francisco to kick off a monthlong trial in its own antitrust lawsuit against Google. Epic is expected to argue that Google is violating both state and federal antitrust laws -- as well as its founding principle, "Don't be evil" -- by wielding monopolistic power over app developers on its Google Play Store on Android mobile phones.
"Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize," Epic wrote in its complaint, which was first filed in 2020. The video game developer had tried to bypass the Play Store's fees by letting Fortnite players pay Epic directly for in-app items, prompting Google to bar the game from the store.
If Epic wins, Google could be forced to alter its restrictive Play Store rules, allowing other companies to offer competing app stores and making it easier for developers to avoid the cut it collects from in-app purchases. Google generally takes a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and 30 percent for purchases made within apps that are downloaded from the store. (The company says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases. Larger app makers like Epic must pay 30 percent.)
The simultaneous antitrust suits underscore how Google is playing defense on multiple fronts as regulators and competitors try to chip away at its influence over the internet.
Part of a wider effort by tech regulators in recent years to curb the ever-increasing power of Big Tech, the lawsuits are potentially damaging distractions for Google when it is trying to focus on competing with Microsoft, OpenAI and others in the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence.
"It's hard to imagine Google makes it out of the gauntlet" unscathed in the next year, said Paul Swanson, an antitrust lawyer from the firm Holland & Hart. "At some point with this many cases, one breaks against you."
Even so, Epic faces an uphill battle. It brought similar claims against Apple in a 2021 trial that featured squabbling over a cartoon Fortnite banana and the first court appearance by Tim Cook as Apple's chief executive, but a federal judge rejected most of Epic's arguments.
This trial has key differences that make Epic think it has a shot. For one, the case will be decided by a jury rather than a judge. Epic also will point to what it believes are damning pieces of evidence, arguing that Google forced phone makers like Samsung to pre-install and promote its apps on their devices. It will argue that a Google program called Project Hug paid off some developers so they would continue using Google's payment system. Epic is also being countersued by Google, which is seeking damages.
Mr. Swanson said a jury trial could be beneficial for Epic.
"Google faces a much larger risk when they are up against a bunch of normal folks who are assessing their behavior versus judges assessing the behavior through a lens of a century of antitrust jurisprudence," he said.
Over time, the antitrust claims against the Play Store have been whittled down to a one-on-one confrontation between Google and Epic. In 2021, dozens of state attorneys general sued Google on similar grounds. Google reached a tentative settlement with the group in September. On Tuesday, Google also announced a settlement with Match Group, the dating app company, which had joined Epic's case.
"Epic wants all the benefits of Android and Google Play without having to pay for them," Wilson White, a Google vice president of public policy, said during a briefing with reporters. "The lawsuit would upend a business model that has lowered prices and increased choices."
In 2020, Epic antagonized Google and Apple by encouraging its customers to sidestep the tech giants and pay Epic directly for purchases made in Fortnite, the animated battle royale game. That was a violation of both companies' rules, so they kicked Fortnite out of their app stores.
Epic responded with lawsuits and a public relations blitz that focused on Apple. Fortnite was still available on Android phones because Google allows a practice called sideloading -- downloading apps from the internet outside a phone's app store.
Epic is expected to argue that Google has made life tough on both Android phone users and app developers through a variety of means. Sideloading, Epic will argue, is an arduous process that most phone users struggle with, meaning that Google can maintain de facto control over what apps are on its phones through its Play Store restrictions. Samsung also offers an app store on its Android devices.
Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Epic's, Tim Sweeney, are expected to testify.
This week, Mr. Pichai testified in the Justice Department's flagship antitrust suit against Google's search engine. The department and attorneys general from dozens of states accuse Google of crushing competition by paying Apple, Samsung and other partners billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default on their web browsers.
Google says that it obtained the default positions because it has a superior product, and that its rivals have failed to invest in search.
In addition to Mr. Pichai's appearance, the case has included testimony from Google employees and executives from some of its competitors, including Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella. A ruling is likely to come in 2024.
A federal judge in Virginia is considering a separate Justice Department lawsuit accusing Google of illegally abusing its monopoly power over the technology that delivers ads online. A trial in that case could begin as soon as next year.

Full text: Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, appeared in court to defend his company against a landmark federal antitrust case.
As Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, tells it, his company has always been on the side of consumers. It has paid billions to other industry giants, like Apple and Samsung, he said, to make sure Google's internet search engine worked as well as it should on those companies' devices.
Testifying on Monday in Google's landmark antitrust trial, Mr. Pichai directly contradicted the Justice Department's claims that his company's huge payments to companies like Apple to be the default internet search option on their popular devices represented its unchecked monopoly power. Mr. Pichai said he had been worried that Apple, in particular, would make it more difficult to use Google's search on its devices, and he believed Google had to pay to make sure that wouldn't happen.
"Given that Apple designs the experience, it wasn't clear how they would change the experience if the financial incentive wasn't there," Mr. Pichai said while testifying for more than three hours.
The Google chief was the highest-profile witness to testify so far in the 10-week trial. The monopoly trial -- the first involving a tech giant of the modern internet era -- reflects increasing efforts in Washington to rein in the power of Big Tech.
The Federal Trade Commission has filed its own antitrust lawsuit against Meta, arguing it stifled nascent competitors, and Amazon, saying it squeezes small merchants and favors its own services. On Monday, President Biden signed an executive order laying out the government's first rules for the artificial intelligence systems that Silicon Valley companies have raced to build.
Mr. Pichai opted to stand at a lectern to deliver his testimony because of a sprained lower back, as he tried to undercut claims by the Justice Department and state attorneys general that Google stifled competition through default-distribution deals with companies like Apple and Samsung.
Google paid $ 26.3 billion for its search engine to be the default selection on mobile and desktop browsers in 2021, according to Google's internal data presented during the trial. Most of that, about $ 18 billion, went to Apple, The New York Times has reported.
Google's competitors testified in the trial that the payments had effectively made it impossible for them to compete. Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, said the search giant's power was so significant that the internet was really the "Google web" and that its relationship with Apple was "oligopolistic."
Mr. Pichai, who is also chief executive of Google's parent company, Alphabet, told a different story. He joined Google in 2004 and led the development of its Chrome web browser, which debuted in 2008. In 2014, he began leading product and engineering for many of the company's core products, including Search, Maps, Play and Android. The next year, he was named chief executive.
For 45 minutes, Google's lead litigator in the trial, John Schmidtlein, guided Mr. Pichai through questions about his almost two decades at the company, which has intersected with many of the products and deals at the heart of the case.
Mr. Pichai said that during negotiations with Apple to be the default search engine on its devices, an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, had told him that the deal was "very competitive." He said Mr. Cue had acknowledged there was "tension" between the two companies because Apple's revenue share from the deal, which was proportional to the traffic it sends to Google, had fallen.
Mr. Pichai said he had been worried that if Google did not improve the financial terms of the deal, Apple would degrade the experience of using its search engine.
"There was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen if the deal didn't exist," he said.
Mr. Pichai discussed how products that had Google as the default search engine, including the popular Chrome browser and the Android smartphone operating system, had boosted competition across the industry.
When Chrome was released in 2008, Mr. Pichai said, it challenged the "stagnant" incumbent, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and provided users with a better experience on the web. Internet Explorer offered product updates annually or once every two years, he said, while Chrome released new versions every six weeks.
Mr. Pichai argued that Android's direct competition with Apple had improved all smartphones, leading to better screens and interfaces as well as increased usage in applications and Google's search engine.
His comments appeared to be aimed at addressing the legal standard that both sides say applies to the case. If the government can prove that Google's conduct has resulted in diminishing competition, Google must defend itself by showing its behavior was justified because of ways that it bolsters competition.
During a cross-examination, Meagan Bellshaw, a lawyer for the Justice Department, tried to get Mr. Pichai to explain how much Google's default agreements had contributed to the search engine's popularity.
Ms. Bellshaw pointed to notes from an internal Google meeting, which said default agreements were responsible for 75 percent of the company's search traffic. Mr. Pichai said he could not comment on the figure because did not have full context for it.
The Justice Department's lawyer also homed in on a meeting in 2018 between Mr. Pichai and Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, to discuss Apple's concerns about how the search default agreement was playing out. Mr. Cook was worried that Apple's Safari revenue was growing more slowly than that of Google's search engine.
Painting a picture of a cozy relationship between the two tech giants, Ms. Bellshaw read from an email recapping the meeting, in which a Google executive wrote that Mr. Pichai had said the companies' "incentives are aligned." Mr. Pichai said in court that the meeting had tense moments, focused primarily on the search deal, and that the two companies fiercely competed in other arenas.
William Cavanaugh, a lawyer representing the state attorneys general, pressed Mr. Pichai on Google's rationale for sharing so much money with Apple, and whether he was paying the company to stay out of the search business.
Mr. Pichai repeatedly said he had renewed the deal because it was working well, leading to an increase in search usage and revenue, and had brought benefits to Apple, Google and its shareholders.
For a moment, the usually genteel Mr. Pichai appeared to have lost his patience during an exchange with Mr. Cavanaugh.
"I just gave all the reasons!" Mr. Pichai said, before repeating himself.

Google's Search Chief Describes Company Trying to Stay Ahead: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: At the start of its antitrust defense, Google attributed its success to relentless investment, countering government claims that it broke the law to stay ahead.
The Justice Department has spent weeks arguing in a federal antitrust trial that Google has built an impenetrable barrier around its search business with strong-arm tactics and multibillion-dollar deals.
But a Google executive said on Thursday that he didn't see it that way. He sees a world of threats that could humble his company at any moment.
Google presented a starkly different picture of how it has built and maintained the internet's most dominant business as it began its defense in the landmark trial. The key, said Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's senior vice president overseeing search and other products, has been constant investment and innovation.
Dr. Raghavan described Google's path from its once-unimaginable rise over his former employer Yahoo to fears that its business could be disrupted by formidable competitors.
"I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill," Dr. Raghavan said. "If we become second class, we become irrelevant over time."
Dr. Raghavan said focusing on search missed the internet's competitive landscape. He said numerous companies without search engines compete with Google, including TikTok, Expedia and Booking. "A bunch" of companies are cause for concern, he said, but "Amazon is one of the two most keep-awake companies." The solution to staying ahead, he added, was relentless increases in research and development spending.
The depiction of Google as a company just trying to stay ahead of the pack from Dr. Raghavan and Michael S. Sommer, a lawyer representing Google who questioned him, sharply contrasted with the argument made by the Justice Department and 38 states and territories. For the last seven weeks, they have maintained that Google crushed competition by paying Apple, Samsung and other partners billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default on their web browsers.
The government has said that Google's massive scale makes it impossible for other search engines to compete for contracts and users, and gives the company commanding power over online ads, allowing it to raise ad prices at will.
Google has said that its search engine is popular because of its quality and that users can easily change their default to another service such as Microsoft Bing or DuckDuckGo.
"As I constantly remind my team, nobody wakes up every morning and says I have to run a Google query," Dr. Raghavan said. Instead, he said, they go to the best service for their particular needs.
Dr. Raghavan, 63, has spent more than 11 years at Google, with stints running its applications and ads operations. In 2020, he assumed control of the company's search engine and related businesses, including Google Maps and Assistant as well as commerce products. He had previously devoted much of his career to research, leading Yahoo Labs and working at IBM Research for 14 years.
Dr. Raghavan said that Google's success was not set in stone, and that it faced many challenges in trying to retain its users, especially among younger people. Dr. Raghavan cited research that found that Americans spend about 23 minutes a day surfing the web, versus almost four hours using applications. And he highlighted TikTok's youth appeal, as well as user research that found that "where young people go, older people follow."
To drive the point home, Dr. Raghavan said he was "unfortunately" aware of a derogatory nickname for his employer among young people: "Grandpa Google knows the answers and will help you with homework, but when it comes to interesting things, they like to start elsewhere," he said.
Joshua Hafenbrack, a lawyer for the Justice Department, sought to undercut Dr. Raghavan's insistence that Google was under threat from Amazon, during a cross-examination. He referred to a 2019 competitive analysis conducted by Google that found the company had not seen an impact on its search or shopping revenue among members of loyalty programs like Amazon Prime. These types of loyalty members tend to do more searches on Google, not less, he said.
"Research is something that users do a lot of at Google," Dr. Raghavan said.
Mr. Hafenbrack suggested that Google was more interested in keeping users and making money than offering new features that might be popular.
Google once considered building a so-called incognito version of its search engine that collected no data on users. Mr. Hafenbrack asked if Google never moved forward with the project because it would be popular with users and cost the company billions in revenue.
"That was only one of the concerns, yes," Dr. Raghavan said, adding that the company was also concerned that it would have been using the term "incognito" inconsistently across multiple products.

Full text: For years, Google watched with increasing concern as Apple improved its search technology, not knowing whether its longtime partner and sometimes competitor would eventually build its own search engine.
Those fears ratcheted up in 2021, when Google paid Apple around $ 18 billion to keep Google's search engine the default selection on iPhones, according to two people with knowledge of the partnership, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The same year, Apple's iPhone search tool, Spotlight, began showing users richer web results like those they could have found on Google.
Google quietly planned to put a lid on Apple's search ambitions. The company looked for ways to undercut Spotlight by producing its own version for iPhones and to persuade more iPhone users to use Google's Chrome web browser instead of Apple's Safari browser, according to internal Google documents reviewed by The New York Times. At the same time, Google studied how to pry open Apple's control of the iPhone by leveraging a new European law intended to help small companies compete with Big Tech.
Google's anti-Apple plan illustrated the importance that its executives placed on maintaining dominance in the search business. It also provides insight into the company's complex relationship with Apple, a competitor in consumer gadgets and software that has been an instrumental partner in Google's mobile ads business for more than a decade.
The relationship has come under scrutiny in the landmark antitrust suit brought against Google by the Justice Department and dozens of states. Lawyers for the government have argued that Google rigged the market in its favor with default agreements signed with companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla. These pacts funnel traffic to Google's search engine when users look up information in the top bar of a browser.
Google is expected to begin a three-week presentation of its defense in the lawsuit's monthslong trial on Thursday. So far, the company has downplayed the role that its default agreements with phone makers and browser companies has had on its success. It argues that its search engine is popular because of its quality and innovation, and that users can easily choose another default in their device settings.
But the documents viewed by The Times showed that Google understood the power of defaults in channeling users to a product as it tried to change Apple's selection of Safari as the iPhone's default web browser.
"Competition in the tech industry is fierce, and we compete against Apple on many fronts," said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman. "There are more ways than ever to search for information today, which is why our engineers make thousands of improvements a year to Search to ensure we deliver the most helpful results."
While Google bids on default settings because they matter, he added, users can and do change their defaults. Apple declined to comment.
Last fall, Google executives met to discuss how to reduce the company's reliance on Apple's Safari browser and how best to use a new law in Europe to undermine the iPhone maker, documents showed. While Google considered several options, including how much data it should have access to on the iPhone, it is unclear what the executives decided on.
At the time, the European Union was readying the Digital Markets Act, which was designed to help smaller companies crack Big Tech's control of the industry. Google, already one of the world's largest internet businesses, saw an opening.
Under the act, the European Union is forcing large tech companies designated as "gatekeepers" to open their platforms to competitors by March, giving users a choice of which service to use, and to stop favoring their own services on their platforms.
The law is expected to force Apple to allow customers in the European Union to download rival app stores. Users setting up a new Apple device in Europe could also be presented with an option to select a default browser other than Safari.
Google, which the law will force to allow more competition in search, explored ways to lobby E.U. regulators to crack open Apple's tightly controlled software ecosystem so Google could siphon users from Safari and Spotlight, the documents showed. Executives debated how aggressive the company should be in advocating for access to Apple's operating system.
Google executives figured that if users had to make a choice, the number of European iPhone users who selected Chrome could triple, according to documents reviewed by The Times. That would mean the company could keep more search ad revenue and pay less of it to Apple.
Regulations intended to help smaller companies enter the marketplace "very frequently can also be used by incumbents to gain advantage over their rivals," Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School who focuses on technology and competition, said in an interview.
Google and Apple have had a search engine partnership for Safari since 2002, half a decade before the iPhone's debut. The relationship became more complicated when Google released the Android mobile operating system in 2008, a direct competitor to the iPhone.
Google was concerned about Apple's Spotlight from the feature's earliest days. In 2014, an internal presentation discussed the impact that Apple's new operating system, iOS 8, could have on Google's revenue. The second page of the slide deck was titled "Bottom Line: It's bad," according to a presentation introduced as evidence in the antitrust trial.
"We expect these suggestions to siphon queries away from Google in verticals where Spotlight is triggered," the company wrote.
Apple poached a powerful Google search executive, John Giannandrea, in 2018, and expanded its teams of search employees as it built a more capable Spotlight system. The 2021 improvements to the tool, as part of iOS 15, sparked concerns at Google over Apple's intentions in the search market, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.
In response, Google spun up an effort to build its own version of Spotlight, which was meant to work on iPhones, documents showed. It presented users with quick facts and information from files, messages and apps on the device.
In recent years, Apple has not used Spotlight to crib so-called commercial queries -- which feature ads in their results -- from Google, so the tool has not hurt Google's search business.
Still, Google executives last year contemplated ways to convince the European Union to designate Spotlight as a search engine, according to the documents. Spotlight contained at least five different search features, offering web images; answers and "rich" results that provided extra information like photos; and universal search, which could scan devices, apps and the web. The European Union has not yet decided whether to open Spotlight to greater competition under the law.
That Google is leaning on laws intended to help small companies has frustrated some legal experts.
"I prefer companies to compete on the merits for consumers to want to use their products by offering higher-quality products," Mr. Hurwitz said. "Not by paying lawyers to go to the European Union and get rules in place in order to obtain access to their competitors' platforms."

Full text: Sublime and vulgar all at once, his diaphanous stains of color have come together in a once-in-a-generation show in Paris.
Melt the world away, lose its details, dissolve its borders; it doesn't sound like such an unwelcome prospect right now. The most substantial Mark Rothko retrospective in a generation has opened at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, and it is a show of monumental dispersion: a pull-out-all-the-stops blockbuster where life passes into vapor.
From 1949, when his early figurative pictures finally liquefied into stains of translucent color, Rothko painted with no allusions, no particulars. Over and over, in soft-edged blocks layered on filmy backgrounds, he modeled a commitment to abstraction that charged at the hardest questions of life and art through refusal of the easy path. A lot of people find his large paintings consoling, or seek the Romantic sublime in the depths of his reds and violets. Rothko never thought of them as peaceable. "Behind the color lies the cataclysm," he said in 1959 -- a citation that rarely makes the auction preview catalogs.
His misty abstractions are now so beloved, and their prices so elevated (one was for sale for $ 40 million at Paris+, the Art Basel spinoff here last week), that we might feel we know Rothko backward and forward. Yet it's been 25 whole years since the last full-scale exhibition, organized by the National Gallery of Art in Washington and later seen at the Whitney in New York. To mount a Rothko retrospective of this scale -- there are 115 works at the Fondation Vuitton, spanning all four floors of its Frank Gehry-designed glass schooner in the Bois de Boulogne -- is a far heavier lift than it was in 1998, now that costs have reached such extremes that almost no public museum could afford it.
These paintings are fragile, too, in addition to being a fortune. Nobody wants to lend them without a good reason. It therefore helps when your museum is presided over by the second-richest man on the planet; Bernard Arnault, the luxury conglomerate CEO, is, if nothing else, spending his billions more civically than the South African meme lord, Elon Musk, who overtook him this year to the top of the rich lists. It helps, too, to have the artist's son, Christopher Rothko, as co-curator of this show, with Suzanne Pagé of the Vuitton. Christopher and his sister, Kate Rothko Prizel, hold a trove of their father's paintings, which they recovered after a notorious, epic lawsuit in the 1970s.
The French foundation and the estate have been working together for years to construct this very rare assembly. Unlike the 1998 show, whose core was the National Gallery's huge Rothko holdings and the children's personal collections, here in Paris the curators have borrowed some of the weightiest works of MoMA and the Menil, Yale and Stanford, SFMOMA and the Art Gallery of Ontario. There are also rarely seen paintings from smaller institutions like Munson, a museum in Utica, N.Y., which has generously parted with two prime Rothkos: a blotchy abstraction from 1947, when the artist was on the very hinge of his breakthrough, and a 1951 painting of classic vermilion and diffusing white.
So in organizational terms this show is a milestone, with dozens of classic foggy rectangles bookended by Rothko's early city scenes (sweet but not special) and late color-free abstractions (truly underrated). It plays everything straight, on a strict chronological path to the abstract sublime, and its cool tone only amplifies its extravagance. Whole galleries are given over to 10 or more abstractions, and paintings throughout are hung much lower to the floor than usual -- the artist's preference, to echo the conditions of his studio -- against walls of elephant gray rather than nuclear white.
It keeps the focus on the pictures and nothing else, with just passing glances to the young Marcus Rothkowitz's flight from present-day Latvia, the influence of his Talmudic education or the impact of the Holocaust, the mixed reception of Abstract Expressionism in American and European museums, or his suicide in 1970. The maturation of Rothko's style into a luminous overlay of hazy-edged not-quite-squares occurs in a horn-blowing room (or perhaps the sound is more like a muffled trumpet?) with a dozen choice pictures from 1952 to 1958, unencumbered by internal walls or supplementary texts.
For all that, may I grumble for a moment? I can coolly appreciate the artist's modulations of color; I'm not a philistine. I have a sly admiration for how he imparted the highest seriousness to a few blurry stains. But there is a repetitiousness to this much Rothko, and a fair bit of pomposity to its metaphysical claims. For an artist with such a horror of the decorative, his classic phase is uncomfortably stylish, and feels all the more so in a museum funded by handbag sales. A particular bugbear is his preference for, or fixation on, low-lit rooms containing no art but his own, reducing many of his paintings to props in a moody installation.
I feel that especially in the case of the Seagram Murals, exceptionally lent to Paris from Tate Modern in London, which the artist painted for a disastrous commission for the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan and which, sorry!, I have never liked. Rothko grew more and more upset between 1958 and 1960 that his somber, wine-dark canvases would accompany business lunches, and though he fantasized of making the diners vomit even he knew art didn't have that power. "People can stand anything these days," he said regretfully, and even more today; these stifled pictures of charcoal and rusty burgundy appear more than ever as decorative detours.
Yet even the somewhat Rothko-resistant will find a lot to admire in the Paris show, especially in the pictures that rub against the grain. His early paintings of New York subway stations, for example. Made in the late 1930s, just before he changed his name, these relatively small pictures treat stairs, tracks, commuters and supporting columns as shallow blocks of color, and present the Big Apple as a hermetic pressure cooker. There is a certain charm, too, to his orotund Surrealist pictures of the early 1940s: superpositions of totemic birds and monsters that suggest the abstract arrangements to come, gassed up with classical/biblical titles like "Tiresias" and "Rites of Lilith."
We see how those totems defused and deformed into his first splotchy postwar abstractions, known as the "Multiforms," and from there into the melancholy but still luxurious classic Rothkos of 1949, with their rough symmetry of floating color blocks. They are spectacular, even if they soon all became broadly similar. The effect of all these Rothkos glowing in darkened galleries recalls nothing so much as the OLED screens of Apple and Samsung smartphones: not exactly radiant in themselves, but illuminated from a power source within.
Forgive me for the smartphone analogy; I know it's vulgar. Yet the art historian T.J. Clark and the painter Amy Sillman have both argued that Abstract Expressionism had its greatest impact when it embraced its own vulgarity, and found its way to the sublime via a certain American ludicrousness. I felt that reaffirmed here in Paris, where the most engrossing and challenging paintings are the later, more self-consciously theatrical Rothkos of the 1960s: no longer mysterious, shamelessly immersive, rich and bloody as canard à la presse. The prize of the show is SFMOMA's "No. 14," done in 1960 and 9.5 feet tall, whose cloudy purple background supports a huge, diffuse square the color of a persimmon and, beneath it, a rectangle of metallic blue.
Still this show's final gallery has a shock: after all that gloom, a blast of bright light. In 1969-70, the diaphanous squares and rectangles get pared back to simple, bisected compositions of deep, dense blacks atop brushier grays that recalls the lunar surface. There are 11 of these achromatic puzzles on view here, smaller than the immersive canvases that made his name, and in a cunning move they appear with two large, spindly bronzes by Alberto Giacometti: another artist of existential austerity and eye-watering expense. (The pairing is inspired by Rothko's own unrealized idea of exhibiting alongside Giacometti at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris -- a very rare act of openness from this fussiest of exhibitors.)
Rothko painted these in the wake of a serious illness. For far too long, these were glossed as his "last paintings," or even premonitions of his suicide; in fact, Rothko also painted with bright colors until his final days. Here in Paris, the "Black and Gray" series appears sprier, smarter and more honest about their medium than almost anything that came before.
"I'm only interested in expressing basic human emotions -- tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on," Rothko said in 1957, denying any interest in the mechanics of abstraction or color. It was another aggrandizement, but maybe I should stop being such a hardhearted formalist and take him at his word. Awe, love, fear, faith, emptiness, immanence, infinity, eternity: Are these not the whole reason we bother with form in the first place? On most days I find it faintly ridiculous to try to locate such grand themes in a spume of green or a blood-red fog. On other days, days like now, I find it ridiculous to get through life without them.

Google Argues That the Key To Its Dominance Is Acumen: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While the Justice Department says Google has squeezed partners and made expensive deals to maintain its search dominance, the company has a more genteel story to tell.
In its antitrust confrontation with the government, the pillar of Google's defense has been that innovation -- not restrictive contracts, backed by billions in payments to industry partners -- explains its success as the giant of internet search.
Its competitive advantage, it says, is brilliant people, working tirelessly to improve its products.
Pandu Nayak, Google's first witness in the antitrust trial that began last month, is the face of that defense.
Mr. Nayak, a vice president of search, was raised in India and graduated at the top of his class at one of that nation's elite technical schools. He came to America, earned his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford University and then spent seven years as a research scientist on artificial intelligence projects at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.
Nineteen years ago, Mr. Nayak joined Google and found a particularly welcoming workplace, filled with professional friends. "At the end of the day, Google is a technology company -- it really values the skills that I have," Mr. Nayak said in his testimony on Wednesday.
The computer scientist's testimony is an attempt to rebut a central argument in the case filed by the Justice Department and 38 states and territories. Their suit claims that scale is essential to competition in search. That is, the more data from user queries a search engine collects, the more it learns to improve its service, which attracts still more users, advertisers and ad revenue. That flywheel, the suit says, is fueled by ever-increasing volumes of user data.
The government and states claim that Google locks in a huge data advantage through exclusive contracts and payments of more than $ 10 billion a year to Apple, Samsung and others to be the default search engine on smartphones and personal computer browsers.
A slender man with thinning gray hair, who spoke in clipped, slightly accented English, Mr. Nayak has a professorial air, and has taught graduate courses at Stanford. Much of his testimony was essentially a tutorial in search technology and its evolution, guided by a Google lawyer, Kenneth Smurzynski.
Mr. Nayak went through the long string of research advances at Google that have improved search quality, including developments in machine learning, deep learning, transformers and large language models -- the technology behind A.I.-driven chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.
The evolution Mr. Nayak traced was one in which innovations in language understanding have become increasingly important to gains in search quality, while the sheer volume of search queries has become less important.
At one point, Mr. Nayak cited a change where using a third less data brought "no meaningful decline in search quality." Clever software, he suggested, matters more than more data.
In testimony earlier this week, Michael Whinston, the Justice Department's economic expert, estimated that Google's exclusive deals blocked rivals from between a third and one half of all user search queries in the United States.
"The power of the defaults is very significant," said Mr. Whinston, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Whinston based his analysis on internal documents provided by Google, Microsoft, DuckDuckGo and other search services to determine his estimate of "foreclosure rate" as a result of the Google contracts.
In his cross-examination, John Schmidtlein, Google's lead lawyer, noted that exclusive contracts were common practice in the search business. But Mr. Whinston said the size of Google's deals was striking.
"When you see Google paying billions and billions and billions, there has to be a reason," he said. "That's the first thing that, as an economist, slaps me in the face."
In his testimony, Mr. Nayak discussed the investments Google has made in search, including amassing and constantly updating a vast index of the web, which includes hundreds of billions of documents, and employing an army of 16,000 human raters worldwide, who assess the relevance and reliability of search results.
Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, pushed Mr. Nayak to concede that Google's improvements in search depend on huge amounts of user data -- far more than its nearest rival, Microsoft's Bing.
Mr. Nayak acknowledged that data was crucial, but he stuck to Google's line of defense. "Bigger is not necessarily better," he said.

Full text: Best Buy recently said it would end DVD sales after the holiday season, and Netflix already shuttered its disc rentals. What does that mean for audiences?
If you were a child of the early 2000s, there's a good chance your Britney Spears fandom reached a fever pitch around 2002, when she was basking in the success of her third studio album, "Britney," and, months after that VMA python moment, she starred in her first feature film: "Crossroads."
The film, written by Shonda Rhimes, follows Spears's character and two friends, played by Zoe Saldaña and Taryn Manning, as they take a cross-country journey to find friendship, rock 'n' roll and a maternal relationship. There is singing on the open road. There are giggly convenience store trips. There is a boy.
I, turning 7 that year in Boise, Idaho, knew exactly what I wanted for my birthday: "Crossroads" on DVD, so I could watch it about 300 times.
Twenty years later, ahead of the release next week of Spears's memoir, "The Woman in Me," I wanted to rewatch my favorite childhood movie. But doing so turned out to be nearly impossible: "Crossroads" was not streaming on Netflix. Nor was it on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ or any of the other streaming services I searched.
Finally, I tracked down my original "Crossroads" DVD, but was confronted with a new problem: All of the devices I had once used to watch DVDs -- computers, TVs, gaming systems -- no longer supported them. I was stuck.
Top producers such as Sony, Samsung and LG once sold tens of millions of DVD players a year. In 2009, 88 percent of American households owned a DVD player, according to Nielsen. By early 2021 that number was just 56 percent, and lower for young people.
Gaming systems used to market themselves as all-in-one entertainment hubs, where families could play games and watch movies. But by 2020, the Xbox Series S was designed for "disc-free gaming." This year, a version of the PlayStation 5 excluded the disc drive. The last Apple MacBook that contained a disc drive was released in 2012.
That mirrors a decline in the disc market, which last week was dealt another blow when Best Buy confirmed that it would stop selling DVDs and Blu-ray discs after the holiday season. Netflix shuttered its DVD delivery service at the end of September.
DVDs, which entered the market in 1996 in Japan as a more compact and durable replacement for VHS tapes, reached their peak popularity in the mid-2000s, when movie studios began to report better sales numbers in the first week of DVD release than at the box office. Domestic sales began their decline just a few years later, during the Great Recession.
"To state the obvious, the way we watch movies and TV shows is much different today than it was decades ago," a spokesman for Best Buy wrote in an email to The New York Times.
In 2021, physical media accounted for just 8 percent of the U.S. entertainment market, or $ 2.8 billion, according to the Motion Picture Association. That's a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars consumers spent on DVDs in 2005 and 2006, around the market's peak.
That DVDs have largely fallen out of use is "a function of the march of time in connection with technology," said Jason E. Squire, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and host of "The Movie Business Podcast."
"The entertainment industry is filled with these kinds of landmarks in the map of history -- radio, television, home entertainment," he said.
Even with so many streaming services out there, some movies and television series still fall through the cracks, either because the services don't think there's an audience for them, or because licensing them would be too costly.
Streaming services often buy temporary rights to a film or show, leaving some titles unavailable for gaps of time while they are without a streaming home.
For example, "Friends," which had been on Netflix for five years and was estimated to be one of its most watched shows, was unavailable on streaming for about five months in between the time that Netflix's deal ended and the show's next platform, HBO Max, got up and running.
That's why, say, if you try to continue your journey through millennial nostalgia and look for the "Spice World" movie, you'll find it's not streamable in the United States -- but it is available on DVD. Which is great news, if you still have a DVD player.
For now, there are still plenty of customers who prefer to have their favorite movies reliably available as physical objects.
"We do get customers basically every single day still buying physical media," said Diana Hernandez, the deputy store manager at the Midtown Manhattan location of Bookoff, a secondhand store that sells DVDs. Some are nostalgia buyers; others are older and more comfortable with the format; and some don't have access to the internet.
"Looking back, people in the future will be saying, 'Yeah, well, this is another typical transition for the entertainment industry because of new technology,"' Mr. Squire said.
But we're not fully there yet. For those who want a backup of their favorite series or movie, other big retailers still carry them, and the secondhand market is strong in many cities: Bookoff, for example, is expanding to Long Island soon, Ms. Hernandez said.
As for my "Crossroads" journey, I managed to play my old copy on a DVD player I borrowed from a friend. (Spoiler alert: It holds up.)
And if you want a nostalgia trip of your own but don't have time to get your hands on a DVD player, good news: The movie is back in theaters for just two days next week to celebrate the release of Spears's memoir.

You Don't Need a Podcast to Sharpen Your Audio Projects: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The right hardware and software -- combined with time to learn -- can improve the soundtrack in your videos, podcasts and other creative endeavors.
Tired of tinny sound, echoes, inaudible dialogue or just bad audio in your home recording efforts? The popularity of social-media video and podcasts has led to a variety of affordable microphones, software and other tools for creating better-quality audio for personal projects. Even if you don't plan to start a podcast, understanding digital audio a bit more can make other tasks like recording Grandma's stories for a family-history archive or adding a narration track to your vacation videos sound much cleaner.
Here's an overview.
Hardware
Just about every laptop includes a microphone for videoconferencing and audio calls, but the fidelity can be lacking. An external microphone that plugs into your computer's USB port gives you much better sound quality. Logitech's Yeti ( $ 130) and the Shure MV5 ( $ 99) are two models recommended by Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times. (Setup is usually simple, but if you plug in the mic and nothing happens, make sure the new hardware is selected in the computer's sound input settings.)
Recording on a smartphone is standard for social-media video and audio. The phone's own headset microphone and earphones may work in some situations. If you need an external mic, say, to clip to an interview subject's shirt, you have options. RØDE makes phone-friendly external microphones, and Amazon sells a wide variety from different companies, most for less than $ 100. (Given the ever-changing ports on smartphones these days, make sure the mic you like will connect to your phone properly.)
Digital voice recorders -- with USB connectivity so you can transfer the recordings -- are another option, although the inexpensive models probably won't sound that great. Wirecutter recommends the $ 190 Sony UX560. The Zoom Corporation makes a number of hand-held recorders designed for professional use, including the $ 120 H1n-VP model.
A good pair of headphones can also come in handy during the recording and editing process, as can a quiet room free of echoes and background noise.
Software
For capturing quick recordings like spontaneous stories from toddlers, the app from your phone maker -- like Apple's Voice Memos, Google's Android Recorder and Samsung's Voice Recorder -- can work. Plenty of third-party recording apps are available as well, including the free Dolby On for Android and iOS.
Several podcasting companies have their own free or inexpensive apps for recording and editing audio, including Spotify for Podcasters (formerly the Anchor app) and Spreaker's podcast studio apps for Android and iOS. Another option, Podbean's audio recorder, has tools for recording remote guests. (And if starting a podcast intrigues you, The Times's Learning Network has a free guide to getting started.)
Riverside has tools for long-distance interviews; speakers can see each other in a video-chat window, and the software records each person directly on his or her phone or computer. The separate tracks are uploaded to a server after the session, so you don't have to worry about a slow internet connection causing glitchy audio during recording -- as can happen when directly recording audio or video conferences. Riverside ( $ 15 a month; a free trial is available) works in a browser and has its own mobile apps. Zencastr is a similar service for browsers but currently offers only an iOS app.
You can also record audio directly onto your computer. Subscription programs like Adobe Audition ( $ 21 a month) and Avid Pro Tools (starting at $ 10 a month) are designed for professionals, but if you're just starting out, free software can do the job. Audacity for Windows, Mac and Linux and Apple's GarageBand software for Mac and iOS are two options; Apple's free iMovie program can record voice-over narration for videos you have created.
Editing
When you open a sound file in an editing program, the audio data is visually displayed as a series of waveforms. Bigger, denser waves represent a lot of sound, while smaller waves or flat lines depict the quieter or silent parts of the recording. You edit the file by adjusting these waveforms.
Editing can be a complex process, but taking the time to work on your recordings allows you to whittle down a recorded conversation to just the important parts or clip out disruptions like the dog barking in the middle of your narration. Among other things, you can also adjust the volume of the speakers within the recording, add music or filter out persistent noise like the hum of an air-conditioner.
It may feel overwhelming, but you can find help and learning guides for most programs online. Audacity and GarageBand have instructions and tutorials geared toward beginners, and the latter even supplies pop-up tips to help you understand the program's controls.
Audio editing has a learning curve, but the availability of relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use hardware and software lets you dive in without breaking the bank -- and sound all the better for it.

Indiana City Will Get 2nd Electric Battery Plant
Stellantis, the Jeep maker, says it will build a second electric vehicle battery factory in Kokomo, Ind., that will create 1,400 new jobs.
The $ 3.2 billion joint venture plant with South Korea's Samsung SDI is to start production early in 2027.
Construction already is underway. The factory is scheduled to open early in 2025. A $ 3.1 billion plant announced in May of 2022 also is expected to create about 1,400 new jobs.
Kokomo, which is about 60 miles north of Indianapolis, made a compelling case to locate the second factory there, Stellantis chief operating officer for North America, Mark Stewart, said in a statement early Wednesday.
Indiana offered an incentive package of up to about $ 186.5 million in conditional tax credits, training grants and investments for the first Kokomo battery factory. The money would offset the costs of the plant's infrastructure, the state said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

New Chief at Walgreens; Pharmacy Workers Strike
Walgreens has named a new chief executive as pharmacy staff walked off the job this week over concerns that working conditions are putting employees and patients at risk.
Tim Wentworth, who formerly headed Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, was named chief effective Oct. 23.
The scale of the protest was unclear. Organizers on Tuesday estimated that more than 300 locations -- out of nearly 9,000 nationwide -- were affected by walkouts planned through Wednesday..
Many Walgreens workers aren't unionized and the employees who walked out are organizing online. They shared three main requests for the company, the organizer said: to improve transparency about shifting hours and schedules; to set aside training hours for new team members; and to adjust tasks and expectations at each location based on staffing levels.

Walmart Will Build Milk Plant in Georgia
Walmart announced Wednesday that it would build a $ 350 million milk processing plant in south Georgia, hiring nearly 400 people.
The Arkansas-based company said the plant would provide milk to more than 750 Walmart and Sam's Club stores in Georgia and neighboring states.
Bruce Heckman, Walmart's vice president of manufacturing, said in a statement that the company wanted to do more to ensure its milk supply, saying the company wanted to provide "high-quality milk for our customers that we can offer at the everyday low prices they rely on."
The company previously bought milk from other dairy companies
Critics have warned Walmart buys milk from only a handful of very large dairy farms, putting smaller farms under further pressure. Americans drank 22 percent less milk per person in 2021 than in 2011, the Agriculture Department says. ASSOCIATED PRESS

South Korean Chip Makers Get U.S. Waivers on Exports: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A government official in Seoul said the decision settled a trade issue that had threatened to impede the China operations of Samsung and SK Hynix.
The South Korean government said on Monday that the country's semiconductor manufacturers had secured waivers from U.S. government rules that threatened to limit their businesses in China.
At issue is the continuation of licenses granted last year by the U.S. Commerce Department to Samsung and SK Hynix, the two dominant South Korean chip makers. The licenses effectively suspended 2022 controls on exports of semiconductors and chip making equipment to China.
South Korea, an ally in America's chip war with China, relies heavily on its semiconductor sector for jobs and revenue. Samsung and SK Hynix dominate the global market for memory chips used in smartphones and laptops. Both produce chips in China.
To curb China's access to advanced chips that could power its military, Washington imposed restrictions on chip exports last October. It granted Samsung and SK Hynix one-year licenses that allowed them to continue to operate in China, but the looming expiration of those licenses set off concern in South Korea's semiconductor industry.
"This decision by the U.S. government means that the biggest trade issue for our semiconductor companies has been resolved," said Choi Sang-mok, senior presidential secretary for economic affairs for Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president.
In a statement, Samsung said the U.S. decision "significantly removed" uncertainty around its production of semiconductors in China.
SK Hynix said in a statement that it welcomed the U.S. government's decision, adding that it will "contribute to the stabilization of the global semiconductor supply chain."
The Commerce Department declined to comment.
The South Korean government said that unlike last year's one-year exemptions, these waivers did not have a definite end date. The industry has argued that short-term waivers deprived the companies of the certainty they need to make investment decisions and stay competitive.
"This kind of indefinite exemption is the most stable condition for companies, and only in this way can they consider restarting their investments in China," said Eric Chen, a research analyst at Digitimes Research, a market tracking company. "But in reality, we cannot avoid the political risks and the uncertainties of geopolitics."
It was not clear whether a similar waiver had been extended for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chip maker. TSMC, as the company is known, produces some of its less advanced logic chips in two plants in China. TSMC had also been granted a yearlong exemption from the export controls last October. The company was not immediately available for comment.

Making Connections, So Mothers Can Bury Sons: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A Times reporter hiked to a rugged region in Greece where the bodies of 18 asylum seekers were found. She returned, weeks later, with a man who had lost his brother.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On Aug. 23, I stood inside what was left of a burned shack on a hillside. The air was heavy with smoke, but after hours of reporting I had given up covering my mouth and nose.
The soles of my feet were hot inside the boots that had carried me on reporting assignments to Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and now Evros, the region in northeastern Greece that borders Turkey where, two days earlier, a wildfire began to rage.
It was 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and small flames were still flickering inside the hollowed-out trunks of ancient trees. I'd been traveling with Alexandros Avramidis, a photographer for Reuters, for safety.
We sank into silence and took in the sight: The sky was a deep, sickly orange. Plumes of smoke rolled over the hills nearby. Ash, broken tiles and a mug -- somehow, whole -- littered the ground beneath my feet. And there were bones -- fragments of a human tibia, though I didn't know it at the time.
I learned later that day that three asylum seekers, fleeing Syria for a better life in Europe, had burned to death where I had stood. I have been around death in my journalism career, but this was different. The decimation of the natural environment combined with the horrific deaths felt more profound, more total.
That morning I had rushed from Brussels, where I'm based, to this corner of Greece. The day before, the Greek authorities had announced the discovery of 18 charred bodies, presumed to be asylum seekers, as no one had declared missing persons locally. I wanted to report on the rapidly advancing fire -- it would soon be declared Europe's largest on record -- and to learn more about the victims.
My role at The New York Times is to cover the European Union -- mostly policy and politics -- but I am also a Greek national, and I have deep experience covering migration. I've spent most of the past six months writing about migrants being brutalized at Europe's borders, many dying in horrid circumstances. This trip was another data point in what has emerged as a pattern: Asylum seekers are facing growing hostility in their desperate search for a future and safety in Europe.
Dr. Pavlos Pavlidis, the coroner who provided crucial information for my article, told me he was optimistic that, despite the unrecognizable state of the charred bodies, the remains would be identified and returned to the victims' families.
Over the next few weeks, I worked closely with Karam Shoumali, a Syrian reporter who was indispensable in tracking down sources, as well as Dr. Jan Bikker, a Dutch forensic anthropologist. Six years ago, Dr. Bikker moved to Athens to help migrant families find lost loved ones, offering his services for free.
Together we tried to piece together information. As the only one of us who spoke Greek, I called every Greek governmental department involved to learn of any progress in the identification of the bodies.
At the morgue, I examined the few pieces of evidence that survived: a ring with a square black stone (I sketched a drawing in my notebook); a blackened men's wristwatch (no discernible markings); and two smartphones (one a white Samsung, the other melted beyond recognition). Some of those details were helpful in our quest to learn who the victims were.
Early on, we found Qusai al-Ahmad, a 31-year-old engineer from Aleppo, Syria, who had been living in Norway as a refugee and was looking for his younger brother Basel. He flew from Oslo to Athens to provide a DNA sample, which would prove key to determining the identities of the 18 people. Qusai knew that his brother had been traveling as part of a group of Syrian men and boys; he helped us build a list of people in the group. One was 13.
Over WhatsApp, Qusai shared videos and voice messages Basel had sent him, as well as locations that he had shared along his route. Qusai was in touch with other relatives who also started forwarding us information from their last communications with their loved ones. Many relatives were in denial that their families were dead -- some still are.
Dr. Bikker and I spoke daily about the latest information, as he fielded calls from other relatives who worried that their family members were among the 18. Those calls reminded me that my reporting was part of another effort: to work out what happened, so that mothers could one day bury their sons.
On Sept. 6, Qusai's DNA came back as a match to one of the 18 bodies. His text on the evening of Sept. 6 was laconic: "They told me today that my brother was among the victims. Tomorrow I am traveling to Greece."
When I met him at Athens International Airport two days later, he was with four of his cousins and Dr. Bikker. Together with the photographer Byron Smith, we got on a flight to Alexandroupolis, Evros's largest city.
Over the next 12 hours, I drove 150 miles around the region, translated from Greek to English for Qusai (his youngest cousin translated in Arabic) and the other way around.
Qusai asked me to take him where Basel had died. I thought about the half-hour hike up the hill (the area was inaccessible by road) and wondered if he'd make it.
But I had discounted the sheer energy unleashed by grief. Being in its presence was humbling. We made the hike.
Before heading home that evening, I accompanied Qusai to the fire department, where he needed to provide a copy of his passport to retrieve his brother's remains.
A lieutenant fire colonel there, Dimitris Lykidis, was friendly. He asked me to write down all of the relevant information in Greek. "I just want to make sure it's all 100 percent correct, so he doesn't need to come back here," he said.
For a fleeting moment, I felt proud that I'd kept it together all day.
It was only when Lt. Lykidis told me in Greek -- and I told Qusai's cousin Mahmoud in English, and Mahmoud told Qusai in Arabic -- that he had collected Basel's body from the hills, and Qusai and Lt. Lykidis embraced in tears, that I had to leave the room to regain my composure.
I still had a story to write.

Full text: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, is the government's biggest-name witness in its landmark antitrust case against Google.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, testified on Monday that Google's power in online search was so ubiquitous that even his company found it difficult to compete on the internet, becoming the government's highest-profile witness in its landmark antitrust trial against the search giant.
In more than three-and-a-half hours of testimony in federal court in Washington, Mr. Nadella was often direct and sometimes combative as he laid out how Microsoft could not overcome Google's use of multibillion-dollar deals to be the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.
The internet is really the "Google web," Mr. Nadella told the packed courtroom, adding that Google could now use its advantage and scale to build tools to dominate the emerging artificial intelligence industry.
The image of the chief executive of a leading tech rival -- Microsoft is one of the world's biggest public companies, valued at $ 2.4 trillion -- saying it could not easily fight Google was striking. Mr. Nadella's testimony underscored how entrenched Google has become in online search as the government seeks to prove that the company broke monopoly laws by forging anticompetitive deals to crush rivals.
Mr. Nadella's appearance on the witness stand in the case -- U.S. et al v. Google, which is the first monopoly trial of the modern internet era -- was also a sign that the bitter rivalry between Microsoft and Google continues unfettered. Over more than two decades, the two companies have battled over online search, mobile computing, web browsing and cloud computing, and dueled in multiple legal battles as both became ever more powerful. Now the companies are locked in an increasingly intense fight over A.I.
"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious," Mr. Nadella said.
Regulators around the world have been working to rein in the power and reach of Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon, arguing it broke antitrust laws by squeezing merchants on its site. The F.T.C. has also filed an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, claiming it snuffed out nascent rivals, and the Justice Department has sued Google in a second case over its control of online advertising.
The 10-week Google trial is being closely watched as a referendum on whether the government can slow down Silicon Valley's biggest companies. A Google victory could be a major rebuke of regulators who say the tech giants have too much sway over their customers, partners and start-up competitors.
At the heart of the government's case is the contention that Google illegally cemented its monopoly in online search by paying to be the default search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox, as well as on the home screen of smartphones. Google has argued that the default positions are not overwhelmingly powerful and that users can switch to a new search engine if they like.
But in court, Mr. Nadella said that argument was "bogus" because users generally don't change their default search engine, even if they can do so.
"You get up in the morning, you brush you teeth and you search on Google," he said, later adding that the arrangement between Google and Apple in particular was "oligopolistic."
Mr. Nadella said Microsoft had tried to win deals for the default positions on browsers and smartphones for Bing, its own search engine. But it had not been very successful, he said.
Microsoft introduced Bing to compete against Google in 2009. At the time, Microsoft began an aggressive public relations campaign against Google and both companies lobbied against the other with regulators in Europe and the United States.
In 2016, the public mudslinging seemed to come to an end with Mr. Nadella and Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who were both new to their roles, declaring a détente. The rivalry had become a distraction, they said, and they had different priorities.
The testimony from Mr. Nadella showed their rivalry had continued. John Schmidtlein, Google's lead litigator, said in his opening statement that the case was "really all about Microsoft."
Last week, other Microsoft executives such as Jonathan Tinter, a business development executive, and Mikhail Parakhin, an advertising executive, testified about the search business. Mr. Tinter said that Google used its scale to make its search engine the default on Apple and Samsung phones, stifling competitors like Microsoft.
On Monday, Mr. Schmidtlein sought to undermine Mr. Nadella's testimony by suggesting that Microsoft's failure to compete with Google was the result of an inferior product and a lack of investment.
Mr. Schmidtlein hammered Mr. Nadella with questions about instances in which Bing had been the default on mobile phones, only for users to switch back to Google. He noted that Mr. Nadella had referred to Google as "dominant," and asked him if he could substitute for the word "popular."
Mr. Nadella said that whether you "call it popular or dominant," Microsoft was still competing against Google's massive market share.
"This testimony paints Google as a bully that everyone's afraid of," said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, adding that it suggested that Google's motivation for signing exclusive search deals was not "merely sharing revenue for a valuable product with a distributor like Apple, but it is primarily to keep competitors like Bing at bay."
While much of the trial has revolved around Google's past behavior, Mr. Nadella shifted some of the focus to the future and A.I. Microsoft has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot, which can now use Bing as a search default. Google has begun offering its own A.I.-powered chatbot, Bard.
Mr. Nadella said he was worried that Google would strike deals to exclusively use content online to train its A.I. tools.
"When I am meeting with publishers now, they are saying, 'Google's going to write this check to us, and it's going to be exclusive and you have to match it,"' he said.
Mr. Nadella said that would prime Google to dominate the next generation of online search, too.
"My main worry now, other than my early exuberance about an opportunity that we may have here, is: Is this going to be even more of a nightmare to make progress in search?" he said.
At the end of Mr. Nadella's appearance, a Justice Department lawyer asked why he thought Google paid Apple so much money to be the default search engine on Apple's web browser Safari.
"That's a great question," Mr. Nadella said. "I would love an opportunity to sort of not have them pay -- maybe on behalf of the Google shareholders."

WASHINGTON — Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, testified Monday that Google’s power in online search was so ubiquitous that even his company found it difficult to compete on the internet, becoming the government’s highest-profile witness in its landmark antitrust trial against the search giant.
In more than 3 1/2 hours of testimony in federal court in Washington, Nadella was often direct and sometimes combative as he laid out how Microsoft could not overcome Google’s use of multibillion-dollar deals to be the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.

U.S.-China Chip War Tests Critical Ally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: South Korea's vital semiconductor sector depends on China. A deadline looms for how it could be affected by U.S. efforts to control China's tech advance.
Samsung and SK Hynix, the semiconductor titans of South Korea, have spent over $ 52 billion to build up their operations in China. Business with China has long made up a sizable portion of their sales.
But the ties between South Korea's chip companies and China are under strain from geopolitics.
South Korea, which relies heavily on its semiconductor sector for jobs and revenue, is wedged between China and the United States, South Korea's longstanding ally, in their trade war over technology.
To curb China's access to advanced chips that could power its military, Washington has escalated steps to control the sale of such technologies. The Biden administration imposed restrictions last October, raising alarms in Seoul and setting off furious lobbying in Washington to try to minimize damage to South Korea's semiconductor industry.
A one-year waiver from the export rules that the companies received in mid-October is set to expire soon. While a new waiver is widely expected, uncertainty surrounds how long it might last.
"Geopolitical issues have become the biggest risk for companies to manage," South Korea's president, Yoon Suk-yeol, said in June, speaking at a meeting of government officials and business executives about a national semiconductor strategy. "Companies cannot resolve this problem alone," he said, calling the competition over chips an "all-out war."
Manufacturing semiconductors requires supply chains that cross national borders, and the efforts to impose new rules on the industry have tested commercial alliances in Asia, Europe and the United States. But few countries have wrestled with the potential economic disruption from trade restrictions as much as South Korea.
Not only is China a big customer of chips made in South Korea, but both Samsung and SK Hynix have major production facilities in China.
Semiconductors account for 20 percent of South Korea's exports. Samsung and SK Hynix have long dominated the market for memory chips, which are used in smartphones and laptops to store data. Samsung sold 36 percent of all memory chips and SK Hynix 25 percent as of June, according to data calculated from TrendForce, a market research firm.
Over the past decade, China has received more than half -- at one point almost 67 percent -- of South Korean chip exports. That number dropped to 55 percent last year, according to a calculation of South Korean government data by The New York Times.
Samsung does not provide semiconductor sales numbers for China. Partly because of a drop in demand for chips and China's economic slowdown, two of the company's chip-related subsidiaries in China that disclosed their financial information showed a 35 percent fall in sales of chips and displays in the first half of this year.
SK Hynix's share of revenue from China peaked at nearly 47 percent in 2019. It shrank to 27 percent last year, still an important part of the company's business.
"To give up the large market that is China? We won't be able to recover," Chey Tae-won, SK Hynix's chairman, said at a news conference in July.
One of the most outspoken South Korean politicians on the issue is Yang Hyang-ja, a lawmaker in the National Assembly and a former Samsung executive. She called the country "a victim" in the trade dispute and proposed tax cuts to help chip makers. Her bill, the K-Chips Act, was passed in March.
"We are taking a direct hit," she said.
Samsung uses its facilities in China to produce 40 percent of its NAND chips, one of two kinds of memory chips that help devices store data. SK Hynix produces 30 percent of its NAND chips in China and almost half of its DRAM chips, which enable short-term storage for personal computers and servers.
The companies' exposure to China is a challenge, said Avril Wu, a senior research vice president at TrendForce. "It's not easy to withdraw, yet continuing to invest further is unwise, as nobody knows what might happen in the future," she said.
Samsung said in a statement that its investments were made to address the needs of global customers and other demands.
Samsung and SK Hynix are not alone in facing uncertainty caused by the China-U.S. tensions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest chip maker, is also waiting to hear from the U.S. Department of Commerce on the fate of its waivers to the export controls.
The Commerce Department declined to comment but referred to a statement by Don Graves, deputy commerce secretary, who said during a trip to South Korea last week that the United States would "do everything" it could to ensure that companies could continue their businesses.
For Samsung and SK Hynix, a waiver of a year or less could slow the companies' development, experts said.
Advances in chip making move swiftly, and companies must invest in equipment, parts and research to stay competitive. The bulky facilities that manufacture chips cost tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars.
"Rather than wondering what will happen year by year, extending the waiver by two to three years at a time would make people more at ease," said Lim Hyung-kyu, a retired Samsung executive who worked at the company for over three decades as an engineer and its chief technology officer.
No matter the outcome of the waiver decision in Washington, the U.S. export controls and inclination to contain China's tech supply chain could force Samsung and SK Hynix to change their business strategies in China.
One possibility is that the companies could use their factories in China to serve customers in China, said Song Myung-sup, a semiconductor analyst at Hi Investment & Securities. They could also shift the focus of their production on less advanced products, he said, to avoid the U.S. restrictions.
Already, the uncertainties surrounding the curbs, as well as a short-term slump in demand for chips, have stalled the construction of a SK Hynix plant in the Chinese city of Dalian, Mr. Song said. Neither SK Hynix nor Samsung has plans at the moment to invest more in China, he said.
SK Hynix said that the construction of its Dalian factory was going as planned but that it had reduced its previously outlined capital spending this year.
In turn, the South Korean government has said it will expand its domestic chip-making capacity over the long term by creating a semiconductor "mega-cluster" in Yongin, a 40-minute drive from a gigantic Samsung chip manufacturing campus. Samsung has said it will invest $ 228 billion over the next two decades.
Separately, SK Hynix vowed last year to make a $ 11 billion investment in a plant in South Korea that it has started to build.
The restrictions on business with China and promises of U.S. government incentives are also spurring more investment in the United States. Samsung said it would spend $ 17 billion on a facility in Taylor, Texas, while SK Hynix has pledged $ 15 billion for an American chip-packaging plant and a research center, and is in search of a location for the plant.
For South Korea, there is the risk of economic retaliation from China for aligning itself too closely with the United States.
South Korea waited almost a year before reluctantly joining an initiative proposed by President Biden last year to form a semiconductor "Chip 4" alliance with the United States, Japan and Taiwan.
Ms. Yang, the South Korean lawmaker, said the U.S.-Chinese tech rivalry was destined to change the global supply chain for chip making. South Korea must accept that reality, she said.
But she worries about the pressure it will put on South Korea, using a common idiom that described her country in relation to two superpowers. "The shrimp's back may burst in a fight between whales," she said.

Google Trial Is Shrouded In Secrecy: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Efforts to seal testimony have increasingly raised questions as the federal antitrust case enters its third week in court.
In a court filing last month, Google argued that it needed its privacy in an antitrust trial that would spotlight its dominance in online search.
"Once commercially sensitive information is disclosed in open court, the resulting harm to the party's competitive standing cannot be undone," the internet giant wrote to the judge presiding over the case.
It was part of a pattern of Google's pushing to limit transparency in the federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era. Before opening statements began on Sept. 12, Google filed 35 motions and responses in the case -- nearly two-thirds of them sealed, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Now as the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, enters its third week in court, it is shaping up to be perhaps the most secretive antitrust trial of the last few decades. Not only has Google argued for the landmark trial to be largely closed off to the public, but so have other companies that are involved, such as Apple and Microsoft. Apple even fought to quash subpoenas, describing them as "unduly burdensome," to get its executives out of giving testimony.
The upshot is that last week, more than half of the testimony in the trial was given behind closed doors, according to one analysis. When one witness, the chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo, testified on Thursday, he spoke on the stand for nearly five hours -- of which just one hour was open to the public. At the judge's request, the Justice Department, which is one of the plaintiffs, has also removed its presentations and evidence from the open web.
The lack of transparency continued this week as a top Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified on Tuesday about a crucial search agreement that Apple struck with Google. The federal government has accused Google of illegally using agreements with companies like Apple to maintain its monopoly in online search and to crush rivals.
Late Monday, Apple petitioned the court to have Mr. Cue's testimony on the details of its Google agreement take place behind closed doors because it was concerned the Justice Department's lawyer could "blurt out" confidential information. Questioning Mr. Cue in open court posed "a substantial risk" of revealing Apple's business relationships and negotiations, the company's lawyers wrote.
When the trial resumed on Tuesday, it began with 45 minutes of closed discussions over confidentiality -- including how to handle documents and business details during Mr. Cue's testimony. Then Mr. Cue testified for about four hours, more than half of which was closed to the public. During his open testimony, Mr. Cue spoke in generalities about how Apple teamed up with Google and revealed few details about the contracts, while the Justice Department presented few exhibits.
"The secrecy surrounding the proceedings is unprecedented in antitrust trials," Diane Rulke, an organizational behavior professor at Carnegie Mellon, said in an interview. Four other antitrust experts interviewed by The Times also described the proceedings as unusually opaque, adding that the government's antitrust case against Microsoft more than 24 years ago was far more accessible to the public and the press.
Google and the Justice Department declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
The secrecy has angered legal and antitrust experts. In addition, Digital Content Next, a trade group and Google critic that represents the business interests of media companies including The Times, filed a court motion to make testimony from witnesses public and to provide access to trial exhibits and emails. The judge, Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has not responded to the motion, according to the trade group's head, Jason Kint.
Randal C. Picker, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an interview that the public should be able to monitor and scrutinize arguments from the case in real time, to hold the parties accountable.
"The public should be looking at this -- staring at Google and staring at D.O.J.," he said. "These are both very powerful actors here."
But opening up the trial appears unlikely. Judge Mehta said in a pretrial hearing last month that he was not a businessperson and indicated that he was amenable to companies' arguments that they needed to protect the details of their businesses.
"I am not anyone that understands the industry and the markets in the way that you do," Judge Mehta said. "And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it's going to cause competitive harm."
The efforts to cloak the information in the case have been longstanding.
Since the case was filed in October 2020, Google and others have argued that the court should keep financial transactions, business relationships and internal affairs out of public view, driven by a desire to avoid embarrassing disclosures and competitive corporate secrets. Google's partners like Samsung, and rivals such as DuckDuckGo, have also sought to shield some of their documents and executives' testimony from the public.
In one legal filing, Microsoft asked the court to consult it on confidentiality throughout the trial.
The right of public access "is not absolute," Microsoft wrote to the court. The company added that the disclosure of "its business strategies, internal deliberations and negotiations" would harm it.
Microsoft declined to comment.
The closed-door nature of the trial was on full display on Thursday when the Justice Department called John Giannandrea, a senior executive at Apple and a former head of search at Google, to testify on the importance of scale for search engines and his guidance on Apple's search efforts.
Even before Mr. Giannandrea began answering questions, the Justice Department's lead litigator, Kenneth Dintzer, said Apple had expressed a strong preference for the testimony to be in closed session on nearly every topic. Then less than 15 minutes after Mr. Giannandrea took the stand, Judge Mehta called an end to the day.
The Apple executive returned to the stand on Friday morning, which started in closed session. More than four hours later, Mr. Giannandrea left the courtroom with lawyers for Apple without the proceedings being opened.
Matt Stoller, the research director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an antimonopoly think tank, said the secrecy "undercuts the legitimacy of our legal system." His group tried and failed to persuade the court to open a teleconference line for the trial.
Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who worked on antitrust policies in the Biden administration and who has contributed opinion essays to The Times, said government lawyers sometimes agreed to seal information to speed a case along.
"These things are warfare," he said. "You want to get the information, and you don't internalize the cost to the public or reporters."
But Mr. Wu noted that there was an inherent irony in Google's push to limit disclosure.
"It's ironic for a company to suck up all our information and know everything about us and we can't know a damn thing about them," he said. "We deserve a better look at them."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eddy Cue, a longtime executive at the company, said Apple's multibillion-dollar deals with Google were driven by quality, not money.
Apple's top deal maker on Tuesday defended his company's favoritism of Google on iPhones, a pivotal collaboration that has shaped the modern tech industry and is at the center of a federal antitrust trial against the search giant.
Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in Washington that Google's placement as the default search option on the Safari browser across Apple devices was motivated by quality.
"I didn't think at the time, or today, that there was anybody out there who is anywhere near as good as Google at searching," said Mr. Cue, who was called to testify by the Justice Department. "Certainly there wasn't a valid alternative."
The Justice Department has accused Google of illegally locking in its monopoly through deals to make its search option the default on Apple, Samsung, Firefox and other platforms. Those partnerships squashed competitors that struggled to get their products in front of consumers, the Justice Department argues.
The Justice Department and dozens of states that brought the lawsuit argue that Google used the default deals as a "powerful strategic weapon" to block competitors and lock in its dominance in the search market.
No other deal has been as significant to the government's case as a two-decades-long partnership between Google and Apple. The partnership has been worth $ 10 billion a year for Apple, which makes up more than 50 percent of the smartphone market in the United States, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm.
Mr. Cue's testimony has been highly anticipated. While the case is focused on Google, the Justice Department has viewed Apple as a secondary player and the foremost example of how Google has used its deep pockets to maintain its power over the global search market. Should the judge rule in the government's favor, it could cost Google and Apple billions of dollars.
The trial is the first monopolization case brought by the government in more than two decades, part of a crackdown on big tech by regulators appointed by President Biden. On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
The Justice Department is also suing Google for illegally monopolizing the ad tech market. And the F.T.C. is suing Meta for using its dominance in social media to kill off competition.
The U.S. government's case against Google promised to lift a veil off blockbuster deals between the most powerful global companies, giving the public a rare glimpse into business deals that have determined how consumers access information online.
Apple and Google began their partnership in search in 2002. In 2016, Mr. Cue took over renegotiations of the deal. The 30-plus-year Apple veteran had risen to be the company's top deal maker, overseeing agreements with record labels for Apple Music, banks for Apple Pay and Hollywood studios for Apple TV+.
In 2016, Mr. Cue met with Sundar Pichai, who was then a year into his role as Google's chief executive, to renegotiate for a higher percentage from their revenue-sharing arrangement.
Despite some back and forth on financial terms of a new deal, Mr. Cue said negotiations were never tested to the point that the companies would back down from their arrangement.
"It was in Google's best interest and our best interest to get the deal done," Mr. Cue said, adding that the company had never considered creating its own search engine to compete with Google.
"We provided great customers to Google -- they did an amazing job on the search engine side," he said.
The Justice Department disclosed in questioning that the deal in 2016 also included a provision for the companies to defend the agreement should it come under any regulatory challenges. Mr. Cue said that the provision was written in by lawyers for Apple and Google, and that he believed it pertained to an antitrust investigation in the European Union of Google.
But few other details were revealed in Mr. Cue's testimony. Much of the trial, which is expected to last until November, has been held in closed sessions and most exhibits have been sealed. Mr. Cue testified for about four hours, of which more than half was closed to the public.
Apple fought against the testimony of executives, saying that Mr. Cue and others had already been deposed ahead of the hearing and that business contracts under scrutiny were highly sensitive.

‘Unprecedented’ Secrecy in Google Trial as Tech Giants Push to Limit Disclosures

In a court filing last month, Google argued that it needed its privacy in an antitrust trial that would spotlight its dominance in online search.
“Once commercially sensitive information is disclosed in open court, the resulting harm to the party’s competitive standing cannot be undone,” the internet giant wrote to the judge presiding over the case.
It was part of a pattern of Google’s pushing to limit transparency in the federal government’s first monopoly trial of the modern internet era. Before opening statements began Sept. 12, Google filed 35 motions and responses in the case — nearly two-thirds of them sealed, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Now as the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, enters its third week in court, it is shaping up to be perhaps the most secretive antitrust trial of the past few decades. Not only has Google argued for the landmark trial to be largely closed off to the public, but so have other companies that are involved, such as Apple and Microsoft. Apple even fought to quash subpoenas, describing them as “unduly burdensome,” to get its executives out of giving testimony.
The upshot is that last week, more than half of the testimony in the trial was given behind closed doors, according to one analysis. When one witness, the CEO of search engine DuckDuckGo, testified Thursday, he spoke on the stand for nearly five hours — of which just one hour was open to the public. At the judge’s request, the Justice Department, which is one of the plaintiffs, has also removed its presentations and evidence from the open web.
The lack of transparency continued this week as a top Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified Tuesday about a crucial search agreement that Apple struck with Google. The federal government has accused Google of illegally using agreements with companies like Apple to maintain its monopoly in online search and to crush rivals.
Late Monday, Apple petitioned the court to have Cue’s testimony on the details of its Google agreement take place behind closed doors because it was concerned that the Justice Department’s lawyer could “blurt out” confidential information. Questioning Cue in open court posed “a substantial risk” of revealing Apple’s business relationships and negotiations, the company’s lawyers wrote.
When the trial resumed Tuesday, it began with 45 minutes of closed discussions over confidentiality — including how to handle documents and business details during Cue’s testimony. Then Cue testified for about four hours, more than half of which was closed to the public. During his open testimony, Cue spoke in generalities about how Apple teamed up with Google and revealed few details about the contracts, while the Justice Department presented few exhibits.
“The secrecy surrounding the proceedings is unprecedented in antitrust trials,” Diane Rulke, an organizational behavior professor at Carnegie Mellon, said in an interview. Four other antitrust experts interviewed by the Times also described the proceedings as unusually opaque, adding that the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft more than 24 years ago was far more accessible to the public and the press.
Google and the Justice Department declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
The secrecy has angered legal and antitrust experts. In addition, Digital Context Next, a trade group and Google critic that represents the business interests of media companies including the Times, filed a court motion to make testimony from witnesses public and to provide access to trial exhibits and emails. The judge, Amit Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has not responded to the motion, according to the trade group’s head, Jason Kint.
Randal Picker, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an interview that the public should be able to monitor and scrutinize arguments from the case in real time, to hold the parties accountable.
“The public should be looking at this — staring at Google and staring at DOJ,” he said. “These are both very powerful actors here.”
But opening up the trial appears unlikely. Mehta said in a pretrial hearing last month that he was not a businessperson and indicated that he was amenable to companies’ arguments that they needed to protect the details of their businesses.
“I am not anyone that understands the industry and the markets in the way that you do,” Mehta said. “And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it’s going to cause competitive harm.”
The efforts to cloak the information in the case have been long-standing.
Since the case was filed in October 2020, Google and others have argued that the court should keep financial transactions, business relationships and internal affairs out of public view, driven by a desire to avoid embarrassing disclosures and competitive corporate secrets. Google’s partners like Samsung, and rivals such as DuckDuckGo, have also sought to shield some of their documents and executives’ testimony from the public.
In one legal filing, Microsoft asked the court to consult it on confidentiality throughout the trial.
The right of public access “is not absolute,” Microsoft wrote to the court. The company added that the disclosure of “its business strategies, internal deliberations and negotiations” would harm it.
Microsoft declined to comment.
The closed-door nature of the trial was on full display Thursday when the Justice Department called John Giannandrea, a senior executive at Apple and a former head of search at Google, to testify on the importance of scale for search engines and his guidance on Apple’s search efforts.
Even before Giannandrea began answering questions, the Justice Department’s lead litigator, Kenneth Dintzer, said Apple had expressed a strong preference for the testimony to be in closed session on nearly every topic. Then less than 15 minutes after Giannandrea took the stand, Mehta called an end to the day.
The Apple executive returned to the stand Friday morning, which started in closed session. More than four hours later, Giannandrea left the courtroom with lawyers for Apple without the proceedings being opened.
Matt Stoller, the research director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly think tank, said the secrecy “undercuts the legitimacy of our legal system.” His group tried and failed to persuade the court to open a teleconference line for the trial.
Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who worked on antitrust policies in the Biden administration and who has contributed opinion essays to the Times, said government lawyers sometimes agreed to seal information to speed a case along.
“These things are warfare,” he said. “You want to get the information, and you don’t internalize the cost to the public or reporters.”
But Wu noted that there was an inherent irony in Google’s push to limit disclosure.
“It’s ironic for a company to suck up all our information and know everything about us and we can’t know a damn thing about them,” he said. “We deserve a better look at them.”

Switching Search Is Not as Simple As Google Asserts: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Google says a change takes just a few steps, but a panel of designers found otherwise. The issue is at the heart of a federal antitrust trial.
Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it's convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don't like it, it's simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That's essentially the crux of Google's defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial -- the federal government's first such case in the modern internet era -- that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, like smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, like Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
But Google has argued that it's easy for people to change their search engine -- just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
On a Mac's Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google's instructions and also shared the company's guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It's hard to switch -- and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
"God help me, I'm dead," Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: "Most people will just stick with it."
I had similar takeaways. Here's what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it's more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn't immediately appear on the screen. It's buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Mr. Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go -- to hop on a bus, for instance.
"You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory," he said.
On a Mac
With just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service -- by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
That's much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button -- it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.
More problematic is that switching search engines can be confusing, because the steps are inconsistent between Safari on an iPhone and Safari on a Mac, said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who oversees an engineering leadership program.
"Overall, the average person would probably struggle with this," he said.
Mr. Selker said a better design would have been to make changing the search engine more "in your face," like a prompt asking users to choose a search engine when opening the browser.
"It has to make you aware it's there until you've dismissed it," he said.
On Android
On an Android phone, Google said, it takes one long press on the search bar to prompt the Remove button to appear. Users can then tap on it to remove the Google search bar widget from the home screen.
This example is especially flawed. First, Google's steps to remove the search bar widget work on some Samsung phones, but they do not work across all Android devices. On Google's Pixel phones, for example, when a user long presses on the search bar, no Remove option appears.
Most important, removing the search widget deletes a shortcut to the Google search bar on the home screen, but it does not change the search engine in an Android web browser. Changing to a different search engine requires a different set of steps. Similar to the path on iPhones, it's a four-step process that involves opening the browser and changing its settings.
The default option
The overarching lesson from the government's antitrust trial against Google is that when companies make arrangements to become a default option, they are aware you will probably stick with the status quo because switching to an alternative requires awareness and effort, said Mr. Brignull, the author of "Deceptive Patterns: Exposing the Tricks Tech Companies Use to Control You."
Google said in a statement that it was easy for people to change their default search engine on Android devices and Apple's Safari. The company added that on Windows computers, which require a long process to switch from Bing as the default search engine in Microsoft's Edge browser, the overwhelming majority of people chose Google as their search engine.
With all of that in mind, and the instructions now in front of you, you can try other search engines. If it turns out that you prefer Google anyway, at least it will be your decision -- not Google's.

Full text: Gabriel Weinberg of the search engine DuckDuckGo was the first competitor to testify in the Justice Department's antitrust trial against Google.
The chief executive of DuckDuckGo on Thursday described Google as a monopoly that has hurt competition and consumers through its scale and command over the tech industry, in the first testimony of a rival in the federal trial of the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against the search giant.
Gabriel Weinberg of DuckDuckGo said that Google's deals to make its search engine the default on browsers and other platforms blocked its ability to compete effectively. DuckDuckGo, with only 2.5 percent of the U.S. market for search, tried to negotiate with other companies to make its privacy-focused search engine a default. But it was continually turned down because of Google's deals with those tech partners, he said.
"We ultimately decided after three years of trying this that it was a quixotic exercise because of the contracts," Mr. Weinberg said.
The trial of the Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Google is the government's first monopoly case in two decades, and it is expected to sweep in many of the biggest tech companies. Executives at Apple, Microsoft and Verizon are also expected to testify in the trial, which could reshape how consumers get information online.
The Justice Department has argued that Google has violated competition laws by maintaining its monopoly through the deals that make it the default access point in users' search for online information across multiple platforms.
Google has defended its business partnerships, saying the companies, including Apple and Samsung, have chosen to make Google the default on their devices because of Google's superior quality. Google said consumers can easily adjust settings on their browsers to change search engine defaults to alternatives like DuckDuckGo.
Mr. Weinberg said on Thursday that any switches to default search engines take far more steps than Google says.
"It's all just way harder than it needs to be," he said.
Mr. Weinberg didn't disclose details of business negotiations in public proceedings but continued his testimony in a closed session on day nine of the antitrust trial.
Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has closed many hours of testimonies at the request of Google and other companies that have argued to keep documents and testimony of sensitive business matters private.

The Google Antitrust Trial Is Really About the Future of A.I.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Google antitrust trial, which began last week, is ostensibly focused on the past -- on a series of deals that Google made with other companies over the past two decades. The prosecution in the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, contends that Google illegally spent billions of dollars paying off Samsung and Apple to prevent anyone else from gaining a foothold in the market for online search.
But the true focus of the trial, like that of the Federal Trade Commission's coming trial of Facebook's parent company, Meta, on monopolization charges, is on the future. For the verdict will effectively establish the rules governing tech competition for the next decade, including the battle over commercialized artificial intelligence, as well as newer technologies we cannot yet envision.
The history of antitrust prosecutions shows this again and again: Loosening the grip of a controlling monopolist may not always solve the problem at hand (here, an online search monopoly). But it can open up closed markets, shake up the industry and spark innovation in unexpected areas. If Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, decides this case correctly, he'll be helping the entire tech world and the American economy more broadly.
Consider the antitrust lawsuit that led to the breakup of AT&T's telephone monopoly in 1984. At the time, prosecutors were focused on lowering the pricing of long-distance telephone calls and giving consumers greater choice. But more important and less anticipated, the breakup helped to jump-start the internet revolution of the 1990s, in part by making it easier for companies to conduct business over phone lines and for customers to connect modems to them.
Or consider IBM's monopoly on mainframe computing, which was challenged by private and public antitrust suits in the 1960s and '70s. At the time, a chief concern was the use of "vaporware" tactics in the mainframe market, which affected a now-long-dead company called the Control Data Corporation. But what matters today is that IBM, out of fear that it would be broken up, unbundled its software from its hardware, which created a market for software sold as a separate product -- spawning, over time, what is now a multi-trillion-dollar industry. The suit also weakened IBM at the very time that personal computers were emerging, benefiting tiny upstarts like Apple and Microsoft.
As this history suggests, it's unlikely that we know exactly what new forms of computing a verdict against Google would make room for. The path of technological evolution is not predictable. But we do know that monopolies tend to stifle innovation and keep too much for themselves, and that forcing a monopolist to back off yields fruit.
The story of Google's own creation is another good example. Google began as a small start-up with a great product, but it was also a beneficiary of federal government intervention. Google began its operations reliant on Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, which had a roughly 95 percent market share in the early 2000s. And Microsoft was running its own search engine on Internet Explorer, then called MSN Search (later renamed Bing). Fortunately for Google, Microsoft had just been put through the wringer by the Justice Department, whose antitrust lawsuit nearly led to a breakup of the company. In the end, Google beat Bing in part because it had a better product -- but also because it wasn't facing the nasty Microsoft of the 1990s, but rather a weakened and chastened Microsoft operating under federal oversight.
Today Google is both interested in and threatened by the large language model technology of companies like OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT. Google has spent many billions of dollars on A.I. research, including developing its own chatbot, Bard, and recently rushed to incorporate dozens of A.I. features into its products. But as a giant, entrenched company, Google has the disadvantage of needing to protect its existing revenue streams and keep its investors, customers and advertisers happy. It has a strong incentive to make sure that A.I. doesn't turn into something that disrupts or destroys its current business.
At the trial in Washington last week, the prosecution (which includes the federal as well as state governments) made clear that Google leveraged its money and power over the past decade to stifle competition, paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars to make Google the default search setting for their phones. Apple also agreed to stay out of Google's business: handling search queries.
That's why Judge Mehta should force Google to sell off its Chrome browser (which has a roughly 63 percent market share) and ban the company's "pay for default" deals with the operating systems for Apple and Android phones. Otherwise, Google will surely be tempted to use its money and control over Chrome to ensure that any rivals in the field of A.I. aren't as successful with their products as Google is with its own.
The cases against Google and Meta are, in effect, a distinctively American form of industrial policy. Many countries choose to subsidize their tech monopolists, but the United States has shown that undermining a monopolist's dominance can be a better alternative. Doing so also serves to check what is perhaps the least accountable form of power in the United States, a power that at times feels like a threat to the idea of rule by the people. These are some of the reasons that the Biden administration, for which I worked for two years on tech competition policy, has made a robust effort to rein in the power of big tech.
Ultimately, antitrust law's most important function is to rebalance economic power, taming the excesses that are the inevitable consequences of a capitalist economy. The tech industries are prone to monopoly, yet as history suggests, they can be extraordinarily generative when given the right nudge. The point of the Google prosecution is not to hurt Google but to force it to make way for the next generation of technologists and their dreams.

Data Edge Of Google Is Key Issue: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The government states that data is "oxygen for a search engine" and that Google's anticompetitive behavior has given it a data fortress. Google says innovation explains its success.
The federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era is less than a week old, but already a central character has emerged: data. Its role, its use and its power are key issues in the Justice Department's case against Google.
The government claims that Google bribed and bullied smartphone producers like Apple and Samsung and the browser maker Mozilla to be their featured search engine, funneling far more data to Google and cutting off competitors.
Data, the government says, drives the flywheel of Google's success. Each search query adds data, which improves search results, attracting more users who generate still more data and advertising revenue. And Google's ever-growing data advantage, the government asserts, is an insurmountable barrier for rivals.
Data is "oxygen for a search engine," Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, declared in his opening statement on Tuesday.
The government's case is not that Google violated the law in becoming a search giant. Instead, the government claims that after Google became dominant, the company broke the law with its tactics to defend its monopoly. Contracts with industry partners to be their default search engine were the weapon -- exclusive deals that froze out rivals, the government claims. So Google is now protected from competition behind a fortress built with data.
Google replies that the government's case is an artifice of misleading theory unsupported by the facts. The government has chosen to "ignore inescapable truths," John Schmidtlein, Google's lead lawyer, asserted in his opening statement.
Those truths, according to Google, are that the company holds its leading position in search because of its technical innovation. It competes with others for default-placement contracts and wins mainly because Google is the best search engine. Those contracts, Google argues, help reduce prices for smartphones and benefit consumers.
The government, Google insists, is overstating the importance of data. In a brief filed this month, the company stated, "Google does not deny that user data can improve search quality, but Google will show that there are diminishing returns to scale."
The trial resumes this week with the Justice Department continuing to present its case. The first witness scheduled to testify on Monday is Brian Higgins, an executive at Verizon who oversees mobile device and customer marketing. The trial is scheduled to run for 10 weeks. A ruling from Judge Amit P. Mehta will come next year.
Google holds 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States, while Microsoft's Bing is a far-distant rival, with less than 5 percent. The difference, Google says, is explained by the smarts of its engineers, not the size of its trove of rich data.
To make its point, Google will call an expert witness, Edward Fox, a computer scientist at Virginia Tech. Professor Fox has conducted a "data reduction experiment" on Google's behalf to estimate how much Google's search quality would decline if it used far less data -- roughly the amount available to Bing. The result, according to Google's filing, was that the data difference explains only part of the gap in search quality between Google and Microsoft.
Google's public messaging on that issue has been consistent over the years. But the government claims that the messaging has been deceitful. In his opening statement, Mr. Dintzer said Google had "misled the public about the importance of data."
To try to show the deception, the government introduced emails among senior Google employees, sparring over that point, as evidence last week. Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, was questioned about defaults and data as the Justice Department's first witness.
At issue were comments that Mr. Varianmade in a 2009 interview with the technology news site CNET.
In the article, Mr. Varian said, "The scale arguments are pretty bogus."
To explain, he added in the article: "It's not the quantity or quality of the ingredients that make a difference. It's the recipes." It was a deft analogy, with the ingredients being the data and recipes being the clever algorithms written by Google's engineers. It reached a wider audience when Mr. Varian's explanation was picked up in a Time magazine article.
But in an email to Mr. Varian shortly after, Udi Manber, a senior engineer on Google's search team, took issue with the economist's description. "It's absolutely not true that scale is not important," Mr. Manber wrote. "We make very good use of everything we get."
In an email string with other Google employees, Mr. Manber wrote, "I know it reads well, but unfortunately it's factually wrong."
A lot has changed since then. The government introduced the emails to cast doubt on the credibility of what Google is saying in court. They amount to a few snippets at the beginning of a lengthy nonjury trial that will generate piles and piles of evidence, testimony and rebuttal for Judge Mehta to weigh and consider.
But what is already clear is that a debate over data in search -- whether it has market-determining power or not -- is a pivotal issue, and one that both sides will most likely be compelled to return to repeatedly in the trial.

Strong I.P.O. For Arm Engenders Optimism: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The performance of the British chip designer's shares signals that the I.P.O. market may revive after a very quiet year.
Call it Wall Street's Groundhog Day.
When shares of Arm, the British chip designer, began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday in the year's biggest initial public offering, investors, tech executives, bankers and start-up founders were watching closely for how it performed.
If Arm's stock fell, they knew the market for I.P.O.s was likely to stay frozen for longer. But a warm welcome for the shares would probably mean many more companies going public in the coming months, ending the cold streak.
They quickly got their answer: It was an early spring. Arm's shares opened trading at $ 56.10, up 10 percent from its initial offering price of $ 51. Shares quickly soared further, rising 25 percent by the end of trading to close at $ 63.59 and giving the company a fully diluted valuation of $ 67.9 billion.
That is positive news for listings from the grocery delivery start-up Instacart and the advertising tech company Klaviyo, which are expected to go public next week. It also provides a boost to the entire tech industry, which has been waiting for market conditions to improve for nearly two years.
"Offerings like this are often beacons to try to decipher what is the sentiment, overall, of this marketplace," said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Arm's debut may encourage other companies to tap the public markets, he said. "If you can break a logjam in one important corner of this private market, that tends to flow all the way down to the private capital providers."
Arm is the largest company to brave the public markets in 2023, a year that has been almost deathly quiet for I.P.O.s. The chip designer, which is owned by SoftBank, had priced its offering on Wednesday at $ 51 a share, raising $ 4.87 billion.
That stands out in a year that has been the worst for I.P.O.s since 2009, according to an analysis by EquityZen, a marketplace for private company stock. So far this year, 73 I.P.O.s in the United States -- including Arm -- have raised $ 14.8 billion, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks public offerings. That's a fraction of the listings during 2021, when 397 companies raised $ 142 billion.
There is a backlog of roughly 200 companies that should have gone public by now, according to an analysis by PitchBook, which tracks start-ups. The shoe company Birkenstock, owned by the private equity firm L Catterton, filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange this week.
"A lot of companies are exploring the market right now," Kyle Stanford, an analyst at PitchBook, said. "The demand is there."
Arm is a particularly interesting test of the public market because it provides an essential technology that is geopolitically and strategically coveted, which also means it faces challenges.
Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, the company sells blueprints of a part of a chip known as a processor core. Its customers include many of the world's largest tech companies, like Apple, Google, Samsung and Nvidia.
Arm's chip designs are primarily used in smartphones, but the company has pitched itself as able to ride the wave of artificial intelligence sweeping Silicon Valley. Many A.I. companies need the most advanced computer chips to do the sophisticated calculations required to develop the tech.
Arm has been the subject of much global interest, with Japan-based SoftBank buying the company for $ 32 billion in 2016. SoftBank, which needs a big win after years of deals that didn't live up to their promise, is set to retain a majority stake in Arm after the I.P.O.
In 2020, Nvidia reached a deal to buy Arm from SoftBank for $ 40 billion. But that plan collapsed 18 months later after opposition from regulators and customers.
On Thursday, Rene Haas, Arm's chief executive, rang the Nasdaq opening bell at the exchange's studio in New York's Times Square, along with Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank's chief financial officer, and other executives. Around 2,000 Arm employees in Cambridge, England, joined the festivities through a video feed.
In an interview, Mr. Haas said he was pleased that Arm's offering priced near the top of the proposed range but was more focused on the future.
"While today is an amazing day, I'm far, far more excited about the next five to 10 years," he said. Arm has been diversifying to place its technology in myriad other products equipped with some level of computing power, including cars, consumer products and data centers.
The company is not receiving any proceeds from the offering, since all shares were sold by SoftBank. Arm had more than $ 2 billion in cash and short-term investments to fund its activities as of the end of June.
SoftBank, which needed a big win from Arm after stumbles with other investments, had bought back Arm shares from investors a few weeks ago at a valuation of $ 64 billion.
In an interview with CNBC, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's chief executive, said he paid that price tag because of his confidence in Arm's future and that he expected the stock to have "good upside" over the long term.
He added that SoftBank was unlikely to sell more of its roughly 90 percent stake in the company. "Our intent is to hold as much as possible as long as possible," he said.
Investors remain cautious to skeptical about other tech companies -- such as Instacart and Klaviyo -- that are readying to go public, with expectations low.
Instacart, which kicked off its I.P.O. pitch meetings this week by setting a price range that valued the company at $ 8.6 billion to $ 9.3 billion, counting all outstanding shares, is set to be valued far below its onetime valuation of $ 39 billion in the private market. Klaviyo started its pitch meetings with a valuation range of $ 7.7 billion to $ 8.3 billion, slightly below its last private valuation of $ 9.5 billion.
To instill confidence in the public offerings, many of the companies have tried reassuring Wall Street that they are desirable investments. Before its offering, Arm said it had lined up $ 735 million of "stated interest" in buying its shares from companies it works with, including Nvidia, Google, Samsung, Apple and Intel.
Arm on Thursday did not disclose additional details concerning those investments, but Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said this week that its directors had approved an investment of up to $ 100 million in the offering.
Instacart made a similar move, selling $ 175 million of its I.P.O. shares to PepsiCo. Klaviyo also announced that it had secured the investment firms BlackRock and AllianceBernstein as "cornerstone" investors ahead of its offering. Trumpeting such commitments ahead of an I.P.O. is not as common in times when the market is flush, Mr. Hsu of Wharton said.
Arm, Klaviyo and Instacart have also drawn attention to their profits. Rising interest rates and inflation have made investors more risk-averse, with many shifting their priorities from fast-growing companies to those that can make money.
The profits contrast with the many cash-burning companies that went public in the boom times of 2021, which have since seen their stock prices plummet. Bird, a scooter company once worth $ 2.5 billion, has fallen to a valuation of $ 11 million. WeWork, the office sharing company that was valued at $ 40 billion on the private market, now trades at a market capitalization of around $ 270 million.

Full text: In the first full day of testimony in the U.S. monopoly trial against Google, the Justice Department sought to show that the company had long tried to cut out search competitors.
The Justice Department used its first full day of questioning in its antitrust trial against Google on Wednesday to establish that the internet giant had long sought agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices, which the government argues were used to illegally maintain the company's hold over online search.
Google responded by highlighting evidence suggesting that companies that signed those agreements -- including smartphone makers, browser developers and wireless carriers -- did so partly because its search product was better.
Chris Barton, a former Google employee who testified on Wednesday, said the company had been willing to pay mobile companies mainly to become their exclusive default search engine. "That's the kind of primary goal of the partnership," he said of the agreements.
The testimony came after the federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era kicked off on Tuesday. The Justice Department and a group of 38 states and territories have accused Google of illegally shutting out competitors and entrenching a monopoly over online search by using multibillion-dollar contracts with companies like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine on smartphones.
Google has argued that its success in online search was the result of having a better product, not the default agreements. In opening statements on Tuesday, Google's lawyer said it was easy for people to switch their search engine and that smartphone and browser makers promoted other search engines as well.
Any ruling in the trial, which is scheduled to last 10 weeks, could have wide implications for a technology industry that has defined communications, culture and the search for information online. A government victory could limit Google, a $ 1.7 trillion company, and put other tech giants on notice.
The case is likely to be the first of several government monopoly trials against the biggest tech companies. The Justice Department has filed a second lawsuit against Google, arguing it abused a monopoly over advertising technology, and the Federal Trade Commission is pursuing a case against Meta claiming it snuffed out nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp.
On Wednesday, the Justice Department began the day in court by questioning Mr. Barton, who worked at Google forging agreements with mobile companies. He was asked about how Google's early agreements with telecommunications providers and smartphone manufacturers prioritized exclusivity as a default search engine on mobile devices.
Mr. Barton's job had been to meet with executives from the telecom and smartphone makers, convince them to sign agreements to distribute Google search and see those agreements through to a final contract, he said. The goal was to "maximize the opportunity" for users to discover Google and start to use it regularly, he said.
Google also paid some mobile phone makers and telecommunications carriers a share of its revenue as part of the agreements. "The key thing" determining whether another company was paid was if it would agree to make Google its default search engine exclusively, Mr. Barton said.
John Schmidtlein, Google's lead litigator, used his questions to suggest that the quality of the company's search engine was important to those that signed the search distribution agreements.
In one 2009 email, Mr. Barton speculated to a colleague that T-Mobile might consider switching its default search engine to Google because of Google's strong brand, among other factors. Mr. Barton also told Mr. Schmidtlein that when he pitched other companies, he tended to focus on Google's "superior product" and "superior monetization."
The Justice Department then called Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, who had testified on Tuesday about the power of being the default search engine and how Google viewed its position in the market.
Kenneth Dintzer, the government's lead lawyer, asked Mr. Varian about debates he had with other Google employees over whether or not the company's significant scale and data troves gave it an advantage over rivals.
Mr. Varian at times sparred with colleagues who thought he was being too dismissive of the role that data played as a competitive advantage for the search engine, according to internal documents displayed during the government's questioning.
Antonio Rangel, a behavioral economist and professor at Caltech, who the government has employed as an expert witness, also testified that using defaults was an effective tactic to get a user to make a certain choice.
"The consensus is that defaults have a powerful influence on consumer decisions," he said, adding that he believed having a default search engine on a device, like a smartphone or personal computer, would bias users toward choosing that search engine in a "sizable and robust" way.
The trial is expected to run through November and feature testimony from executives at Google, Apple and other companies. Some of the testimony is likely to be sealed to the public because it involves information that businesses consider confidential. A portion of the evidence displayed in court has also been redacted.

Semiconductor Firm Juggles Issues Before 2023's Biggest I.P.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The SoftBank-owned company, which for decades has defined how mobile phones operate, is grappling with geopolitical and commercial complexities as it prepares to go public this week.
Rene Haas, the chief executive of the chip-design powerhouse Arm, has many masters to serve.
He reports to Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, which owns Arm and plans to sell a portion of the British company this week in the year's biggest initial public offering. Officials in Beijing and Washington also command Mr. Haas's attention amid a widening chip trade war, as does Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and others who have unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a stock listing in the country.
And Mr. Haas must juggle the demands of more than 200 companies that use Arm's technology. Ten of the biggest -- including Apple, Google, Samsung and Nvidia -- have been negotiating for stakes in the highly anticipated Arm offering as artificial intelligence drives explosive demand for more powerful chips.
"It's only going to get more and more complex," Mr. Haas said in a speech in May at a trade show in Taiwan. "I'm an old person in this industry. I've never seen it like this."
Few companies face as many geopolitical and commercial complexities as Arm, the creator of the most widely used computing architecture of all time. Its public offering, which is expected to start trading on Thursday and to value the company around $ 52 billion, will signal Arm's ability to weather those challenges and enter new markets. How Arm performs will also influence the market for public listings, which has been quiet for much of the year.
There are "a lot of companies to please and a lot of capitals to please," Jodi Shelton, chief executive of the Global Semiconductor Alliance, a big trade group, said of Arm. Mr. Haas, she added, "has to not only play diplomat on a global level but to customers."
Arm is in a quiet period before its public offering, with Mr. Haas expected to help ring the Nasdaq opening bell in New York on Thursday.
Founded in 1990, Arm has for decades helped define how nearly all mobile phones operate, despite having only about 6,000 employees and less than $ 3 billion in annual revenue. Its technology has also spread to cars, sensors, supercomputers and myriad other devices.
Unlike most chip companies, Arm does not make or sell those silicon components. It essentially designs and licenses blueprints for one of the most important parts of a chip -- processor cores, which perform calculations and run software programs.
Those electronic brains rely on a set of instructions that Arm developed, and that programs like Google's Android and Apple's iOS operating systems use to carry out basic operations on smartphones.
Companies typically design entire chips by placing the blueprints for Arm's cores alongside those handling other functions, which they may design or license. That means many companies watch Arm's technical specifications and future plans closely.
"There are very different interests that have to be balanced," said Aart de Geus, the chief executive of Synopsys, which sells software for designing chips along with specialized chip cores and aims to invest in Arm's offering. "We all have to play really well together to make anything work."
Arm estimates that more than 250 billion chips using its technology have been sold since its founding in 1990. That was when Apple and two partners established what was originally called Advanced RISC Machines in Cambridge, England. Apple wanted low-powered technology that would extend battery life in the Newton, its ill-fated personal digital assistant, which was discontinued in 1998.
"The DNA of the company was born building products that run off batteries, and that sensibility still defines us today," Mr. Haas said in a video presentation for Arm's I.P.O. roadshow, where it pitches to investors.
Mr. Haas, 61, is the first American to run Arm, which still conducts most engineering in Cambridge. He grew up in a suburb of Rochester, N.Y., where his father was a Xerox research scientist and exposed him to Silicon Valley's allure on a childhood visit to Xerox's research center there.
After earning an electrical and electronics engineering degree from Clarkson University, Mr. Haas worked for a chip maker and a start-up before a seven-year stint at Nvidia, a dominant provider of graphics and artificial-intelligence chips.
He joined Arm in 2013. After lobbying for changes in its China business, Mr. Haas was transferred to Shanghai.
In 2016, SoftBank bought Arm for $ 32 billion, inspired partly by Mr. Son's ultimately unsuccessful idea of selling services to help coordinate and deliver software to billions of devices equipped with Arm chips. Mr. Haas moved to London to lead the rest of Arm's business, and began pushing for changes there.
Among other things, he introduced licensing schemes with annual subscriptions for a bundle of Arm technologies, reducing the need for repeated negotiations for individual products. Arm also shifted from a longtime practice of designing cores for smartphones and adapting them for other applications. It now designs cores from scratch for new markets like data centers and cars.
In September 2020, Nvidia reached a deal to buy Arm from SoftBank for $ 40 billion. That plan collapsed 18 months later after opposition from regulators and customers. Mr. Son picked Mr. Haas in February 2022 to succeed Simon Segars as chief executive.
An imposing figure at 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Haas introduced new ideas with a collaborative style, associates said. He "has really transformed Arm," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, in the roadshow video.
With Arm in the middle of tech supply chains and the chip trade war, Mr. Haas is grappling with challenges, including slowing sales of smartphones and the question of whether the company can play a big role in A.I. chores in data centers.
Another comes from China, where Arm gets roughly a quarter of its revenue and licensing is handled by Arm China, a company that it does not control. Arm weathered a long-running battle with Arm China's leader, who was ousted last year, but payments and sales information from that company have sometimes been late, the I.P.O. prospectus said.
Trade tensions also loom large. Sales of one powerful version of an Arm core for data centers have been hobbled by American and British restrictions on Chinese exports. Though Arm said it had worked around such limits so far, the possibility of tougher rules stands out among numerous risks concerning China described in the prospectus.
There are also questions about Arm's business model. Arm historically negotiated with chip makers to receive an upfront licensing fee, which might range from $ 10 million to $ 100 million depending on the technology involved, plus a per-chip royalty of around $ 1 to $ 3.50, estimated Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research.
But lower-cost alternatives have emerged, including RISC-V, a technology whose instruction set can be licensed for free.
Arm also faces a legal battle with a major customer, Qualcomm, a big supplier of mobile chips. Arm sued Qualcomm, saying it violated a licensing contract in connection with buying a chip start-up, Nuvia. Qualcomm denied the accusations and plans to begin offering chips developed by the former Nuvia team, underscoring how more customers may license just the Arm instruction set and then design original processor cores.
Though Arm has penetrated data centers in chips designed by Amazon and Ampere Computing, a start-up, it has yet to experience the kind of A.I. sales surge there that Nvidia has enjoyed.
Handel Jones, head of the research firm International Business Strategies, said Arm's biggest A.I. opportunity would be in phones, PCs and other so-called edge applications where devices need low power consumption.
"If Arm can play the role that Nvidia plays in data centers at the edge, then that I.P.O. valuation can be justified," Mr. Jones said. "They are a long way from getting there yet."

SoftBank, Needing a Win, Is Betting on Arm: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Softbank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, believes the chip design company he bought in 2016 is poised to reap the fruits of the A.I. revolution.
Masayoshi Son, the chief executive and billionaire founder of the tech conglomerate SoftBank, believed so strongly in Arm, the British chip design company he bought in 2016 for $ 32 billion, that he guaranteed some big investors they wouldn't lose money on the deal.
If anything, Mr. Son told those investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, he would be willing to pay them as much as double the acquisition price when they eventually exited, according to four people with knowledge of the negotiations, who requested anonymity to discuss a private arrangement.
Mr. Son recently made good on his guarantee, agreeing to buy out his fellow investors at a $ 64 billion valuation. But as Arm prepares for its initial public offering, one of the biggest in recent years, Mr. Son's conviction is being put to the test. The company, which designs chips used in cellphones, including all iPhones, is seeking a market value of $ 51 billion to $ 54 billion in its I.P.O. -- far below where Mr. Son pegged the company's value.
Mr. Son's bullish moves reflect his deeply held belief that Arm -- which he recently described as the financial and existential centerpiece of SoftBank -- is well positioned to take advantage of the revolution in artificial intelligence. At SoftBank's annual meeting in June, Mr. Son, now 66, said he had a recent revelation: He wanted to spend the remainder of his life and career as "an architect to build the future of humankind" through artificial intelligence. Arm's chip designing capabilities, he said, would "play a central role" in accelerating the development of A.I. Mr. Son also sees several other big markets for Arm, such as data centers and automotive.
But his monumental bet on Arm also reflects the urgent need for a big win for SoftBank after years of deals that didn't live up to their promise.
Mr. Son, who started SoftBank in Tokyo in 1981 after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, built it into one of the largest technology investors in the world. Early investments in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and in Japan's mobile phone industry were critical to SoftBank's success. However, some of SoftBank's later investments made through its $ 100 billion Vision Fund, including WeWork, have been far less rewarding.
Leading up to Arm's public offering, Mr. Son has been determined to keep as much of the company under SoftBank's control as he can, according to four people involved in the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly. SoftBank will sell just 10 percent of Arm to investors in the public offering. On average, companies have sold 16 to 29 percent of their shares in I.P.O.s over the past 10 years, according to Dealogic.
Mr. Son originally wanted to sell even less than 10 percent, one of the people said. However, he had taken a large personal loan using his stake in Arm as collateral, and the lenders forced him to sell at least a tenth of the company so they could have access to publicly traded shares -- which are easily sellable -- in case of a default or a steep plunge in Arm's value.
Mr. Son has repeatedly told underwriters and potential investors that after this offering, SoftBank has no plans to sell additional shares for several years, according to one person involved in the deal.
Arm's success is crucial to SoftBank, which in recent years has reeled from a series of troubled bets on technology companies. SoftBank's Vision Fund, which Mr. Son launched in 2017, raised tens of billions of dollars from big investors, including $ 50 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.
It also gained notoriety for making money-losing bets on companies that ran into trouble, including WeWork; a robot-making pizza company called Zume; and the Indian hotel chain Oyo. Losses at SoftBank's Vision Fund unit widened to more than $ 30 billion in its last fiscal year, which ended in March.
Arm's public offering comes roughly 18 months after Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker and a customer of Arm, abandoned its offer to buy Arm for $ 40 billion. The Federal Trade Commission had sued to stop the deal.
While Mr. Son has highlighted how Arm's chip-design technology could be central to an A.I. revolution, it has yet to produce the kind of growth that would bedazzle investors. The company's revenue declined slightly for the fiscal year that ended in March, to $ 2.68 billion from $ 2.7 billion a year earlier. Profitability dropped as well. Arm had net income of 10 cents per share in the most recent quarter, down from 22 cents the previous year.
Arm's I.P.O. underwriters pitched the company's shares to Wall Street investors conservatively, based on what they expected the initial demand to be. But investors who initially appeared to be wary of the chip designer's valuation and growth potential have become more optimistic after Arm shared its prospects with them, two people with knowledge of the deal said.
The company also offered many of its customers the opportunity to buy up to $ 100 million each in the I.P.O., two people involved in the deal said. Arm is expected to raise a total of $ 735 million from companies including Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia.
SoftBank and Arm have other enduring ties. Arm's chief executive, Rene Haas, who took the helm in 2022 shortly after the company called off its deal with Nvidia, recently joined SoftBank's board of directors. He travels to Tokyo regularly to meet with Mr. Son and talks to him multiple times a day, according to two people familiar with those activities.
Mr. Son has rarely left Japan since the start of the pandemic but plans to travel to the United States for the first time since 2020 for the Arm I.P.O., one of the people said. He'll be watching the start of trading from SoftBank's offices in California. Mr. Haas will spend the morning at Nasdaq's New York headquarters.

Likening Google's Antitrust Trial to Microsoft's: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The government's antitrust case against Google borrows heavily from the landmark lawsuit against Microsoft 25 years ago. But it lacks the same cultural impact.
The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts like "network effects" and "switching costs." Yet The Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, like the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.
Microsoft was found by a federal judge to have repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. An appeals court upheld most of that decision but was skeptical of the government's preferred remedy -- breaking up the company.
In its lawsuit against Google, the Justice Department points to the Microsoft case and that company's tactics in the 1990s. "Google deploys the same playbook," the government declares, by illegally wielding its might in online search much as Microsoft did with its personal computer operating system, Windows.
But Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said there were big differences between the Microsoft of the dot-com boom and today's Google. Back then, Mr. Walker was deputy general counsel of Netscape, the commercial pioneer of internet browsing software, which was the main target of Microsoft's campaign to hobble competition.
About 90 percent of personal computers used Microsoft's Windows software, the main gateway to the young internet, and Microsoft controlled the software and services that were featured on those Windows PC screens.
Google, on the other hand, has to work with and pay partners that make smartphones, browsers and other devices, Mr. Walker said. Its deals with companies like Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their smartphones are legal and benefit consumers, giving them the best technology and reducing costs for device makers and their customers, he said.
"We think there are aspects of the Microsoft case that are actually very helpful to us here," Mr. Walker said in an interview.
When the Microsoft trial started, it was the high tide of early internet euphoria. E-commerce was just getting underway, and every industry wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon. This was before mobile computing. The first Blackberry, essentially an email device, was introduced in 1999. The iPhone, which started the smartphone era, didn't arrive until 2007. If you wanted to get online, chances are you did it through a computer that ran Windows.
Microsoft was rich, powerful and ambitious. It had started to move beyond software. In 1996, it entered the media business in a partnership with NBC, setting up the cable channel, MSNBC, and a website, msnbc.com (Microsoft shed its stakes in both, years later).
Executives in industry after industry worried about what Microsoft might do next, sharing a sentiment expressed by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp: "Everybody in the communications business is paranoid of Microsoft, including me."
Today, Google does not loom as large as Microsoft once did. It is one member of the Big Tech club. It is an undisputed giant in search and online advertising, and its software and artificial intelligence prowess can extend to other industries. But its Big Tech peers -- Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and even Microsoft -- are all under scrutiny in the United States and abroad.
The Microsoft case also had a huge personal dimension because of the stature of Mr. Gates. He was the world's richest person, and during the course of the trial, as the stock market surged, Mr. Gates's stake in Microsoft soared to $ 100 billion. In 1995, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a website, called the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, to track Mr. Gates's net worth.
Mr. Gates was widely admired as a brilliant entrepreneur, polls showed. He was Microsoft's leader, deeply involved in company operations and especially its internet strategy. He viewed the government's antitrust pursuit as an assault on his life's work, colleagues said.
Mr. Gates was not a witness at the trial, but excerpts from his videotaped deposition testimony were shown. He was quibbling, unresponsive and forgetful. At one point, he seemed not to understand the term "market share." (The joke immediately afterward was that "share" was the concept he didn't grasp.)
Later, Microsoft officials said Mr. Gates had merely been following legal advice he was given to narrow questions and avoid broad or responsive answers. If so, it was bad advice. His deposition testimony undermined his credibility -- and Microsoft's -- with the judge.
Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, have a far less prominent role in the current case. They are no longer deeply involved in the company. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken company man who joined Google in 2004 and rose through the ranks.
Although the legal theory advanced by the Justice Department mirrors the one used in the Microsoft case, the outcome of the trial will hinge on the evidence presented to Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The government has already suggested its evidence will lack the vivid language of the Microsoft case. There is no equivalent of "cut off Netscape's air supply" or piles of email filled with no-holds-barred terminology.
In the Google suit, the government cited the search company's instructions to its employees to avoid words like "kill," "crush" and "block" in their emails.
"Google did learn one thing from Microsoft -- to choose its words carefully to avoid antitrust scrutiny," the Justice Department wrote.
For its part, the government has understandably borrowed heavily from the Microsoft case in its lawsuit against Google because those legal theories "worked so well against Microsoft," said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
After the George W. Bush administration came to power, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached a settlement. The resulting consent decree prohibited Microsoft from imposing restrictive contracts, freed PC makers to load and feature other companies' software and forced Microsoft to disclose more technical information.
Many people criticized the consent decree as toothless. David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was initially a critic, but his views have changed.
Today, Mr. Yoffie teaches a course on antitrust and technology, and it begins with the Microsoft consent decree. "There were a litany of actions that were no longer possible because of the consent decree," he said. "It did limit Microsoft's ability to go after newcomers, not ones trying to compete with Microsoft head-on but at an angle."
The leading beneficiary of the more open environment, Mr. Yoffie said, was an internet search start-up, with new technology and later a new business model. It was called Google. It was founded in September 1998, one month before the Microsoft trial began.

Full text: For years, officials in China have been told to shun foreign devices. Now reports of renewed curbs have unnerved Apple's investors, heightening geopolitical tensions.
China has discouraged the use of foreign-made electronic devices by government officials for a decade. It has told agencies and state-owned companies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones. And officials frequently show off to Americans their phones made by Huawei, China's cellphone giant.
Now, some employees of government agencies said they have received directives not to use Apple iPhones for work. Internet users in China also have been circulating accounts and screenshots said to contain notices to government employees and state-owned businesses ordering or urging them to adopt domestic brands of cellphones and computers for their work.
Chinese authorities have issued no public pronouncements about broader restrictions on iPhones. The suggestion that Apple could lose ground in the valuable Chinese market has pushed the company's stock lower, and Apple's most popular product has gotten snared in the persistent China-U.S. tensions over technology.
China's censors, usually assiduous about controlling the flow of information on the internet, appear to have done little or nothing to stop the claims of restrictions, first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
Hu Xijin, the retired editor of a Communist Party-run tabloid and now a nationalistic commentator with 25 million followers, has written about them on his blog. "If this trend continues, the U.S. is likely to be the bigger loser," Mr. Hu wrote on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site. In a written reply to questions, Mr. Hu said that China has been forced by American policies to show greater "vigilance" about security issues.
On Sunday, President Biden said during a news conference in Vietnam that China's plan to limit government use of "a Western cellphone" was evidence that "China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game in terms of trade and other issues."
Some local and provincial employees, who make up the bulk of government employees in China, have denied being told of any ban. They have been targeted in previous efforts to discourage the use of Apple devices, notably after Edward J. Snowden, an American government contractor, released information in 2013 revealing American surveillance around the world.
The United States and China both have much to lose in a geopolitical fight over consumer electronics.
Apple products are more visible in China than products from Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi are in the United States. But because Apple and many other consumer electronics manufacturers have moved much of their manufacturing to China, one of the largest categories of the American trade deficit with China is in smartphones.
The warnings come right after Huawei introduced a smartphone with high-quality cameras that is seen as an iPhone rival. The Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Pro, is the target of a U.S. review into whether it uses computer chips that were made with American technologies that have been embargoed for sale to China. Huawei has presented the phone as a domestic effort.
Gina Raimondo, the United States commerce secretary, visited Beijing and Shanghai last month and told Chinese officials that the United States would not pull back recent controls it placed on certain high-tech exports to China.
Duncan Clark, a specialist in China's telecom sector and now the chairman of BDA China, an investment consulting firm, said he believed the restrictions were "an effort to raise the stakes and remind the U.S. of what it could lose" from continued geopolitical frictions.
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus at Hong Kong Baptist University, had a similar assessment. "I think it's a tit-for-tat reaction," he said, to American efforts to discourage foreign governments from installing Huawei equipment in their telecom sectors, as well as moves by some U.S. states to restrict the use of TikTok, the social media app, by government employees.
The United States bans federal agencies from buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers.
Mr. Cabestan said that the warnings in China appeared to be a security measure aimed at state employees, and not a broader effort to discourage sales in China of Apple devices.
Still, few American companies have more to lose than Apple from rising tensions between the world's superpowers. China is the world's largest smartphone market and the source of about a fifth of Apple's revenue. Apple doesn't break out how many iPhones it sells in China.
More broadly, Apple became the most valuable technology company by pioneering a business model built on China's manufacturing expertise. The country's giant work force inexpensively assembles the vast majority of iPhones sold around the world.
On Tuesday in California, Apple will reveal its newest iPhone at a highly choreographed event that is an annual rite in Silicon Valley, and the company will then start stocking its stores around the world with the new model. Increasing official Chinese resistance to iPhones has the potential to curb this year's sales.
Apple, which didn't respond to requests for comment, has not said anything publicly about the recent reports.
The iPhone has long been a status symbol among Chinese entrepreneurs and popular among consumers, particularly in cities. By contrast, government employees have made a point of showing off their Huawei phones in public settings.
Under pressure from the Chinese government, Apple has built an extensive data center in China, although it has said it continues to protect its customers' privacy all over the world.
Some people who work in China's central government said employees have been told to stop using iPhones. Others described a vaguer demand for officials to stop using foreign-brand phones and to use Chinese ones.
One message that circulated on WeChat, a ubiquitous Chinese social media service, cited a decision from a departmental leader that staff members were to be barred from using foreign-brand smartphones, laptops and other digital devices starting Sept. 7. The message said staff members were also prohibited from using these foreign-brand products for work in their own homes. Another message on WeChat said that staff members would be required to stop using iPhones by Oct. 1.
Discussion has appeared online for years about whether Chinese officials are barred from using iPhones, along with occasional denials of blanket bans. A Shanghai newspaper reported in 2014 that officials in that city were under pressure to abandon iPhones over security worries.
A researcher in a government-run research institute in Beijing, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the drive to discourage the use of iPhones appeared to ripple from what Chinese officials and party newspapers have described as a strategy of "substitution for domestic products" in key technologies, which has picked up pace since last year. In a speech to senior officials in February, which was published in July, Xi Jinping, China's leader, urged increased efforts to achieve self-sufficiency for China in scientific research and advanced technologies.
"We must go on the offensive for the national production of scientific and technological instruments and equipment, operating systems and basic software," Mr. Xi said.
In recent weeks, China's Minister of State Security has publicized cases that it said involved Chinese officials and other people in sensitive roles being recruited by U.S. intelligence agents. Earlier this year, Chinese government secrecy authorities warned about careless use of phones that could expose officials to hacking or leaking sensitive information.

How the iPhone Defied Gravity and Dominated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There's a general rule about consumer electronics: The older a device becomes, the more competitors appear and prices fall. This was true for televisions, personal computers and portable music players.
It was supposed to happen with smartphones. But the iPhone has defied gravity.
On Tuesday, Apple will unveil the 17th iteration of its flagship product. Remarkably, at an age in which most consumer devices have lost some of their appeal to users, Apple has increased its share of smartphone sales over less expensive rivals.
Over the past five years, the iPhone has increased its percentage of total smartphones sold around the world while expanding its share of sales in four of the world's largest regions: China, Japan, Europe and India.
In the United States, the iPhone's largest market, the device now accounts for more than 50 percent of smartphones sold, up from 41 percent in 2018, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm. The gains have helped it claim about a fifth of the world's smartphone sales, up from a low of 13 percent in 2019.
Apple has expanded its smartphone empire as the broader industry has faltered. Over the past two years, sales of Android smartphones have plummeted, but the iPhone has suffered only modest declines because it's been winning new customers. It has done so despite being the industry's priciest device.
Apple has overcome price sensitivity by creating a business that is reminiscent of U.S. car sales. Like a car, iPhones last for years and can be resold to offset the purchase of a new one. Wireless providers, much like auto dealers, offer discounts and monthly payment plans that make it more affordable to buy the latest model. And customers, like brand-loyal car buyers, are more likely to buy another iPhone than switch to Google's Android operating system.
Apple has also been lucky. Two of its biggest challengers, Samsung and Huawei, have stumbled in recent years. Samsung faltered in 2016 when the batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted. Huawei, which was popular in China, floundered in 2020 after the Trump administration blocked it from buying U.S. technology.
The iPhone has avoided wobbles with a reliable blueprint: Apple annually updates the iPhone's spare but sleek design and reliable software, and brings it to the masses with an operations machine that assembles 200 million flawless iPhones a year with military precision.
In the United States, the iPhone's popularity is expected to widen in the years ahead. Nearly 90 percent of teenagers own an iPhone, according to Piper Sandler, an investment bank.
For young people, iPhones equal inclusion. Many choose it over Android because Apple's messaging service, iMessage, will turn the color of messages from its default blue to green if a non-iPhone user is in a messaging group. The stigma associated with having green text messages is so pronounced that when it came time for Dave Storrs's 14-year-old son to get his first smartphone, the teenager told his father that he wanted an iPhone or no phone at all.
"It's a status thing," said Mr. Storrs, an Army retiree who lives in El Paso. "They don't want to be treated differently."
Mr. Storrs, who is 49, has been subjected to the same pressure. For more than a decade, he took pride in being what he called an "Android renegade." He owned a series of LG and Motorola phones, even as his son and other family members pressed him to buy an iPhone. He gave in this year after his family gave him a $ 99 pair of Apple's wireless AirPod earbuds.
Each time he wanted to use the AirPods on his Android phone, he had to manually sync them. The laborious process inspired him to buy an iPhone 13, which connects the AirPods instantaneously. After years of using a free Android phone, he now pays $ 11 a month for the iPhone. But he says that he'll never go back to Android because he likes that he can wear AirPods and take phone calls while walking his Catahoula leopard dog, Teddy.
"It's just convenient," he said.
New buyers like Mr. Storrs illustrate how Apple is gaining customers. The gap between the two major operating systems is tilted in Apple's favor. About 94 percent of iPhone customers are likely to buy another iPhone, while 91 percent of Android customers are likely to buy another Android, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm.
The migration from Android to Apple has accelerated as promotional discounts, financing plans and trade-in offers make higher iPhone prices less of a barrier. Wireless carriers sweetened their offers as they scrambled to gain or keep customers after T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020. When the combined company, the new T-Mobile, offered the iPhone 12 free with a 30-month contract, AT&T countered with a similar deal, said Cliff Maldonado of BayStreet Research, a smartphone research firm. It made switching painless.
Around the same time, Apple and wireless carriers began more aggressively promoting monthly payment plans. The plans have reduced the cost of a new iPhone to less than $ 40 a month from the $ 800 to $ 1,200 that customers had to pay upfront. The prices are lower for people who trade in used devices. The old iPhones, which could fetch up to $ 640, have been auctioned to buyers in Asia, who resell them at a markup, Mr. Maldonado said.
"The phone market is like the housing market," he said. "You get equity, and pay over time."
In China, the second-most important country to Apple's business, the iPhone has become the default choice for people who want a premium smartphone. Samsung was squeezed out of the market several years ago, and Huawei has been unable to make a phone with the latest wireless technology. The lack of competition has helped to make the iPhone the country's best-selling smartphone in recent quarters.
But new challenges threaten Apple's lead. Last month, Huawei unveiled a new premium smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, its first to feature chips capable of running on 5G cellular networks. Beijing also directed employees of national government agencies not to use iPhones for work. Instead, they have been encouraged to use domestic smartphone brands, raising the possibility that nationalist momentum undercuts future iPhone sales. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.
Apple may be able to offset a dip in China with growth in India. The company now claims 5 percent of sales in the world's fastest-growing smartphone nation, up from 1 percent in 2019. Counterpoint Research predicts that Apple could double its share to 10 percent next year.
The iPhone's gains in India have been years in the making. In 2017, Apple began working with government officials to start manufacturing iPhones locally, a move that has improved affordability by avoiding import tariffs. It has also opened stores in New Delhi and Mumbai.
The new flagship iPhones that Apple is set to unveil this week will feature speedier processors, more sophisticated cameras and titanium rather than stainless steel cases, according to supply chain analysts. The changes are expected to come with a $ 100 to $ 200 price increase, bringing the cost of an iPhone Pro to $ 1,100 and the Pro Max to $ 1,200.
But analysts predict that iPhone loyalists will shrug off higher prices. The increases would be less than $ 5 a month for people on monthly plans and even less for those who trade in old iPhones.
"The economy is doing pretty well, and everything costs more," said Michael Levin, a co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "People are desensitized to increases right now."

Full text: The government claims that Google illegally stifles rivals, while the company says its practices are legal and mainstream.
A federal judge will start hearing claims this week from the Justice Department and a group of states that Google abused its power as a monopoly over online search services.
Google is synonymous with looking for information online and has leveraged its massively successful search tool to build a giant business spanning advertising, cloud computing and the online video powerhouse YouTube.
The outcome of the trial will have even broader implications than Google's business. By putting decades of Silicon Valley practices under the microscope, it will provide an indication of how successful regulators in the United States will be in their efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech.
What's this trial about?
A judge will consider whether, as the Justice Department and a group of states argue, Google abused its power as a monopoly. It's the first monopoly trial against a tech giant since the landmark proceedings against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
In the decades since, Google has amassed 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.
Why does it matter?
If Google loses this case, the ruling could chip away at its stature and influence in the technology industry -- something that could limit the way Google can compete in the marketplace and reshuffle power in Silicon Valley.
It is also a test for governments that say tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, have too much influence over our online lives. The nation's antitrust laws were first written more than a century ago, and this trial will show whether they can be used to rein in the fast-moving tech industry.
What, exactly, is Google accused of doing?
The Justice Department has accused Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., of illegally using partnerships with phone makers and internet browser companies to shut out rival search engines.
Thanks to agreements with companies like Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, Google has been the default search engine when billions of web users open a browser on their phones, tablets and personal computers. The government has argued that Google's multibillion-dollar payouts to partners have prevented other search engines like Microsoft Bing and DuckDuckGo from accumulating a meaningful share of the online search market.
The Justice Department also claims Google's practice of preloading its services on devices that use its Android software illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly.
What does Google say?
Google says that its business practices are legal and commonplace, and that when it pays to appear on Apple's Safari browser or Mozilla's Firefox, the agreement is akin to a maker of cereals paying supermarkets to stock its boxes at eye level.
The search giant has also repeatedly argued that it has numerous successful competitors in online search. The company points to companies like Amazon and TikTok as thriving competitors. Even though they do not operate general-purpose search engines, Google argues that they are rival destinations where consumers go to find products or content that bypasses Google entirely.
Google has also said that the government is using a flawed argument to target the company because of its popularity. The company believes it is successful because it makes the best search engine. Consumers have a choice to use other search engines, it argues, but choose Google because they find it most helpful.
What does the government need to prove to win its case?
The government has to show that Google has monopoly power over the areas of the economy at issue in the case. The government will try to convince the judge to take a relatively strict view of what a search engine is and to reject Google's argument that e-commerce sites like Amazon and social media services like TikTok or Instagram are in the same market as Google's search engine. The wider the market, the easier it is for Google to argue that it does not have monopoly power.
The government also needs to prove that Google's commercial agreements meaningfully reduced competition among search engines by denying them a chance to forge similar deals with device makers or gain new customers. The Justice Department will also probably have to explain how these business practices directly or indirectly harmed consumers, which has for decades been an important bar for judges considering antitrust cases.
What will happen if Google is found responsible for violating the law?
The trial will have two parts. First, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will determine if Google violated the law. If it did, then Judge Mehta will consider possible ways to fix the situation.
The Justice Department has not yet said what actions it would ask the court to impose on Google in the event of its victory.
"But it all starts with the court being convinced that Google has misbehaved," said Bill Baer, a former Justice Department official.
Google's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, highlighted the challenge of finding an appropriate remedy without forcing other companies that are not being sued, including Apple and Samsung, to change their business practices.
It is possible that the Justice Department will ask that Google be forbidden from signing exclusive distribution agreements to give other search engines more prominence on consumer devices.
What's the broader context surrounding the trial?
The Justice Department's case against Google focuses on whether the tech giant engaged in anticompetitive conduct to undermine other search engines, which rival the service that made the company a household name.
In the decades since Microsoft was accused of bundling its products together to prevent other web browsers from gaining traction in the market, the technology industry has drastically changed.
Google has emerged as the largest advertising business on the internet. Along with its success has come intensifying scrutiny from regulators around the world, questioning the company's business practices and the competitive, political and social consequences of its popular products.
The European Union has been the most aggressive at trying to rein in Google's power, and this case is the first in which the United States will square off against the company.

Microsoft, Google and Antitrust: Similar Legal Theories in a Different Era

The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts such as “network effects” and “switching costs.” Yet the Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.
Microsoft was found by a federal judge to have repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws. An appeals court upheld most of that decision but was skeptical of the government’s preferred remedy — breaking up the company.
In its lawsuit against Google, the Justice Department points to the Microsoft case and that company’s tactics in the 1990s. “Google deploys the same playbook,” the government declares, by illegally wielding its might in online search much as Microsoft did with its personal computer operating system, Windows.
But Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs, said there were big differences between the Microsoft of the dot-com boom and today’s Google. Back then, Walker was deputy general counsel of Netscape, the commercial pioneer of internet browsing software, which was the main target of Microsoft’s campaign to hobble competition.
About 90% of personal computers used Microsoft’s Windows software, the main gateway to the young internet, and Microsoft controlled the software and services that were featured on those Windows PC screens.
Google, on the other hand, has to work with and pay partners that make smartphones, browsers and other devices, Walker said. Its deals with companies such as Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their smartphones are legal and benefit consumers, giving them the best technology and reducing costs for device makers and their customers, he said.
“We think there are aspects of the Microsoft case that are actually very helpful to us here,” Walker said in an interview.
When the Microsoft trial started, it was the high tide of early internet euphoria. E-commerce was just getting underway, and every industry wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon. This was before mobile computing. The first BlackBerry, essentially an email device, was introduced in 1999. The iPhone, which started the smartphone era, didn’t arrive until 2007. If you wanted to get online, chances are you did it through a computer that ran Windows.
Microsoft was rich, powerful and ambitious. It had started to move beyond software. In 1996, it entered the media business in a partnership with NBC, setting up the cable channel, MSNBC, and a website, msnbc.com (Microsoft shed its stakes in both, years later).
Executives in industry after industry worried about what Microsoft might do next, sharing a sentiment expressed by Rupert Murdoch, chair of News Corp: “Everybody in the communications business is paranoid of Microsoft, including me.”
Today, Google does not loom as large as Microsoft once did. It is one member of the Big Tech club. It is an undisputed giant in search and online advertising, and its software and artificial intelligence prowess can extend to other industries. But its Big Tech peers — Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook) and even Microsoft — are all under scrutiny in the United States and abroad.
The Microsoft case also had a huge personal dimension because of the stature of Gates. He was the world’s richest person, and during the course of the trial, as the stock market surged, Gates’ stake in Microsoft soared to $100 billion. In 1995, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a website, called the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, to track Gates’ net worth.
Gates was widely admired as a brilliant entrepreneur, polls showed. He was Microsoft’s leader, deeply involved in company operations and especially its internet strategy. He viewed the government’s antitrust pursuit as an assault on his life’s work, colleagues said.
Gates was not a witness at the trial, but excerpts from his videotaped deposition testimony were shown. He was quibbling, unresponsive and forgetful. At one point, he seemed not to understand the term “market share.” (The joke immediately afterward was that “share” was the concept he didn’t grasp.)
Later, Microsoft officials said Gates had merely been following legal advice he was given to narrow questions and avoid broad or responsive answers. If so, it was bad advice. His deposition testimony undermined his credibility — and Microsoft’s — with the judge.
Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, have a far less prominent role in the current case. They are no longer deeply involved in the company. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is a thoughtful, soft-spoken company man who joined Google in 2004 and rose through the ranks.
Although the legal theory advanced by the Justice Department mirrors the one used in the Microsoft case, the outcome of the trial will hinge on the evidence presented to Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The government has already suggested its evidence will lack the vivid language of the Microsoft case. There is no equivalent of “cut off Netscape’s air supply” or piles of email filled with no-holds-barred terminology.
In the Google suit, the government cited the search company’s instructions to its employees to avoid words such as “kill,” “crush” and “block” in their emails.
“Google did learn one thing from Microsoft — to choose its words carefully to avoid antitrust scrutiny,” the Justice Department wrote.
For its part, the government has understandably borrowed heavily from the Microsoft case in its lawsuit against Google because those legal theories “worked so well against Microsoft,” said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
After the George W. Bush administration came to power, the Justice Department and Microsoft reached a settlement. The resulting consent decree prohibited Microsoft from imposing restrictive contracts, freed PC makers to load and feature other companies’ software and forced Microsoft to disclose more technical information.
Many people criticized the consent decree as toothless. David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, was initially a critic, but his views had changed.
Today, Yoffie teaches a course on antitrust and technology, and it begins with the Microsoft consent decree. “There were a litany of actions that were no longer possible because of the consent decree,” he said. “It did limit Microsoft’s ability to go after newcomers, not ones trying to compete with Microsoft head-on but at an angle.”
The leading beneficiary of the more open environment, Yoffie said, was an internet search startup, with new technology and later a new business model. It was called Google. It was founded in September 1998, one month before the Microsoft trial began.

Full text: A googol, the number for which Google is named, is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. At $ 1.7 trillion, the company's valuation is far from that large, but it's closer than the market cap of almost every other tech competitor.
The biggest U.S. antitrust case in 25 years, set to begin this week, strikes at the heart of the empire that Alphabet, Google's parent company, built over decades.
Alphabet hit a $ 1 trillion market cap in January 2020, a milestone that only Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have also reached. At the time, Alphabet was facing several different legal and regulatory challenges -- but this latest court battle is its most significant yet.
Google will go head to head with the Justice Department and a group of states, which argue that the tech giant illegally abused its agreements with phone makers and browsers to become the default search engine, quashing its rivals.
Those monopolistic practices are how Google got so big, the government says, as the company became synonymous with looking up information on the web. Google has cornered 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to one data analysis firm.
At the helm of Google's legal strategy is Kent Walker, a top lawyer at the company for almost 20 years. He says he will argue that Google's partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers should have easy access to the services they like most.
But if Google loses the case, the company could be forced to pay damages and limit its search distribution deals, leading to fewer users and a drop in its robust profits. And not only could a ruling against Google sap it of its power and influence, the case could also have a ripple effect on other large internet companies that have enjoyed decades of almost unfettered growth.
"It's definitely a lifestyle associated with him and his personality and his music that he created."

David Tolley, who took over as chief executive at the co-working company WeWork, which still has hundreds of locations despite its implosion in 2019.

Toyota's Electric Vehicles Could Use a Boost: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The world's largest carmaker dominates the sales of hybrid cars but has been slow to sell all-electric vehicles, alienating some customers and hurting sales.
Rachel Culin considered herself a Toyota loyalist, one of millions of people who appreciated the company's reliable and fuel-efficient hybrids. But she recently bought an electric Chevrolet Bolt to replace her Toyota Prius because the Japanese automaker had been too slow when it came to selling electric vehicles.
"Where are the options for those people who love Toyota?" Ms. Culin, a resident of Mesa, Ariz., said. "It's really sad."
Once the leading brand for environmentally conscious car owners, Toyota has failed to keep up with changing consumer preferences and a push by governments around the world to greatly reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.
The company and the Japanese auto industry are facing the biggest business challenge they have confronted since becoming global giants in the 1980s. How they respond could determine whether they remain at the top of the auto industry or become afterthoughts.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is the nucleus of power for the country's large auto industry. It has alliances with smaller automakers like Subaru and Mazda and wields enormous influence over government officials and industry groups. The company is also a major employer in the United States, with nearly 30,000 workers in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and other states.
Its business decisions can have far-reaching economic and environmental implications. Toyota arguably did more to improve fuel efficiency and cut emissions than any other established automaker by pioneering hybrid cars that augment a gasoline engine with a battery and an electric motor. But having staked so much on hybrids, it has moved slowly to cars that produce no tailpipe emissions.
That has opened room for Tesla and BYD, a Chinese automaker, to challenge Toyota's dominance by offering appealing and affordable battery electric cars. Toyota has lost market share in the United States, and its sales in China have fallen.
Japanese carmakers have been here before. But last time they were the insurgents.
In the 1970s, with fuel prices soaring, Americans began replacing gas-guzzling cars with small, fuel-efficient Japanese models, challenging the dominance of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
Toyota's manufacturing methods became synonymous with manufacturing efficiency, and many factories adopted what became known as the "Toyota way" or "Toyota method."
Today, Toyota is the one learning from rivals. The company is adopting techniques from Tesla. In China, it has teamed up with BYD in the hope of absorbing its electric motor and battery technology.
"The stage of the battle has changed," said Sanshiro Fukao, a senior research fellow at the Itochu Research Institute, and "the Japanese auto industry in particular has been very slow to act."
Toyota may no longer be able to take its time.
During the pandemic, the global automotive market passed a milestone that caught the world's major automakers flat-footed. In 2022, sales of electric vehicles surged nearly 70 percent to 7.7 million, surpassing those of hybrid-electric vehicles for the first time as demand skyrocketed in China, according to IDTechEx, a market research consultancy.
Toyota remains highly profitable, earning $ 8.9 billion in the quarter that ended on June 30. Last year, it sold 10.5 million vehicles, eight times as many as Tesla. But fewer than 1 percent of the cars it sold were fully electric vehicles.
The absence of electric vehicles has been especially costly in China, the world's largest car market. In July, Toyota's sales in China were down over 15 percent from a year earlier.
In the United States, Toyota's sales have increased, but less than other automakers. From June to August, the company's share of the passenger car market slipped to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Cox Automotive.
The story is much the same for other Japanese automakers like Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Even Nissan, which began selling the Leaf electric car in 2010, has fallen behind, failing to produce a car that could rival Tesla's Model 3 in range, performance or design. Nissan accounted for less than 2 percent of the electric car market in the United States in the first half of the year. In China, it expects sales could drop by almost a quarter in the current fiscal year.
In May the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit organization, rated the 20 largest automakers on their progress toward zero emissions. Five of the six companies with the lowest scores were Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki.
Foreign automakers in China produced electric models designed to placate regulators rather than appeal to consumers, said Christopher Richter, senior research analyst at CLSA, an investment firm.
"They didn't make them as great as they could, and they were behind the learning curve," he said.
Toyota has tacitly acknowledged that it has fallen far behind Tesla and BYD. The decision in January by the Toyota scion Akio Toyoda to step down as chief executive was widely seen as a recognition that the company needed new leadership to navigate the transformation of the auto industry.
The sense of urgency was compounded by the Shanghai auto show in April, said Tatsuya Otani, a journalist who has spent decades reporting on the Japanese auto industry.
Chinese vehicles at the show featured onboard controls and entertainment options that made them look more like iPhones on wheels than traditional cars. Japanese executives were stunned to see how much progress their Chinese rivals had made, Mr. Otani said.
Toyota declined to make executives available for interviews.
The only all-electric Toyota sold in the United States is the bZ4X, a sport utility vehicle that the company recalled last year because faulty bolts could cause the wheels to fall off -- an embarrassing misstep. In China, the company also offers an electric sedan, the BZ3. (Toyota's Lexus division sells one fully electric model in the United States and two in some countries.)
On returning from Shanghai, Toyota executives ordered employees to rush out a presentation on the company's plans for its electric vehicle production. Toyota shared the plan less than two weeks before the company's annual meeting, where shareholders, angered by the slow progress on battery-powered cars, proposed a resolution pushing the company to disclose its climate change lobbying.
The measure did not pass, but the rare expression of dissent was an indication of how Toyota, once praised as a paragon of clean tech, had fallen out of favor.
"They just are not moving quickly enough to E.V.s at a time when that is where the market and the planet are going," said Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, which owns more than $ 100 million in Toyota stock through its pension funds and backed the resolution.
The company has disputed that characterization, arguing that hybrid cars can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions more and faster than battery electric vehicles, which remain too expensive for many buyers.
Factoring in a cleaner manufacturing process for hybrid cars and the limited availability of critical battery materials, such as lithium, hybrids are a safer short-term bet, Toyota executives have said in recent public statements.
In Washington, the company has called for less stringent auto emission limits, saying in July that a proposed new standard "underestimates key challenges including the scarcity of minerals to make batteries, the fact that these minerals are not mined or refined in the U.S., the inadequate infrastructure and the high cost" of electric vehicles.
"When they do math, the effect on the environment is far greater for hybrids," said Jeffrey Liker, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on Toyota. "In addition to that, they make a whole lot more money."
Sales of all-electric vehicles are growing faster than hybrids. But some analysts predict that hybrid sales will surge as would-be electric vehicle buyers worry that the public charging network is inadequate and unreliable. If that happens, Toyota's strategy could be vindicated.
Anita Rajan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in the United States, said Japanese automakers were biding their time until they could make electric cars that were as reliable and affordable as the gasoline vehicles.
"I don't know if there's a benefit in being first to market with these vehicles," Ms. Rajan said. "I think it's how you're entering the market and the thoughtfulness that you show for your customers."
In Toyota's home market, consumers have shown little appetite for battery electric cars, and the government has been reluctant to aggressively push for change in a profitable industry.
That could be a problem for Japanese carmakers, which have traditionally honed their technology at home before marketing it abroad, said Kazutoshi Tominaga, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which has worked with Japan's trade ministry to shape national electric vehicle policy.
"If Japan, as a market, doesn't shift to electrification, we don't have a place to test the product," he said.
Yet BYD has opened 10 dealerships in Japan and plans to have 100 by the end of 2025. The company went so far as to release a video in August calling on Chinese automakers to "demolish the old legends," widely interpreted as a reference to Japanese and Western automakers.
On a recent Sunday, prospective buyers waited patiently to take a BYD S.U.V. for a spin around the Tokyo neighborhood Ikebukuro. Salespeople were quick to point out the car's eligibility for thousands of dollars in subsidies from Japan's trade ministry, which has allocated $ 90 billion to promote battery electric cars.
Two nearby Toyota showrooms were largely empty.
Customers are "satisfied" with the current options, said Masaki Nagasawa, the deputy manager of a Toyota dealership in Tokyo. "For people who are wavering, subsidies are an incentive to buy," but most customers are anxious about electric cars' range and prefer hybrids, he said.
Toyota has said it is working on new production techniques and innovative battery technology that would increase its cars' range and reduce the time it takes to charge them. The company has said that its lineup will include 10 new all-electric vehicles by 2026 and that it will aim to sell 3.5 million of them annually by 2030.
Speaking on Wednesday in Tokyo after the unveiling of a new luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle, Simon Humphries, who is in charge of branding and design and is a director on Toyota's board, said the company was releasing new electric options "month by month, year by year."
But, he added, while there is an "urgency" to introduce new battery-powered cars, "there's urgency in every segment."
Electric vehicle companies are moving fast.
Tesla is on track to sell nearly two million electric cars this year and is building a factory in Mexico, where it is expected to make a car that sells for around $ 25,000. In the United States, the company's Model 3 sedan already sells for about as much as a comparably equipped Toyota Camry after federal and state incentives are taken into account.
BYD is rapidly expanding outside China, including in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its extensive electric lineup includes models that are cheaper than Toyota's most affordable sedans and a mammoth luxury S.U.V. that sells for around $ 150,000.
Just as Apple, Google and Samsung quickly displaced Nokia and BlackBerry in the mobile phone business, some analysts say, Tesla and BYD could be so far ahead in making electric cars by 2026 that Toyota might struggle to catch up.
But Japanese officials are more sanguine.
People own cars longer, so the transition will not be as fast as with cellphones, said Naoki Kobayashi, a deputy director of the trade ministry's automobile division.
He acknowledges that Toyota faces a big challenge, but, he added, "unlike with smartphones, we've still got time."

A Behemoth Turns to Its Ace In Its Biggest Antitrust Fight Yet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant is facing the greatest legal threat in its history, and hopes the stolid approach of Kent Walker, its top lawyer, will once again prevail.
When the government started an antitrust investigation into Google, one of the company's top lawyers, Kent Walker, said the solution was not a charm offensive. Google just needed to explain how its business functioned.
It was 2009, and the Federal Trade Commission was assessing whether Google had rigged technology markets in its favor. Mr. Walker's plan worked. The company agreed to a few small business practice changes in a 2013 settlement and maintained its search engine dominance for another decade.
Now, Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are facing their most significant legal challenge. They are preparing to face off next week in federal court against the Justice Department and a collection of states, which claim the tech giant illegally abused its monopoly power to keep its search engine on top.
The Justice Department has argued that Google illegally used agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung, as well as internet browsers like Mozilla, to be the default search engine for their users, preventing smaller rivals from getting access to that business.
The court fight -- the most important antitrust case since the Justice Department took on Microsoft 25 years ago -- strikes at the heart of Alphabet's $ 1.7 trillion empire and could strip power and influence away from the world's most successful internet company.
If Google loses and a judge then approves remedies, it could eventually be forced to restructure in some way, and it could be subject to damages and a prohibition on search distribution deals. That would translate to fewer users, deflated profits and perhaps even limits on how Google is able to innovate with new technologies like artificial intelligence.
To fend off the regulators' claims, Google needs to convince Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that Google's decades of dominance are due to its superior product, not abusive tactics.
The company is counting on Mr. Walker, 62, once again. Since being hired as Google's general counsel in 2006, Mr. Walker has been an architect of the company's legal strategy, overseeing a victory in a protracted courtroom showdown with rival Oracle and a case that could have held Google liable for users' social media posts. Both legal fights went to the Supreme Court.
That Mr. Walker is defending an industry giant against the monopoly claims of regulators is an odd turnabout in his long career. He grew up in Palo Alto, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, and graduated from Harvard and Stanford Law School. Starting in 1990, he spent five formative years at the Justice Department, where he worked on the prosecution of Kevin Mitnick, once the most wanted hacker in the country.
In 1997, Mr. Walker began a pivotal four-year tenure at the pioneering internet company Netscape as deputy general counsel, bringing him into the landmark antitrust proceedings against Microsoft. The Windows company was accused of bundling its products together to snuff out other web browsers, including Netscape's Navigator.
In a recent interview, Mr. Walker argued that he is still fighting for the same thing -- that consumers should have easy access to the services they like the most. He discussed the case in societal terms, framing it as a battle over how much innovation is permissible under American antitrust law and a fight that will have "important implications for the tech sector."
Mr. Walker has dozens of in-house lawyers and hundreds of other employees helping on the antitrust case, he said. Google has also hired three law firms to take the lead on the litigation.
John E. Schmidtlein, an experienced antitrust lawyer and a partner at the law firm Williams & Connolly, will lead Google's courtroom defense. Wendy W.H. Waszmer, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, will also argue for Google in court. They will have three weeks to make their case after the Justice Department and attorneys general from 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam make theirs.
The company contends that it faces stiff competition from a number of alternative services where consumers can find products and information online, including Amazon and TikTok.
Google also argues that its partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers can change their default search engine in five or fewer steps on these phones. The company will also point out that when users open a Safari browser on an iPhone, they can see quick links to a variety of other services besides Google, including Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia.
The search giant will also seek to undermine the premise of the Justice Department's suit, claiming that the government has used antitrust law in a novel way to punish the company because of its popularity.
"American law should be about promoting benefits for consumers: that's lower price, that's more innovation, that's more opportunity," Mr. Walker said. "If we move away from that and make it harder for companies to provide great goods and services for consumers, that's going to be bad for everyone."
Gregory Rosston, Stanford's public policy program director, said both sides would argue about whether the search market would be more competitive if Google did not have default-search agreements.
"Google is going to argue Apple had no interest in developing a search engine," Dr. Rosston said. "They do search in Siri and other things, but they're not very good at it. The government is going to say, well, they could have done it or they could have done a deal with Bing or some other start-up search engine, and maybe people would have done more searches with those."
"Generally, antitrust laws take a dim view of agreements between competitors to divide up or not enter a market," he added.
For nearly two decades, Google executives have depended on Mr. Walker to protect the company from high-stakes litigation. But at times, Mr. Walker has also had to simply explain how the legal system works. Harry Litman, a friend and former Justice Department colleague of Mr. Walker, recounted a story he shared at a reunion for U.S. attorneys several years ago.
Mr. Walker was in a meeting with Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, discussing a spate of lawsuits around the world, Mr. Litman said. One of the co-founders asked: Why can't we have a single judge in every country who would get up to speed on the internet and oversee lawsuits against us?
Mr. Walker "was chuckling about his job, having to explain to these extremely rational people why the law doesn't always work in such a rational way," Mr. Litman said.
Despite what colleagues and friends describe as Mr. Walker's Boy Scout persona, his team can be known for hardball tactics, legal opponents say. David Boies, who successfully prosecuted Microsoft for the Justice Department more than 20 years ago, said Google failed to produce documents, denied all liability and fought for every inch.
Mr. Boies is suing Google in two civil cases, including one that accuses the company of tracking users without their knowledge while in its web browser's Incognito mode. He said he had gotten sanctions against Google twice, including a million-dollar penalty, for failing to deliver relevant evidence.
"They hold the ground until it breaks," he said. "They don't bend."

Full text: In opening a brick and mortar store, Elorea broadens the offerings of the perfumery.
Inside Elorea, a sleek new Korean perfumery in Manhattan's NoLIta neighborhood, whose name is a portmanteau of "elements" and "Korea," you will find paintings and pottery by Korean and Korean American artists, a cafe offering a chocolate and perfume pairing and shop attendants dressed entirely in black, eager to explain the brand's gender-neutral fragrance collections.
"Even though I've never heard of a Korean perfume brand, I just figured it's going to be on another level," said Albert Chun, 36, a customer whose parents immigrated from Seoul to Oakland, Calif., in the mid-1980s. "We're such proud people," he added with a half-laugh.
"In our heads, in everyone's heads, Korea is the capital of the world in terms of beauty," said Wonny Lee who, along with his wife, Su min Park, founded Elorea as an online perfumery business last year.
Korean beauty, or K-beauty, is just one stream in the surging "hallyu," or Korean wave, sweeping over the world through K-dramas, K-pop and Korean technology. This wave of cultural and material exports has helped South Korea transform itself into a global economic powerhouse.
And yet, when Ms. Park, 35, and Mr. Lee, 36, walked through a department store in Seoul in 2019, they were surprised to find a lack of Korean perfume brands.
"Korea and Asia in general have very deep and rich relationships with scent, but it's just so, so underrepresented in the current market," Ms. Park said.
With Mr. Lee's background in e-commerce and marketing at Samsung, the gaming accessories manufacturer Turtle Beach and the direct-to-consumer footwear company Greats, and Ms. Park's experience as a photographer and art director with clients including Ann Taylor, Alexis Bittar and Fekkai, the couple decided to create their own Korean perfumery.
But what exactly constitutes a "Korean perfumery"?
"We didn't want to just slap, like, 'K' in front of it because we're Korean founders," said Mr. Lee, whose parents immigrated from Seoul to Queens in 1984. Ms. Park, whose family left Seoul for Brooklyn in 1998 when she was 10, agreed, noting how some beauty companies might call a product "Japanese" simply because they use cherry blossoms in their branding.
"We had to dig deeper," Ms. Park said. "We have to talk about our history. We have to talk about our culture and what it means -- what the scent means."
Everything in the store rings with symbolism. The curved base of the shop's display table is modeled after a traditional Korean roof tile. The store's stark black and white color scheme expresses the Korean flag's philosophy of "taegeuk," or "great polarity." The four scents in Elorea's foundational collection "The Elements," are inspired by the four trigrams adorning the Korean flag, representing earth, sky, fire and water.
According to Mr. Lee, the four perfumes in "The Elements" mirror the four major olfactory classifications on typical fragrance wheels: floral (sky), fresh (water), woody (earth) and warm and spicy (fire). "I was staring at the Korean flag, and I was staring at the fragrance wheel," Mr. Lee recalled. "And I was like, 'There's no way this can be; it's too perfect."'
Ms. Park spearheaded Elorea's second fragrance line, "The Forgotten Words," basing the collection on words that are native to Korea but no longer in common parlance.
The perfume called "Gentle Shower" is redolent of the Korean word "jambi," which, according to Ms. Park, means a sudden rain that allows farmers to rest. One of the perfume's top notes is perilla leaf, a minty, licorice-like herb frequently used in Korean cooking.
For Ms. Park, Elorea provides an opportunity to reunite with the country she was estranged from when she was young. "Part of me was always back at home," she said.
Elorea allows Mr. Lee to cultivate a greater sense of Korean pride and identity as someone who, because of racism he experienced as a boy and his desire to fit in, didn't always want to be Korean growing up. He recounted a conversation he had with his friend, the chef Hooni Kim, 51, whose restaurant Danji was the first Korean restaurant ever to win a Michelin star, in 2011.
Mr. Kim asked Mr. Lee, "Why are you so into telling Korea's story?"
Mr. Lee responded, "I personally feel like Elorea is my ask for forgiveness to my younger self, my deepest apology."
The couple have intentionally incorporated the work of other Koreans and Korean Americans in their store, like custom drinks from the popular Korean coffee brand Gute Leute, and a bright blue painting by the Korean artist Son il hanging by the front door.
More than just a perfume store, they hope that Elorea will provide an evolving, multisensory space to showcase and celebrate Korean culture.
"We want to work with entrepreneurs, we want to work with artists," Mr. Lee said. "Because at the end of the day, their success will be our success."

Full text: The Senate majority leader helped deliver billions of dollars in federal funding for semiconductors. Now he's pushing for his state to reap benefits.
In a darkened hotel ballroom in San Jose, Calif., last November, the most powerful players in the semiconductor industry received a familiar sales pitch.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, appeared by video message to urge the industry titans at the Semiconductor Industry Association's annual awards dinner to work together to strengthen American manufacturing of a critical technology -- and to invest more in his home state, New York.
"I ask that more of the industry consider investing in the Empire State, and if you do, you'll find no greater champion in your corner than me, the Senate majority leader," Mr. Schumer said, to cheers and laughs of recognition from a crowd accustomed to the senator's solicitations.
Amid growing fears about China's dominance of technology and America's loss of competitiveness, Mr. Schumer helped rally Congress last year to push through the biggest industrial policy programs the United States had seen in a generation. The Biden administration is now preparing to invest tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. semiconductor industry in an effort to boost chip manufacturing across the country and lessen U.S. reliance on foreign factories.
If Mr. Schumer gets his way, a substantial part of that funding will flow to New York.
In his encounters with chip executives, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and President Biden himself, Mr. Schumer has openly and aggressively drawn on his political capital as majority leader to try to channel investment to his home state. During the months when Congress was debating whether to approve that funding, industry executives who set foot in Mr. Schumer's office or spoke to him on the flip phone he carries in his breast pocket were asked when, not if, they would invest in New York.
Mr. Schumer, a longtime China critic, primarily views the investments as critical to reducing America's reliance on Beijing for a technology that powers everything from cars and dishwashers to missiles and fighter jets. Most chip production has moved to Asia in recent decades, leaving the U.S. economy highly vulnerable to shortages, as became apparent during the pandemic.
But he also saw the opportunity to fulfill a more personal goal: securing investment that could revive the factory towns of his state, which had been hollowed out through decades of competition with China. The move would also augment his local political support, attract donations from chip companies to fill Democratic coffers and cement his legacy as a proponent of upstate New York.
"I cared about upstate, and I cared about competition with China," Mr. Schumer said in an interview in Albany in June. "When I drafted the legislation, I did things with New York companies in mind."
Senate majority leaders and other legislators have long used their clout to drive federal funds back home. But Mr. Schumer is capitalizing on his position at an opportune moment, as the United States prepares to invest nearly $ 53 billion in the sector, including $ 11 billion for chip research and $ 39 billion in manufacturing grants.
Still, some critics have cautioned that economic and strategic factors, not political influence, must determine the investment decisions that could shape the U.S. economy for decades to come.
If the proposed investments are realized, New York could become one of the country's busiest hubs for chip production. Chip makers like GlobalFoundries, IBM, Onsemi and Wolfspeed are applying for funds to build or expand facilities there. Micron Technology, a memory chip maker, is proposing to invest up to $ 100 billion near Syracuse over the next two decades to build what would be the largest high-tech chips facility proposed in the United States, employing up to 9,000 people.
Mr. Schumer is also pushing for New York to play a leading role in semiconductor research, as the headquarters of a new federal chip research organization.
Competition for federal funding is expected to be fierce. By late June, the Commerce Department -- which will dole out the funds -- had received nearly 400 statements of interest from companies that intended to apply for money.
"I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money," Ms. Raimondo said in February.
New York has already faced some setbacks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Intel, makers of the most cutting-edge types of logic chips, passed over the state in recent years in favor of Arizona, Texas and Ohio, where they are now building large facilities that could absorb a significant portion of government funding.
Chip industry executives say practical factors, like the cost of electricity, land and capital, the availability of workers and the proximity of their suppliers, weigh heaviest in their decisions about where to invest.
But the pressure from Mr. Schumer -- and from other influential lawmakers, university presidents and company executives who helped secure the funding -- raises questions about the role powerful political figures will play in the next chapter of American industrial policy.
"I think there is and ought to be a lot of skepticism about political players having a major say in decision making over where these funds are spent," said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University and the author of "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology."
"If you want effective industrial policy, you have to keep it as far away as possible from pork barrel politics," he said.
The Commerce Department has been hiring experts in finance and semiconductors to review company applications, and it has set up a selection committee to choose the board for the new research center, called the National Semiconductor Technology Center. The department appears to be trying to avoid any undue influence or favoritism.
"Our awards will be entirely dependent upon the strength of applications and which projects will advance U.S. economic and national security interests," the Commerce Department said in a statement.
Mr. Schumer insists that New York will win federal dollars on its own merits, but he is also explicit about the benefit his position brings. In June, as he walked the sunlit halls of the Albany NanoTech Complex, a long-running chip research and educational facility, Mr. Schumer said he "did not close out a single discussion" with a semiconductor company without encouraging it to invest in New York.
New York has five main advantages, he told executives: Skilled workers, stemming from New York's history of manufacturing. Cheap and plentiful water. Cheap hydropower. Shovel-ready sites for companies to build on.
"And fifth, they had the majority leader," he said.
In a yellow-lit clean room behind Mr. Schumer, workers in white protective suits were tending to hundreds of millions of dollars of advanced machinery. On tracks overhead, mechanized metal pails whizzed by carrying silicon wafers, each roughly the size of a record, to and from the machines, where they would be imprinted with layers of intricate circuitry.
Mr. Schumer paused to peer over his reading glasses at a smooth, white box the size of a mobile home: an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, made by the Dutch firm ASML, arguably the most advanced piece of machinery ever developed.
Albany NanoTech is the only public research facility in the United States with such a machine. The facility is applying for federal funding to build a new clean room in an adjacent parking lot, and it hopes to become home to part of the government's new research center.
"This is the perfect place," Mr. Schumer said. "When we wrote the CHIPS and Science bill to set up a National Semiconductor Technology Center, I had Albany in mind. And I'm pushing to get it."
Mr. Schumer said he had personally made that case to a parade of administration officials he brought through the state. That included Mr. Biden, who was pitched on New York's potential as the two men rode in a motorcade to hear Micron's investment announcement last October.
By his telling, Mr. Schumer's efforts on behalf of upstate New York are a personal mission, stemming in part from an early challenge from a political opponent who told voters that they would never see Mr. Schumer, a Brooklyn native, west of the Hudson River. As he watched companies like General Motors, General Electric and Carrier shutter their New York facilities, he said, he vowed to do something to stop the flow of young people out of the state.
Mr. Schumer had also been one of Congress's earliest China hawks, particularly on the issue of Chinese currency manipulation. During a workout in 2019 in the Senate gym, he began forming a plan with Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, to bolster the U.S. economy by dedicating over $ 100 billion to technology research.
It took two years -- and an aggressive, coordinated lobbying effort between government and industry -- to amass the support and momentum to turn that bill into law. Mr. Schumer and other key Republican and Democratic lawmakers enlisted company executives, university presidents and state officials to talk publicly about the importance of the funding, and put pressure on reluctant members of Congress.
Mr. Schumer also worked closely with Ms. Raimondo to push the bill forward. He called her frequently as obstacles arose, including during Sunday Mass and her daughter's 18th birthday party, she said in an interview in July 2022.
As the bill progressed, the prospect of funding for new U.S. factories touched off an elaborate game of courtship among legislators, state officials and companies.
The number of chip lobbyists in Washington multiplied. Companies like GlobalFoundries and Intel, which stood to benefit enormously from the legislation, hosted or attended fund-raisers and virtual events for Mr. Schumer in the months before the CHIPS Act was passed. From the beginning of 2021 through June 2023, political action committees linked with Mr. Schumer received more than $ 350,000 in donations from executives at chip companies and their suppliers, including $ 5,000 from Intel's chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, data from the Federal Election Commission shows.
New York played host to a series of chip companies considering potential investments, particularly for the plot that Micron now plans to build on. TSMC looked at the site in 2019 before it chose Arizona, and Intel considered the same location but ultimately chose Ohio.
Micron was ready to write off New York because the state did not have a big enough site, Ryan McMahon, the local county executive, said. To win the final bid, the county spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring land, including buying out a street of homeowners, and running gas and electricity to the site, he said.
"If Schumer didn't introduce us, it's one of those things you wonder if it ever would have happened," Mr. McMahon, a Republican, said.
Mr. Schumer, along with other proponents, secured an investment tax credit in the chips legislation that Micron saw as key to making the economics of the project work. And at the urging of Gov. Kathy Hochul, state lawmakers passed their own chips subsidy bill to complement the federal one, approving up to $ 500 million a year in tax abatements to chip manufacturers.
Micron has said it plans to start construction next year and complete the first $ 20 billion phase of the factory by 2030. New York State has promised to give Micron $ 5.5 billion in tax credits over the life of the project if the company meets certain employment targets.
As the biggest maker of memory chips with headquarters in the United States, Micron is seen as a likely candidate for a federal grant. But other developments have thrown the project into question: Micron has recently become the subject of a crackdown in China that could cost the company an eighth of its global revenue, potentially undercutting its ability to make ambitious investments.
The deal has also been met with skepticism from local government watchdogs, who fear that Micron will become the latest firm to be offered taxpayer subsidies but fail to deliver the promised economic impact.
"It might be good geostrategic policy for the United States," said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a watchdog focused on the New York government. "But for New York, it's an incredibly low return on the investment of subsidy dollars."
For both Mr. Schumer and Governor Hochul, the Micron investment became a centerpiece of their electoral strategy last fall. With Republicans on their way to the best statewide showing in two decades, both Democrats packaged clips of themselves with Micron's chief executive into TV ads that blanketed parts of the state otherwise wary of Democrats' economic agenda.
"Transformational for upstate New York, transformational for America," Mr. Schumer said in one.

A Chip Titan Can No Longer Stay Offstage In a Tech War: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a wood-paneled office overlooking Taipei and the jungle-covered mountains that surround the Taiwanese capital, Morris Chang recently pulled out an old book stamped with technicolor patterns.
It was titled "Introduction to VLSI Systems," a graduate-level textbook describing the intricacies of computer chip design. Mr. Chang, 92, held it up with reverence.
"I want to show you the date of this book, 1980," he said. The timing was important, he added, as it was "the earliest piece" in a puzzle that came together for him -- altering not only his career but also the course of the global electronics industry.
The insight that Mr. Chang gained from the textbook was deceptively simple: the idea that microchips, which act as the brains of computers, could be designed in one place but manufactured somewhere else. The notion went against the semiconductor industry's standard practice at the time.
So at the age of 54, when many people begin thinking more about retirement, Mr. Chang instead put himself on a path to turn his insight into a reality. The engineer left his adopted country, the United States, and moved to Taiwan where he founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. The company does not design chips, but it has become the world's biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge microprocessors for customers including Apple and Nvidia.
Today, the company that partially exists because of a textbook is a $ 500 billion juggernaut that has put the most advanced chips in iPhones, cars, supercomputers and fighter jets. So critical are its airplane-hangar-size chip factories, called fabs, that the United States, Japan and Europe have courted TSMC to build them in their neck of the woods. Over the past decade, China has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to recreate what TSMC has done.
Mr. Chang's unlikely entrepreneurial journey helped Taiwan become an economic giant, restructured the way the electronics industry worked and ultimately charted a new geopolitical reality in which a linchpin of global economic growth lies in one of the world's most volatile spots.
That has thrust Mr. Chang, and the company he created, into the spotlight. And at the twilight of his career, a man who has preferred to remain in the shadows reflected on what he has built and what it means to no longer be able to stay under the radar.
"It doesn't make me feel particularly good," said Mr. Chang, who retired in 2018 but still appears at TSMC events. "I would rather stay relatively unknown."
Over a recent three-hour discussion in his office, Mr. Chang made it clear that he identifies as American -- he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1962 -- at a time when the company he founded is at the center of a technological Cold War between the United States and China. Even as the rivalry for tech leadership intensifies, he does not give China much of a chance for semiconductor supremacy.
"We control all the choke points," Mr. Chang said, referring collectively to the United States and its chip-making allies such as the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. "China can't really do anything if we want to choke them."
More than a dozen people familiar with Mr. Chang, many of whom knew him as a colleague at TSMC, said he built the company -- and outmaneuvered giants like Samsung and Intel -- by being meticulous, stubborn, trusting his best people and, crucially, having boundless ambition and making daring moves when justified. When TSMC stumbled after the 2008 financial crisis, he returned as chief executive at age 77 to take over again.
"He's probably the only person left in the chip industry who was present at the creation of the industry itself," said Chris Miller, the author of the book "Chip War" and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. "That he's not only still in the industry but at the center and top of it is extraordinary."
To understand the tech industry's future, it is crucial to understand the world through Mr. Chang's eyes and how he made that initial bet when others didn't. And unlike today's tech moguls -- such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have publicly considered a cage fight -- Mr. Chang has shown more restraint. If competition between the global tech giants is a series of high-stakes poker games, he is the quiet man who runs the casino.
Almost an automaker
Mr. Chang was born in 1931 in a China on the brink of war. Before the age of 18, he lived in six cities, changed schools 10 times, experienced bombings in Guangzhou and Chongqing, and crossed the front lines as his family fled Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II.
When he made it to Hong Kong in 1948 with his family, who by then were trying to get away from the Chinese Communist Party's advancing army, there was no going back.
"My old world crumbled as the mainland changed its color, and a new world was yet to be established," he wrote in his autobiography, which was published in 1998.
In 1949, Mr. Chang moved to the United States, attending Harvard before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. In 1955, when he twice failed a qualifying exam for a doctoral degree at M.I.T., he decided to test out the job market.
"Many years later, I considered failing to be admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Ph.D. program as the greatest stroke of luck in my life!" he wrote in his autobiography.
Two of the best offers arrived from Ford Motor Company and Sylvania, a lesser-known electronics firm. Ford offered Mr. Chang $ 479 a month for a job at its research and development center in Detroit. Though charmed by the company's recruiters, Mr. Chang was surprised to find the offer was $ 1 less than the $ 480 a month that Sylvania offered.
When he called Ford to ask for a matching offer, the recruiter, who had previously been kind, turned hostile and told him he would not get a cent more. Mr. Chang took the engineering job with Sylvania. There, he learned about transistors, the microchip's most basic component.
"That was the start of my semiconductor career," he said. "In retrospect, it was a damn good thing."
Three years at Sylvania opened doors and cemented Mr. Chang's passion for semiconductors. But Sylvania struggled, teaching him a lesson that would inform how he later ran TSMC.
"From the beginning, the semiconductor industry has been a fast-paced and unforgiving industry," Mr. Chang wrote of Sylvania's eventual collapse in his autobiography. "Once you fall behind, catching up becomes considerably difficult."
In 1958, he jumped to a buzzy new semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. The Dallas company was "youthful and energetic," with many employees working over 50 hours a week and sleeping overnight in the office. Four years later, Mr. Chang became an American, an identity he considers primary.
"Ever since I fled Communist China and went to the United States and became naturalized in 1962, my identity has always been American, and nothing else," he said.
Mr. Chang became a pillar of Texas Instruments' then world-beating semiconductor business. Breakthroughs were constant. In the 1970s, the firm produced a chip that could synthesize the human voice, which led to the famed Speak & Spell toy, a hand-held device that helped children with spelling and pronunciation.
"It's just like Camelot, but it was not a long period of time," he said.
In the late 1970s, Texas Instruments turned its focus to the burgeoning market for calculators, digital watches and home computers. Mr. Chang, then in charge of the semiconductor side, realized his career there was approaching a "dead end."
It was time for something different.
Putting the puzzle pieces together
If the first puzzle piece that led to TSMC's creation was the textbook, the second was an experience that Mr. Chang had toward the end of his time at Texas Instruments.
In the early 1980s, Texas Instruments opened a chip factory in Japan. Three months after the production line began churning out chips, the plant's "yield" was double that of the company's factories in Texas. Yield is a key statistic that refers to how many usable chips emerge from production.
Mr. Chang was dispatched to Japan to solve the yield mystery. The key was the staff, he found, with turnover surprisingly low among well-qualified employees.
But try as it might, Texas Instruments could not find the same caliber of technicians in the United States. At one U.S. plant, the top candidate for a supervisor job had a degree in French literature and no engineering background. The future of advanced manufacturing appeared to be in Asia.
In 1984, Mr. Chang joined General Instrument, another chip firm, where a third puzzle piece fell into place. He met an entrepreneur who later started a company that would only design chips without also making them, which was then uncommon. He spotted a trend that would prove to have staying power: Today most semiconductor companies design chips and outsource manufacturing.
This final piece coincided with Taiwan's transition from a labor-intensive and heavy industry economy to a high-tech one. When Taiwanese officials set their sights on developing the semiconductor industry, they asked Mr. Chang, whose reputation as a chip expert was established, to lead an institute for supercharging innovation.
So in 1985, Mr. Chang, then 54, left the United States for a place he knew only from several visits to a Texas Instruments factory.
"I certainly had no plan to spend nearly so much time in Taiwan," he said. "I thought I was going back in maybe just a few years, and I really had no plan to set up TSMC, to set up any company in Taiwan."
Within weeks of Mr. Chang's arrival, Li Kwoh-ting, a government official who became known as the godfather of Taiwan's tech development, asked him to make the state-led chip project commercially viable.
When Mr. Chang assessed Taiwan's strengths and weaknesses, he sensed an opening. "I concluded that Taiwan was a lot more similar to Japan than the U.S.," he said, referring to his experience with the Texas Instruments' factory in Japan.
In 1987, Mr. Chang founded TSMC. The business model was clear in his head: TSMC would make chips for other companies and not design them. That meant it just had to win over those inside the industry and then focus on what it could do best -- manufacturing.
From the get-go, Mr. Chang had plans for TSMC to tap into a global market. He introduced professional management systems, which were uncommon in Taiwan, at the company. To foster an international environment, internal communications were in English.
His vision proved prophetic. As semiconductors became more complex and expensive to produce, only a few firms could even afford to try. Making chips involves hundreds of steps that pull on advanced lasers and chemical manipulations to create tiny pathways for electronic signals that do the most basic calculations for a computer. Costs were astronomical.
Over the years, Mr. Chang kept going as others dropped out. If TSMC could attract enough customers, leveraging economies of scale, it had a chance to take out the kings: Intel and Samsung.
In 1997, Mr. Chang recruited a new head of research of development, Chiang Shang-yi. He told Mr. Chiang to benchmark TSMC against the industry leader, Intel.
"Our goal is to be No. 1, barring none," Mr. Chang said.
Mr. Chiang was surprised. "To be No. 1, you have to spend three times as much as your next competitor," he replied, implying that being in the lead would be too lofty and costly a goal.
"It may be three times, but I do want to spend enough so that we become No. 1," Mr. Chang said. And he was prepared to be patient, even after stepping down as TSMC's chief executive in 2005 and staying on as the company's chairman.
Closing the Apple contract
In April 2009, angry TSMC employees -- many who had recently been let go by the company -- set up a protest camp at a leafy playground in Taipei's quiet residential neighborhood of Dazhi. They were down the street from Mr. Chang's upscale apartment building.
As dark fell, the protesters rolled out sleeping bags next to a slide and jungle gym, covering themselves with a large sign that read "TSMC lies lies lies." Throughout its more than two-decade history, TSMC had never laid off employees. Yet after the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Chang's successor, Rick Tsai, began letting employees go.
Mr. Chang, then 77, decided he could no longer stay on the sidelines. He took back his job, rehired the talent Mr. Tsai had let go and more than doubled TSMC's spending.
Coming at a tough time for the industry, the move was not appreciated by investors. Elizabeth Sun, TSMC's former head of investor relations, recalled her reaction to the news: "When I heard it, I felt like banging my head against a wall."
But the bet paid off. In 2010, Mr. Chang got the call that would turbocharge TSMC's growth and clinch its lead over Samsung and Intel. Jeff Williams, a senior vice president at Apple, reached out through Mr. Chang's wife, Sophie Chang, who is a relative of Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, Apple's largest assembler.
The call led to a Sunday dinner with all four of them, which turned into negotiations the next day. Apple had worked with Samsung to produce the microchip it designed for the iPhone, but it was looking for a new partner, partly because Samsung had become a major smartphone competitor. TSMC, which does not compete with its customers, was in pole position for the contract.
The discussions stretched on for months. "It was very complicated -- the contract itself," Mr. Chang said. "It was the first time we ran into this kind of thing."
At one point, Apple announced a two-month pause in talks. Mr. Chang heard Intel might have intervened.
Worried, Mr. Chang flew to San Francisco to meet Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, who reassured him. In a 2013 interview, Paul Otellini, then Intel's chief executive, said he had turned down the chance to make the chips for the iPhone because Apple would not pay enough.
Mr. Chang would not make the same mistake. Apple demanded better terms and lower prices than others, but he understood the contract's scale would help TSMC rocket past competitors. That was a lesson he learned from Bill Bain, who founded the consulting firm Bain & Company, back at Texas Instruments.
Mr. Bain, then a consultant for Boston Consulting Group, had worked in an office next to Mr. Chang for almost two years. He had analyzed Texas Instruments' production and sales numbers and argued that the more the company produced, the better it would perform.
When the deal with Apple was complete, Mr. Chang borrowed $ 7 billion to build the capacity for making millions of chips for the iPhone.
In the ensuing years, Apple briefly turned to Samsung for iPhone chip production again, but TSMC became its primary chip maker. Apple is now TSMC's largest client, accounting for about 20 percent of revenue.
Mr. Chang remains cautious about what he says about TSMC's customers even now. After beginning a story about Apple at his office, he wondered whether he had said too much.
"I don't think I have exceeded Apple's limits of what to tell you," he said.
In a statement, Mr. Williams, now Apple's chief operating officer, said Mr. Chang had "pushed the semiconductor industry to new frontiers."
In 2018, Mr. Chang, at 86 years old, retired again. By then, TSMC had succeeded where others lagged, mass producing chips with electronic pathways the size of a DNA double helix. That gave Mr. Chang confidence that he had achieved a key tenet for TSMC: technological leadership.
Spurring the A.I. revolution
Among the awards and photos with world leaders that stud the walls of Mr. Chang's Taipei office, one is a framed comic portraying his close relationship with Jensen Huang, a founder of the chip firm Nvidia.
If Apple turbocharged TSMC, it was Mr. Chang who helped make Nvidia the world's most important designer of artificial intelligence chips. The cartoon tells the story. In the mid-1990s, when Nvidia was a start-up, Mr. Huang sent a letter to Mr. Chang asking if TSMC would make its chips. After a call with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chang agreed.
"I liked him," Mr. Chang said of Mr. Huang.
By taking that chance, Mr. Chang helped spur the A.I. revolution in the United States. With TSMC's manufacturing, Nvidia became the world's most important A.I. chip designer. Breakthroughs like generative A.I. rely on huge numbers of Nvidia chips to find patterns in vast amounts of data.
In a 2018 speech at Mr. Chang's retirement gathering, Mr. Huang said Nvidia -- now worth $ 1 trillion -- would not exist without TSMC. An inscription on the comic, which Mr. Huang gave to Mr. Chang, reads: "Your career is a masterpiece -- a Beethoven's Ninth Symphony."
For Mr. Chang, the final notes of that masterpiece have not yet been played. He is healthy for a nonagenarian, though he can no longer smoke a pipe -- once his trademark in photos -- after he had stents put into his heart a few years ago.
At his office, he still keeps a Bloomberg terminal. He also makes regular public appearances around Taiwan to discuss global politics and the economy. Like many, he worries about a potential conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan, though he believes the chance of such a confrontation is low.
"The chance of China invading Taiwan, amphibious warfare and all that stuff, I think that's a very, very low probability," he said. "A blockade of some kind, I think I still put it as low probability, but it's still a chance and I want to avoid that."
Mr. Chang said he was not worried about U.S. policies that have cut off Chinese firms from access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology.
"I think it's still OK," he said, though he noted U.S. companies would lose business and China would find ways to fight back.
As the conversation wound down, Mr. Chang said he had some regrets that he could not be in the driver's seat as TSMC faces geopolitical challenges. But he said the timing of his retirement in 2018 made sense, driven by technology and not politics.
"I was literally sure that we had achieved technology leadership," he said of that time. "I don't think we'll lose it."

TAIPEI, Taiwan — In a wood-paneled office overlooking Taipei and the jungle-covered mountains that surround the Taiwanese capital, Morris Chang recently pulled out an old book stamped with technicolor patterns.
It was titled “Introduction to VLSI Systems,” a graduate-level textbook describing the intricacies of computer chip design. Chang, 92, held it up with reverence.
“I want to show you the date of this book, 1980,” he said. The timing was important, he added, as it was “the earliest piece” in a puzzle that came together for him — altering not only his career but the course of the global electronics industry.
The insight that Chang gained from the textbook was deceptively simple: the idea that microchips, which act as the brains of computers, could be designed in one place but manufactured somewhere else. The notion went against the semiconductor industry’s standard practice at the time.
So at the age of 54, when many people begin thinking more about retirement, Chang instead put himself on a path to turn his insight into a reality. The engineer left his adopted country, the United States, and moved to Taiwan where he founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. The company does not design chips, but it has become the world’s biggest manufacturer of cutting-edge microprocessors for customers including Apple and Nvidia.
Today, the company that partially exists because of a textbook is a $500 billion juggernaut that has put the most-advanced chips in iPhones, cars, supercomputers and fighter jets. So critical are its airplane-hangar-size chip factories, called fabs, that the United States, Japan and Europe have courted TSMC to build them in their neck of the woods. Over the past decade, China has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to re-create what TSMC has done.
Chang’s unlikely entrepreneurial journey helped Taiwan become an economic giant, restructured the way the electronics industry worked and ultimately charted a new geopolitical reality in which a linchpin of global economic growth lies in one of the world’s most volatile spots.
That has thrust Chang, and the company he created, into the spotlight. And at the twilight of his career, a man who has preferred to remain in the shadows reflected on what he has built and what it means to no longer be able to stay under the radar.
“It doesn’t make me feel particularly good,” said Chang, who retired in 2018 but still appears at TSMC events. “I would rather stay relatively unknown.”
Over a recent three-hour discussion in his office, Chang made it clear that he identifies as American — he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1962 — at a time when the company he founded is at the center of a technological cold war between the United States and China. Even as the rivalry for tech leadership intensifies, he does not give China much of a chance for semiconductor supremacy.
“We control all the chokepoints,” Chang said, referring collectively to the United States and its chipmaking allies such as the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. “China can’t really do anything if we want to choke them.”
More than a dozen people familiar with Chang, many of whom knew him as a colleague at TSMC, said he built the company — and outmaneuvered giants such as Samsung and Intel — by being meticulous, stubborn, trusting his best people and, crucially, having boundless ambition and making daring moves when justified. When TSMC stumbled after the 2008 financial crisis, he returned as CEO at age 77 to take over again.
“He’s probably the only person left in the chip industry who was present at the creation of the industry itself,” said Chris Miller, author of the book “Chip War” and an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “That he’s not only still in the industry but at the center and top of it is extraordinary.”
To understand the tech industry’s future, it is crucial to understand the world through Chang’s eyes and how he made that initial bet when others didn’t. And unlike today’s tech moguls — such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have publicly considered a cage fight — Chang has shown more restraint. If competition between the global tech giants is a series of high-stakes poker games, he is the quiet man who runs the casino.
Almost an automaker
Chang was born in 1931 in a China on the brink of war. Before the age of 18, he lived in six cities, changed schools 10 times, experienced bombings in Guangzhou and Chongqing, and crossed the front lines as his family fled Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II.
When he made it to Hong Kong in 1948 with his family, who by then were trying to get away from the Chinese Communist Party’s advancing army, there was no going back.
“My old world crumbled as the mainland changed its color, and a new world was yet to be established,” he wrote in his autobiography, which was published in 1998.
In 1949, Chang moved to the United States, attending Harvard before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study mechanical engineering. In 1955, when he twice failed a qualifying exam for a doctoral degree at MIT, he decided to test out the job market.
“Many years later, I considered failing to be admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Ph.D. program as the greatest stroke of luck in my life!” he wrote in his autobiography.
Two of the best offers arrived from Ford Motor Co. and Sylvania, a lesser-known electronics firm. Ford offered Chang $479 a month for a job at its research and development center in Detroit. Though charmed by the company’s recruiters, Chang was surprised to find the offer was $1 less than the $480 a month that Sylvania offered.
When he called Ford to ask for a matching offer, the recruiter, who had previously been kind, turned hostile and told him he would not get a cent more. Chang took the engineering job with Sylvania. There, he learned about transistors, the microchip’s most basic component.
“That was the start of my semiconductor career,” he said. “In retrospect, it was a damn good thing.”
Three years at Sylvania opened doors and cemented Chang’s passion for semiconductors. But Sylvania struggled, teaching him a lesson that would inform how he later ran TSMC.
“From the beginning, the semiconductor industry has been a fast-paced and unforgiving industry,” Chang wrote of Sylvania’s eventual collapse in his autobiography. “Once you fall behind, catching up becomes considerably difficult.”
In 1958, he jumped to a buzzy new semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. The Dallas company was “youthful and energetic,” with many employees working more than 50 hours a week and sleeping overnight in the office. Four years later, Chang became an American, an identity he considers primary.
“Ever since I fled Communist China and went to the United States and became naturalized in 1962, my identity has always been American, and nothing else,” he said.
Chang became a pillar of Texas Instruments’ then-world-beating semiconductor business. Breakthroughs were constant. In the 1970s, the firm produced a chip that could synthesize the human voice, which led to the famed Speak & Spell toy, a hand-held device that helped children with spelling and pronunciation.
“It’s just like Camelot, but it was not a long period of time,” he said.
In the late 1970s, Texas Instruments turned its focus to the burgeoning market for calculators, digital watches and home computers. Chang, then in charge of the semiconductor side, realized his career there was approaching a “dead end.”
It was time for something different.
Putting the puzzle pieces together
If the first puzzle piece that led to TSMC’s creation was the textbook, the second was an experience that Chang had toward the end of his time at Texas Instruments.
In the early 1980s, Texas Instruments opened a chip factory in Japan. Three months after the production line began churning out chips, the plant’s “yield” was double that of the company’s factories in Texas. Yield is a key statistic that refers to how many usable chips emerge from production.
Chang was dispatched to Japan to solve the yield mystery. The key was the staff, he found, with turnover surprisingly low among well-qualified employees.
But try as it might, Texas Instruments could not find the same caliber of technicians in the United States. At one U.S. plant, the top candidate for a supervisor job had a degree in French literature and no engineering background. The future of advanced manufacturing appeared to be in Asia.
In 1984, Chang joined General Instrument, another chip firm, where a third puzzle piece fell into place. He met an entrepreneur who later started a company that would only design chips without also making them, which was then uncommon. He spotted a trend that would prove to have staying power: Today, most semiconductor companies design chips and outsource manufacturing.
This final piece coincided with Taiwan’s transition from a labor-intensive and heavy industry economy to a high-tech one. When Taiwanese officials set their sights on developing the semiconductor industry, they asked Chang, whose reputation as a chip expert was established, to lead an institute for supercharging innovation.
So, in 1985, Chang, then 54, left the United States for a place he knew only from several visits to a Texas Instruments factory.
“I certainly had no plan to spend nearly so much time in Taiwan,” he said. “I thought I was going back in maybe just a few years, and I really had no plan to set up TSMC, to set up any company in Taiwan.”
Within weeks of Chang’s arrival, Li Kwoh-ting, a government official who became known as the godfather of Taiwan’s tech development, asked him to make the state-led chip project commercially viable.
When Chang assessed Taiwan’s strengths and weaknesses, he sensed an opening. “I concluded that Taiwan was a lot more similar to Japan than the U.S.,” he said, referring to his experience with the Texas Instruments’ factory in Japan.
In 1987, Chang founded TSMC. The business model was clear in his head: TSMC would make chips for other companies and not design them. That meant it just had to win over those inside the industry and then focus on what it could do best — manufacturing.
From the get-go, Chang had plans for TSMC to tap into a global market. He introduced professional management systems, which were uncommon in Taiwan, at the company. To foster an international environment, internal communications were in English.
His vision proved prophetic. As semiconductors became more complex and expensive to produce, only a few firms could even afford to try. Making chips involves hundreds of steps that pull on advanced lasers and chemical manipulations to create tiny pathways for electronic signals that do the most basic calculations for a computer. Costs were astronomical.
Over the years, Chang kept going as others dropped out. If TSMC could attract enough customers, leveraging economies of scale, it had a chance to take out the kings: Intel and Samsung.
In 1997, Chang recruited a new head of research of development, Chiang Shang-yi. He told Chiang to benchmark TSMC against the industry leader, Intel.
“Our goal is to be No. 1, barring none,” Chang said.
Chiang was surprised. “To be No. 1, you have to spend three times as much as your next competitor,” he replied, implying that being in the lead would be too lofty and costly a goal.
“It may be three times, but I do want to spend enough so that we become No. 1,” Chang said. And he was prepared to be patient, even after stepping down as TSMC’s CEO in 2005 and staying on as the company’s chair.
Closing the Apple contract
In April 2009, angry TSMC employees — many who had recently been let go by the company — set up a protest camp at a leafy playground in Taipei’s quiet residential neighborhood of Dazhi. They were down the street from Chang’s upscale apartment building.

Judge Limits Scope of Trial Vs. Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The ruling did not affect some central parts of the antitrust cases about Google search, which are scheduled to go to trial next month.
A federal judge said this week that the Justice Department and a group of states could not move forward with some claims in antitrust complaints against Google, narrowing the scope of what is set to be the most significant federal monopoly trial against a tech giant in decades.
In the decision, which was unsealed on Friday, Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed four claims in the lawsuits and allowed government lawyers to move forward with three.
Judge Mehta wrote that a trial was warranted to assess whether Google's exclusivity deals for web browsers and preloading its services on Android devices illegally helped the internet company maintain a monopoly. But he said the government had not "demonstrated the requisite anticompetitive effect" to prove that Google broke the law in other ways, such as by boosting its own products in search results over those of specialized sites, like Amazon and Yelp.
The decision sets the stage for the first major tech monopoly trial since the federal government took Microsoft to court in the 1990s, amid a renewed backlash over the power of tech giants. In recent years, American regulators have filed lawsuits and tried to block the acquisitions of companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as they have grown in reach and size.
Some efforts by regulators to challenge the tech giants have faltered. Twice this year, federal judges have declined to grant Federal Trade Commission requests to stop tech deals, allowing Meta to close the purchase of a virtual reality start-up and clearing the way for Microsoft's blockbuster acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
But the Google trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 12, stands out as the most direct government attempt in years to confront one of the world's biggest tech companies about longtime business practices. The trial is expected to last almost 10 weeks and to scrutinize not only how Google conducts business but its relationships with other major companies, such as Apple and Samsung, which have largely been shrouded in secrecy.
Bill Baer, a former Justice Department antitrust official, said the cases were as significant as the landmark litigation against Microsoft.
The outcome "will set an important precedent about whether these dominant tech platforms are engaging in behavior that limits competition and disadvantages consumers," he said.
Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement on Friday that the company appreciated Judge Mehta's "careful consideration and decision to dismiss claims regarding the design of Google Search."
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The department filed an antitrust case against Google under President Donald J. Trump in 2020. It argues that the Silicon Valley company exploits its power over online search and the ads that appear in search results. The lawsuit was ultimately combined for trial with a separate case about Google search that was filed that same year by the attorneys general of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.
The Justice Department has separately filed another antitrust case against Google, focused on the company's software for placing ads across the web, which is headed to trial as soon as next year.
In his ruling, Judge Mehta allowed the core of the Justice Department's case to stand. But he dismissed three of the agency's claims regarding Google's management of the Android operating system, its relationships to phone makers that use Android and its Google Assistant service. He also threw out a central claim brought by the states, which accused Google of providing top billing in its search results to its own products.
Judge Mehta acknowledged in his opinion that Google was extremely popular and noted the bar that government lawyers must clear to prove that it had broken antitrust rules.
It is not illegal for Google to have a monopoly alone, he wrote, adding, "A company with monopoly power acts unlawfully only when its conduct stifles competition."
At trial, both sides are set to argue over whether the company's multibillion-dollar agreements to be the default search engine on various devices and browsers are anticompetitive, which could have significant consequences for its core business. Google's search engine collected $ 162 billion in advertising revenue last year.
Google has argued that these pacts with companies like Apple and Samsung are simple distribution deals that are common in business, and that the government has tried to penalize Google because of its popularity.
The agreements have been a linchpin in Google's efforts to be easily accessible to large audiences. The company retains an estimated 94 percent of search engine traffic on mobile devices, according to Similarweb, a data analysis firm.

Sales Down, But Apple Lifts Profit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The iPhone maker's recent quarter benefited from strong sales in its App Store and other services businesses.
The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world's most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $ 81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $ 19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple's financial results were the latest indication that tech's biggest companies have found their footing after last year's downturn. Last week, Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.
The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $ 5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $ 6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple's share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $ 39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world's second-largest economy.
"We've done a really good job with affordability programs around the world," said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. "The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing."
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company's services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $ 21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $ 8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $ 3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won't go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
"While I'm pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, during the call with analysts. "It's a huge opportunity for us."
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company's supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming "incrementally incremental."

Huge in Mexico. Struggling With Mom.: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Fleeing the strictures of modern life in a hypercompetitive South Korea, a young woman found a calmer way of life in Mexico -- and millions of social media followers.
To her mother in South Korea, SuJin Kim is a failure: She's over 30, single and not working for a big Korean corporation.
But to her millions of followers in Latin America, she has become a relatable friend and a teacher of all things Korean. In Mexico, where she lives, they know her, in fact, as "Chinguamiga," her online nickname, a mash-up of the words for friend in Korean and Spanish.
Her success has been propelled not just by her ingenuity and charisma, but also by a wave of South Korean popular culture that has swept the world, driven in part by a government effort to position the country as a cultural giant and to exert a soft power.
In her homeland, Ms. Kim, 32, struggled with the grind of a hypercompetitive society where success is defined narrowly and young women face diminishing labor prospects, grueling work schedules, sexism and restrictive beauty standards.
In Mexico, the growing interest in all things Korean has made her a social-media sensation with more than 24 million followers on TikTok and over eight million subscribers to her YouTube channel, allowing her to gain popularity, financial stability and a romantic partner -- all on her own terms.
"There was a packaging that she came with," said Dr. Renato Balderrama, who leads the Center for Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, an industrial hub with an expanding Korean presence. "She had all this training in Korea, in this new Korea that allows her to land in a place like Mexico and be successful."
A sort of a teacher of comparative pop culture, Ms. Kim offers lessons on popular Korean soap operas, lyrics, fashion standards, traditions and social norms. She once worked as a waitress in Mexico for a day and posted about her confusion with tips. (South Korea is a no-tip country.) She showed followers how Korean students crammed for exams. She started traveling across Mexico tasting regional delicacies.
Her social media success has attracted invitations to events, award nominations, magazine spreads and sponsorship deals, and yielded a popular business teaching Korean language classes online. She moved from Monterrey to Mexico City to gain more exposure and grow her brand.
Ms. Kim's budding empire now includes an online store of Korean beauty products. She will be featured as a contestant in the second season of HBO's "Bake Off Celebrity" show.
Ms. Kim's success tracks the growth of Korean influence in Mexico and the region.More than 2,000 Korean companies have a presence in Mexico, part of a so-called near-shoring strategy that has driven larger corporations -- Kia, LG, Samsung, Hyundai, among others -- to take advantage of a free-trade agreement with Canada and the United States.
South Korea has not only arrived in Mexico with jobs, cars and cellphones, but also with something more intangible: its own idea of modern culture. K-pop, K-beauty and K-dramas have shown Latin Americans a new, different way to be cool.
K-pop bands have been performing to increasingly bigger and sold-out venues since 2012. This year, a summer festival will bring 16 Korean groups to Mexico City, with ticket prices starting at around $ 170.
Some newsstands specialize in magazines, posters and merchandise about South Korean celebrities. Netflix offers dubbing in "Latin Spanish" for Korean shows. Movie theaters stream live K-pop concerts performed abroad.
Ms. Kim grew up in Seoul but after a work-study stint in Canada and traveling through South America, she returned home and found life in South Korea stifling.
"I don't want to go back to my old life," she remembered thinking.
She moved to Mexico in 2018, driven by a desire to experience life in Latin America and trying to escape severe burnout. She worked for a Korean multinational corporation and found the work rhythm all too familiar so she started teaching Korean.
Then the pandemic upended the world.
"It's my moment, I have nothing to do," she recalled thinking before she started to post her Korean classes on YouTube. "I had zero views, nobody saw me."
Her videos were straightforward language lessons "Easy Words in Korean -- 3 Minutes!" But then she pivoted to TikTok and uploaded a short clip, this time explaining Korean culture.
"That same day it had like 5,000 views and I was like, what?!" she said, her pointy nails adorned with jeweled stars, bows and moons.
Very quickly, her TikTok following exploded.
One afternoon this year, Ms. Kim welcomed her students to a virtual Korean class on Zoom; she charges $ 35 to $ 45 for each four-week session, with one 90-minute class per week.
When the class started, 76 students had logged on. There were young girls and bespectacled moms and at least one longhaired businessman, spread across Central and South America.
Ms. Kim's bright blue curls bounced on the screen as she moved her head approvingly.
When a student trying to figure out how to pluralize singular nouns asked, "No plural?" she chirped: "No! How neat, right?"
After finishing college in South Korea, Ms. Kim said she experienced severe stress. "I wanted to die and I wished to rest," she said in one of her most popular videos. She has spoken openly about being hospitalized to take care of her mental health.
She attributes her exhaustion to Korea's culture of sacrifice and grind that helped the country become an economic powerhouse after the Korean War.
"Everything is quick, quick, now, right this second," Dr. Balderrama said. "This created a culture where there's no place for mediocrity, there's no place for those unwilling to compete."
In Mexico, Ms. Kim hoped to find a more joyous life: "I saw how Latin culture is, how Latin people live and they're living happily," she said. "I don't want to waste a single moment I'm in Latin America because it's so precious to me."
But if Ms. Kim has found a passion and a business, she has not completely found the peace of mind she was seeking. She's in therapy to deal with what she described as some depression and anxiety.
Her large following and popularity has bred fear: "I feel people will forget me, that nobody will like me," she said, worried about the toll of having to come up with creative content to remain relevant.
"I also have this problem with haters, with people's comments, which affect me," she added.
She does get criticized online by users who say she should go back to Korea, who ask whether she pays taxes in Mexico (she says she does) and who consider her another foreigner lured by life on the cheap and who contribute to the gentrification of parts of the country at the expense of Mexican residents.
In a recent video,as she prepared to go home for a visit she showed an ID card that she said was proof of her status as a legal resident. She wanted to dispel any rumors she had to leave the country because she was on a tourist visa.
Ms. Kim declined to discuss her citizenship status with The New York Times, but months ago she posted a video in which she said she'd taken the exam to become a citizen of Mexico.
By many standards, Ms. Kim has made it. But what about her mother's standards?
"I don't think she'll change her mind about success -- that I'm not a success, that's a fact for her," she said following her visit home. "She's still more worried than happy for me."
Still, after meeting Ms. Kim's boyfriend and his family in South Korea, her parents promised to visit her in Mexico.

Why Deep-Sea Mining Is the Next Battleground in the Energy Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Countries and companies are in a fight between those that want to excavate minerals used in electric vehicles and others that warn the cost is too high.
Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
"We're preparing our application," said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, "but we reserve the right to move forward."
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether -- though it's not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don't yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean -- and transporting metals back to land -- raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works -- like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries -- could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. "This industry could start without being needed," she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
"Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean," Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet "through decades of profit-driven development" as "patronizing."
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. "That horse has bolted," he said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Lina Khan's bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT's privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn't have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees' calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It's the company's latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.
Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday's Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $ 11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $ 4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $ 200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The "political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech," Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.
Paris takes on 'auto-besity'
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on "auto-besity." Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the vehicles -- a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. "We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles," Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was "to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity ... the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities."
The new rules will add to carmakers' worries. Details haven't been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
"France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars," Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla's price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are "in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below."
On our radar: A.I. as a villain
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the latest installment in Tom Cruise's efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $ 90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans' relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ex Machina" and, yes, "A.I." But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I."? The Entity is capable of "collapsing the world's economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim." At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide -- and time will tell if that mission is ... well, you know.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you on Monday.
We'd like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.

Full text: Full of experiments with new media, the museum's giant exhibition displays the powers and the pitfalls of seeing the world through a screen.
Beauty is nice, elegance has its place, but sometimes I go to museums to be perplexed: to agree and disagree, to argue and reassess, to leave even less certain than I was before. I sure got my wish with "Signals: How Video Transformed the World," which closes this weekend at the Museum of Modern Art -- and which, screen for screen, hour for hour, stands proud as the most perplexing exhibition of the year.
Maybe a dozen times since its opening in March I have ascended to MoMA's top floor for this ambitious, irregular exhibition of video art, the largest this museum has ever put on. I've swum through its panoply of screens and projections, broadcasting more footage than any one visitor could ever take in. Did I like it? I still have no idea after four months, though my feelings about "Signals" have settled into some unholy mix of admiration, bafflement, intellectual provocation, political fatalism and (in the case of one work) absolute fury. Given the recent subtropical weather here in New York, this final weekend might be ideal for wrestling with "Signals" in MoMA's climate-controlled galleries. Go with a friend, and then fight about it.
"Signals," drawn from the museum's collection by the curators Stuart Comer and Michelle Kuo, is decidedly not a history of video art. It aims instead to present video as a communication medium -- transmitted by artist-citizens, through closed circuits or TV satellites or mobile phone apps, to document an incident or to rally a public. The focus on communication means it leaves out many of the medium's pioneers, from Bruce Nauman to Joan Jonas. (Fair enough: Nauman had a major retrospective in these same galleries in 2018, and Jonas has one coming up next year.) Nam June Paik still reigns as the father of video art, yet his most prominent work here is a later one: "Good Morning, Mr. Orwell," a live satellite broadcast of music and dance performances, whose soft-edged images beamed simultaneously from New York and Paris on New Year's Day 1984.
Rather than recording and playback, this show puts a premium on how video imagery circulates: through a network, through a society. It is thus almost cavalierly relaxed about video's technical properties, and drifts without distinction from the Sony PortaPak to the Samsung Galaxy. Confusingly, one of the show's largest objects, Stan VanDerBeek's "Movie-Drome" of 1964-65, is not video art at all -- but rather a work of expanded cinema, for which the American techno-optimist projected 16-millimeter films and 35- and 70-millimeter slides on the roof of a prefab aluminum igloo. (MoMA's media conservators have used some video projectors for their impressive reconstruction of the "Movie-Drome," but those are contemporary digital stand-ins for VanDerBeek's original film reels and slide shows.) VanDerBeek had imagined a whole world of Movie-Dromes, linked up into an "artist interchange."
The show is relaxed, too, about display conditions. Very few videos are screened in black boxes, and sound bleeds from one installation to the other, though the museum does make admirable allowances for visitors with hearing impairments: written descriptions of the audio tracks, headphones to borrow. I appreciated Comer and Kuo's relaxed approach to display, and especially their decision to stream more than 70 of the show's single-channel videos for free at moma.org. Knowing you can watch later at home frees you from having to imbibe every video in one go, though online playback introduces a new idiosyncrasy: the high-speed scrubber bar, whose preview thumbnails and instant fast-forwarding kill once and for all the pretense of video art as an absorptive medium.
So this is not so much an exhibition of video art as an exhibition of video against: video against broadcast television, video against government censorship, video against corporate interests. This antagonistic pose has become a little reflexive at MoMA lately, and not always convincing. More than a few videos and installations here, such as an archive of queer interviews from Carlos Motta and an animation about colonial monuments from the collective New Red Order, come across as showcases of visibility that an elite institution can easily metabolize.
Whereas the best of the younger artists in "Signals" have real skepticism about the value of visibility and documentation. Tiffany Sia's "Never Rest/Unrest" (2020) shows the flip side of viral protest videos -- presenting mundane imagery from Hong Kong's stifled pro-democracy demonstrations, which she shot in the same 16:9 vertical aspect ratio as every other protester's iPhone. For Sondra Perry's two-screen projection "Double Quadruple Etcetera Etcetera I & II" (2013), the artist filmed two Black dancers, wearing white clothing, performing against white walls; she then used "context-aware" editing software (a dubious name) to dissolve the dancers' bodies into their environments. The digital effacement stutters, though. It glitches. The ghost haunts the machine; the Black figure defies elite capture in ways straight-on representation cannot.
For a naïve trust in the screen can lead to myopia and even moral catastrophe, as it did here in six videos by Frances Stark. Her "U.S. Greatest Hits Mix Tape Volume I" consists of six iPads that each screen two other videos, playing on computers on the artist's desk in Los Angeles. One of the screens-in-the-screen plays an old pop song; the other plays YouTube clips of contemporaneous wars or disputes that, so we are told, the United States orchestrated. One of these videos implies that the U.S., rather than the Soviet Union, bears principal blame for the war in Afghanistan that began in 1979 (while playing Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer). Another simply transmits a speech by the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, blaming "the empire in the United States" for the 2019 uprising against his rule (featuring Ariana Grande). The most appalling ascribes the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine to American interference -- a fiction often espoused in the Russian media to justify President Vladimir V. Putin's initial invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
When I say MoMA spent four months relaying Putinist propaganda, I am not being excessive. The Afghanistan video incorporates footage from Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed cable network. The Ukraine conspiracy theory comes from a small-time YouTube channel that promotes Russian war messaging, which the "Western mainstream media is unwilling to say." And if you thought Stark was making some distanced commentary on digital gullibility, MoMA thought otherwise. When I first saw the show in March, the wall texts stated outright that Stark's work "examines the history of U.S. military intervention in six countries," and outrageously listed Ukraine's democratic revolution as one of these American military plots. The text was later changed in response to public complaints; it now accuses the U.S. of "alleged or covert involvement." That introduces about as much subtlety as the Katy Perry song that plays in the background.
MoMA should never have acquired this bankrupt "Mix Tape." But within the din of "Signals," Stark's useful idiocy (to use the old Cold War term for Western dupes apologizing for foreign tyranny) may have an accidental value -- as an admonition against the poor habits of streaming, linking, sharing and commenting, in which the last democratic potential of video seems to have drowned. In this show's catalog, the art historian David Joselit observes how video in the 2010s became less about archiving events and more about perpetual renewal and erasure, and how our endless recording has ironically left us with "an eradication of history." The best videos in "Signals" stand against that eradication, especially two you can watch in person or online this last weekend.
One is a classic: "Videograms of a Revolution," from 1992, by the German filmmaker Harun Farocki and his Romanian collaborator Andrei Ujica. In the last days before the 1989 overthrow and execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, pro-democracy demonstrators took over the headquarters of a Bucharest television station, kicked out the propagandists, and started broadcasting for themselves: news from the front, reporting about the revolution, but also personal testimonies and even folk songs. Farocki and Ujica compiled hundreds of hours from Romanian free television, and produced an invaluable archive of video's democratic potential in times of extreme upheaval.
One is newer: "Letter to a Turtledove," a beautifully jagged video poem from 2020, by the young Ukrainian artist Dana Kavelina. Mixing stop-motion animation, camera-phone videos from Ukrainian soldiers, and backward-projected 1930s Stalinist footage, this wrenching recent work pictures the Donbas (the industrial, predominantly Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine) as a territory of both historical and contemporary amnesia, erased here by propaganda, there by indifference. Like so many artists after the 2014 Maidan Revolution -- which was not an American plot, as this show initially suggested -- she found beneath the polluted Donbas soil the aquifers of a new Ukrainian art, grown only more urgent since the full-scale invasion. When Kavelina's titular turtledove turns into a flaming fighter jet, when her whispered poetry gives way to air raid sirens, you remember whose signals need to get through, and whose should be jammed.

A Checklist for Summer Weather: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: This season has seen excessive heat, violent storms and hazardous smoke already, but you can prepare for future events with a few apps and tools.
Summer is in full swing now, but along with vacation trips, camp and lazy days, extreme weather has arrived for many parts of the country. If you live in an area that's prone to such conditions, it helps to be ready. Here are some tips to help you use your tech through major meteorological moments -- sometimes, even when power and cell service are shaky.
Stay Updated
Getting accurate local weather information helps you stay ahead of nearby threats like hurricanes, flash floods, tornadoes or wildfires. Setting up alerts on Apple's default Weather app, the Google app or a specialized weather app keeps you notified. Bookmarking government web pages in your browser -- like those for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Hurricane Center or the U.S. Air Quality Index -- is good for manual checks of current conditions.
Your phone can also receive wireless emergency alerts from authorized federal, state, local, tribal and territorial authorities. Check your notification settings to make sure these are enabled.
The American Red Cross also has a free Emergency app, which allows you to track 40 types of hazards, including earthquakes, tornadoes, extreme heat, hurricanes and wildfires -- with alerts in English and Spanish. Emergency, which consolidates information from older Red Cross apps, also offers checklists, first-aid tips, information about nearby shelters and downloadable guides that work offline.
Stock Up
If the power goes out, you will need alternative ways to charge your phone -- like a solar panel, a power cable for your car's 12-volt dashboard outlet or a hand-cranked charger. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has guides for alternative chargers, emergency radios and other equipment to help you through hurricanes, wildfires and earthquakes.
Stuff Your Digital Wallet
Losing your physical wallet in a catastrophe can be highly disruptive, but if you have credit or debit cards saved to the digital wallet app on your phone, you have a backup for businesses with contactless payment terminals. Digital versions of your health care cards and driver's license may also be options. (Four states now offer official digital driver's licenses or state ID cards for the Apple and Google wallet apps, but more are coming, including New York; some states also have their own digital ID apps.)
Just about every major insurance company has its own mobile app that you can use for filing a claim, getting roadside assistance and checking policy documents. If you have not installed your provider's app and set up your account on your phone, do it before you need to use it.
And if you are mired in air-travel disruptions, your airline's app helps with flight rebooking.
Make Cloud Copies
Sealed plastic boxes and fireproof chests can help protect vital documents and photos from the elements. However, digitizing the material -- and storing it in the cloud on a secure server -- gives you a virtual backup out of nature's reach. Many multifunctional printers include a scanner, but you can also scan files reasonably well with a smartphone app.
Find Fuel
Big storms often disrupt gasoline delivery and other items on the supply chain. With its price maps and outage tracker features, the GasBuddy site and apps can help you find working gas stations.
As seen during the coronavirus pandemic, Google and Apple kept their maps apps updated with new information relevant to the situation like temporary business and road closures. And Google's Crisis Response team has been working to provide flood forecasting, fire maps, hurricane warnings and other alerts to its software.
Know How to SOS
Apple's iPhones, Google's Pixel phones, Samsung's Galaxy devices and other phones have shortcuts to call emergency services and pinpoint your location. Apple's iPhone 14 models also include a satellite S.O.S. feature for when you are out of cellular range, and Google has a Personal Safety app for Android. Make sure you know how it all works on your model so you can get help fast if needed.
If you are stranded with a rapidly draining phone battery and no power, consider this common trick if you still have cell service: Change your voice mail greeting to state your location and situation. Even if your phone battery fades, loved ones trying to reach you will get the information.
Protect Your Phone
Of course, there may be situations so extreme that your phone is lost or damaged. Turning on the "find my phone" feature in your device's settings before the bad weather arrives offers electronic hope for finding it later.
To recover faster from a destroyed phone, back it up online so its contents are safe and ready to download to a replacement device. Your phone manufacturer will be happy to sell you additional online storage space for a few dollars a month if you need it, but just make sure you have time to do a full cloud backup before those storm clouds hit.

Foreign Investors Pour Money Into Samsung's A.I. Venture, But It Faces Stiff Competition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The introduction of ChatGPT has lit a fire under the shares of companies that produce microchips, the brains of artificial intelligence. Bets on the potential of so-called generative A.I. have poured in. The most eye-catching example of the rally is Silicon Valley's Nvidia, the top seller of chips used in artificial intelligence, whose shares are up nearly 200 percent this year.
Samsung Electronics, the South Korean giant, is hoping to get in on the action. Widely known for its consumer products, Samsung also has the world's largest memory chip business and the second-busiest semiconductor foundries, which build custom microchips for other companies.
Foreign investors have bought $ 8 billion worth of Samsung shares this year on the South Korean stock market -- already the largest amount of foreign purchases in Samsung for any year since 2000, according to data provided by CLSA, an investment firm in Hong Kong. The surge reversed a sell-off over the previous three years, when foreign investors sold more of the company's stock than they bought.
At an event in California last week, Samsung detailed what it called its "vision in the A.I. era." Samsung believes it can snatch market share from the leading chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, but recently the trend has gone the other way. According to Counterpoint Research, a market research firm, TSMC enjoys roughly 60 percent of total revenues in the global foundry business and Samsung only 13 percent -- a gap that has widened since 2021 as some of Samsung's customers, including Nvidia, have shifted their business to TSMC.
Samsung said it spent $ 7.4 billion in the first quarter of this year -- when its profits fell a staggering 95 percent -- on its chip business, a portion of which is expected to serve the A.I. industry. It is expanding production at its chip-manufacturing complex in Pyeongtaek, about 40 miles south of Seoul, as well as a chip factory in Texas. Over the next 20 years, Samsung said, it plans to work with the government on a $ 230 billion plan to build a chip-making "megacluster" in South Korea.
The optimism is tied to Samsung's memory chip business, which makes up roughly half the company's operating profit in an average year, said Sanjeev Rana, a senior analyst at CLSA.
Compared with traditional servers -- the hardware that underpins desktops and databases -- the servers built for artificial intelligence can require four times the memory, called DRAM. Samsung commands roughly 45 percent of the global DRAM market. And it is the only major memory company to invest in more production despite an industrywide tumble in memory prices, Mr. Rana added.
The chip industry is known for its boom-and-bust cycles. After a spike in demand for memory chips during the pandemic, chip makers began one of their worst downturns in years last fall. Samsung's memory chip rivals, including Micron Technology in the United States and South Korea's SK Hynix, said they would cut back on investments in production this year.
Some analysts think Samsung's spending in the down cycle will pay off in the long run when the memory sector recovers, in part because of artificial intelligence.
"If demand comes back, they will be very ready," Mr. Rana said.
But skeptics question whether Samsung can achieve the kind of indispensable role in generative A.I. that it has had in smartphones and high-resolution televisions. It lost out last year when Nvidia chose SK Hynix as its supplier for a high-powered memory chip expected to become a fast-growing business line because of its prominence in future A.I. servers.
SK Hynix controls roughly 50 percent of that market for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, compared with Samsung's 40 percent, according to TrendForce, a market research firm. Shares of SK Hynix are up more than 50 percent this year, surpassing Samsung's gain of 30 percent.
Samsung said it had already begun supplying "key customers" with a competing version of HBM. The next generation of its HBM is set to launch this year, it added.
Samsung's lag in HBM technology could be a symptom of broader issues, said Nam Hyung Kim, an analyst at Arete Research, an equity research firm. In a report in February, Mr. Kim wrote that Micron had also leapfrogged Samsung's technology in DRAM and another type of memory, NAND flash.
"The problem with Samsung is they always want to be big," Mr. Kim said. "They're spending so much money, but they're not the leader in technology anymore."
Mr. Kim said Samsung should invest more in research and not worry so much about market share. "Samsung is a bigger player than Apple in smartphones," he said. "But how many people think Samsung makes a better smartphone than Apple?"
Samsung said in a statement that it had been successful in several aspects of advanced semiconductor technologies and that it could offer customers "comprehensive solutions" in the evolving landscape of A.I. and other technologies.
Samsung's own executives have offered a more sober diagnosis.
In May, the president of Samsung's semiconductor division, Kyung Kye-hyun, acknowledged in a talk to university students that the company "lagged behind" TSMC by up to two years. The remarks, which circulated widely in Korean media, were a rare admission for a company that has long prided itself on its tech leadership.
Mr. Kyung went on to vow that Samsung's memory chips would become a "core" of A.I. supercomputers by 2028. "We can outperform TSMC within five years," he said.

A Streaky Surprise: Our Local Black Hole Serves Up An 'Awe Moment' for Astronomers: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Filaments of radio energy from Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, are turning astronomers' heads.
Astronomers have detected a new set of whiskers on the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy: filaments of radio energy a few light-years long, and streaming outward along the galactic plane.
The streaks may be the fading remains of explosive outbursts from the black hole, Sagittarius A*, which contains the mass of 4 million suns, according to Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern University.
Dr. Yusef-Zadeh led a team of radio astronomers that studied Sagittarius A* with the MeerKAT telescope, the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory's sprawling array of antennas. They published their results on June 2 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
The discovery adds a new dimension to the electrical complexity of the Milky Way. In its structure, the galaxy resembles a sunny-side-up egg, with a bulbous, bright middle surrounded by a flat disk of stars, gas and dust.
Dr. Yusef-Zadeh, a dedicated explorer of the galaxy's heart of darkness, and his colleagues had already detected radio filaments, thin magnetic tubes of energy 150 light-years long, running perpendicular to the galactic plane like the pickets of a fence.
The new filaments are shorter -- a few light-years in length -- and they run in a different direction, parallel to the galactic plane rather than through it. "It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole," Yusef-Zadeh said in a news release issued by Northwestern University. "I was actually stunned when I saw these."
He added in an email: "The filaments show up nicely once you know what you are looking for. It was an awe moment for us to realize these filaments were pointing toward the black hole."
The geometry of the new streaks suggests that the black hole is spinning on an axis that is likewise parallel to the plane, Dr. Yusef-Zadeh added. The energy is squeezed out from the poles like toothpaste from a tube. Astronomers still do not know what the perpendicular vertical filaments are, he said.
Future observations with the Event Horizon Telescope, the far-flung network of Earthbound observation posts that in 2022 produced the first image of Sagittarius A*, should shed further light on the behavior and orientation of the black hole, Dr. Yusef-Zahed said. He added: "It is satisfying when one finds order in the middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy."

Full text: Google's new $ 1,800 gadget proves that phones with bendable screens are something people might want. Now they just need to get cheaper.
When I recently turned on Google's new Pixel Fold smartphone and unfolded it as if it were a book, it transformed into a miniature tablet, similar to an iPad Mini or an Amazon Fire. Then something unexpected happened.
For the next few hours, I found it difficult to put the device down, as if I were sucked into a great novel. The phone's performance was smooth and fast, and the bigger screen made reading emails, watching videos and reading comic books more delightful than on a normal phone screen.
I was surprised because I have been wary of foldable phones. The earliest models released by Samsung, Motorola and Huawei about four years ago had glaring flaws. They were thick and heavy, had durability issues and lacked software to take advantage of their novel hardware. But I immediately knew the Pixel Fold -- Google's first foldable phone -- was different.
When I folded the device back up, a second 5.8-inch outer screen illuminated, converting it into a regular smartphone that could be used with one hand. Importantly, it was not too chunky -- it's about half an inch thick folded up, which is slightly bigger than my iPhone -- so it was comfortable to carry in my pockets.
The Pixel Fold, which was unveiled last month and arrives on Wednesday, is proof that when cutting-edge technology emerges, it is wiser to wait before sinking your hard-earned dollars into it. In just four years, Google has managed to erase most of the problems with foldable phones, transforming a gimmicky concept into a product with compelling reasons to exist.
What Google didn't manage to do was make foldable phone technology cheaper. The Pixel Fold costs $ 1,800, about $ 400 more than similar phones released a few years ago. Google said the device's cost partly stemmed from the engineering challenge of cramming high-quality components, including a camera on a par with other Pixel phones, into a device this thin. (When unfolded, the Pixel Fold is thinner than a typical smartphone.)
That's a bummer. Most people won't spend this much on a phone when there are many great options that are cheaper. But I can recommend it for its target audience: people with lots of disposable income who rely heavily on their devices.
Still, the progress with foldable technology is good news. A few years ago, handsets from companies like Apple and Samsung seemed to have peaked. Their flagship phones were already incredibly zippy, their screens were big and bright, and their cameras took stunning photos. The smartphone industry, as a whole, became a pile of nearly indistinguishable black rectangles.
What was left to do? In 2019, Samsung was among the first to release a foldable phone, but it poisoned the well by rushing the gadget to market. The screens on early review samples of its Galaxy Fold failed, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to postpone the product. Samsung and others have since released a few more foldable phones, but none were compelling to me.
Google's entry into the market is significant. Mirroring Apple's tight control of the iPhone's design, Google designed both the hardware (including the computing processor) and software that power the Pixel Fold. That means the device's software was tailored to work with it, and it has long battery life and very fast performance.
Beyond the bigger screen, Google has come up with clever reasons for how and why you might use a foldable phone.
For one, the Pixel Fold is a great video player to use everywhere because of the way it folds at an angle like a laptop.
When I cooked in the kitchen, I played a YouTube video with a recipe and folded the device at a 90-degree angle. The upper half of the screen showed the video, and the lower half showed the description listing the ingredients. In some ways, this was even better than a tablet, which you would have to prop up with a stand on the countertop to view at the proper angle.
What else might you do with a foldable? With the device unfolded, I ran two apps side by side, which was useful for reading a webpage while typing an email.
Google also demonstrated how its translation app could take advantage of the two screens. Consider a situation in which you, an English speaker, are trying to communicate with someone who speaks Chinese. Holding the phone unfolded, you can speak English into the microphone and have the phone's outer screen show text translated into Chinese to the other person. When the Chinese speaker responds, you can read the translated text on the inner screen.
This feature will not be released until the fall, so I didn't get to test it. But it's an intriguing use case.
In the end, the device is expensive because it is packed with advanced technology with no major trade-offs. In my tests, its camera produced crisp and vibrant images on a par with photos taken with Apple's latest iPhone and the Pixel 7 Pro, Google's $ 900 smartphone, which has an excellent camera.
Though the Pixel Fold's high price will make it inaccessible to most people, it was an exciting glimpse into the next step for smartphones. Over the last five years, as phone screens got bigger, we have voted with our wallets and shown that we prefer larger screens, so long as they come on devices easy to carry everywhere. The Pixel Fold delivers that.
I suspect that in a few years, foldable phones will probably fall in price to replace current phones with the "pro" moniker and will make up the new high end of the market. When that happens, I can see myself and many others making the switch to a foldable -- and a future where the tablet becomes less relevant.

Full text: His girlfriend told him not to buy the electric scooter.
But Alfonso Villa Muñoz was intrigued. He was working in a Brooklyn bodega last August when a delivery man said he knew someone selling one for $ 700. Mr. Muñoz said yes.
The scooter was cherry red with the number 7 on the front. Under the seat was an extra-large lithium ion battery. When it needed charging, Mr. Muñoz would remove the battery from the scooter and use both hands to lug it up to the couple's third-floor apartment in College Point, Queens.
A month later, the battery exploded in the living room, unleashing flames that engulfed the apartment. Mr. Muñoz screamed for their 8-year-old daughter, Stephanie, who was asleep. He could not breach the wall of black smoke to get to her. Stephanie died from smoke inhalation.
"It's like you bring in death and destruction to your house, and not only to you, to everybody around you," said Mr. Muñoz, 36, pulling off his glasses to wipe away tears. "You could lose everything."
E-bikes and e-scooters have flooded New York City's streets in recent years, embraced by delivery workers and commuters alike as an economical and efficient new way to get around. But even as the devices have grown in popularity to become nearly ubiquitous, the batteries inside them have made New York City an epicenter for a new kind of ferocious and fast-moving fire.
These fires are "uniquely dangerous," warned Laura Kavanagh, the city's fire commissioner. With little or no warning, the batteries can ignite, leaving seconds for people to escape. In just three years, lithium battery fires have tied electrical fires and have surpassed blazes started by cooking and smoking for major causes of fatal fires in the city.
Reasons for the uptick of these fires are myriad. They include a lack of regulation and safety testing for individually owned devices, hazardous charging practices (like using mismatched equipment or overcharging) and a lack of secure charging areas in a population-dense city with numerous residential buildings, where most fires start.
But for New Yorkers who rely on e-bikes and other battery-powered devices to make deliveries or otherwise earn a living, the fires have forced a choice between financial stability and personal safety.
Across the country, over 200 micro-mobility fire or overheating incidents have been reported from 39 states, resulting in at least 19 fatalities, according to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. But the organization emphasized that the problem is particularly acute in densely populated areas like New York City. In London, lithium battery fires are the fastest-growing fire risk, with 57 e-bike fires and 13 e-scooter fires this year, according to the London Fire Brigade.
In New York, lithium battery fires have killed 13 people so far this year, including four people in a blaze that started in an e-bike store in Chinatown on Tuesday. A total of 23 people have died in battery fires since 2021. This year, there have been 108 fires so far, compared with 98 fires for the same period last year.
'These devices are here now, and there's lots of them'
During the pandemic, when public transit was compromised and the demand for food deliveries skyrocketed, a ready supply of cheap e-bikes and e-scooters of questionable quality cropped up across the city.
New Yorkers looking for good deals pounced. With many residents living in tight quarters, they would charge their batteries in their apartments.
But once a lithium battery overheats or malfunctions, all bets are off; the speed and impact of lithium battery fires make them particularly perilous, especially when people live close together.
This has pushed more and more landlords to ban e-bikes and other e-mobility devices, while New York's leaders have worked to prevent the fires on several fronts. In September, New York will become the first city in the nation to ban the sale of e-bikes and other e-mobility devices that fail to meet recognized safety standards.
City and fire officials have also pushed for greater state and federal oversight of the devices, shut down illegal battery charging stations, worked with food delivery apps to educate workers and shown public service messages with exploding batteries.
"I have very, very serious concerns in the short term," Commissioner Kavanagh said. "These devices are here now, and there's lots of them."
A 'mini inferno' at Citi Bike foreshadows a crisis
In March 2019, Citi Bike, the popular bike-share program, was charging its pedal-assisted e-bikes in its Brooklyn warehouse when a fire broke out.
It started with a loud bang like a pistol shot. Then came flames with chrome-colored sparks flying out and a rush of heat. "In an instant, the batteries began to explode into flames one by one, like a domino effect, going from right to left," recounted a witness in the fire marshal's report. "Within 10 seconds, the entire top row became a mini inferno."
Though e-bike fires were just becoming a problem, fire officials had been aware of the dangers of lithium batteries for years. They initially focused on the highly regulated batteries in energy storage systems, which hold backup electricity for buildings.
Leo Subbarao, who worked as a fire protection engineer in the department until 2019, recalled there had been talk back then about whether the city should allow a battery storage system to be placed under an elevated subway track. Fire officials quickly put an end to that.
"The technology was moving forward so fast, and we were trying to catch up with regulations," said Mr. Subbarao, who lectures at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
After the Citi Bike fire, battery safety became a priority for the bike-share program. It uses only batteries that have been certified to safety standards and have built-in sensors to monitor their condition in real time, as well as a shut-down switch. In the warehouse, each battery is inspected and charged in a rack with fireproof concrete dividers. There has not been a major battery fire since at Citi Bike since these protocols were added.
Fire officials also revised the city fire code, which now requires buildings to provide safety measures, like a dedicated charging room with a sprinkler, when more than five e-bikes are charging.
But the fire code does not cover the individual use of e-bikes, and fire inspectors do not enter private dwellings to check for safety violations without a warrant. So there are no safeguards to prevent what happened to Josue Mendez.
Mr. Mendez, a delivery worker, had plugged an e-bike battery to charge beside his bed in his Bronx apartment in 2021. He woke up to see it "throwing smoke," and then it exploded like fireworks. Mr. Mendez and his family sprinted out the door, flames chasing them. "Thank God we were able to come out alive," said Mr. Mendez, 31, a Mexican immigrant, who was burned on his back and arms.
After the fire, Mr. Mendez's family moved to another building in northern Manhattan. Earlier this year, the building banned e-bikes, but it did not ban the batteries themselves, which pose the most danger. So Mr. Mendez parked his e-bike on the street and took the batteries upstairs to charge.
'We're trying to squeeze too much energy out of these batteries'
Lithium batteries, which have been used commercially since 1991, have a history of sparking fires in Dell notebook computers, Samsung smartphones and hoverboards, leading to huge recalls.
But after years of research to "engineer the hazard out," lithium batteries have generally become safer, said Adam Barowy, a fire protection engineer who specializes in lithium batteries for the Fire Safety Research Institute at UL Research Institutes, a nonprofit.
Inside a lithium battery, a number of small cells are bundled together. When the battery is used, lithium ions move between the electrodes inside each cell, generating an electrical current. The danger occurs when a cell goes into "thermal runaway," a chain reaction in which heat develops extremely quickly, creating a threat of fire and sometimes explosion. A cell can be sent into thermal runaway by overcharging, a manufacturing defect or even the heat from an adjacent cell in the battery pack that is already in thermal runaway.
But there is market pressure on manufacturers to add more energy to batteries, which can push safety limits. The batteries in e-bikes contain far more energy than in cellphones and, as a result, are more destructive in a fire.
"The problem is that we're trying to squeeze too much energy out of these batteries, and that makes them more dangerous," said Nikhil Gupta, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering.
Regulation means costly testing but safer devices
More powerful batteries are only part of the reason that so many e-bikes and e-scooters are catching fire. Electric cars and energy storage systems, which are being increasingly adopted to fight climate change, require far more energy and yet have fewer fires.
The difference, according to battery and fire safety experts, is that those industries are closely regulated and have to go through several layers of testing to show their products are safe. Until recently, e-bikes and e-scooters have not received similar scrutiny.
Victoria Hutchison, a senior research project manager at the Fire Protection Research Foundation, said the lack of safety regulations and testing requirements has allowed cheaper, low-quality devices and batteries of questionable safety to enter the market. "That's really the root of the problem," she said.
These products of questionable origin also make it difficult for victims to sue. The batteries are often destroyed in the fires, and even when they can be recovered, they can lack identifying marks to trace back to a specific manufacturer or distributor who can be held legally responsible, according to lawyers and fire experts.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has increased its oversight of e-mobility devices, urging companies to "comply with established voluntary safety standards or face possible enforcement action." And New York lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have proposed a federal safety standard for lithium batteries used in those devices.
Ash Lovell, the electric bicycle policy and campaign director for PeopleForBikes, the national trade association for bike manufacturers, which has called for more safety regulations, said the low-quality batteries do not reflect the overall e-bike industry. Most of their members also sell e-bikes in Europe and have already met robust safety regulations there, she said.
Fatal flames and a heartbroken family
When Mr. Muñoz brought home the red e-scooter from the bodega, it did not come with any safety certifications. He did not know to be worried.
He met his girlfriend, Marilu Torres, at a party in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in 2013. He drank too much and left his sweater and an ID card. She returned them. They moved in together, and the next year, Stephanie was born.
They called her "gatito," kitten in Spanish, because she made meowing sounds when she was young. She had a big heart for all creatures, even alligators and tarantulas. "She would like something odd and make it her own," said Jefferson Jimenez, 19, Ms. Torres's son.
Mr. Muñoz said he bought the e-scooter so Mr. Jimenez could ride it. He also used it to make extra money delivering Grubhub orders.
But then the trouble started. Mr. Muñoz was riding it one day when the battery died. He had to push the scooter home. "I'm going to throw it in the garbage," he said he told himself. When he plugged in the battery, it would not charge.
His co-worker at the bodega brought in another charger, and then another, until one finally worked. That night, Mr. Muñoz brought the charger and battery to his apartment and went to sleep. Hours later, he woke up to smoke "like the darkest thing you have ever seen."
With severe burns on his face, arms and hands, Mr. Muñoz spent two months in the hospital. He was there when he found out that the cause of all the misery and devastation had been the battery.
Ms. Torres said the e-scooter she never wanted has "broken part of me."

Full text: The Taliban administration is stuck in a cat-and-mouse game with WhatsApp, which is off-limits to the nascent government because of U.S. sanctions.
Late one night two months ago, a team of Taliban security officers assembled on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital to prepare for a raid on an Islamic State hide-out.
As the zero hour approached, the men fiddled with their automatic rifles while their leader, Habib Rahman Inqayad, scrambled to get the exact location of their target. He grabbed his colleagues' phones and called their superiors, who insisted they had sent him the location pin of the target to his WhatsApp.
There was just one problem: WhatsApp had blocked his account to comply with American sanctions.
"The only way we communicate is WhatsApp -- and I didn't have access," said Mr. Inqayad, 25, whom The New York Times has followed since the Taliban seized power in August 2021.
He was not alone. In recent months, complaints from Taliban officials, the police and soldiers of their WhatsApp accounts being banned or temporarily deactivated have become widespread, disruptions that have illuminated how the messaging platform has become a backbone of the Taliban's nascent government. Those interruptions also underscore the far-reaching consequences of international sanctions on a government that has become among the most isolated in the world.
The United States has long criminalized any form of support for the Taliban. Consequently, WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, scans group names, descriptions and group profile photos on the messaging app to identify users among the Taliban and block their accounts, according to a spokesman for the company.
The policy has been in place since U.S. sanctions were enacted more than two decades ago. Even when the Taliban were an insurgency, the ban handicapped some fighters who relied on the app because it catered to people with neither literacy nor technological skills; using WhatsApp's voice message feature, they could send messages and listen to the verbal instructions from their commanders with the press of a button.
But over the past two years, the Taliban's reliance on WhatsApp has become even more far-reaching as smartphone use has proliferated and 4G networks have improved across Afghanistan with the end of the U.S.-led war. As the Taliban have consolidated control and settled into governance, the inner bureaucratic workings of their administration have also become more organized -- with WhatsApp central to their official communications.
Government departments use WhatsApp groups to disseminate information among employees. Officials rely on other groups to distribute statements to journalists and transmit official communiqués between ministries. Security forces plan and coordinate raids on Islamic State cells, criminal networks and resistance fighters from their phones on the app.
"WhatsApp is so important to us -- all my work depends on it," said Shir Ahmad Burhani, a police spokesman for the Taliban administration in Baghlan Province, in northern Afghanistan. "If there were no WhatsApp, all our administrative and nonadministrative work would be paralyzed."
The use of WhatsApp among the Taliban's ranks began during the war, as the app gained popularity worldwide and cellphone towers began sprouting up across Afghanistan. Today, experts estimate that around 70 percent of Afghanistan's population has access to a cellphone. Like millions across the globe, Afghans depend on WhatsApp's speed and flexibility to communicate with each other and the outside world.
During the war, Taliban fighters took photographs when they attacked government outposts and shared them on WhatsApp with their superiors and the insurgency's media wing, said Kunduzi, a commander in the Taliban Army's Second Regiment, who preferred to go only by his surname because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. "WhatsApp was a simple tool, and sending videos and photos via email used to take a lot of work and time," he added.
Since the Taliban seized power, the popularity and accessibility of WhatsApp among the group's ranks has grown rapidly. Former Taliban fighters began using their smartphones around the clock, no longer afraid that Western forces could use the signal to track or target them in drone strikes, they say.
As thousands of former fighters took up new posts as policemen and soldiers in major cities that were now under Taliban control, they also gained access to proper cellphone stores.
One recent afternoon at a cellphone shop in central Kabul, the capital, a dozen Talibs crowded onto wooden benches, waiting for their service tickets to be called. Since the new government began doling out salaries to Taliban fighters turned government employees, cellphone providers have been overrun with new customers. Many vendors can no longer keep up with the demand. Across Afghanistan, stores have reported shortages of SIM cards and have had to turn customers away.
Sitting in the waiting room, Muhammad Arif Omid, 21, fiddled with his paper ticket in one hand and his Samsung smartphone in the other. Originally from Helmand Province in the south, Mr. Omid bought his first cellphone and SIM card around four years ago -- back when doing so was a days- or weekslong effort.
"We were living in the mountains -- we couldn't go to the shops in cities to get a phone or SIM," he said. Instead, Talib fighters had to track down secondhand dealers in rural provinces under the movement's control or give money to a relative to shop for them. Nowadays, he says, getting a nice smartphone and data plan is easier than ever.
But the cat-and-mouse game of shutting down accounts has become a headache for officials in the Taliban administration -- an almost daily reminder that the government they lead is all but shunned on the world stage.
No foreign government has formally recognized the Taliban administration in Afghanistan. The U.S. government's freeze on billions of dollars of assets belonging to the Afghan central bank has hindered the economy. Travel bans have kept Taliban leaders from meeting some dignitaries abroad. Some social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube appear to have interpreted the sanctions more loosely and have allowed Taliban members to use their platforms, but the country's most popular messaging app is technically off-limits.
"We have one group of 50 people belonging to the Islamic Emirate, and 40 to 45 WhatsApp numbers in it have been blocked," said Abdul Mobin Safi, a spokesman for the police in Takhar Province, in northern Afghanistan, referring to the Taliban administration as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Mr. Safi has been among those barred -- a move that caused him to lose around 10 gigabytes of data, including old photographs and videos from the war, and the numbers of many of his colleagues.
"It's like I have lost half of my memory," he said. "I've faced a lot of problems -- I lost the numbers of reporters, of everyone."
Still, many who have had their accounts shut down have found workarounds, buying new SIM cards and opening new accounts, and turned the ban more into a game of Whac-A-Mole.
About a month after Mr. Inqayad, the security officer, was unable to reach his commanders during the night operation, he begrudgingly bought a new SIM card, opened a new WhatsApp account and began the process of recovering lost phone numbers and rejoining WhatsApp groups.
Sitting at his police post, a refurbished shipping container with a hand-held radio, Mr. Inqayad pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his new account. He pointed out all of the groups he is a part of: one for all of the police in his district, another for the former fighters loyal to a single commander, a third he uses to communicate with his superiors at headquarters. In all, he says, he is a part of around 80 WhatsApp groups -- more than a dozen of which are used for official government purposes.
He recently purchased a new unlimited data plan that costs him 700 afghanis a month -- about $ 8. It is expensive for his budget, he says, but worth it for the app.
"My entire life is on my WhatsApp," he said.

Indian Official Drains Reservoir to Find Phone: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Rajesh Vishwas, a food inspector, used a diesel pump to empty part of a reservoir where he had lost his smartphone.
Say you drop your brand-new smartphone into a reservoir while posing for a selfie during a picnic. Would you consider it lost and buy a replacement, or drain the reservoir to retrieve it?
An Indian official who chose the latter option has been suspended from his job. He is also facing the glare of the national news media in a drought-prone country where water is a precious commodity.
The official, Rajesh Vishwas, 32, was picnicking with friends in central India on May 21 when he dropped his Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra into the Paralkot reservoir in Chhattisgarh State, where he lives. The $ 1,200 device is a new model, and Mr. Vishwas, a government food inspector, apparently decided that he had to have it back and claimed that it had official departmental data, according to NDTV, the Indian television station.
Initially, some villagers he knew spent two days diving in the reservoir in an attempt to retrieve the phone, Mr. Vishwas told The Indian Express newspaper. No luck. So he rented a diesel pump and drained about three feet of water over another two days -- by some estimates, enough to irrigate 1,500 acres of farmland.
Mr. Vishwas later said he had received "oral permission" from R.C. Dhivar, an official at the local Water Resources Department, to drain three or four feet of water. Mr. Dhivar said that doing so "would in fact benefit the farmers," Mr. Vishwas told NDTV.
Attempts to reach both men for comment on Saturday were unsuccessful. Priyanka Shukla, a top local official, said in an interview on Saturday that Mr. Vishwas had no authority to drain the water.
Whatever the arrangement was, it backfired.
By the time Mr. Vishwas ‌retrieved his phone‌ this past week‌, it was unusable, according to reports in the Indian news media. And after word of his operation made headlines across the country, he was temporarily removed from his post for having "misused his position."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As for Mr. Dhivar, officials said they had asked him to explain his position on the episode, in writing, within two days. He could eventually face disciplinary action.
The incident drew criticism from some prominent pundits and politicians, including Raman Singh, a former Chhattisgarh State chief minister.
"Today in the scorching heat people are dependent on tankers, there is no arrangement for even drinking water," Mr. Singh, a leader from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in opposition in the state, wrote on Twitter on Friday. At the same time, he added, with the water drained in the effort to retrieve Mr. Vishwas's phone, "one and a half thousand acres of land could have been irrigated."
India, which is among the world's most water-stressed countries, has experienced several major heat waves and droughts in recent years. They are vivid reminders of how exceedingly vulnerable the nation is to the effects of global warming.
Mr. Vishwas told The Indian Express that news reports of his phone-retrieval operation had been greatly exaggerated. He also said the Paralkot reservoir was not used for irrigation.
But Ms. Shukla, a district magistrate in the area, said that local farmers did rely on it to irrigate their fields.
"He will face consequences for draining the water, and this won't be tolerated," she added.

China's Ban on Micron Escalates Microchip War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A Chinese government block on Micron Technology's memory chips marks how far apart the two economic powers are drifting on tech policy.
When cutting foreign technology companies from Chinese supply chains, Beijing has long chosen to work obliquely or even secretly. Regulators would give executives back-room lectures, weigh them down with excessive red tape or hit them with occasional office raids. Rarely did the government tell a firm outright it was no longer welcome.
But that is what it signaled to Micron Technology in a late-night announcement on Sunday.
The Chinese government barred companies that handle critical information from buying microchips made by the Boise, Idaho-based Micron. The company's chips, which are used for memory storage in all kinds of electronics, like phones and computers, were deemed to pose "relatively serious cybersecurity problems" by China's internet watchdog after a review.
Micron said it was "evaluating" the government's finding and "assessing" what it would do next. Analysts said the company, which has been selling chips in China for years, could find itself cut out of future business from Chinese companies.
The openness and speed with which the Chinese authorities took action against Micron -- they spent less than two months on the investigation -- underscore how far apart the two sides are drifting on tech policy. Last year, the Biden administration took harsh steps to block Chinese chip makers' access to crucial tools needed to make advanced chips, as well as access to the chips that run supercomputers and craft powerful artificial intelligence algorithms.
The Micron action, widely seen as a reprisal for those moves, shows some of China's advantages over the United States: a speedy, and feared, authoritarian rule that can quickly pronounce and enforce absolute bans. It also offers a glimpse of new tactics by Beijing.
With the block of Micron, the authorities carved out a space in the industry that Chinese chip makers could fill. The move could also present a new wedge between the United States and its allies, whose companies could make billions of dollars in sales if they were to step in and pick up business that Micron might lose.
For Beijing, hurting an American company that makes critical equipment advances the government's goal of boosting its domestic tech sector.
"It may not be feasible or necessary to completely replace all products with domestic ones, but for these core products, we need to develop our own capabilities and avoid being overly dependent," said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. "This applies not only to the chip industry but also to other sectors," he added.
For the better part of a decade, China and the United States have jockeyed over global technological leadership. Chinese computer hacks of American firms, and policies designed to acquire closely held intellectual property, raised red flags in Washington. In Beijing, revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor, exposed the vulnerability in relying too much on American tech.
As each side maneuvered to find new advantages, both came to focus on the semiconductor industry. The tiny microchips that do the thinking for just about all electronics were a convenient choke point for the United States, which worked to cut off China's access to the smallest and fastest chips. The hope was to make China's supercomputers less smart and its smartphones less salable.
To counter Washington, China lavished subsidies on domestic chip leaders. While they failed to catch up to global rivals in the arena of the most advanced chips, some firms succeeded with less sophisticated parts, like memory chips and larger logic chips that work in cheaper smartphones and cars.
Then the Biden administration in October announced a major set of policies aimed at China's most successful semiconductor companies. The move, along with billions in new subsidies for chip production in the United States, were viewed dimly by Chinese policymakers, said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy advisement firm.
"Officials in Beijing over the past months have been complaining to anyone who will listen about U.S. actions," he said. "Beijing views these moves as primarily politically driven and is now willing to go tit for tat," Mr. Triolo added.
In some ways, China is better equipped for that exchange. China's authoritarian system enables quick action and guarantees that few domestic firms will break with policy.
In the United States, political debate and legal challenges can dull the sharpness of government efforts. Major American companies, for instance, found legal workarounds to Washington's attempts to cut component sales to companies like the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei. Some multinationals successfully lobbied for licenses to allow them to keep selling to blacklisted companies.
By targeting Micron specifically, China is hitting at one of the few sectors -- memory chips -- that it has a toehold in with its chip competition with the United States.
While protecting such success by barring American competitors makes strategic sense, China remains very reliant on the United States for advanced chips, according to Teng Tai, an economist and the director of the Wanbo New Economic Research Institute in Beijing.
"The ultimate goal of retaliating against Micron is to urge certain American companies to restrain themselves, so we could further promote technology and trade cooperation, and avoid pursuing an isolated and self-reliant approach," he wrote Monday on Weibo, a Chinese social media outlet.
Another question that Sunday's action against Micron raises is how the United States' ally South Korea will respond. Its companies, in particular Samsung and SK Hynix, have the most to gain from the Micron ban. The two companies stand to pick up customers from Micron, which reported $ 3.3 billion in sales in China in 2022.
Mr. Xiang, the Chinese government adviser, said: "Why should South Korea blindly follow the United States and harm its own interests? I don't think South Korea has such an obligation."

Miffed China Bans Chips Made in U.S. By Micron: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many analysts see the move as retaliation for Washington's efforts to cut off China's access to high-end chips.
Beijing on Sunday told Chinese companies that deal with critical information to stop purchasing products from Micron Technology, the U.S.-based manufacturer of memory chips used in phones, computers and other electronics. Many analysts viewed the move as retaliation for Washington's efforts to cut off China's access to high-end chips.
In a statement on its official social media site, the Cyberspace Administration of China said that in a cybersecurity review it had found that the chip maker's products posed "relatively serious cybersecurity problems." The problems could "seriously endanger the supply chain of China's critical information infrastructure" and threaten national security, it said.
China's action is the latest volley in an economic tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington that is rearranging the fabric of a sprawling global microchip industry. The decision to bar Micron from selling its chips to key companies could have a ripple effect through China's supply chains as Micron's Chinese customers seek to replace the U.S. memory chips with homegrown or Korean versions. South Korean chip makers like Samsung and SK Hynix are Micron's competitors and already do significant business with China.
Beijing initiated a cybersecurity review of Micron in late March as part of what it called a "normal regulatory measure." The announcement came after Washington rolled out restrictions in October against China's semiconductor industry. Micron said at the time that it was "cooperating fully" with the investigation and that its China business was operating as normal.
In a statement, the company said it was "evaluating the conclusion and assessing our next steps," adding that it was "continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities."
Since the announcement in March, China has been engaged in an all-out campaign to shore up its homegrown chip industry. Beijing has spent billions of dollars on the efforts at self-reliance and Chinese companies up and down the supply chain have moved to replace Western chips and parts.
The Chinese authorities offered few clues about what they had discovered that posed serious risks. They have also provided little information about what is required of companies during a cybersecurity review.
In a statement, a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said the action against Micron, "along with recent raids and targeting of other American firms, is inconsistent with the People's Republic of China's assertions that it is opening its markets and committed to a transparent regulatory framework." The department will "engage directly" with Chinese officials in response, the statement said.
But Graham Webster, the editor in chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center, said that among the risks was the potential for further sanctions by Washington that could cut off important Chinese companies from Micron's memory chips.
"Supply-chain security includes the risk of a foreign government cutting off supply, which the U.S. government has done in multiple ways for other semiconductors," Mr. Webster said. He added that China's decision may have been partly a "derisking measure to avoid further reliance on supplies the U.S. might cut off."
Washington has urged South Korean officials to prevent its chip makers from filling the market void if Micron was unable to sell its chips to China, The Financial Times reported in April.
China approved a cybersecurity law in 2016 that outlined rules to safeguard what it called "critical information infrastructure," which refers to technology systems in sectors including telecommunications, transportation and defense that Chinese regulators believe would be vulnerable if they malfunctioned or leaked data.
Micron, which is based in Boise, Idaho, built its first factory in China in 2007. In recent years as relations between the United States and China cooled, it has begun to downsize its operations, reducing the number of Chinese staff and shutting down some operations. As of April, it had about 3,000 employees in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.
The impact of Sunday's decision on the company could be sizable. In 2022, Micron reported $ 3.3 billion in sales in China, roughly 11 percent of its annual $ 30.8 billion in global sales. It was unclear how much of those sales in China would be affected by the government's action.

Growing Trade Restrictions Force New Business Plans And Altered Supply Chains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Seven months after Washington unveiled tough curbs, Chinese companies are doubling down on homegrown supply chains and drawing billions in cash from Beijing and investors.
Last October, construction plans for a hulking semiconductor factory owned by a major state-backed company in central China fell into disarray. The Biden administration had escalated the trade war over technology, severing China's access to the Western tools and skilled workers it needed to build the most advanced semiconductors.
Some employees with U.S. citizenship departed the company. Three U.S. equipment suppliers almost immediately halted their shipments and services, and Europe and Japan are expected to do the same soon.
The facility belonged to Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, or YMTC, a memory chip company that Xi Jinping, China's president, has extolled as a flag-bearer in China's race toward self-reliance. Now, the chip maker and its peers are hurriedly overhauling supply chains and rewriting business plans.
Nearly seven months later, the U.S. trade barriers have accelerated China's push for a more independent chip sector. Western technology and money have pulled out, but state funding is flooding in to cultivate homegrown alternatives to produce less advanced but still lucrative semiconductors. And China has not given up on making high-end chips: Manufacturers are attempting to work with older parts from abroad not blocked by the U.S. sanctions, as well as less advanced equipment at home.
The tough U.S. restrictions stemmed from alarm over what officials in Washington viewed as the threat posed by China's use of its technology companies to upgrade its military arsenal. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, recently characterized the sentiment as part of a "new consensus" in Washington that decades of economic integration with China was not wholly successful, adding that the new controls were "carefully tailored" to go after China's most cutting-edge semiconductors.
Under the October rules, American enterprises and citizens may no longer aid any Chinese companies building chip technology that meets a certain threshold of sophistication. The controls went beyond Trump administration trade curbs that went after specific companies like the Chinese telecom giant Huawei.
During those earlier trade tensions, Beijing mobilized vast sums to cultivate homegrown alternatives to Western chip makers. But foreign components were readily available and of higher quality, leaving many Chinese firms unwilling to make the switch.
Those reservations about using materials from China appear to be easing. Chinese tech companies up and down the supply chain are assessing how to replace Western chips and related components, even those unaffected by U.S. controls. Guangzhou Automobile Group, a state-owned electric vehicle manufacturer, said in February that it aimed to eventually purchase all of its roughly 1,000 chips in its cars from Chinese providers. It currently buys 90 percent of its chips from overseas.
"The goal now in China in a lot of areas is to de-Americanize supply chains," said Paul Triolo, the senior vice president for China at Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategy firm.
Dozens of Chinese chip companies are finalizing plans to raise money through public offerings this year. They include China's second-largest chip manufacturer, Hua Hong Semiconductor, as well as a chip tool maker backed by Huawei.
The technology disputes between the world's two largest economies show no signs of abating. The Biden administration has drafted, but not yet released, new rules that would restrict American venture capital investments in advanced chip companies in China. Foreign investment into China's semiconductor sector this year has already tumbled to $ 600 million, its lowest point since 2020, according to data from PitchBook, which tracks private financing. And officials are mulling tighter controls on technologies like quantum computing or chip manufacturing equipment.
U.S. restrictions have caused Beijing to activate a state fund that had been dormant because of waste and graft: The government's "Big Fund" injected roughly $ 1.9 billion into YMTC in February to bolster its response to the U.S. restrictions. The fund has also recently put money into chip equipment and material suppliers, according to state media reports.
The new subsidies aim to remove Western components from China's supply chains. The southern city of Guangzhou has earmarked over $ 21 billion this year for semiconductor and other tech projects including those that attempt to replace Western chip equipment suppliers. Purchase orders for Chinese-made equipment have spiked in recent months, according to corporate reports and press statements.
Mr. Xi has been outspoken about what he sees as an effort by Western countries to enforce an "all-around containment" of China. During an important legislative meeting in March, the Chinese president interrupted remarks by a delegate from a Chinese crane manufacturer. The exchange was widely reported by state media: "The chips inside your cranes, are they locally sourced?" Mr. Xi asked. Yes, the delegate said.
So far, less than 1 percent of all semiconductors in China are at the industry's top end that are subject to U.S. controls, according to estimates from Yole Group, a market research firm. The rest are less advanced, or "mature," semiconductors, found in everyday consumer electronics and cars, and are "the vast majority of the business," said Jean-Christophe Eloy, the chief executive of Yole Group. Those chips, largely untouched by the Biden administration's October controls, are now seeing a surge of investment, he added.
China's two largest chip manufacturers, the state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and Hua Hong Semiconductor have each announced billions of dollars this year to expand production into mature chips, according to public announcements.
Yet over the long term, China's lack of access to world-class tools needed to make chips could stymie its progress in many advanced industries like artificial intelligence and aerospace, according to Handel Jones, the chief executive of International Business Strategies, a consulting firm.
Last August, YMTC had targeted a three fold increase in its share of global chip production to 13 percent by 2027, challenging chip incumbents like U.S.-based Micron Technology, according to Yole Group's estimates. Facing trouble building out its second factory, the Chinese memory chip maker's production is set to decline, sliding to just 3 percent of the market in 2027.
International companies that had previously invested in China's semiconductor industry are diverting their investments elsewhere. Korea and Taiwan's leading chip manufacturers, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, are investing billions of dollars into new production in the United States. The Taiwanese chip-maker is applying for U.S. subsidies for its Arizona factory that force it to cap its investment into China for a decade.
At the same time, experts said, the weakening of foreign influence over China's chip sector is creating opportunity for domestic companies. Last month, a semiconductor equipment manufacturer went public in Shanghai. Shares of the company, Crystal Growth & Energy Equipment, have climbed 30 percent since its debut.
"It's because of the sanctions that there's now space in the market," said Xiang Ligang, a director of a Beijing-based technology consortium who has advised the Chinese government on technology issues. "Now we have a chance to develop."
The recent burst of state cash could supercharge China's share of global production in lower-end chips. In the next decade, China could account for roughly half of the world's production capacity for a class of mature semiconductors, according to a jointly written report by Rhodium Group, a consulting firm, and Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a think tank in Berlin.
That could create new supply chain vulnerabilities for foreign companies, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, a co-author of the report.
"Putting all of your eggs in one basket is a stupid idea," he explained. "This is a choke point that can be exploited."

A Company That Is Crucial To the Security of an Island Faces a Shortage of Engineers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan's world-dominating microchip sector was built by TSMC's skilled employees. But a demographic crisis, demanding work culture and flagging interest threaten its lead.
Engineers like Royale Lee, 31, are one reason Taiwan is the world's biggest contract producer of the microchips that power almost all electronics.
When a computer virus paralyzed machinery at his employer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Mr. Lee pulled a 48-hour shift to help fix the problem. For years he responded to phone calls day and night. But in late 2021, after five years of sacrifices, he had come to fear the ring of his phone. His annual compensation of $ 105,000, an envied sum in Taiwan, was not enough for him to stick around.
Over the past decade, TSMC, as the company is known, has built a wide lead over rivals like Intel and Samsung in the race to make the smallest -- and fastest -- microchips. Largely because of the ingenuity of its engineers, TSMC has become one of the most geopolitically important firms in the world.
Today, many at the top of Taiwan's semiconductor industry fear the tiny island territory will not be able to sustain the growing demand for a new generation of engineers. A shrinking population, demanding work culture and an abundance of competing tech jobs have meant workers have become ever more scarce.
The stakes are enormous. Some military strategists argue that TSMC's dominance in microchips provides Taiwan a guarantee against an invasion by China -- in part because the United States would need to defend such an important piece of its supply chain.
Taiwan's talent crisis is intertwined with TSMC's success. The company's employee count has grown almost 70 percent over the past decade, while Taiwan's birthrate has plummeted by half. Start-ups in promising fields like artificial intelligence are luring top engineers. In recruiting, TSMC must compete with internet companies like Google and foreign semiconductor companies like ASML of the Netherlands, which generally offer better work-life balance and perks like free food.
TSMC's leaders have defended the company's famously tough work culture, which has helped it grow into a $ 440 billion behemoth with 73,000 employees. Morris Chang, the founder, recently defended the military discipline he expected -- spouses, he said, would just fall back asleep when TSMC called employees to work in the middle of the night. But in recent years, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu has repeatedly acknowledged that the largest challenge facing Taiwan's semiconductor industry is its shortage of talent.
Taiwan's largest job search platform, 104 Job Bank, had over 33,000 listings for chip industry jobs as of August. Last year, Taiwan's chip sector employed about 326,000 people, according to the government-affiliated Industrial Technology Research Institute.
TSMC has been forced to adjust its recruitment strategies. It has broadened hiring channels and increased its base salary for master's graduates, who can now expect to receive an average annual compensation of up to $ 65,000. It begins recruiting Taiwanese graduate students in September, well ahead of the conventional job-hunting season of March, and has even begun to cultivate high schoolers with online classes about the basics of semiconductors.
"Many companies are struggling to find suitable candidates," said Burn Lin, a former vice president at TSMC and the current dean of National Tsing Hua University's College of Semiconductor Research.
"Now when searching for talent, they are not very picky," Mr. Lin said. "You don't necessarily have to study electrical engineering or computer science."
The college Mr. Lin heads is one of four specialized semiconductor schools that were established by the Taiwanese government in 2021 in response to calls for action by industry players like Mr. Liu and Tsai Ming-kai, chairman of the chip design firm MediaTek.
"In cultivating semiconductor talent, we are racing against time," Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's president, said at the unveiling of Mr. Lin's semiconductor college.
The challenges facing Taiwan's chip industry come amid a global crunch. In China, where officials have sought to lure Taiwanese engineers to build up its fledgling chip industry, the state-backed Chinese Academy of Sciences has fretted about a "serious shortage" of qualified workers. By one estimate, China's microchip industry was short 200,000 people.
In the United States, government efforts to use billions of dollars in subsidies to attract semiconductor plants have spurred Intel, Samsung, TSMC and others to announce plans for new plants. But surveys of executives showed talent shortages remain a problem.
At TSMC, the recruitment gap back home has added urgency to its efforts to build factories, and train workers, outside Taiwan. Unlike most major hardware companies, which long ago spread research and production across the world, TSMC has built the vast majority of its chip manufacturing plants, known as fabs, in Taiwan. The clustering of its best employees and suppliers as well as most cutting-edge plants has helped it over the years, but the company needs to start looking beyond Taiwan, according to Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih.
"If I were TSMC I'd get serious about finding other places where I can get that talent," he said.
Making semiconductors requires skilled and disciplined employees and it is part of the reason TSMC excels at it, said Wu Chih-I, director of the TSMC-National Taiwan University Joint Research Center.
Mr. Wu, who worked as an engineer at Intel early in his career, said tech workers today are more interested in jobs that fit their interests, rather than just pursuing a paycheck as his generation was.‌ ‌
"If you don't have significant financial pressure, you might choose a less demanding job, even if it means passing up the high salary and promising future of a semiconductor career."
Mr. Lee, the former TSMC employee, said younger Taiwanese are less willing to endure the grueling experience of working in a fab.
"It's no longer as glorious as it used to be," said Mr. Lee, who now works as a web developer for an American firm.
Jason Chin, senior vice president of 104 Job Bank, said TSMC and other chip companies will never stop the turnover without improving working conditions.
That applies not just to workers like Mr. Lee who face the grueling job of keeping plants running, but also critical researchers who think up new ways to make chips ever faster.
Frank Lin, 30, is one such TSMC researcher who left because he found the work tedious and unfulfilling. His role as product engineer and chip designer was not as high pressure as others at the company, but he nonetheless struggled, craving more meaning and a sense of accomplishment. Even though he had a master's degree from one of Taiwan's most prestigious universities, he was given scant responsibility and assigned rote daily tasks.
"Though the amount of money I make continues to increase, is this all there is to life?" he remembered thinking often at work when sitting in a sunlit office pantry. After fewer than three years at the company, he struck out on his own as an independent financial adviser. He hasn't looked back. "People want to work for themselves. There are so many possibilities in the outside world right now," he said.

Deft Moves Help Google Make Gains On 2 Fronts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Google's latest entry-level phone, which costs $ 500, is just as good as devices nearly double its price.
Not long ago, there were plenty of compelling reasons to spend upward of $ 900 on a smartphone. Nowadays, you'll have to come up with an excuse to pay that much.
I ran out of reasons to splurge and stopped buying fancier phones with the "Pro" moniker over the past two years. That's not just because I'm frugal. Cheaper phones have increasingly become indistinguishable from high-end ones, and the few features that set them apart rarely justify the extra cost.
Google's new budget phone that arrives in stores this week, the Pixel 7A, is the latest testament to the maturation of the smartphone market, and it presents an opportunity to save money. The entry-level handset, priced at $ 500, is in many ways on par with its premium counterpart, the Pixel 7 Pro, which cost $ 900. And based on my testing for a week, I would recommend the budget model for most Android users.
Bear with me as I break from the tradition of reviewing a phone's features. Putting the Pixel 7A's value into perspective requires a history lesson on smartphones.
For most of the last decade, the biggest disadvantage to buying Android phones instead of Apple's iPhones was that they were short lived. Most Android phones received software updates for roughly two years, at which point they became less safe to use because they lacked security protections against the latest vulnerabilities. In contrast, iPhones got updates for about six years.
Many Android phone makers struggled to keep up with software updates because they relied on chips and components from an array of different manufacturers, and it was difficult to make new operating systems continue to work with all those parts.
So for a long time, spending more on an Android phone made sense. Samsung's high-end Galaxy smartphones, which cost roughly $ 700 to $ 1,000, got software updates for several years longer than other Androids in part because the South Korean manufacturer tightly controlled its hardware production.
But Google recently gained an edge. In 2018, the search giant acquired the handset maker HTC, which allowed it to make its own mobile computing chip, called Tensor. Google now controls its Pixel hardware and the Android software, so it can guarantee software updates for its Tensor-powered Pixel phones for at least five years.
That longer support life -- combined with Google's Tensor making the Pixel phones faster and more efficient in their power use -- is a win for consumers.
"They want the latest features and they want it to stay secure, so those are the things that we're most focused on," said Brian Rakowski, a Google executive overseeing the Pixel phones.
With that all in mind, the Pixel 7A, which includes the same Tensor chip as the high-end Pixel, offers the best bang for the buck among Android phones. Here's how.
Pixel 7A vs. 'Pro'
The most obvious difference between the Pixel 7A and the higher priced Pixel is the screen. At 6.1-inches diagonally, the display is slightly smaller than the 6.7-inch screen of the Pixel 7 Pro. Whether that's good or bad will depend on you and your body type. To me, a person with a slender build, the Pixel 7A is a reasonable size that feels easier to handle with one hand and fits more comfortably in a pocket.
Google also says that the glass on the Pixel 7 Pro's screen is higher quality than the Pixel 7A's display. But in my experience, all phone screens are susceptible to shattering when dropped on a hard surface, and it's always a better idea to use a protective case.
The other main difference between the premium and cheaper model is the camera. The Pixel 7A has a dual-lens camera and the Pixel 7 Pro has a triple-lens system that can zoom in at a higher resolution. Otherwise, both phones include the same camera software, including a night mode that makes them capable of shooting photos in low light and a tool to sharpen blurry photos. The Pixel 7A's camera excels at all these features.
What matters most on a camera is how the photos look in daylight, because that's how we take most of our pictures. I took photos of my dog, Max, with both phones, and the images from the two devices looked sharp and detailed. Although the pictures taken with the Pixel 7 Pro's camera overall looked ever-so-slightly better, they certainly didn't look $ 400 better. (You be the judge.)
Finally, the Pixel 7A's battery lasted long enough to get me through a normal day of general use, including browsing the web and checking email, just as the Pixel 7 Pro could.
Bottom Line
The blurring line between budget and premium phones raises questions about the sales tactics used by tech companies to market their high-end wares. Companies like Apple, Google and Samsung often say that their expensive phones are devoted to "pro" users, the high-earning road warriors who spend hours chatting on the phone, sending messages and juggling apps.
Yet the image of the pro user has become a marketing myth in the context of smartphones. In just about every occupation, whether it's a college student, a truck driver or a white-collar professional, people rely heavily on phones -- and most handsets at this point excel at all those tasks.
So pick a phone based on your needs, your body type, the operating system you prefer and the apps you use. A budget phone like the Pixel 7A may be the right fit, regardless of what the marketers would like you to think.

Photo Apps With A.I. Go Far Beyond Fixing Red Eyes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Photo apps have been using artificial intelligence for years to give you control over the look of your images. Here's how to take advantage of that.
In today's world of socially shared images, the urge to post a "perfect" photo, free of distractions and blemishes, is nothing new -- the practice of manipulating photographs can be traced back to the 19th century. But instead of using laborious darkroom techniques and other manual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning built into sophisticated smartphone apps now makes it easy for anyone to significantly alter a digital picture.
Vanity-driven repairs are popular, but A.I.-powered editing can even fix fuzzy focus or entirely remove that inebriated fellow photobombing your family beach portrait with just a few screen taps. Here's an overview of what you can do.
How It Works
In a nutshell, apps that incorporate A.I. tools typically analyze an image and make adjustments based on what an aesthetically pleasing photograph is supposed to look like -- sometimes even as you capture the picture and the camera software is processing the file.
A.I. software can detect the subject of a photo and automatically enhance the light and color around it. If you want to remove an object from the photo, the software copies the pixels in one part of the image and uses them to blend and fill in the background where that object used to be.
What You Need
Phones from Apple, Google and Samsung include the company's own photo-editing apps that use A.I. to enhance pictures, but you may get additional features based on your hardware model.
For example, some Samsung Galaxy phone models have an Object Eraser option. Google's recent Pixel phones include software with built-in tools to "unblur" images, erase background distractions and adjust the look of portraits. (This year, the Magic Eraser feature was added to the Android and iOS Google Photos apps for subscribers to the Google One cloud-storage service.)
If your phone's default editing app doesn't include the controls you crave, you can download third-party apps to get the job done; many are dedicated just to making your self-portraits look good. Among the many software options for Android and iOS are Adobe's Photoshop Express or Lightroom, which are free with in-app purchases; Lightroom skews more toward advanced photo-editing work. TouchRetouch ( $ 15 a year) is another dedicated editing app.
If you don't want to spend money or scale a steep learning curve while you experiment, Google's free Snapseed app for Android and iOS is a solid all-around editor with an online help guide.
Fixing Focus
Blurry photos can be caused by errant autofocus, shaky hands or a dirty camera lens, but you may be able to sharpen the picture after the fact. Several dedicated apps offer to "unblur" photos by using A.I. to reconstruct the image and add definition and clarity. Options include PhotoDirector, which cost $ 6 per month and is available for Android and iOS, and Remini, which is $ 5 monthly. But if you have an editing app, you may already have a tool to fix blurriness too, like the Unblur option available on recent Google Pixel models.
For iPhone users, opening a picture in the Photos app, tapping Edit and moving the Sharpness slider may help a slightly blurred image. Adobe Lightroom and Google's Snapseed work similarly: Tap the Details tool and adjust the available sliders.
Small Repairs
For minor adjustments like smoothing over skin blemishes or touching up old family photos, most apps offer a "healing brush" tool that copies or blends in surrounding pixels to remove imperfections. Just select the tool and set the brush size -- using too big a brush can pull in pixels from other parts of the image and distort things.
Red eyes in flash photos are not as much of a problem as it used to be thanks to cameras and software that better capture images in low light, but some apps like Adobe Photoshop Express still include a dedicated tool for neutralizing the demonic retinal reflection.
Removing Distractions
"Eraser" tools remove objects that divert attention from the photo's subject. Power lines, street signs, garbage bins and annoying people can all be swiped out of view. Some apps, like Google Photos, even automatically suggest elements to remove from the picture when you tap its Magic Eraser button.
To manually remove objects with an eraser tool, run your finger over the item you wish to remove from the image. It may take a few swipes to fully remove the object. In some cases, if the software doesn't produce seamless results, you may have to experiment.
Blurring the background of an image can also minimize distractions. Both the iOS Photos and Google Photos apps include tools for editing the background blur in portraits.
All in all, A.I. can do wonders for a photograph deemed imperfect by technical or compositional issues (or just plain vanity). But it's also important to remember that these manipulated images are also their own artificial reality.

Full text: The girls arrive at the makeshift cricket ground on their bicycles, a narrow file of white athletic uniforms breezing down a dirt track that cuts through lush wheat fields in India's Punjab region. They wear their names and numbers on their backs, their hair tied in long, neat braids. The youngest is 9, the oldest 14.
It's time for practice: a two-mile run, a couple hours of batting, bowling and catching drills, and lots of giggles. Overseeing it all is Gulab Singh Shergill, a police officer by day, their manager, mentor and champion by evening. The girls, including his own daughter, all refer to him as "veera," meaning elder brother in Punjabi.
But there would be no team, no dream, without the women. When someone is struck by a ball -- made of hard cork and leather -- Mr. Shergill's mother, Harjeet Kaur, is there to offer comfort until the sobbing stops and the girl runs back to the pitch. Mr. Shergill's wife, Kamaldeep Kaur, helps coordinate with the 20-odd families through the team's WhatsApp group. His sister, Jasvir Kaur, acts as a physical therapist of sorts: tummy rubs and deep breaths for the 9-year-old who arrived for practice after overindulging at a wedding function, facedown stretches for the girl struggling with leg cramps.
For the girls, the daily routine is an escape from the boredom of village life. After each practice, they lie in a circle, their backs to the grass, their faces to the sky's fading light. They close their eyes for two minutes of silent reflection.
It's about a lot more than cricket.
"What is the village life? You wake up at 5 a.m., bake bread and prepare food and tea -- all the housework is for the girls," Mr. Shergill tells them. "If you don't become a player, you will be waking up early all your life until you are old. It will be marriage, and working for your husband, and then it will be for your children."
And if they make it as professional players?
"You will have helpers," he says with a smile. "You will pick up the phone, ring them, and they will bring you tea."
If it ever felt as if Mr. Shergill was selling a pipe dream, it now feels a bit less so.
A remarkable thing happened this spring: A new Indian professional cricket league for women held its inaugural season, a more than $ 500 million bet on female talent in what is by far the country's most popular sport.
The women's league is modeled on India's hugely successful men's professional cricket league, known as the Indian Premier League, featuring teams that are stocked mostly with Indian players but also include other top players from around the world. The two leagues make India the world's foremost stage for professional cricket.
In just 15 years, the men's Premier League has become one of the most valuable sports organizations on the planet. Teams bought for $ 100 million are now estimated to be worth $ 1 billion. The money flooding in has been used to improve infrastructure at the sport's lower levels and groom younger players.
Now, wealthy investors see an opportunity in the Women's Premier League, too, and are pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars. That means the kind of opportunities for female athletes that never existed before.
Opening up what has long been known as "the gentleman's game" sends a powerful psychological message to hundreds of millions of women and girls in what will soon be the world's most populous country. Gender roles remain rigid in India, where only about 20 percent of women are employed in the formal work force, one of the lowest rates globally. If the country is to meet its full economic potential, it must chip away at that gender divide.
In the case of cricket, at least, some of India's most famous industrialists -- the Ambanis, the Adanis and others -- are invested in ensuring that women thrive. The five teams created for the inaugural season, which took place last month, were sold by the league for $ 570 million in total, or an average of about $ 110 million per franchise. Overnight, the league became the world's second-most-valuable women's sports association, after the W.N.B.A.
The splashy debut got an enthusiastic reception among fans, even if it paled in comparison to the ferocious following for the men. Some of the matches drew as many as 35,000 people. Fifty million viewers in India tuned in during the league's first week. Social media was filled with chatter and memes about the players.
"Everyone is a stakeholder now in making it successful," said Nikhil Bardia, an executive at RISE Worldwide, a sports and entertainment agency, "in empowering the women ecosystem to have a lot more heroes."
Inspiration
When the girls and their families in the village of Dharoki in Punjab turn on the TV these days, when they open Instagram or spread out a newspaper, they see it: roaring female cricket players, displaying the kind of joy and swagger long confined to men.
A majority of the players who have made it -- running and diving on India's cricket fields one day, appearing in ads for luxury cars, jewelry and sunscreen the next -- come from villages and small towns. The girls in Punjab know this well because one of the most famous of them, Harmanpreet Kaur, is a local legend from their home state.
Last month, as the women's league kicked off in Mumbai, Ms. Kaur, 34, walked out to fireworks in the buzzing stadium, flanked by the captains of the other four teams. For years, she has been the captain of India's national team.
She embodies this moment's transformative potential for women's sports.
Ms. Kaur has risen to the heights of cricket only because a coach identified her talent in high school and let her practice with the boys -- there were no girls' teams in her area. Eventually, she said in an interview, he built a girls' team around her.
Even after she had become a fixture on the women's national team, she had to keep looking for side jobs. She found part-time work far away from home, at Indian Railways in Mumbai. The contrast was deflating: representing India on the global stage, then returning to a junior clerk job, carrying documents between offices at a crowded train station.
Her routine was grueling, with hours of practice before and after work, and hours on the train rushing from place to place.
"Many of my friends, they left cricket," Ms. Kaur said. "At some point, they had to chose one -- cricket or office life."
Women's cricket suffered from indifference until 2006, when India's cash-rich governing board for the sport finally took it under its wing. But only recently, after a string of successful performances by the national women's team on the international stage, did the board invest in earnest in layers of district and state competition for female players.
Cricket experts say that the turning point was the World Cup in 2017 in England, when India lost a heartbreaking final but Ms. Kaur had a star turn. Her performance was so dominating and drew such wide attention on television and social media that one cricket commentator declared: "Harmanpreet smacked women's cricket into lounge rooms."
In recent years, contracts from the board that oversees Indian cricket, and efforts to reach pay parity between men and women, have brought some financial security for national team players. Now, with the advent of the women's professional league, India will need to develop a female talent pool up and down the country.
"The young girls who haven't gotten enough chances -- for them this is a great platform," Ms. Kaur said before the league's opener.
That match, which included colorful song and dance performances, drew a crowd of about 20,000 people. One of the spectators was Ishita Dave, who works in Mumbai's film industry.
Ms. Dave noticed that the stadium announcer did not call out Ms. Kaur's name as she walked out to bat -- none of the hype-building that routinely introduces a male player of her stature. But as Ms. Kaur belted the ball around the stadium, Ms. Dave and two of her friends stood up to start a chant: HAR-MAN-PREET! HAR-MAN-PREET!
Initially, their enthusiasm drew quizzical looks from the largely male crowd. But by the end of the match, even the announcer was joining in: HAR-MAN-PREET! HAR-MAN-PREET!
"It will eventually catch up -- it will have to," Ms. Dave said about the rise of the women's game. "Lots of us will make sure that it does."
As Ms. Kaur led her team to victory after victory in Mumbai, as she received accolade after accolade and check after check, the girls in the village of Dharoki were watching.
They included two sisters, Naina and Sunaina, ages 13 and 12, both members of the cricket team.
Both of their parents are sweepers -- their father works as a sweeper at the private school in the village, and their mother sweeps the houses of five different families. The family share a one-bedroom on a second floor, which they reach by climbing a rickety ladder. Downstairs, there is storage only for the girls' bicycles, which they use to get to school and to practice. When it rains, a corner of their room drips.
When Women's Premier League games were on television, the sisters would return from their own cricket practice, change into comfortable clothes and bundle up with their father on the bed to catch the action on their small Samsung television, as their mother prepared dinner on the stove on the balcony.
Naina and Sunaina can list the best players, which teams they play for. And, as easily: the handsome sum -- exceeding $ 400,000 at the very top -- that each is paid for not even a month's play.
Promise
The girls' cricket team in Dharoki started with a vow that its manager, Mr. Shergill, made from the roof of a house long run by women.
His mother and two sisters farmed their land and raised him after his father died of a heart attack when Mr. Shergill was 6. When he finished his studies, he helped sell his family's farm produce in other states while trying his luck repeatedly at the police entrance exam.
On one of his trips to the state of Gujarat, he saw a cricket training facility in a village -- the sport is mostly played in ad hoc spaces in India -- and thought: If they can do it, why can't we? If he got the police job, he pledged, he would spend a good chunk of his salary on building a team.
It began with tossing balls at his own daughter, Harsimrat, his only child, on their rooftop when she was 6. When the Covid lockdown shut schools, the number of girls on the rooftop increased. So did the number of balls landing in the neighbor's house.
Mr. Shergill at first erected nets around the roof. Then he carved out a corner of the family's wheat fields and dedicated himself to managing the team three years ago.
"We don't know what got under him," his sister, Jasvir, said with a smile.
The household expenses are largely covered by his wife's earnings as a government clerk, supplemented by the farm's income. Much of Mr. Shergill's monthly salary of about $ 600 goes to jerseys and equipment, food and fuel. He pays a part-time coach to do the technical training.
He is sensitive to the fact that his players come from diverse financial backgrounds. He provides the same shoes for all. The batting equipment is shared. Everyone's tiffin has the same food on travel days. The last thing a child needs is a taunt: that her shoes were donated while others came with shoes bought by their parents.
Beyond the daily practice, Mr. Shergill is obsessive about finding exposure opportunities for his players -- and every time, he makes clear that cricket is just a vehicle.
He has managed to get passports for all of his players -- he keeps them, with copies of their school certificates and citizenship IDs, safe at home. For more than a dozen of them, he can recall their birthdays off the top of his head.
Last September, the team traveled to Mohali, about 50 miles from the village, to watch the Indian men's national team play Australia. Mr. Shergill's sister and wife baked 60 rotis, two for each girl and a few for the adults, and cooked some vegetables, packing all the food and water into one bag. They and his mother chaperoned the girls.
The team arrived early at the stadium. "Everyone sees the match," Mr. Shergill said. "We were there to see them practice."
After the match, when the V.I.P.'s had gone home, Mr. Shergill took the girls on a tour of their section of the stands. As the girls enjoyed the comfort of chairs marked with the names of dignitaries, Mr. Shergill made a video of them.
"This child -- she is sitting in the chief minister of Punjab's seat!" he says in the video as he moves the camera down the line, the pride and joy clear in his voice. "Karandeep Kaur -- in the chair of Honorable Justice Ravi Shanker Jha! Naina, in the chair of Harbhajan Singh, member of Parliament!"
This is what it looks like to chip away at India's rigid gender divide. The girls walk and talk with the kind of confidence and ease that come with familiarity with things beyond one's immediate life, with travel and exposure. They have seen the cities, they have eaten in restaurants, they have sat in the front rows of stadiums with cameras pointed their way.
Back home, their daily routine -- two dozen girls challenging themselves out in the open, enjoying themselves -- has become just another part of village life. Their presence feels as rooted as the peepal tree that shades the bench where Grandma Kaur sits to watch the drills as she snaps green beans for dinner.
But it is also building toward something bigger, something beyond the village.
One morning in late March, Mr. Shergill and his team arrived at the cricket ground in the city of Patiala, where recruiters were shortlisting players for the district's under-15 squad. Selection to this team is the only way the girls get a significant opportunity to play in competitive matches and put themselves on the sport's official radar.
Three women, all former state-level players, kept a watchful eye and made notes. As the girls went through their drills -- taking their turn batting, running in to show their bowling skills -- Mr. Shergill sat in the shade of a tree and filled out their paperwork.
At the end of the session, the recruiters told Mr. Shergill that five of his players would most likely make the team. (Days later, over the phone, they told him that seven had been selected.)
After the trial, the team walked to a nearby restaurant. Sitting around a long table, the girls pulled out their tiffins and water bottles and had their lunch. Then, a small cake arrived: It was 12-year-old Jasmin's birthday. The girls sang together and fed each other cake. Then, in their white uniforms, they filed out of the restaurant to catch the bus back to the village.

DHAROKI, India — The girls arrive at the makeshift cricket ground on their bicycles, a narrow file of white athletic uniforms breezing down a dirt track that cuts through lush wheat fields in India’s Punjab region. They wear their names and numbers on their backs, their hair tied in long, neat braids. The youngest is 9, the oldest 14.
It’s time for practice: a 2-mile run, a couple hours of batting, bowling and catching drills, and lots of giggles. Overseeing it all is Gulab Singh Shergill, a police officer by day, their manager, mentor and champion by evening. The girls, including his own daughter, all refer to him as “veera ,” meaning elder brother in Punjabi.
But there would be no team, no dream, without the women. When someone is struck by a ball — made of hard cork and leather — Shergill’s mother, Harjeet Kaur, is there to offer comfort until the sobbing stops and the girl runs back to the pitch. Shergill’s wife, Kamaldeep Kaur, helps coordinate with the 20-odd families through the team’s WhatsApp group. His sister, Jasvir Kaur, acts as a physical therapist of sorts: tummy rubs and deep breaths for the 9-year-old who arrived for practice after overindulging at a wedding function, facedown stretches for the girl struggling with leg cramps.
For the girls, the daily routine is an escape from the boredom of village life. After each practice, they lie in a circle, their backs to the grass, their faces to the sky’s fading light. They close their eyes for two minutes of silent reflection.
It’s about a lot more than cricket.
“What is the village life? You wake up at 5 a.m., bake bread and prepare food and tea — all the housework is for the girls,” Shergill tells them. “If you don’t become a player, you will be waking up early all your life until you are old.

General Motors Profits Fall as Costs Rise for Consumers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company also announced a new U.S. battery factory and said it would stop production of its top-selling electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt.
General Motors on Tuesday reported an 18.5 percent drop in profits in the first quarter, mainly because of the cost of job cuts and slowing new-vehicle sales in China. The company also announced that it would build a fourth battery factory in the United States while retiring the electric car that accounts for most of its sales in that category.
The decline in profit comes as higher interest rates has raised the cost of new vehicles for consumers and worries persist about a possible recession in the United States.
G.M. said its net income in the first three months of the year fell to $ 2.4 billion, from $ 2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue in the first quarter rose 11 percent, to $ 40 billion.
"The first quarter came in ahead of our own expectations, primarily as a function of pricing and a consistent incentive plan, as well as demand remains strong for our vehicles," G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said in a conference call.
Globally, G.M. sold 1.4 million vehicles in the first quarter, down 3 percent from last year. Its U.S. sales rose 18 percent, but its sales in China fell 25 percent.
One reason the company's sales fell so much in China is that consumers increasingly prefer electric cars. That has created a big opening for Chinese manufacturers and hurt Western automakers that have been slow to roll out electric vehicles.
In the United States, G.M. has started making a new generation of electric vehicles using modular battery packs produced at a new factory in Ohio. The Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport utility vehicle, and the GMC Hummer are in production, although G.M. sold fewer than 1,000 of those models in the United States in the first three months of the year.
G.M.'s top-selling E.V. is the Chevrolet Bolt compact, which accounted for almost all of the more than 20,000 E.V.s that the company sold in the United States in the first quarter. The Bolt has been on the market since 2017 and uses an older battery design. G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said on Tuesday that the company would stop making the model at the end of this year.
In 2021, G.M. recalled all the Bolts made to that point to replace their battery packs after it found that a manufacturing defect had caused fires in a small number of them. After halting production to address the problem, the company resumed Bolt sales in 2022.
G.M. said Tuesday that it would build a battery plant with a South Korean partner, Samsung SDI. The two companies will jointly invest $ 3 billion in the factory, but G.M. did not disclose a location. G.M. is working with another South Korean company, LG Energy Solution, at the Ohio battery plant, and on two others that are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
Later this year, G.M. plans to introduce three models that will use its new battery packs. An electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup is expected to arrive around the middle of the year, followed by the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox S.U.V.
G.M. is hoping for a surge in sales of electric vehicles this year on the back of those new models. Mr. Jacobson said the automaker expected E.V. production in the first half of the year to top 50,000, and about double that in the second half.
"We feel good about the demand being robust for the electric vehicles we are producing," he said.
The automaker's first-quarter earnings were lowered by $ 900 million, which G.M. had set aside to cover the cost of severance and other measures resulting from its elimination of 5,000 salaried jobs. In total, G.M. is trying to cut about $ 2 billion a year in costs.
The effect of those cost-cutting efforts, Mr. Jacobson said, is "flowing to the bottom line quicker than we anticipated."
Because of the job-cut expenses, G.M. lowered its net income outlook for 2023 slightly. The company said it now expected net income for next year to be $ 8.4 billion to $ 9.9 billion. In January, it forecast a range of $ 8.7 billion to $ 10.1 billion.
The auto industry's trajectory remains uncertain. In the United States, sales of new vehicles rose about 7 percent in the first quarter, to 3.6 million vehicles. But the pace of sales slowed noticeably by March. Much of the increase had stemmed from purchases by rental-car companies and other commercial fleets, rather than individuals.
Rising interest rates and near-record prices have made it hard for many Americans to afford new cars and trucks. In March, car buyers paid an average of $ 48,008 for new vehicles, an increase of nearly $ 1,800 from last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, a market researcher. The average monthly payment on new cars last month was $ 784, up from $ 683 a year earlier.
While G.M.'s U.S. sales rose in the first quarter, signs of softening consumer demand in the broader market have started to appear. Last week, AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the United States, said its new-vehicles sales fell 2 percent in the first quarter.
"There is a lot of mixed economic signals in the market, and within auto retail, which do warrant, I think, a more cautionary approach than the past few years," AutoNation's chief executive, Mike Manley, said in a conference call.
G.M.'s stock was down 4 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.

Apple Opens Its First Store Within India: [Correction]

Full text: Tim Cook, the chief executive of the iPhone maker, visited Mumbai to inaugurate the store. Apple is pushing to expand its market share in India, as well as shift some production there.
Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company's first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world's most populous country.
Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall.
The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years -- marked this week, in fact -- Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.
And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren't helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself -- and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.
"I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly -- who does that?" Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. "I don't see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future."
India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India's, has two.
But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India's.
In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company's market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $ 365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.
The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.
But Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald's, for example, Apple's signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.
Price hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $ 304, per month -- well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.
"It's simple: For me, it's a status symbol," said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. "The message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class," he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.
Mr. Sharma's partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is "not worth it," she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. "It's uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse." She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)
Apple's formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone -- but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.
"Most people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone," Mr. Dua said. "So sharing media and files becomes difficult."
The relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India's consumers than with the country's growing role as a production hub.
Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway "since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head." They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple's products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, "with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice."
That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that "given Apple's size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions," noting that the company has catalyzed China's growth. "We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops."
Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.
During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city's "incredible energy, creativity, and passion."
His fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead.

Electric Vehicle Price Wars Break Out: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The intense competition among the country's huge number of start-up carmakers has unsettled what had been a pillar of the economy in the last few years.
A cutthroat price war has erupted in the world's largest automobile market.
Within a week in March, Volkswagen's Chinese joint venture slashed prices on its ID.3 electric cars by 18 percent. Changan Automobile, one of China's state-owned car manufacturers, offered $ 3,000 cash rebates, free charging credits and other incentives for its electric vehicles. BYD, the country's biggest E.V. maker, unveiled a second round of markdowns in a month for some of its older models.
Amid slumping auto sales, car brands are going to extremes to stay competitive, offering dealership giveaways and deep discounts. Over 40 carmakers have discounted electric and gas-powered vehicles in China this year. The discounts have amounted to several hundred dollars for cheaper models, and tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings.
"The severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I've never seen," said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights, who has worked in the automotive industry in China and the United States for 25 years.
The price competition has unsettled what was a pillar of strength in the last few years, even as strict pandemic measures shook China's economy and undermined efforts by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to instill confidence.
China's car sales fell 13 percent in the first three months of 2023. Sales of traditional automobiles plunged, while growth in electric vehicles slowed, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
China's E.V. market has grown rapidly since 2020 -- doubling in sales last year -- propped up partly by government subsidies. When that program expired in December after 13 years, the competition intensified to attract buyers in an already crowded segment of the market.
At the same time, traditional automakers are scrambling to unload inventory of older cars before tougher national emissions standards starting in July make it difficult to sell diesel- and gas-powered vehicles.
An already jittery market started to spiral in January when Tesla, the American company that makes electric vehicles in Shanghai, lowered prices in China for the second time in three months. Other manufacturers felt pressure to do the same.
This month, Wang Chuanfu, chairman and chief executive of BYD, proposed that the government extend tax exemptions, which reduce the cost of buying electric vehicles, to 2025 instead of allowing them to expire this year. And China's Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce published an article last month calling for a six-month delay in the new emissions standards.
The price cuts are not limited to China. Tesla has also lowered prices in the United States and Europe, and its competitors have followed suit. But the intensity of competition reflects the reality that China is not only the biggest market for electric vehicles but also the most competitive.
Established domestic carmakers and local start-ups, supported by Beijing's policies encouraging growth of so-called new energy vehicles, flooded the sector, enticed by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to upend the balance of power in the car industry. By one measure, there are around 300 domestic E.V. manufacturers across China.
Didi, China's leading ride-hailing service, has developed an electric car with BYD exclusively for its drivers. Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones, has said it plans to debut an electric car next year. Even Evergrande, the beleaguered property developer, was building electric vehicles, although those plans may be in jeopardy because of its debt woes.
China is the leading market for electric cars, and more were sold there last year than in the rest of the world. Foreign automakers see an urgent need to gain a foothold in China to develop the know-how and manufacturing scale necessary to compete globally.
Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said the price war "will definitely continue" because of the importance of producing E.V.s in large quantities.
"In the end, companies with small sales, or poor technology will be easily eliminated," Mr. Cui said.
Car companies and dealerships are now pulling out all the stops for customers. Some dealers are offering free vacations or bottles of perfume in exchange for test drives, while some eager sales teams are stalking charging stations in hopes of luring drivers away from the competition.
Last month, a promotional poster from a Toyota dealer in the southern city of Shenzhen generated buzz online. It advertised a free gas-powered sedan with the purchase of a bZ4X, the company's electric sport utility vehicle. A woman who answered the phone at the dealership said there was currently no such deal.
Kevin Yang, 29, said he visited a Volkswagen dealer in Chengdu last month to look at its electric vehicles. He was struck by a sense of desperation among the salespeople.
The salesman stayed well past the end of his workday to plead with him to take a test drive. After Mr. Yang agreed to take the car for a spin, he started receiving daily phone calls from the salesman with offers of lower prices if he was willing to return to the dealership.
"The rat race is really intense now," Mr. Yang said.
There are similarities between the frothy E.V. market in China and the early days of the smartphone boom, when a new technology product attracted scores of upstarts to jostle with established foreign brands.
In 2015, there were more than 100 Chinese smartphone manufacturers -- a number that has been whittled down significantly to four main domestic brands and Apple. Many non-Chinese brands, such as Samsung Electronics, once a mobile phone leader in China, barely register.
Zhu Jiangming, chairman and chief executive of the Chinese E.V. maker Leapmotor, said he saw another similarity. He expects electric car prices to come down faster than traditional cars because, like smartphone makers, E.V. manufacturers will benefit as the prices of components fall and features are improved.
It is possible, Mr. Zhu said, that an average to high-end electric vehicle in China could sell for around $ 7,000 in 10 years. The average price for an electric car in China is already significantly lower than in the rest of the world, around $ 35,000 compared with $ 60,000 in Europe and $ 70,000 in the United States.
William Li, chief executive of Nio, one of the top Chinese electric vehicle companies, said he planned to keep Nio out of the price war, which he called "unhealthy and unsustainable." For traditional gas-powered automakers, "cutting prices is their last resort in trying to secure market share," he said in a statement.
Some executives fear that consumers will become accustomed to waiting for price reductions. The China Automobile Dealers Association said last month that foot traffic to dealerships had soared after markdowns, but that orders had decreased.
Leapmotor and Li Auto sought to assure potential buyers with a guarantee offering to make up the difference if the company lowered prices or offered cash rebates in the next 90 days.
Mr. Yang, the car shopper in Chengdu, said he expected prices to go even lower.
"I heard that there will be more discounts soon," he said. "I'm going to wait a bit."

Google's Fight To Stay Ahead Of Bing's A.I.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant is sprinting to protect its core business with a flurry of projects, including updates to its search engine and plans for an all-new one.
Google's employees were shocked when they learned in March that the South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung was considering replacing Google with Microsoft's Bing as the default search engine on its devices.
For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.
Google's reaction to the Samsung threat was "panic," according to internal messages reviewed by The New York Times. An estimated $ 3 billion in annual revenue was at stake with the Samsung contract. An additional $ 20 billion is tied to a similar Apple contract that will be up for renewal this year.
A.I. competitors like the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google's search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with A.I. features, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.
The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions. The new search engine would offer users a far more personalized experience than the company's current service, attempting to anticipate users' needs.
Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement that "not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we've said before, we're excited about bringing new A.I.-powered features to search, and will share more details soon."
Billions of people use Google's search engine every day for everything from finding restaurants and directions to understanding a medical diagnosis, and that simple white page with the company logo and an empty bar in the middle is one of the most widely used web pages in the world. Changes to it would have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people, and until recently it was hard to imagine anything challenging it.
Google has been worried about A.I.-powered competitors since OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that is working with Microsoft, demonstrated a chatbot called ChatGPT in November. About two weeks later, Google created a task force in its search division to start building A.I. products, said two people with knowledge of the efforts, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
Modernizing its search engine has become an obsession at Google, and the planned changes could put new A.I. technology in phones and homes all over the world.
The Samsung threat represented the first potential crack in Google's seemingly impregnable search business, which was worth $ 162 billion last year. Although it was not clear whether Microsoft's work with A.I. was the main reason Samsung was considering a change after the last 12 years, that was the assumption inside Google. The contract is under negotiation, and Samsung could stick with Google.
But the idea that Samsung, which makes hundreds of millions of smartphones with Google's Android software every year, would even consider switching search engines shocked Google's employees.
After some workers were told that the company was looking for volunteers this month to help put together material for a pitch to Samsung, they reacted with emojis and surprise. "Wow, OK, that's wild," one person responded.
A Google spokesperson said that the company was continuously improving its search engine to give users and partners more reason to choose Google, and that Android phone makers were free to embrace technologies from different companies to improve their users' experience.
Samsung and Microsoft declined to comment.
Google has been doing A.I. research for years. Its DeepMind lab in London is considered one of the best A.I. research centers in the world, and the company has been a pioneer with A.I. projects, such as self-driving cars and the so-called large language models that are used in the development of chatbots. In recent years, Google has used large language models to improve the quality of its search results, but held off on fully adopting A.I. because it has been prone to generating false and biased statements.
Now the priority is winning control of the industry's next big thing. Last month, Google released its own chatbot, Bard, but the technology received mixed reviews.
Plans for the new search engine, which demonstrate Google's ambitions to reimagine the search experience, are still in the early stages, with no clear timetable on when it will release the new search technology.
The system would learn what users want to know based on what they're searching when they begin using it. And it would offer lists of preselected options for objects to buy, information to research and other information. It would also be more conversational -- a bit like chatting with a helpful person.
But long before the search engine can be rebuilt, the Magi project will add features to the existing search engine, according to internal documents. Google has more than 160 people working full time on it, a person with knowledge of the work said.
Magi would keep ads in the mix of search results. Search queries that could lead to a financial transaction, such as buying shoes or booking a flight, for example, would still feature ads on their results pages.
That's important for Google, since search ads are the primary way it makes money. Its chatbot, Bard, does not feature ads, and there has been anticipation in the tech industry that A.I. answers on search engines could make ads less relevant to users.
The planned search additions could also answer questions about software coding and write code based on a user's request. Google may place an ad under the computer code answers, according to a document.
Last week, Google invited some employees to test Magi's features, and it has encouraged them to ask the search engine follow-up questions to judge its ability to hold a conversation. Google is expected to release the tools to the public next month and add more features in the fall, according to the planning document.
The company plans to initially release the features to a maximum of one million people. That number should progressively increase to 30 million by the end of the year. The features will be available exclusively in the United States.
Google has also explored efforts to let people use Google Earth's mapping technology with help from A.I. and search for music through a conversation with a chatbot, a Google director wrote in a document.
Other product ideas are in various stages of development. A tool called GIFI would use A.I. to generate images in Google Image results. Another tool, Tivoli Tutor, would teach users a new language through open-ended A.I. text conversations.
Yet another product, Searchalong, would let users ask a chatbot questions while surfing the web through Google's Chrome browser. People might ask the chatbot for activities near an Airbnb rental, for example, and the A.I. would scan the page and the rest of the internet for a response.
Jim Lecinski, a former Google vice president of sales and service, said the company had been goaded into action and now had to convince users that it was as "powerful, competent and contemporary" as its competitors.
"If we are the leading search engine and this is a new attribute, a new feature, a new characteristic of search engines, we want to make sure that we're in this race as well," Mr. Lecinski, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University, said in an interview.

SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s employees were shocked when they learned in March that South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung was considering replacing Google with Microsoft’s Bing as the default search engine on its devices.
For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.
Google’s reaction to the Samsung threat was “panic,” according to internal messages reviewed by The New York Times. An estimated $3 billion in annual revenue was at stake with the Samsung contract. An additional $20 billion is tied to a similar Apple contract that will be up for renewal this year.
AI competitors such as the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google’s search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with AI features, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions. The new search engine would offer users a far more personalized experience than the company’s current service, attempting to anticipate users’ needs.
Lara Levin, a Google spokesperson, said in a statement that “not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to search, and will share more details soon.”
Billions of people use Google’s search engine every day for everything from finding restaurants and directions to understanding a medical diagnosis, and that simple white page with the company logo and an empty bar in the middle is one of the most widely used webpages in the world. Changes to it would have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people, and until recently, it was hard to imagine anything challenging it.
Google has been worried about AI-powered competitors since OpenAI, a San Francisco startup that is working with Microsoft, demonstrated a chatbot called ChatGPT in November. About two weeks later, Google created a task force in its search division to start building AI products, said two people with knowledge of the efforts, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
Modernizing its search engine has become an obsession at Google, and the planned changes could put new AI technology in phones and homes all over the world.
The Samsung threat represented the first potential crack in Google’s seemingly impregnable search business, which was worth $162 billion last year. Although it was not clear whether Microsoft’s work with AI was the main reason Samsung was considering a change after the past 12 years, that was the assumption inside Google. The contract is under negotiation, and Samsung could stick with Google.
But the idea that Samsung, which makes hundreds of millions of smartphones with Google’s Android software every year, would even consider switching search engines shocked Google’s employees.
After some workers were told that the company was looking for volunteers this month to help put together material for a pitch to Samsung, they reacted with emoji and surprise. “Wow, OK, that’s wild,” one person responded.
A Google spokesperson said that the company was continuously improving its search engine to give users and partners more reason to choose Google and that Android phone makers were free to embrace technologies from different companies to improve their users’ experience.
Samsung and Microsoft declined to comment.
Google has been doing AI research for years. Its DeepMind lab in London is considered one of the best AI research centers in the world, and the company has been a pioneer with AI projects, such as self-driving cars and the so-called large language models that are used in the development of chatbots. In recent years, Google has used large language models to improve the quality of its search results but held off on fully adopting AI because it has been prone to generating false and biased statements.
Now, the priority is winning control of the industry’s next big thing. Last month, Google released its own chatbot, Bard, but the technology received mixed reviews.
Plans for the new search engine, which demonstrate Google’s ambitions to re-imagine the search experience, are still in the early stages, with no clear timetable on when it will release the new search technology.
The system would learn what users want to know based on what they’re searching when they begin using it. And it would offer lists of preselected options for objects to buy, information to research and other information. It would also be more conversational — a bit like chatting with a helpful person.
But long before the search engine can be rebuilt, Magi will add features to the existing search engine, according to internal documents. Google has more than 160 people working full time on it, a person with knowledge of the work said.

Full text: ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The strawberry Dole Whip sundae at Disneyland, in its first minute or so of life, looks perfect. Billowed with fresh fruit and a syrupy drizzle, veiled with tender cake crumbs, it has the dazzling color and softly drooping tip of a cartoon dessert.
By the time you pick up a spoon and find a place to sit down, this may no longer be true. But on the day I met AJ Wolfe in Disneyland, the weather was overcast and slightly chilly, and the sundae was holding just fine.
With her phone, Ms. Wolfe took a vertical shot, then a horizontal shot. A hero shot, then a group shot of all of the snacks we'd ordered from Tropical Hideaway in Adventureland. Together, we tasted every item on the table.
By then, the sundae was melting -- a super sweet, sickly pink, half-eaten wreck that had managed to make everything in a three-foot radius sticky, including my phone, my hands and my eyelashes (how?). I found myself going back for bites, but by then, I almost begrudged it.
Luckily, Ms. Wolfe had packed wet wipes. At 44, she lives in Dallas and runs Disney Food Blog, a website title with perfect search-engine optimization that employs more than 30 people. There are many Disney fan sites on the internet exploring our intense and complicated relationships to the multinational conglomerate, but few take theme-park food, and by extension the people who obsess over its pleasures, so seriously.
"Disney is a religion for people -- a drug," she said. "I know because there was a time when all my thoughts were focused on: How do I get there again?"
In 2008, just before she started the site, Ms. Wolfe was living in a little apartment on the northern tip of Staten Island, running up her credit cards with trips to Disney World in Florida. For a while, the park was the only thing that mattered -- a trap door in the back of her life as a grant writer, opening out into a perfect, if provisional happiness.
From the start, the thing Ms. Wolfe loved the most about Disney was the food. She documented every chicken tender and corn dog with her Kodak point-and-shoot camera, treated every ice cream cone in the way of a serious food blogger, shuffling around to be near a window, or rushing dishes outside before they melted to get shots in the best light, with the prettiest background. Over time, she built an archive of the food at the parks, with continuously updated notes on every bakery, restaurant and kiosk.
When Disneyland opened in Anaheim in 1955, the food offerings weren't so different from what you'd find at a local county fair -- hot dogs, fried chicken, barbecue and pancakes. That genre of food hasn't disappeared -- there's always a wait for the incomprehensibly large and glistening turkey legs -- but as Disney parks expanded across the world and matured, so did their menus.
Today, there's a discreet corporate "flavor lab" at Disney World where chefs experiment with new dishes, a series of bumper food and wine festivals, as well as sit-down restaurants serving everything from Zanzibar-inspired vegetable curry to roast duck with pistachio pâté. Reporters on the food beat for Disney Food Blog are in the parks every day to catch and document new items.
Disneyland, in Anaheim, is known as a kind of locals park -- I know plenty of Angelenos who grew up with annual passes (as well as those who consider it a red flag when people brag about annual passes on dating apps). Though I live about 45 minutes away, I had never been until I met Ms. Wolfe there for a day of snacking that began with soft, malt-scented Mickey waffles in Carnation Cafe.
"You haven't touched your ears," said our server, Dave, as he poured us more coffee, and told us that Walt Disney had hired his father as an animator in the 1950s.
About a third of visitors here are "Disney adults," or as Disney calls them "non family guests," meaning grown-ups with no children in tow -- often in for birthdays, dates, anniversaries and honeymoons. Die-hard Disney fans hold annual passes and don't need a reason to visit. They know the park and its offerings inside and out, in long-term relationships sustained throughout their lives. (Disney has tried, and failed, to prevent people from scattering the ashes of their loved ones in the park, particularly on rides like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean.)
In the slow, white tram that takes you from the parking lot to the park entrance, I thought I must look like a Disney adult, clutching my tote bag, entering Disneyland alone.
I was, in fact, a Disney kid. When I was 8, my father took a job working for Disneyland Paris, which was not in Paris at all, but in Chessy, about 20 miles east of the city. This was the early 1990s, during the renaissance years for Disney animation -- the years of "Aladdin," "The Lion King" and "Beauty and the Beast."
Before the park officially opened, my family stayed in each of the American-themed hotels for a couple of nights, eating at all of the restaurants and answering detailed questionnaires about each meal. I'd never been to the United States, and without any understanding of these foods and their origins, I ate black bean soup and tortilla chips at the Santa Fe-themed hotel, and oysters Rockefeller in a replica of the Rainbow Room in the New York-themed hotel.
I could have lived on the park's warm caramel popcorn, the smell of which was pumped into the air at several key points in the park, and which I can accurately conjure now, if I take a deep enough breath. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that my first Oreo milkshake -- from Annette's Diner in Disney Village, where most of the servers worked on roller skates -- shifted the course of my life.
I don't usually say all that, though, because it sounds absurd. And did I really enjoy the food, or did the exhaustion and frustration of the theme park put me in such an emotionally fragile place that I clung to the pleasures of a milkshake? There's no way to know what effect a few years of extremely high Disney doses had on me.
The brand's culinary reference points can be just as vivid and enduring as its characters and stories. Chad Wright and Venessa Hinojosa-Wright met in 2009 while they were working at Disney World. They were later married there, and put Disney's sweet potato pancakes on their wedding brunch menu.
Though they no longer work for the corporation, they still love going to the parks, and blog about it on their YouTube channel, Two Tickets to Adventure. At the holidays, they keep an eye out for the lightly spiced, super-soft gingerbread Mickey Mouse cookies. "They're really coveted in the Disney community," said Ms. Hinojosa-Wright, who explained that every year, some portion of the cookies end up peddled by scalpers on Facebook Marketplace.
Ms. Wolfe's food-fan site caters to families planning first-time trips with detailed instructions and tips, as well as to Disney fans who simply want to know what's changed -- if there's a new chef or menu item, a new hard-to-get, limited-edition seasonal snack -- since their last visit.
As she developed the site, Ms. Wolfe's goal was to show all readers what Disney food really looked like. She didn't make restaurant reservations under her own name, avoided photos on the internet (and for this article) and paid for her own meals.
"I'm old-school, and that's how restaurant critics do it," she said.
She ripped open cheese sticks for the camera to reveal their stodgy or stringy insides, depending on the temperature at which they were served; spooned up soups and sundaes, illuminating their textures; and broke apart cupcakes and cookies.
"These families are going to go and spend so much money," Ms. Wolfe said. "They don't need to see perfect images of the food: They need to see what they're actually going to get."
What you're actually going to get at Disneyland is, of course, impossible to predict. Crowds swell and prices go up. Characters disappear moments after you arrive to see them. Wait times for restaurants and rides unfurl indefinitely. Key rides shut down and snacks disappear. And bathrooms are never nearby when you really, really need them. You don't know when something's going to veer from the script, only that it is.
After waffles and sundaes, lumpia and char siu bao, chicken tenders and mac and cheese, blue milk and green milk, one of our last stops of the day was Oga's Cantina, in Galaxy's Edge. The "Star Wars"-themed bar also happens to be one of the few places in the park to serve alcohol, including a vodka, falernum and Curaçao-spiked juice called the Jedi Mind Trick. The drinks don't make much sense as cocktails, but still, I couldn't wait to have one in front of me, ideally with a ridiculous garnish on top.
Ms. Wolfe put us down on a wait list and we wandered around, delighted that the wait for Oga's today was just 20 minutes. But within a few seconds of getting inside, it became clear that something had gone horribly wrong.
"Protein spill," said Ms. Wolfe with authority. "Want to get out of here?"
"Protein spill" is gentle Disneyland lingo for vomit. And in a dark, windowless, crowded room like Oga's, the smell is both especially unpleasant and impossible to escape. My eyes hadn't had time to adjust to the darkness, to take in the details or design of the room. I hadn't even opened the menu. But the answer was yes, I wanted to get out of there. We all did.
Later, in the shade of an umbrella, Ms. Wolfe and I shared a paper basket of corn dogs. They were warm and bulging, crisp-edged but yielding, with juicy sausages inside. They were almost sweet, and the batter hadn't sponged up too much oil from the fryer. They were, as the sign advertised, "hand-dipped."
I'd tasted so many snacks by then, I was almost nonfunctioning as a critic, unable to process. The corn dog was fine, but in the chaos of the park during the surge of spring break, after walking about 10,000 steps (Ms. Wolfe was keeping track for us), the corn dog was also more than fine.
It was no Oreo milkshake, but it was consolation, fortification and even joy. For a minute or two, the corn dog at Disneyland was everything.

The brand’s culinary reference points can be just as vivid and enduring as its characters and stories. Chad Wright and Venessa Hinojosa-Wright met in 2009 while they were working at Disney World. They were later married there, and put Disney’s sweet potato pancakes on their wedding brunch menu.
Although they no longer work for the corporation, they still love going to the parks, and blog about it on their YouTube channel, Two Tickets to Adventure. At the holidays, they keep an eye out for the lightly spiced, super-soft gingerbread Mickey Mouse cookies. “They’re really coveted in the Disney community,” said Hinojosa-Wright, who explained that every year, some portion of the cookies end up peddled by scalpers on Facebook Marketplace.
Wolfe’s food-fan site caters to families planning first-time trips with detailed instructions and tips, as well as to Disney fans who simply want to know what’s changed — if there’s a new chef or menu item, a new hard-to-get, limited-edition seasonal snack — since their last visit.
As she developed the site, Wolfe’s goal was to show all readers what Disney food really looked like. She didn’t make restaurant reservations under her own name, avoided photos on the internet (and for this article) and paid for her own meals.
“I’m old-school, and that’s how restaurant critics do it,” she said.
She ripped open cheese sticks for the camera to reveal their stodgy or stringy insides, depending on the temperature at which they were served; spooned up soups and sundaes, illuminating their textures; and broke apart cupcakes and cookies.
“These families are going to go and spend so much money,” Wolfe said. “They don’t need to see perfect images of the food: They need to see what they’re actually going to get.”
What you’re actually going to get at Disneyland is, of course, impossible to predict. Crowds swell and prices go up. Characters disappear moments after you arrive to see them. Wait times for restaurants and rides unfurl indefinitely. Key rides shut down and snacks disappear. And bathrooms are never nearby when you really, really need them. You don’t know when something’s going to veer from the script, only that it is.
After waffles and sundaes, lumpia and char siu bao, chicken tenders and mac and cheese, blue milk and green milk, one of our last stops of the day was Oga’s Cantina, in Galaxy’s Edge. The “Star Wars”-themed bar also happens to be one of the few places in the park to serve alcohol, including a vodka, falernum and Curaçao-spiked juice called the Jedi Mind Trick. The drinks don’t make much sense as cocktails, but still, I couldn’t wait to have one in front of me, ideally with a ridiculous garnish on top.
Wolfe put us down on a waitlist and we wandered around, delighted that the wait for Oga’s today was just 20 minutes. But within a few seconds of getting inside, it became clear that something had gone horribly wrong.
“Protein spill,” Wolfe said with authority. “Want to get out of here?”
“Protein spill” is gentle Disneyland lingo for vomit. And in a dark, windowless, crowded room like Oga’s, the smell is both especially unpleasant and impossible to escape. My eyes hadn’t had time to adjust to the darkness, to take in the details or design of the room. I hadn’t even opened the menu. But the answer was yes, I wanted to get out of there. We all did.
Later, in the shade of an umbrella, Wolfe and I shared a paper basket of corn dogs. They were warm and bulging, crisp-edged but yielding, with juicy sausages inside. They were almost sweet, and the batter hadn’t sponged up too much oil from the fryer. They were, as the sign advertised, “hand-dipped.”
I had tasted so many snacks by then, I was almost nonfunctioning as a critic, unable to process. The corn dog was fine, but in the chaos of the park during the surge of spring break, after walking about 10,000 steps (Wolfe was keeping track for us), the corn dog was also more than fine.
It was no Oreo milkshake, but it was consolation, fortification and even joy. For a minute or two, the corn dog at Disneyland was everything.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The digital version of the SIM card, included on many newer phones, is set to become prevalent. It also offers affordable cellular data abroad.
As vacation season looms, now is as good a time as ever to bite the bullet and become familiar with a smartphone feature that many of us have ignored for years: the eSIM, the digital version of the SIM card that carries your phone number.
Among many benefits, eSIM technology is a boon for travelers, and pretty soon we will all be using it because the physical SIM card will be no more. Let me explain.
Last year, Apple eliminated the SIM card tray from the iPhone 14 to free up space. That means the SIM card, which acts as a key that connects your phone with cellular networks, is being phased out for Apple phones.
Where Apple leads, others typically follow, so you can expect handset makers like Samsung and Google to also go all-in on eSIM -- a digitized SIM card embedded into the phone's computer chip that you can activate with any cellular network's service plan.
"Whether we like it or not, it's coming," Roger Entner, a telecom expert and founder of the research firm Recon Analytics, said about eSIM technology.
But this move isn't really all about Apple. The Federal Communications Commission also favors eSIM technology, because it makes it easier for people to switch to a different carrier by using software instead of going to a store for a physical SIM card. And the technology has security benefits: If your phone is stolen, thieves can't remove an eSIM to hijack your phone number and commit identity theft, as they could with a physical SIM card.
Most important, the experience of using eSIM data plans for travel has greatly improved. About five years ago, eSIM data plans for international roaming were overpriced, and cell service was sometimes unreliable. But in the last year, I've tested a few eSIM services when I left the country and found them to be cost-effective and zippy.
As is always the case with new technology, there are downsides. Activating a data plan on a foreign network with an eSIM is not as straightforward as sticking a different SIM card into your phone. The process is especially challenging for those who are less familiar with technology, putting the onus on more tech savvy companions to help them make the switch.
There are also privacy concerns. Many eSIM service providers offer apps that collect your data for tracking purposes.
You can use my experience as a template for navigating the inevitable transition to eSIM. Recently, I tried eSIM data plans when traveling with several members of my family and acted as their tech sherpa through the switch.
Step 1: Pick an eSIM
The main reason to use eSIM services for travel is to save money. The big U.S. carriers, like AT&T and Verizon, offer international roaming options, including $ 10 day passes for using your phone in foreign countries. The costs quickly add up for a two-week trip with family.
In contrast, an eSIM data package that can be used for the entirety of your trip costs a few dollars. The tricky part is choosing an eSIM service provider because there are many, and most are unfamiliar brands like Airalo, GigSky and Flexiroam. (Apple provides a list of eSIM service providers on its website.)
For a recent weeklong trip to Montreal, I researched travel blogs and picked Nomad, which offered a gigabyte of data that could be used for seven days in Canada for $ 7. I had the option to activate the plan with Nomad's app or by following setup instructions on the company's website. The app had high reviews in the App Store, so I clicked the download button.
Step 2: Activate the eSIM Service
A nice thing about eSIM is that you can buy a plan and set up the service on your phone well in advance of a trip, then activate it when you arrive at your destination. After you buy a plan, the eSIM service provider sends you a list of instructions.
The Nomad app showed a list of steps. In the iPhone's settings app, I clicked on the cellular menu, clicked "Add eSIM" and typed in an activation code. As I crossed the border into Canada, I went back into the cellular settings, selected the Nomad phone line and toggled on the option for "Turn on this line."
(If you still use a physical SIM card for your domestic phone line, you need not remove it. In the phone's cellular settings, you just switch off the service for your primary line to avoid roaming charges.)
After I picked this eSIM plan, I shared the Nomad app with my wife and brother-in-law, who each followed the instructions to set it up by themselves. I didn't know how to advise my mother-in-law, who never downloads apps, how to set up the plan, so I did it for her.
Herein lies the real problem: Less tech-inclined folks are probably not going to know how to use eSIM services. When my mother-in-law went on a trip to Hong Kong alone and I wasn't nearby to set up the service for her, I told her to pay for AT&T's international roaming plan and find a store later to buy a SIM card from a Hong Kong phone carrier.
Terry Guo, a chief product officer of LotusFlare, the company that developed Nomad, agreed that the main demographic of travelers using eSIM service plans comprised younger, more tech-savvy people.
"We are doing a lot of work in the app to make this simpler," he said.
Optional (but Important) Step: Protect Your Privacy
Another downside to eSIM services is privacy-related. All the eSIM service providers I researched in Apple's App Store said in their app descriptions that they did some tracking of users across different apps and websites.
Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a company that helps businesses reduce their wireless bills, underlined the importance of safeguarding personal information from eSIM providers. He said many of these companies, known as mobile virtual network operators, had struggled to generate profit.
"One way they think they'll make money is selling your information," Mr. Toikka said. "That's why you should always opt out of any tracking. You shouldn't sell yourself for pennies on a dollar."
Mr. Guo said that the Nomad app contained Google's analytics technology to see how people were using the app, and that people who logged into the app with their Facebook accounts could also be tracked by Facebook.
A simple workaround to data collection is to avoid logging into an app with third-party sites like Facebook and Google. Apple users can also click "Ask app not to track" when opening an eSIM app for the first time.
Android users don't have the option to ask apps not to track them, so their best option is to buy the eSIM plan from the company's website and set up the service without downloading the app.
Bottom Line
Overall, the pros of eSIM outweigh the cons. Traveling with a smartphone with SIM cards wasn't relaxing because you needed to carry a pin to eject the card tray; plus you had to make sure not to lose the tiny SIM card.
When returning from a trip using eSIM services, all you have to do is go back into the phone's settings app and switch your domestic phone line back on. That simplicity and peace of mind make eSIM worth the hassle.

Chemical Bans Pose Challenge To Tech Growth: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Key industries -- including some that the White House is backing through other policies -- are lobbying to water down the first major new rules in a generation on chemicals that pose risks to humans.
WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is preparing to impose some of the first new rules in a generation to restrict or ban an array of toxic chemicals that are widely used in manufacturing, presenting the White House with tough choices between its economic agenda and public health.
Many of the substances in question are important to industries that President Biden has backed through other policies intended to bolster global competitiveness and national security, such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.
Corporations are framing the decisions about new regulations for an initial group of toxic chemicals as putting at risk the administration's drive to nurture the American economy of the future. Environmental and public health groups are stressing the need to focus on protecting workers and communities from substances known to carry health risks, such as cancer, liver and kidney damage and infertility.
A major lobbying clash is already underway. Chip makers, the burgeoning electric vehicle industry and other companies, including military contractors, are pressuring the administration to water down the new rules, saying the repercussions of a ban or new restrictions could be crippling.
"If the national security batteries do not perform as designed, then missiles don't fire, fighter jets crash, and satellites go dark," Aaron Rice, the director of environmental health and safety at EaglePicher Technologies, a Missouri-based battery manufacturer, wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency objecting to expected restrictions on two chemicals the company uses.
Boeing, Cummins, Ford, General Motors, General Electric and dozens of other companies have intervened with the E.P.A. directly or through trade associations to pre-emptively ask for exemptions.
The corporate lobbying has provoked an equally intense response from public health advocates, who argue that the chemicals in question have caused dozens of deaths or thousands of illnesses, particularly affecting Black and Latino communities near industrial zones in Texas, Louisiana and other states.
The E.P.A., the public health experts argue, can protect public health, combat climate change and promote other new technologies by pushing industry to switch to safer chemicals. The claims of disruption to economic growth, public health advocates say, are just scare tactics.
"There is nothing industry won't say to preserve their right to poison workers and consumers to make a buck," said Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has been pushing the E.P.A. to move ahead with the rules.
At issue initially are 10 chemicals that the E.P.A. has identified as among the most toxic threats. The agency has completed evaluations on nine of them, with the first three of these proposed chemical rules already undergoing review at the White House. Four others are expected by the end of the year.
The E.P.A. has hinted where it is headed with the new rules, issuing a series of so-called chemical exposure limits that detail how much workers can safely inhale without an increased risk of cancer, liver disease or other ailments -- extremely complex calculations based on decades of studies examining human and animal exposures to the toxins.
The proposed levels in many cases are many times lower than current workplace standards, which are decades old, generating predictions by chemical industry players of enormous impact on existing operations at manufacturing and processing plants.
Both sides are deluging the White House with their arguments.
The effort at the E.P.A. is being overseen by Michal Ilana Freedhoff, a chemist who spent more than two decades as a staff member in Congress working with Democrats who wanted to strengthen the government's powers to regulate toxic chemicals.
The rail accident last month in East Palestine, Ohio, which released toxic substances made with some of the same chemicals now being examined for safety, has focused additional attention on the threat, Ms. Freedhoff said. But the risks from toxic chemicals are present in areas across the United States on a daily basis, particularly for families who live close to factories that manufacture or use them.
"It is literally a matter of life and death for people all across America," Ms. Freedhoff, the head of the E.P.A.'s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters.
The pace of progress on toxic chemical regulation in the United States has been extraordinarily slow, even by the glacial standards of Washington's bureaucracy.
Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976, giving the E.P.A. the power to regulate toxic chemicals. But by 1991, key parts of the law were invalidated by a federal appeals court ruling after industry manufacturers challenged an effort to ban asbestos, a known carcinogen.
For the next 25 years, the United States effectively had no operative toxic chemical law. It was not until 2016 that Congress expanded the E.P.A.'s powers to fill the federal policy vacuum.
Given the decades of regulatory inaction, officials at the E.P.A. acknowledge that there are thousands of chemicals in the United States that have never been properly evaluated for the risk they present based on the specific ways they are used.
As a starting point, the agency identified 83 of the most toxic threats: chemicals that are "known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity." It then narrowed that list in 2016 to 10 of these chemicals as the initial focus of the regulatory process.
But more delays followed. When President Donald J. Trump took office in 2017 -- and hired several chemical industry executives to help oversee the revised law -- the E.P.A. revised the way it defined "risk evaluation," bowing to chemical industry lobbying but generating protests from longtime agency employees and lawsuits from public health advocates.
When Mr. Biden came into office two years ago, the pendulum swung back. The E.P.A. moved to define more broadly how it would consider toxic chemical hazards, calling the restrictions that the Trump administration had imposed evidence of how "political interference sometimes compromised the integrity of our science."
The E.P.A. is now evaluating not just contamination in manufacturing plants but also threats to the public at large, through contaminated air or water or at landfills.
The agency also assumes that workers do not always wear respirators or other protective equipment based on a concern that some employers do not mandate these basic safety measures, a decision that has provoked intense protests from chemical companies and industrial users. Workers are already protected, companies say, or the chemicals are used in closed-loop systems where the workers are not exposed at all -- except if there is an accident.
Ms. Freedhoff said the E.P.A. had an obligation to protect both workers and the public. She said she was still haunted by the deaths of children who drank contaminated drinking water in North Carolina and Massachusetts decades ago.
The chemical implicated in the drinking water contamination, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, can cause sudden death or kidney cancer if a person is exposed to high levels and other neurological harm even at lower exposures over a long period.
Yet the E.P.A.'s recently completed risk-evaluation studies found that as much as 250 million pounds of TCE are still produced in the United States annually to make refrigerants and remove grease from metal parts. It is also used in carpet cleaners, laundry spot removers and even hoof polish for horses.
Based on the new Biden-era risk evaluation, TCE presents an "unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment" in 52 of the 54 known ways it is used as an industrial and consumer product, the E.P.A. determined. That also includes the way in which it is disposed.
"That is locked into my whole moral compass," Ms. Freedhoff said, referring to TCE, which the E.P.A. toxic chemical program has not regulated in the more than three decades since the government first listed it as a probable carcinogen. "We have to take on TCE. That rule has to be done. It has to be protective."
The agency's risk assessments for seven other chemicals -- 1-bromopropane, carbon tetrachloride, C.I. Pigment Violet 29, cyclic aliphatic bromide cluster, methylene chloride, n-methylpyrrolidone, perchloroethylene -- reached similar conclusions of widespread "unreasonable risks," as did one completed during the Trump administration for asbestos.
The toxic chemical law requires the E.P.A. to move immediately to issue regulations to eliminate unreasonable risks by picking from a range of options such as banning the chemical, prohibiting certain types of uses and requiring special health precautions.
The E.P.A. has imposed air pollution restrictions on some of these same chemicals, but manufacturing plants often have mishaps that result in releases despite the rules. Public health advocates and some state health officials have pressed the E.P.A. to consider the cumulative impact of exposures to different chemicals in certain communities near clusters of manufacturing plants.
"All sources of exposure must be considered," said a letter sent by environmental officials from California, New York, Oregon and Washington State.
The revised law gives the E.P.A. the power to grant exemptions to chemical regulations if a ban or restriction "would significantly disrupt the national economy, national security or critical infrastructure," a process that may simply mean companies have more time to phase in a less toxic replacement.
This language has generated a flood of exemption requests, including from a coalition of companies that manufacture lithium batteries used in cellphones and electric vehicles. The batteries use n-methylpyrrolidone, or NMP, which the E.P.A. concluded increases the risk of miscarriages and male infertility.
"It is critical for E.P.A. to recognize that there is no substitute for NMP in our manufacturing processes," the battery-industry trade association wrote in a letter to the agency before requesting an exemption, arguing that it had ways to safely use the chemical. "The federal government should be taking steps to promote -- not impede -- the growth of our rechargeable battery technology in the United States."
The Semiconductor Industry Association, whose members include Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung and most of the other major global chip manufacturers, has sent letters to the E.P.A., challenging its assumption that the way the companies use NMP presents a risk to its employees.
Several other industry players pointed out to the E.P.A. that chemicals it could soon impose limits on are essential to manufacture new air conditioning refrigerants that do not deplete the ozone layer or contribute to climate change.
The American Chemistry Council, the country's largest trade association representing the $ 800 billion-a-year chemical industry, has hosted over 100 virtual and in-person meetings for members of Congress and their staff to try to persuade them to more closely oversee the E.P.A.'s actions. Those events included a reception last month on Capitol Hill for newly elected members of Congress, mostly Republicans.
"They've heard from us, they've heard from other stakeholders that work with the E.P.A.," said Ross Eisenberg, the chief lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, which spent nearly $ 20 million on lobbying last year, the most in its history.
House Republicans, following these appeals, introduced a bill last month that would require the E.P.A. to more broadly weigh "economic, societal" costs before it could reject the use of a new chemical.
Corporate executives and lobbyists have also pressed White House officials to intervene. Executives from Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance -- whose members make TCE and other chemicals -- predicted at a White House meeting in December that there would be dire economic consequences if the E.P.A. moved ahead with tougher workplace inhalation limits.
Companies have also made clear that they intend to sue to try to block the rules once they are imposed.
"Such levels, if mandated, would eliminate U.S. manufacturing of tires, paper, many plastics and many other important products," said a statement presented on behalf of a trade association and Olin Corporation, a major chemical manufacturer.
The new rules, Ms. Freedhoff conceded, would mean higher costs in some cases. But she said she was also convinced that the United States could make progress on combating climate change and expanding major industries like semiconductor manufacturing while still reducing health threats.
"We have to change the way industry does things in order to protect human beings," she said. "Right now, the human beings are assuming the cost."

The rail accident last month in East Palestine, Ohio, which released toxic substances made with some of the same chemicals now being examined for safety, has focused additional attention on the threat, Freedhoff said. But the risks from toxic chemicals are present in areas across the United States on a daily basis, particularly for families who live close to factories that manufacture or use them.
“It is literally a matter of life and death for people all across America,” Freedhoff, the head of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in an interview at the agency’s headquarters.
The pace of progress on toxic chemical regulation in the United States has been extraordinarily slow, even by the glacial standards of Washington’s bureaucracy.
Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976, giving the EPA the power to regulate toxic chemicals. But by 1991, key parts of the law were invalidated by a federal appeals court ruling after industry manufacturers challenged an effort to ban asbestos, a known carcinogen.
For the next 25 years, the United States effectively had no operative toxic chemical law. It was not until 2016 that Congress expanded the EPA’s powers to fill the federal policy vacuum.
Given the decades of regulatory inaction, officials at the EPA acknowledge that there are thousands of chemicals in the United States that have never been properly evaluated for the risk they present based on the specific ways they are used.
As a starting point, the agency identified 83 of the most toxic threats: chemicals that are “known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity.” It then narrowed that list in 2016 to 10 of these chemicals as the initial focus of the regulatory process.
But more delays followed. When President Donald Trump took office in 2017 — and hired several chemical industry executives to help oversee the revised law — the EPA revised the way it defined “risk evaluation,” bowing to chemical industry lobbying but generating protests from longtime agency employees and lawsuits from public health advocates.
When Biden came into office two years ago, the pendulum swung back. The EPA moved to define more broadly how it would consider toxic chemical hazards, calling the restrictions that the Trump administration had imposed evidence of how “political interference sometimes compromised the integrity of our science.”
The EPA is now evaluating not just contamination in manufacturing plants but also threats to the public at large, through contaminated air or water or at landfills.
The agency also assumes that workers do not always wear respirators or other protective equipment based on a concern that some employers do not mandate these basic safety measures, a decision that has provoked intense protests from chemical companies and industrial users. Workers are already protected, companies say, or the chemicals are used in closed-loop systems where the workers are not exposed at all — except if there is an accident.
Freedhoff said the EPA had an obligation to protect both workers and the public. She said she was still haunted by the deaths of children who drank contaminated drinking water in North Carolina and Massachusetts decades ago.
The chemical implicated in the drinking water contamination, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, can cause sudden death or kidney cancer if a person is exposed to high levels and other neurological harm even at lower exposures over a long period.
Yet the EPA’s recently completed risk evaluation studies found that as much as 250 million pounds of TCE are still produced in the United States annually to make refrigerants and remove grease from metal parts. It is also used in carpet cleaners, laundry spot removers and even hoof polish for horses.
Based on the new Biden-era risk evaluation, TCE presents an “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment” in 52 of the 54 known ways it is used as an industrial and consumer product, the EPA determined. That also includes the way in which it is disposed.
“That is locked into my whole moral compass,” Freedhoff said, referring to TCE, which the EPA toxic chemical program has not regulated in the more than three decades since the government first listed it as a probable carcinogen. “We have to take on TCE. That rule has to be done. It has to be protective.”
The agency’s risk assessments for seven other chemicals — 1-bromopropane, carbon tetrachloride, C.I. Pigment Violet 29, cyclic aliphatic bromide cluster, methylene chloride, n-methylpyrrolidone, perchloroethylene — reached similar conclusions of widespread “unreasonable risks,” as did one completed during the Trump administration for asbestos.
The toxic chemical law requires the EPA to move immediately to issue regulations to eliminate unreasonable risks by picking from a range of options such as banning the chemical, prohibiting certain types of uses and requiring special health precautions.
The EPA has imposed air pollution restrictions on some of these same chemicals, but manufacturing plants often have mishaps that result in releases despite the rules. Public health advocates and some state health officials have pressed the EPA to consider the cumulative impact of exposures to different chemicals in certain communities near clusters of manufacturing plants.
“All sources of exposure must be considered,” said a letter sent by environmental officials from California, New York, Oregon and Washington state.
The revised law gives the EPA the power to grant exemptions to chemical regulations if a ban or restriction “would significantly disrupt the national economy, national security or critical infrastructure,” a process that may simply mean companies have more time to phase in a less toxic replacement.
This language has generated a flood of exemption requests, including from a coalition of companies that manufactures lithium batteries used in cellphones and electric vehicles. The batteries use n-methylpyrrolidone, or NMP, which the EPA concluded increases the risk of miscarriages and male infertility.
“It is critical for E.P.A. to recognize that there is no substitute for NMP in our manufacturing processes,” the battery-industry trade association wrote in a letter to the agency before requesting an exemption, arguing that it had ways to safely use the chemical. “The federal government should be taking steps to promote — not impede — the growth of our rechargeable battery technology in the United States.”
The Semiconductor Industry Association, whose members include Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung and most of the other major global chip manufacturers, has sent letters to the EPA, challenging its assumption that the way the companies use NMP presents a risk to its employees.
Several other industry players pointed out to the EPA that chemicals it could soon impose limits on are essential to manufacture new air-conditioning refrigerants that do not deplete the ozone layer or contribute to climate change.
The American Chemistry Council, the country’s largest trade association representing the $800 billion-a-year chemical industry, has hosted more than 100 virtual and in-person meetings for members of Congress and their staff to try to persuade them to more closely oversee the EPA’s actions. Those events included a reception last month on Capitol Hill for newly elected members of Congress, mostly Republicans.
“They’ve heard from us. They’ve heard from other stakeholders that work with the EPA,” said Ross Eisenberg, the chief lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, which spent nearly $20 million on lobbying last year, the most in its history.
House Republicans, following these appeals, introduced a bill last month that would require the EPA to more broadly weigh “economic, societal” costs before it could reject the use of a new chemical.
Corporate executives and lobbyists have also pressed White House officials to intervene. Executives from Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance — whose members make TCE and other chemicals — predicted at a White House meeting in December that there would be dire economic consequences if the EPA moved ahead with tougher workplace inhalation limits.
Companies have also made clear that they intend to sue to try to block the rules once they are imposed.
“Such levels, if mandated, would eliminate U.S. manufacturing of tires, paper, many plastics and many other important products,” said a statement presented on behalf of a trade association and Olin Corp., a major chemical manufacturer.
The new rules, Freedhoff conceded, would mean higher costs in some cases. But she said she was also convinced that the United States could make progress on combating climate change and expanding major industries like semiconductor manufacturing while still reducing health threats.
“We have to change the way industry does things in order to protect human beings,” she said. “Right now, the human beings are assuming the cost.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A $ 7.8 billion factory planned by a Chinese company in eastern Hungary has become divisive even within the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who championed it.
The small-town mayor, long a loyal foot soldier for Hungary's governing party, recently committed what he described as "political suicide," throwing himself in the path of an enormous $ 7.8 billion Chinese battery factory project promoted by his dissent-intolerant prime minister, Viktor Orban.
"It is like lying in front of a steamroller," Zoltan Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, said of his decision to side with residents opposed to the project, which his Fidesz party championed. "I just hope it won't roll over me too soon."
The factory, which would be the biggest of its kind in Europe, is the fruit of a yearslong diplomatic and economic tilt by Mr. Orban away from the West toward countries like China and Russia. It promises to put Hungary at the center of a wrenching and, for some, highly profitable green transition, with electric cars leading the way.
But residents in Mikepercs, a Fidesz stronghold in eastern Hungary, are seething over the arrival on nearby farmland of bulldozers and dump trucks preparing the way for the Chinese plant. Many worry the project would create pollution, drain their water supply and bring an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers.
"Pocketknives have opened up in everyone's pocket," said Eniko Pasztor, a pensioner and opponent of the factory, using a Hungarian phrase used to express anger.
Two public hearings on the venture, held in the nearby city of Debrecen in January, descended into chaos amid fistfights and shouts of "traitor" directed at officials by residents anxious about their future health and property values.
Taman Polgar Toth, a journalist with a local news site, Debreciner, said he "had never seen anything like it -- hundreds of people yelling and fighting."
Behind the noise, however, lie two of the most consequential and closely entwined issues of the day: China and climate change. Disagreement over what to do about either has thrust tiny Mikepercs (population: 5,300) into a global ruckus.
In a push to dominate new technologies vital to the reduction of carbon emissions, China has lavished tens of billions of dollars' worth of tax breaks and other subsidies on its electric carmakers.
It is now the world's biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, led by Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., or CATL, the company behind the Hungarian project.
China's dominance of the industry has raised alarm in the United States, where a recent battery-factory project involving CATL in Virginia collapsed after Gov. Glenn Youngkin denounced it as a "front for the Chinese Communist Party." In Europe, there have been warnings about the risks of dependence on Chinese battery manufacturers.
CATL already has a $ 2 billion plant in Germany that was widely welcomed, but its plans for the larger one in Hungary has left it at odds with the nearly half of the country's population that, according to a survey this week, wants new battery plants banned.
Mr. Orban's courtship of China and its investors is part of Hungary's "Eastern Opening," a policy he announced in 2010 in an abrupt turn away from his previous role championing democracy, human rights and Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
The shift has delighted Beijing. On a visit last month to Budapest, the Hungarian capital, China's senior foreign policy official, Wang Yi, praised Hungary for its "China-friendly policy."
Many other European countries have soured on China, in part because of its support for Russia over the war in Ukraine. But Hungary -- already isolated from its NATO and European Union allies because of its equivocal stand on the war -- has doubled down.
"He is the last man standing as a friend of China in the European Union," said Tamas Matura, a foreign relations scholar at Corvinus University in Budapest.
When Hungary announced the battery plant last August, it trumpeted it as the biggest foreign investment in the country's history.
Previous Chinese megaprojects in Hungary, notably a nearly $ 3 billon high-speed railway between Budapest and Belgrade, the capital of neighboring Serbia, have been mired in delays and accusations of corruption relating to secret contracts for Mr. Orban's allies in business.
Now, the battery plant has been met with stiff opposition, first from local residents, and then from opposition politicians and civil society activists.
They were joined last week by the governor of Hungary's central bank, Gyorgy Matolcsy, a former Fidesz stalwart who accused Mr. Orban's government of stoking inflation by pursuing economic growth through large foreign investments in basic manufacturing, like battery plants. Hungary has become a manufacturing hub for German carmakers, Asian companies like Samsung, which has a battery plant near Budapest, and others foreign corporations.
The new Chinese battery factory is expected to create 9,000 jobs, but some economists say the macroeconomic gains, like years of robust growth, from such projects are offset by the inflation they help fuel. Hungary has Europe's highest annual rate of inflation, running at around 25 percent.
Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest, a prominent liberal critic of both Mr. Orban and China who has renamed several streets in the capital to give them names like "Free Hong Kong Road," said the "huge Chinese factory is a symbol of Hungary's model of capitalism" based on what he said were "low wages, low environmental standards and low protection for workers."
"In Hungary, we have socialism for the elites and capitalism for the masses," he said.
More worrying for the government is the public rift, small but highly unusual, that has opened up within the ranks of Fidesz.
Mr. Timar, the mayor of Mikepercs, won 100 percent of the vote in the last election in 2019, his fifth victory in a row for the party.
Struggling to contain discontent among its supporters, Fidesz has deployed its vast media apparatus to paint the furor over the battery plant as the work of outside agitators funded by the Hungarian-born financier George Soros, the governing party's go-to villain, and "fake" residents mobilized by the opposition.
But Fidesz's problems began last November, when a group of women in Mikepercs, angry that they had not been consulted about the Chinese project, organized a street protest, the first of many.
Ms. Pasztor, the pensioner, joined other women to form Mothers of Mikepercs, a group that wants to halt construction of the factory until residents have reliable information about what it would mean for their water supply, noise levels and pollution. Another big question they have is where the plant's workers would come from, since unemployment in the area is nearly nonexistent.
The mayor, Mr. Timar, held a town-hall meeting and invited CATL to address local concerns. The company, he said, told him it was "too busy" to send someone to answer questions.
Asked about the meeting, a spokesman for the Chinese company, Fred Zhang, said CATL "communicates regularly" with the mayor and has been "actively responding to questions and concerns from local residents."
Many of the concerns, he added, "are misinformation and misunderstanding. We intend to strengthen our communications with local communities in the future."
Ms. Pasztor said she has nothing against China but did not want neighborhood houses turned into dormitories for Chinese and other foreign workers, a widespread concern after years of anti-immigrant fear-mongering by Mr. Orban and his party's media machine.
The Fidesz mayor of Debrecen, Laszlo Papp, a strong supporter of the Chinese factory, acknowledged that many locals were upset but said this was largely because there "is a lot of fake information" about how much water the plant would use, where factory workers would come from and other issues.
He added that it was important to keep an eye on long-term economic development and not be distracted by "momentary shifts in the public mood" driven by political rivalries. "You can't run a city on the basis of mood and feelings," he said.
The Chinese factory, its supporters say, is vital for the whole country.
"The green transition is inevitable, and we want to be part of it," said Mate Litkei, director of the Climate Policy Institute in Budapest, hailing the Chinese investment as an important contribution to the shift away from fossil fuels.
Mr. Litkei said that Hungary needed to ensure there were enough batteries on hand before 2035, when a European Union ban on the sale of new gas and diesel cars will start.
Mercedes-Benz Group, which has a big factory in Hungary, welcomed CATL's plans, saying it would be the "first and biggest customer of the new plant's initial capacity."
When CATL in January opened a much smaller battery factory in Germany, it met with no opposition from local residents or German environmentalists, whose Green Party is part of the coalition government in Berlin.
In Hungary, however, politics have become so polarized and toxic, with Fidesz for years vilifying environmental activists as agents of Mr. Soros, that neither side trusts the other.
Hungarian environmentalists see electric cars as a big improvement on carbon-emitting vehicles, but point to the damage caused by the mining and processing of lithium, cobalt and other hazardous materials used to make batteries.
On top of that, said Peter Ungar, co-chairman of the Green Party of Hungary, factories like the one next to Mikepercs consume vast amounts of water and energy and cover arable land with concrete. CATL's Hungarian plant would cover an area around the size of 400 football fields.
"Batteries are not our salvation," Mr. Ungar said. "Nor is China."

Full text: If you haven't used some of your phone's preloaded programs in years, the software may surprise you with updated or hidden features.
When the iPhone landed in 2007, Apple's preinstalled apps for weather, stocks and a calculator were pretty basic. Once the more versatile third-party apps hit the scene a year later, it was easy to forget about those default offerings. Over time, though, Apple and Google have added many fresh features to those old apps, and added new offerings.
Why use an app from Big Tech? Well, you're already using software by the company, and there's less chance of malware. But don't forget to check the privacy policy on any app you download to see what personal data is being collected.
Here's a quick guide to several Apple- and Google-made apps -- and how to delete them if you still never use them.
Updates to Apple's Standbys
If you haven't opened Apple's Weather app in a few years, it has had a major overhaul after Apple bought the rival Dark Sky weather app in 2020 and integrated its technology. Apple Weather now includes precipitation alerts, hyperlocal forecasts and color radar maps. Panels displaying air quality, the ultraviolet index, humidity, wind speed and sunrise/sunset times tap open for detailed information. There's also a 10-day forecast -- tap a day to see its predicted high and low temperatures and conditions.
In Apple's Stocks app, you can still look up ticker symbols in the search box. If you've set up a custom watch list (or several), tap a ticker symbol to get a screen full of data; tap the time ranges at the top of the chart to see the performance over time, or swipe through the data below the chart to see more details.
Pressing the middle of the chart with one finger shows the value for a certain day and time, and pressing with two fingers shows the difference in value over time. Want a quick view of a stock's performance? Just press and hold its ticker symbol in your watch list.
The trusty old Calculator app -- which has long concealed a scientific calculator for more advanced mathematical functions when you use the iPhone in landscape mode -- has a few other shortcuts. Accidentally enter the wrong number? Just swipe to the left or right on the display to delete the last digit. And press your finger down to copy a calculation for pasting elsewhere.
The Android Toolbox
Android's preinstalled software differs, depending on the version of the operating system. But a Calculator app has been standard since the early days; the current edition handles basic math and scientific operations like trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions no matter which way you hold the phone, and the screen at the top stores your past calculations.
Some hardware makers like Samsung have their own versions; the Samsung Calculator includes a unit converter function for translating measurements.
You can track both weather and stocks through the Google app on most Android phones. When you open the app and tap the weather button, you can save a shortcut to the forecast on your home screen; if you don't see the option, tap the three-dot menu icon on the right and choose Add to Home Screen.
To set up and track your stock portfolio, tap the Stocks button and add ticker symbols, mutual funds and other content to your watch list. Google supplies news stories related to your list, and you can save a Google Finance shortcut to your home screen.
Finding More Free Apps
Apple and Google have created dozens of tools that make your phone even more of a digital Swiss Army knife, like the free language translation, health and maps apps. Apple tends to load these, such as its Magnifier, Voice Memos, Measure and Compass apps, on new devices. If you don't see one you're looking for, search for a free download in the App Store.
Depending on the phone, you may find certain Google-built apps already installed; the Google Play Store has a whole page of free Android apps developed by Google to browse. Many Google-developed apps have iOS counterparts and are available on the iOS App Store, like Google Earth and Socratic, a homework helper powered by artificial intelligence.
Use It, or Lose It
If you're not using an app, deleting it saves space and helps you keep your home screen organized. Apple now allows most of its own iPhone apps to be removed by pressing down on an icon until a menu with a "remove" option appears.
On an Android phone, you can delete many apps quickly by dragging each icon to the top of the screen to the Uninstall option.
And if you change your mind later, you can always download those apps again.

The CHIPS Act Is About More Than Just Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A sprawling new program for the semiconductor industry is foremost about national security, but it will try to advance other priorities as well.
The Biden administration unveiled rules Tuesday for its "Chips for America" program to build up semiconductor research and manufacturing in the United States, beginning a new rush toward federal funding in the sector.
The Commerce Department has $ 50 billion to hand out in the form of direct funding, federal loans and loan guarantees. It is one of the largest federal investments in a single industry in decades and highlights deepening concern in Washington about America's dependence on foreign chips.
Given the huge cost of building highly advanced semiconductor facilities, the funding could go fast, and competition for the money has been intense.
Here's a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, what it aims to do and how it will work.
Funding chip production and research
The largest portion of the money-- $ 39 billion -- will go to fund the construction of new and expanded manufacturing facilities. Another $ 11 billion will be distributed later this year to support research into new chip technologies.
The bulk of the manufacturing money is likely to go to a few companies that produce the world's most advanced semiconductors -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung Electronics, Micron Technology and, perhaps in the future, Intel -- to help them build U.S. facilities.
Some will go to makers of older chips that are still essential for cars, appliances and weapons, as well as suppliers of raw materials for the industry and companies that package the chips into their final products.
While some critics have questioned the wisdom of giving grants to a profitable industry, semiconductor executives argue that they have little incentive to invest in the United States, given the higher costs of workers and running a factory.
The administration does not plan to fund entire projects: Biden administration officials say they plan to offer grants of between 5 to 15 percent of a company's capital expenditures for a project, with funding not expected to exceed 35 percent of the cost. Companies can also apply for a tax credit reimbursing them for 25 percent of project construction.
Limiting foreign dependence
Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, describes the program as foremost a national security initiative.
While the United States is still a leader in designing chips, most manufacturing has been sent offshore. Today, more than 90 percent of the most technologically advanced chips, which are critical for the U.S. military and the economy, are produced in Taiwan. That has prompted concerns about the supply's vulnerability, given China's aggression toward Taiwan and the potential for a military invasion of the island.
At the same time, China has increased its market share in less advanced chips that are still critical for cars, electronics and other products. The United States manufactures 12 percent of chips, though none of the world's most advanced.
Chip shortages during the pandemic forced factories to halt work and brought home in a tangible way how vulnerable the supply chain is to disruption. Workers at Ford Motor factories in Michigan and Indiana worked a full week just three times last year because of a chips shortage, Ms. Raimondo said in a speech at Georgetown University last week. That helped create a car shortage and raise the price of cars, stoking inflation.
The Commerce Department says the program will also provide the Department of Defense and the national security community with a domestic source of the world's most advanced chips.
Building chip hubs
According to Ms. Raimondo, the goal is to build at least two U.S. manufacturing clusters to produce the most advanced types of logic chips, as well as facilities for other kinds of chips, and complex supply networks to support them.
Commerce officials have declined to speculate where these facilities might be, saying they must review applications. But chip makers have already announced billions of dollars in plans for new investments around the United States.
TSMC, which produces most of the world's leading-edge chips, has been busy expanding in Arizona, while No. 2 Samsung is growing in Texas. Micron, which makes advanced memory chips, has announced big expansion plans in New York. And Intel, a U.S. technology giant that is investing heavily to try to capture a technological edge, has broken ground on a "megasite" in Ohio.
Ms. Raimondo has said the vision is to restore the United States to a position of leadership in semiconductor technology, to the point where every major global chip company wants to have both research and manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Still, there is skepticism about how much the program can do. One 2020 study, for example, found that a $ 50 billion investment in the industry would increase U.S. market share only to 14 percent.
Protecting taxpayer funds
The stakes are high for the Biden administration to prove this foray into industrial policy can work. Critics have argued that the federal government may not be the best judge of winners and losers. If the administration gets it wrong, it could face intense criticism.
The Commerce Department said it would look closely at companies that applied for funding, to try to ensure that they were not being given more taxpayer dollars than they needed.
In a decision that may irk some companies, the department said projects receiving grants would be required to share a portion of any unanticipated profits with the federal government, to ensure that companies gave accurate financial projections and didn't exaggerate costs to get bigger awards.
The Commerce Department also said it would dole out funding over time as companies hit project milestones, and give preference to those that pledged to refrain from stock buybacks, which tend to enrich shareholders and corporate executives by increasing a company's share price.
Companies are also barred from making new, high-tech investments in China or other "countries of concern" for at least a decade, to try to ensure that taxpayer money does not go to fund new operations in China.
But analysts said it remained to be seen how difficult it would be to enforce these provisions. Company finances can be opaque, and when a company saves a dollar in the United States, it may then choose to invest it elsewhere.
Helping workers by attaching big strings
The program also includes some ambitious and unusual requirements aimed at benefiting the people who will staff semiconductor facilities.
For one, the department will require companies seeking awards of $ 150 million or more to guarantee affordable, high-quality child care for plant construction workers and operators. This could include building company child care centers near construction sites or new plants, paying local child care providers to add capacity at an affordable cost or directly subsidizing workers' care costs. Ms. Raimondo has said child care will draw more people into the work force, when many businesses are struggling in a tight labor market.
Applicants are also required to detail their engagement with labor unions, schools and work force education programs, with preference given to projects that benefit communities and workers.
Other provisions will encourage companies, universities and other parties to offer more training for workers, both in advanced sciences and in skills like welding. The department said it would give preference to projects for which state and local governments were providing incentives with "spillover" benefits for communities, like work force training, education investment or infrastructure construction.
This is part of the Biden administration's "worker-centered" approach to economic policy, which seeks to use the might of the federal government to benefit workers. But some critics say it could put the program's goal of building the most advanced semiconductor factories at risk, if it adds excessive costs to new projects.

U.S. Funding Drives Rivals In Chip Wars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Semiconductor companies, which united to get the CHIPS Act approved, have set off a lobbying frenzy as they argue for more cash than their competitors.
WASHINGTON -- In early January, a New York public relations firm sent an email warning about what it characterized as a threat to the federal government's program to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The message, received by The New York Times, accused Intel, the Silicon Valley chip titan, of angling to win subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act for new factories in Ohio and Arizona that would sit empty. Intel had said in a recent earnings call that it would build out its facilities with the expensive machinery needed to make semiconductors when demand for its chips increased.
The question, the email said, was whether officials would give funding to companies that outfitted their factories from the jump "or if they will give the majority of CHIPS funding to companies like Intel."
The firm declined to name its client. But it has done work in the past for Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's longtime rival, which has raised similar concerns about whether federal funding should go to companies that plan to build empty shells. A spokesman for AMD said it had not reviewed the email or approved the public relations firm's efforts to lobby for or against any specific company receiving funding.
"We fully support the CHIPS and Science Act and the efforts of the Biden administration to boost domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing," the spokesman said.
Rival semiconductor suppliers and their customers pulled together last year as they lobbied Congress to help shore up U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce vulnerabilities in the crucial supply chain. The push led lawmakers to approve the CHIPS Act, including $ 52 billion in subsidies to companies and research institutions as well as $ 24 billion or more in tax credits -- one of the biggest infusions into a single industry in decades.
But that unity is beginning to crack. As the Biden administration prepares to begin handing out the money, chief executives, lobbyists and lawmakers have begun jostling to make their case for funding, in public and behind closed doors.
In meetings with government officials and in a public filing, Intel has called into question how much taxpayer money should go to its competitors that have offshore headquarters, arguing that American innovations and other intellectual property could be funneled out of the country.
"Our I.P. is here, and that's not insignificant," said Allen Thompson, Intel's vice president of U.S. government relations. "We are the U.S. champion."
States, cities and universities have also gotten into the act, hoping to lure subsidies and jobs expected to be generated by manufacturing sites and new research and development.
Purveyors of chips, their suppliers and the trade associations that represent them together spent $ 59 million on lobbying last year, according to tracking from OpenSecrets, up from $ 46 million in 2021 and $ 36 million in 2020, as they tried to ensure that Congress approved their funding.
Some of those activities have now shifted to making sure companies snag the biggest portion.
"Everybody wants their piece of the pie," said Willy Shih, a management professor at Harvard Business School who follows semiconductor issues. He said it wasn't surprising that companies would be raising tough questions about competitors, which could be helpful for the Commerce Department in setting policies.
"We haven't done something of this scale in the U.S. in a long time," he said. "There is a lot at stake."
How the Biden administration distributes the funding in coming months could shape the future of an industry that is increasingly seen as a driver of both economic prosperity and national security. It may also influence how vulnerable the United States remains to foreign threats -- particularly the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where more than 90 percent of the world's advanced chips are made.
Since American researchers invented the integrated circuit in the late 1950s, the U.S. manufacturing share has dwindled to around 12 percent. Most American chip companies, including AMD, focus on designing cutting-edge products while outsourcing the costly manufacturing to overseas foundries, most of which are in Asia.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company developed the foundry concept in the 1980s and dominates that market, followed by Samsung Electronics. Intel, which both designs and makes its own chips, fell behind TSMC and Samsung in manufacturing technology but has vowed to catch up and build its own foundry business to make chips for customers.
The industry's concentration has left it particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. During the pandemic, shortages of lower-end "legacy" chips that are used in cars forced automakers to repeatedly close factories, sending prices soaring.
The CHIPS Act aims to rectify some of these shortcomings by allocating $ 39 billion in grants for new or expanded U.S. factories. The Commerce Department has indicated that about two-thirds of the money will be steered toward makers of leading-edge semiconductors, a category that includes TSMC, Samsung and Intel. All three companies have already broken ground on major expansions of their U.S. facilities.
The remaining third is expected to go toward legacy chips, which are heavily used in cars, appliances and military equipment.
Another $ 11 billion of funding is expected to go toward building a handful of chip research centers around the country. Government and academic institutions in Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Florida and Ohio have filed documents describing why they should be considered for funding. Even tiny Guam has raised its hand.
One challenge for the Commerce Department will be to distribute the money widely enough across the nation to create several thriving "ecosystems" that can bring together raw materials, research and manufacturing capacity, but not undermine the effort by spreading it too thinly. With dozens of companies, universities and other players interested in snagging a share, the funding could go fast.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters on Wednesday that the goal was to create "at least two" new clusters of manufacturing capacity for leading-edge chips, in addition to facilities producing other kinds of semiconductors. Each cluster would employ thousands of workers and support a web of businesses supplying the raw materials and services they need.
"We have very clear national security goals, which we must achieve," Ms. Raimondo said, noting that not every chip maker will get what it wants. "I suspect there will be many disappointed companies who feel that they should have a certain amount of money, and the reality is the return on our investment here is the achievement of our national security goal. Period."
The competition has intensified as the Biden administration prepares to release the ground rules for applications next week. The grants, which can range up to $ 3 billion or more per project, could start going out this spring.
Executives say huge spending by governments in South Korea, Taiwan, China and elsewhere has helped shape the chip industry globally. And the current U.S. policy push could again alter the market, by giving some companies advantages that allow them to edge out competitors.
Most chip companies, in publicly discussing the subsidies, have stressed the common goal of bolstering U.S. production. But clear differences among them have emerged. Many are outlined in the more than 200 filings that companies, organizations, universities and others submitted to the Commerce Department last March.
Beyond extolling the merits of their own manufacturing plans, some applicants made the case that rival projects deserved less funding or should face strict limits on how they operated, though few companies mentioned their competitors by name.
Intel, along with other U.S.-based firms like GlobalFoundries and SkyWater Technology, expressed concerns about foreign-owned companies, including whether their U.S. factories could continue operating in the event of a crisis in their home country.
Intel has argued that foreign investment is welcome, but that its longtime concentration of chip design, research and manufacturing in the United States meant that it should get special consideration.
But competitors argue that investing heavily in Intel could be a risky bet for the U.S. government, and some Biden administration officials have questioned whether Intel can follow through on its plans to catch up to its competitors technologically. The company has suffered from a severe drop in sales and announced on Wednesday that it would cut its stock dividend.
U.S. officials have also stressed the need to support a U.S. expansion by TSMC, in part because it produces leading-edge chips crucial to the military.
TSMC, which has broken ground on a $ 40 billion investment in two advanced factories in Arizona, countered in its filing that "preferential treatment based on the location of a company's headquarters" would not be an effective or efficient use of U.S. money. AMD, one of TSMC's largest customers, has advocated its U.S. expansion.
AMD and Intel, both based in Santa Clara, Calif., have competed fiercely for the market for microprocessor chips.
In its filing in March, AMD expressed concerns about whether certain unnamed competitors had proved that they could operate effectively as a foundry and make leading-edge chips. Intel has struggled on both counts. And AMD highlighted the risk that grant recipients would not immediately spend that money to outfit their factories with equipment.
"Any facility receiving federal assistance must be operational upon completion of construction," AMD wrote. "A facility that sits idle or is held in reserve for demand increases should immediately forfeit any federal funds."
Mr. Thompson of Intel declined to comment on the email. But he defended the "smart capital" strategy articulated by Patrick Gelsinger, Intel's chief executive, which has stressed building factory shells and then investing to equip them in accordance with market demand.
Intel is continuing to follow that strategy with construction projects in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, to ensure that its new facilities are built out "in alignment with the market," Mr. Thompson said. But Intel has no intention of using the government money for "basically just building shells," he said. "The goal is to ensure that we have the capacity to support our customers."

WASHINGTON — In early January, a New York public relations firm sent an email warning about what it characterized as a threat to the federal government’s program to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry.
The message, received by The New York Times, accused Intel, the Silicon Valley chip titan, of angling to win subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act for new factories in Ohio and Arizona that would sit empty. Intel had said in a recent earnings call that it would build out its facilities with the expensive machinery needed to make semiconductors when demand for its chips increased.
The question, the email said, was whether officials would give funding to companies that outfitted their factories from the jump “or if they will give the majority of CHIPS funding to companies like Intel.”
The firm declined to name its client. But it has done work in the past for Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s longtime rival, which has raised similar concerns about whether federal funding should go to companies that plan to build empty shells. A spokesperson for AMD said it had not reviewed the email or approved the public relations firm’s efforts to lobby for or against any specific company receiving funding.
“We fully support the CHIPS and Science Act and the efforts of the Biden administration to boost domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing,” the spokesperson said.
Rival semiconductor suppliers and their customers pulled together last year as they lobbied Congress to help shore up U.S. chip manufacturing and reduce vulnerabilities in the crucial supply chain. The push led lawmakers to approve the CHIPS Act, including $52 billion in subsidies to companies and research institutions as well as $24 billion or more in tax credits — one of the biggest infusions into a single industry in decades.
But that unity is beginning to crack. As the Biden administration prepares to begin handing out the money, CEOs, lobbyists and lawmakers have begun jostling to make their case for funding, in public and behind closed doors.
In meetings with government officials and in a public filing, Intel has called into question how much taxpayer money should go to its competitors that have offshore headquarters, arguing that U.S. innovations and other intellectual property could be funneled out of the country.
“Our IP is here, and that’s not insignificant,” said Allen Thompson, Intel’s vice president of U.S. government relations. “We are the U.S. champion.”
States, cities and universities have also gotten into the act, hoping to lure subsidies and jobs expected to be generated by manufacturing sites and new research and development.
Purveyors of chips, their suppliers and the trade associations that represent them together spent $59 million on lobbying last year, according to tracking from OpenSecrets, up from $46 million in 2021 and $36 million in 2020, as they tried to ensure that Congress approved their funding.
Some of those activities have now shifted to making sure companies snag the biggest portion.
“Everybody wants their piece of the pie,” said Willy Shih, a management professor at Harvard Business School who follows semiconductor issues. He said it wasn’t surprising that companies would be raising tough questions about competitors, which could be helpful for the Commerce Department in setting policies.
“We haven’t done something of this scale in the U.S. in a long time,” he said. “There is a lot at stake.”
How the Biden administration distributes the funding in coming months could shape the future of an industry that is increasingly seen as a driver of both economic prosperity and national security. It may also influence how vulnerable the United States remains to foreign threats — particularly, the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where more than 90% of the world’s advanced chips are made.
Since American researchers invented the integrated circuit in the late 1950s, the U.S. manufacturing share has dwindled to around 12%. Most U.S. chip companies, including AMD, focus on designing cutting-edge products while outsourcing the costly manufacturing to overseas foundries, most of which are in Asia.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. developed the foundry concept in the 1980s and dominates that market, followed by Samsung Electronics. Intel, which both designs and makes its own chips, fell behind TSMC and Samsung in manufacturing technology but has vowed to catch up and build its own foundry business to make chips for customers.
The industry’s concentration has left it particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. During the pandemic, shortages of lower-end “legacy” chips that are used in cars forced automakers to repeatedly close factories, sending prices soaring.
The CHIPS Act aims to rectify some of these shortcomings by allocating $39 billion in grants for new or expanded U.S. factories. The Commerce Department has indicated that about two-thirds of the money will be steered toward makers of leading-edge semiconductors, a category that includes TSMC, Samsung and Intel. All three companies have already broken ground on major expansions of their U.S. facilities.
The remaining third is expected to go toward legacy chips, which are heavily used in cars, appliances and military equipment.
Another $11 billion of funding is expected to go toward building a handful of chip research centers around the country. Government and academic institutions in Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Florida and Ohio have filed documents describing why they should be considered for funding. Even tiny Guam has raised its hand.
One challenge for the Commerce Department will be to distribute the money widely enough across the nation to create several thriving “ecosystems” that can bring together raw materials, research and manufacturing capacity but not undermine the effort by spreading it too thinly. With dozens of companies, universities and other players interested in snagging a share, the funding could go fast.

Do We Really Need V.R. Goggles?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Sony's new $ 550 headset offers best-in-class virtual reality gaming, but it's still hard to see why we need V.R. goggles at all.
Ah, the "metaverse." Will a fantasy where our office meetings and social gatherings take place mostly in virtual reality ever come true?
As a tech critic who has worn almost every pair of virtual-reality goggles released in the last seven years, I've been holding my breath for a long time. And based on my testing of this year's first big hardware release in the metaverse category -- Sony's PlayStation VR2, which arrives Wednesday -- I've concluded that V.R. still has a ways to go before becoming a mainstream staple for work and play.
To be clear, the PlayStation VR2, priced at $ 550, is one of the best pieces of V.R. hardware you can buy. The curvy white headset plugs into the PlayStation 5 console, which is equipped with a powerful computer to run high-resolution games more smoothly; by contrast, Meta's V.R. devices, including its $ 400 Oculus Quest 2 and $ 1,500 Quest Pro, work wirelessly and rely on slower computing chips built into the headsets.
Also unlike Meta, Sony leans into the use of V.R. goggles only for gaming -- a wise choice because, so far, games are the most popular V.R. applications and productivity apps for taking video calls through headsets haven't gained traction.
Still, none of this is enough to make V.R. more than a niche, even as more brands, including Apple, prepare to enter the industry. That's because many of the problems people have had with V.R. headsets since the get-go -- including their off-putting aesthetic and high price -- remain for the PlayStation VR2 goggles. That being the case, I can recommend them to enthusiasts, but not to those who play the occasional video game.
Here's how I felt about virtual reality and the metaverse after a week of testing the PlayStation VR2.
V.R. has yet to find a truly killer app.
Why use V.R. for making video calls, streaming movies or playing games when the existing methods already work well? This is the perennial question surrounding the metaverse. Despite making progress with the technology, the new PlayStation goggles don't offer a clear answer.
The most compelling new game I tried was Horizon Call of the Mountain, a V.R. spinoff of the best-selling PlayStation 4 title Horizon Zero Dawn, a post-apocalyptic role-playing game. In the V.R. game, you control the character from a first-person perspective and can swing your arms to run around and climb mountains; you can also move your hands to grab an arrow from a quiver and shoot it with a bow.
It's a fun game with impressive graphics that show off the hardware's muscle, but in the end, I still preferred the gameplay and deeper story of the original Horizon Zero Dawn, which I finished years ago on the PlayStation 4.
Otherwise, a majority of V.R. games accompanying the device's launch that I tested were relatively old and uninteresting. Those included Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge; Tetris Effect: Connected; and Moss, which were previously released for the older Quest 2 and first-generation PlayStation VR.
In general, the graphics and motion in the new PlayStation goggles looked clearer and smoother than Meta's V.R. products. Still, more often than not I found myself wondering why a game should be played in V.R. instead of on a television screen.
In the Star Wars game, where you take on the role of a droid mechanic, shooting a blaster at an enemy would have been just as simple using a game controller. The same could be said about Moss, where you control a white mouse in a 3-D environment. Tetris Effect: Connected involves rotating pieces known as tetrominoes, just as you would in any traditional Tetris game made in the last few decades; there was no clear benefit to playing this in an immersive environment.
Other games that will soon be available for PlayStation VR2, which I could not test, include big titles like Gran Turismo 7 and Resident Evil Village. Those are popular franchises, but both were released for traditional consoles in the last two years.
Gaming may currently be V.R.'s killer app, but if you want fresh and exciting games, the console-plus-TV combo is still king.
Headsets still look and feel weird to wear.
Since V.R. hardware started hitting the market about seven years ago, headsets have shed some weight. At 20 ounces, the PlayStation VR2 is an ounce lighter than its predecessor and five ounces lighter than the Meta Quest Pro. But all the goggles still felt too heavy. In my experience, I could wear them for no longer than 30 minutes before starting to feel neck strain.
Case in point: The PlayStation VR2 fell off my face and hit the ground when I was playing the Star Wars game and bent over to pick up a tool from the floor of a virtual space station. The wire plugged into the console also made the device feel more cumbersome than wireless headsets, and it created a tripping hazard in the living room.
And like all the goggles that came before it, the PlayStation VR2 looks pretty ridiculous. My wife couldn't resist shooting videos to mock me as I wore a headset that made me look like a character from the movie "Tron."
For storage, Sony includes a charging station to hold the motion controllers, which is convenient. But along with the headset, the product takes up precious space in a living room -- and unlike a laptop or smartphone, V.R. goggles instantly make a tidy room look cluttered. For single folks, I fear that the sight of the goggles would kill the chances of a second date.
The metaverse is lonely.
For the concept of the metaverse to succeed, we need to be able to connect with our loved ones in that space. In its current state, V.R. is still a mostly solitary experience. When you wear the PlayStation goggles, you block out your view of the real world. What you're doing in the game is shown on the TV screen that the PlayStation is plugged into. That lets others in the room follow along, but it's not very social.
Which brings up another issue: To have friends to play with in the metaverse, they must buy the same headset -- and the tech is still expensive.
When consumer technology goes mainstream, it typically becomes cheaper and more accessible. Despite being on the market for most of the last decade, virtual reality is heading in the opposite direction. At $ 550, the PlayStation VR2 costs $ 150 more than its predecessor -- and that's on top of the $ 500 you have to pay for a PlayStation 5.
Sony is not alone in the price creep. Last year, Meta raised the price of its best-selling headset, the Quest 2, to $ 400, from $ 300. Apple's headset, which may release this year, is expected to be a premium device that may cost thousands of dollars, according to reports.
So maybe one day -- when the tech is cheaper, has a truly killer app and doesn't make people look like weirdos -- we'll all hang out in the metaverse. For now, I'll continue to meet folks in person and online the old-school way.

Ah, the “metaverse.” Will a fantasy where our office meetings and social gatherings take place mostly in virtual reality ever come true?
As a tech critic who has worn almost every pair of virtual-reality goggles released in the last seven years, I’ve been holding my breath for a long time.

When you wear the PlayStation goggles, you block out your view of the real world. What you’re doing in the game is shown on the TV screen that the PlayStation is plugged into. That lets others in the room follow along, but it’s not very social.
Which brings up another issue: To have friends to play with in the metaverse, they must buy the same headset — and the tech is still expensive.
When consumer technology goes mainstream, it typically becomes cheaper and more accessible. Despite being on the market for most of the last decade, virtual reality is heading in the opposite direction. At $550, the PlayStation VR2 costs $150 more than its predecessor — and that’s on top of the $500 you have to pay for a PlayStation 5.
Sony is not alone in the price creep. Last year, Meta raised the price of its bestselling headset, the Quest 2, to $400, from $300. Apple’s headset, which may release this year, is expected to be a premium device that may cost thousands of dollars, according to reports.
So maybe one day — when the tech is cheaper, has a truly killer app and doesn’t make people look like weirdos — we’ll all hang out in the metaverse. For now, I’ll continue to meet folks in person and online the old-school way. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: You may never have to deal with a missing device, but planning ahead with a few simple steps can make it easier if disaster strikes.
The average smartphone contains so much of one's personal life -- photos, list of contacts, calendar, email, digital wallet -- that the loss of that handy slab of glass and metal can be highly disruptive and disorienting. You may never have to face this situation, but you would be wise to plan for it, especially if you have children with their own phones.
Here's a guide to what you can do before and after you lose or break your phone.
Basic Precautions
A sturdy drop-resistant case and a screen protector are starters for safeguarding your phone from physical damage. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has case recommendations for iPhones.
A lost phone can be a security risk, so make sure you have facial or fingerprint recognition enabled and a strong passcode in place to lock the screen.
Your phone's location services feature can also help you find the device if you lose it, so make sure to enable location in your Android or iOS settings if you've turned it off. Remember, you can adjust the access apps have to your location in the settings for privacy.
Keep a record of the phone's identification numbers (the serial number and International Mobile Equipment Identity number) in case you need the information later to file a police report. You can find the numbers in the settings or by dialing *#06# on the phone's keypad. Take a screenshot and send it your computer for safekeeping.
Insurance Options
Buying insurance or extended warranty coverage for your phone costs money up front, but it can bring benefits like 24/7 support, low-cost repairs and same-day replacements for unusable devices.
If you're not sure you need insurance, factor in how long you intend to keep the phone, how you use the device and if you can afford out-of-pocket repairs. In some cases, the insurance can cost more than the repair, so read the warranty or policy closely before investing in it.
You're typically prodded to sign up when you purchase a new phone. AppleCare, Google Preferred Care and Samsung Care+ are common manufacturer plans; AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are among the carriers offering coverage. Third-party insurance companies like Assurant, Asurion and Akko sell policies for smartphones, as do some general insurance providers like Progressive and USAA.
Back It Up
With your phone's Apple, Google or Samsung account, you get a certain amount of "cloud" storage -- internet-connected servers where you can back up files. Cloud backup is simple: Once enabled, the phone should automatically back up when it's plugged into power and connected to a Wi-Fi network.
If you have a lot of content on your phone, you may need to buy more space for a few dollars a month.
Set your Apple iCloud, Google or Samsung account to sync across devices, and then your email, contacts, notes and calendar will be backed up to your provider's cloud. But you may also want to preserve things like call history, text messages and other information from the phone.
Apple, Google and Samsung all have instructions on their sites for configuring cloud backup on their gear. Google's Google One service also works with other Android phones and devices.
If your camera roll is your primary concern, Google Photos, iCloud Photos and other services like Amazon Photos and Dropbox can be set to back up pictures automatically.
If you prefer to keep your files off remote servers because of privacy and security concerns, you can back up to your computer instead. Apple's iOS devices can be backed up to a Mac or PC using a USB cable or Wi-Fi connection; that backup can later be transferred to a new iPhone or iPad. Google's site has instructions for transferring Android files to a computer and Samsung's free Smart Switch app for Windows, Mac and Android can backup and transfer your Galaxy phone files.
Looking for the Phone
If you lost your phone or fear it was stolen, search for it using the Apple, Google or Samsung "find my device" pages, or with tools like Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device apps. If your phone still works, the location setting is enabled and it is connected to a network, you should see the device's whereabouts displayed on a map.
Apple's Find My app can warn you if you leave a device behind and includes a Mark as Lost setting to lock the phone with a passcode and disable Apple Pay. But if the device seems to be in an unfamiliar location, you can use these tracking tools to remotely lock or erase your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or other Android phone.
If the phone appears to be permanently missing or you know it was stolen, inform your wireless carrier and report the loss to the police; you'll probably need to supply those serial and I.M.E.I. numbers. File an insurance claim if you have a policy, change your passwords and alert your financial institutions to watch for suspicious account activity.
Deal With Damage
Accidents happen. Waterlogged hardware and cracked screens are common phone mishaps. Apple, Google and Samsung have their own guides for dealing with water damage, which can be less fatal than it used to be. (Many experts advise against dunking the wet phone in dry rice to draw out moisture.)
For the technically adventurous, the do-it-yourself site iFixit has illustrated guides to common repairs. But for many people, smashed glass or fried electronics mean a trip to a professional service center. Check with your phone manufacturer and wireless carrier for your options.
National chains like CPR or Asurion Tech Repairs & Solutions (formerly UbreakiFix) work with some insurance policies. And speaking of insurance policies, if you signed up for one, go file that claim.
Photograph The Location feature on your Android phone, left, or iPhone can help you find a lost device -- as long as you have the setting enabled. Your phone manufacturer's built-in online backup feature, right, is easy to set up and use, but you may quickly run out of storage space.

Full text: "Richard Avedon: Murals" fills just one gallery of the Met, but "fills" is an understatement. These in-your-face, wall-engulfing portraits are a milestone in image-making.
He had reached the heights of the fashion industry, photographing the most beautiful models each month for Alexander Liberman's Vogue; he was shooting Bette Davis and Barbra Streisand for mink coat advertisements, and Catherine Deneuve for the cover of Life. But it wasn't enough anymore. Not professionally, and not personally. Not after the assassination in Memphis, not after the riots in Chicago. Richard Avedon in 1968 was going through an artistic crisis. He needed a fresh start, with a new camera; he had to get out of New York; he needed to think bigger, in the most literal sense imaginable.
"Richard Avedon: Murals" fills just one gallery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but fills is an understatement. For this centennial tribute to American photography's great purifier, the Met has brought out some of the largest photographs in its collection: Avedon's wall-engulfing group portraits, made between 1969 and 1971, reaching from floor to ceiling and covering up to 35 horizontal feet. Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the other defendants known as the Chicago Seven stare and slouch. Paul Morrissey, Viva and the self-proclaimed Superstars of Andy Warhol's Factory pout and preen. The generals and ambassadors leading the American war effort in Vietnam stand flinty and frigid.
Putting aside their aesthetic force, these murals were a milestone in photographic printing. They aren't inkjet enlargements, in which a photographic positive is outputted onto a roll of paper at 300 dots per inch. These are traditional silver gelatin prints -- well, traditional in all but size -- exposed in a darkroom, and requiring stunning technical acuity to produce. (At this scale, even minuscule deformities in the negative can produce damaging gashes, lumps or other irregularities.)
Yet even in a very different, dematerialized moment for photography, Avedon's silver gelatin friezes of 1969-71 still confound. Confronted with group portraits that are quite literally larger than life -- indeed, black-and-white group portraits, in high contrast, against purged backgrounds -- you are forced to answer a question that the infinite scroll of Instagram has almost made moot: What, besides mere size, can make a picture stand out and matter?
It is a bracing thing, seeing them again. The last time Avedon's murals were on view in New York -- or three of the four, at least; the Met doesn't own the last one, of Allen Ginsberg and his family -- was in 2012, when Gagosian presented these panoramas in an expansive showcase. There, the murals appeared in custom vitrines designed by the architect David Adjaye, and could be viewed from great distances; here at the Met, no glass separates you from the colossal prints, and the gallery's bowling-alley proportions prevent you from stepping far back. The murals are in-your-face, and in each other's: Warhol's crew and the Vietnam squad face off directly, the apparatchiks staring down the nude Candy Darling with establishment indifference.
Avedon, even as he was making a name and a fortune in fashion and commercial photography, had turned his camera to American politics and society before the murals. In 1955 he made an indelible portrait of the contralto Marian Anderson, also on view here: eyes shut, lips pursed into a perfect O, her hair no longer demurely coiled like at her Lincoln Memorial concert, but streaming in the breeze. Later, in 1964, he published "Nothing Personal," a volume of portraits from an anxious America -- Adam Clayton Powell and George Wallace; Joe Louis and Marilyn Monroe -- with a text by James Baldwin, a friend from their days at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. (By decade's end Avedon would be one of the guests at Leonard Bernstein's notorious cocktail party for the Black Panthers, skewered by Tom Wolfe in New York magazine as the height of "radical chic.")
But these were days when photography's status as a visual art was still in question, and Avedon, perpetually anxious about his credibility and legitimacy, felt only a new visual grammar could meet the times head-on. As Philip Gefter relates in "What Becomes a Legend Most," his 2020 biography of Avedon, that cultural break only became possible with a technological shift. He set down his old twin-lens Rolleiflex, a lightweight and hand-held apparatus whose top-mounted viewfinder required him to look away from his models while shooting. He adopted a heavy, tripod-mounted 8x10 Deardorff camera, with a slow shutter speed and shallow depth of field, whose seeming inconveniences introduced a new rigor. (Notably, the figures in Avedon's murals often appear with their foreheads and feet sliced off at the edges, as if on the mortuary slab.) The camera was no longer a substitute for the photographer's own gaze, flitting this way and that. It was a stonyhearted eyewitness, with rules and limits of its own, that Avedon had to accept and build upon.
The murals were not commissions, and he imposed further constraints on himself. No props. No conspicuous lighting. No receding background, either; just a seamless white backdrop, a purged terrain, a No Man's Land. Most importantly -- especially today, when Facetune and other apps allow retouching and reframing with the flick of a finger -- Avedon committed to printing his photographs with the black borders of the exposure still visible. The visible negative edges, sharp against the white background as a testament to the picture's wholeness, would become an Avedon signature. He retained them in the multipanel murals, which were composed of three to five individual prints, with figures at the margins sliced and reduplicated where the prints overlapped.
It took a year and a half to make the Superstars group portrait, including the printing, and included seven sessions with the camera in Avedon's studio. Warhol appears at far right, microphone nuzzled against his leather jacket; Joe Dallesandro, the most beautiful of Warhol's film stars, stands clothed beside him, but also shows up naked in the mural's leftmost print. Darling is nude at center, along with three cisgender male stars of Warhol films, grouped like some queer parody of Rubens's Three Graces. And yet the clothing bunched at their feet was hardly a promise of authenticity, any more than the high contrast and blank backgrounds. "Stripping them away doesn't necessarily get you closer to anything," Avedon once said. Numerous outtakes on view in vitrines here, showing the Superstars in various hammier combinations, reaffirms the point: Each portrait is a joint confection of model and photographer, whose "truth" is up for constant negotiation.
Certainly that's the case with the group portrait of military and policy leaders of the Vietnam War, for which Avedon flew to Saigon on his own dime, bringing along cases of 8x10 film plates and a large white paper backdrop. Unlike at Warhol's Factory, here he knew he would have just a few minutes to shoot the officials, though he had to endure weeks of cancellations and long waiting games in the embassy lobby. When the day finally came, he placed at center Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the only figure wearing military uniform; colorless ambassadors and counselors flank him, facing front in baggy suits, expressions flat. They might be confused for the C-suite of some mid-tier corporate office, though that was the point. Here was the war in all its mundane evil, the men who reduced death to a pencil-pushing exercise.
The final, 35-foot group portrait (which was first exhibited in 1975, the same year it also appeared in this newspaper) has the starkness and two-dimensionality of a police lineup. But look at the outtakes here at the Met. Looser poses. Freer body language. A little smile on General Abrams's face as he gossips with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. Avedon was able to make this essential group portrait of American war precisely because he wasn't a war hand, and could convince these men in the shadows that his imagery was no weightier than fashion. (He later said: "The fact that I might have had a political opinion didn't cross their minds because I was a Vogue photographer.") And yet while he was waiting in Saigon, Avedon made other and less famous Vietnamese portraits, on view here: shoeshine boys and sex workers, the mission command's counterparts against the same white backdrop.
When Avedon died in 2004, two matters seemed settled. First: The 20th century's bright lines between photographic genres, which made Avedon so anxious and led critics to dismiss all his imagery as one big Vogue shoot, had dissolved into the 21st century's low-drama catholicity. Annie Leibovitz and Steven Klein could appear without incident in our museums and galleries, while fine-art photographers like Roe Ethridge and Philip-Lorca diCorcia could shoot fashion editorials without losing their art world cred. And second: With the arrival of the commercial inkjet printer (as well as cheaper large-format chromogenic printing), the medium's 21st-century future appeared to be bigger and more painterly -- one where the pictures of a Thomas Struth could have the size, as well as the importance, of oil paintings.
And what actually happened? Everything got smaller. The 8x10 Deardorff ceded its place to the 100-megapixel Samsung Galaxy; the inkjet made the photograph in the gallery indistinct from the poster in the gift shop, while the smartphone made printing itself seem almost an afterthought. If the mural-scale print could highlight Avedon's stark portraits to best advantage, the portrait today must respond to the technical demands of the OLED touch-screen: saturated colors, high-gloss makeup, surfaces as slick as glazed doughnuts. What Avedon's murals recall is not only the force photography once had at scale, but how we reduced our expectations of the medium as it shrank to shareable size.

Full text: A surge in trade by Russia's neighbors and allies hints at one reason its economy remains so resilient after sweeping sanctions.
WASHINGTON -- A strange thing happened with smartphones in Armenia last summer.
Shipments from other parts of the world into the tiny former Soviet republic began to balloon to more than 10 times the value of phone imports in previous months. At the same time, Armenia recorded an explosion in its exports of smartphones to a beleaguered ally: Russia.
The trend, which was repeated for washing machines, computer chips and other products in a handful of other Asian countries last year, provides evidence of some of the new lifelines that are keeping the Russian economy afloat. Recent data show surges in trade for some of Russia's neighbors and allies, suggesting that countries like Turkey, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are stepping in to provide Russia with many of the products that Western countries have tried to cut off as punishment for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Those sanctions -- which include restrictions on Russia's largest banks along with limits on the sale of technology that its military could use -- are blocking access to a variety of products. Reports regularly filter out of Russia about consumers frustrated by high-priced or shoddy goods, ranging from milk and household appliances to computer software and medication, said Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in an event at the think tank this month.
Even so, Russian trade appears to have largely bounced back to where it was before the invasion of Ukraine last February. Analysts estimate that Russia's imports may have already recovered to prewar levels, or will soon do so, depending on their models.
In part, that could be because many nations have found Russia hard to quit. Recent research showed that fewer than 9 percent of companies based in the European Union and Group of 7 nations had divested one of their Russian subsidiaries. And maritime tracking firms have seen a surge in activity by shipping fleets that may be helping Russia to export its energy, apparently bypassing Western restrictions on those sales.
While Western countries have not banned the shipment of consumer products like cellphones and washing machines to Russia, other sweeping penalties were expected to clamp down on its economy. They include a cap on the price that Russia can charge for its oil as well as restricted access to semiconductors and other critical technology.
Some companies, including H&M, IBM, Volkswagen and Maersk, halted operations in Russia after the invasion, citing moral and logistical reasons. But the Russian economy has proved surprisingly resilient, raising questions about the efficacy of the West's sanctions. Countries have had difficulty reducing their reliance on Russia for energy and other basic commodities, and the Russian central bank has managed to prop up the value of the ruble and keep financial markets stable.
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund said it now expected the Russian economy to grow 0.3 percent this year, a sharp improvement from its previous estimate of a 2.3 percent contraction.
The I.M.F. also said it expected Russian crude oil export volume to stay relatively strong under the current price cap, and Russian trade to continue being redirected to countries that had not imposed sanctions.
Most container ships have stopped ferrying goods like phones, washing machines and car parts into the port of St. Petersburg. Instead, such products are being carried on trucks or trains from Belarus, China and Kazakhstan. Fesco, the Russian transport operator, has added new ships and new ports of call to a route with Turkey that transports Russian industrial goods and foreign appliances and electronics between Novorossiysk and Istanbul.
Sergey Aleksashenko, former deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation, said at an event this month that 2023 would be "a difficult year" for the Russian economy, but that there would be "no catastrophe, no collapse."
Some parts of the Russian economy are struggling, he said, pointing to car factories that shut down after being unable to secure parts from Germany, France, Japan and South Korea. But military expenditures and higher energy prices helped prop it up last year.
"We may not say that Russian economy is in tatters, that it is destroyed, that Putin lacks funds to continue his war," Mr. Aleksashenko said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin. "No, it's not true."
Russia stopped publishing trade data after its invasion of Ukraine. But analysts and economists can still draw conclusions about its trade patterns by adding up the commerce that other countries report with Russia.
Matthew Klein, an economics writer and a co-author of "Trade Wars Are Class Wars," is one of the people drawing conclusions about this Russia-size hole in the global economy. According to his calculations, the value of global exports to Russia in November was just 15 percent below a monthly preinvasion average.
Global exports to Russia most likely fully recovered in December, though many countries have not yet issued their trade data for the month, he said.
"Most of that recovery has been driven overall by China and Turkey particularly," Mr. Klein said.
It's unclear how much of this trade violates sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, but the patterns are "suspicious," he said. "It would be consistent with the idea that there are ways of trying to get around some of the sanctions."
Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington nonprofit, recently issued a similar analysis, estimating that the value of Russian imports from the rest of the world had exceeded prewar levels by September.
One of the case studies in that report was the jump in Armenian smartphone sales. Andrew S. David, the senior director of research and analysis at Silverado, said the trends reflected how supply chains had shifted to continue providing Russia with goods.
Samsung and Apple, previously major suppliers of Russian cellphones, pulled out of the Russian market after the invasion. Exports of popular Chinese phone brands, like Xiaomi, Realme and Honor, also initially dipped as companies struggled to understand and cope with new restrictions on sending technology or making international payments to Russia.
But after an "adjustment period," Chinese brands started to take off in Russia, Mr. David said. Overall Chinese exports to Russia reached a record high in December, helping to offset a steep drop in trade with Europe. Apple and Samsung phones also appeared to begin to find their way back to Russia, rerouted through friendly neighboring countries.
"Armenia is certainly not the only one," Mr. David said. "There's a lot coming through central western Asia, Turkey and the former Soviet republics."
Shipments to Russia of other products, like passenger vehicles, have also rebounded. And China has increased exports of semiconductors to Russia, though Russia's total chip imports remain below prewar levels.
One major open question is how effectively the Western price cap will hold down Russia's oil revenue this year.
The cap allows Russia to sell its oil globally using Western maritime insurance and financing as long as the price does not exceed $ 60 per barrel. That limit, which is essentially an exception to Group of 7 sanctions, is designed to keep oil flowing on global markets while limiting the Russian government's revenue from it.
Some analysts have suggested that Russia is finding ways around the effort by using ships that do not rely on Western insurance or financing.
Ami Daniel, the chief executive of Windward, a maritime data company, said he had seen hundreds of instances in which people from countries like the United Arab Emirates, India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia bought vessels to try to set up what appeared to be a non-Western trading framework for Russia.
"Basically, Russia has been gearing up toward being able to trade outside of the rule of law," he said.
Mr. Daniel said his firm had also seen a sharp uptick in shipping practices that appeared to be Russian efforts to contravene Western sanctions. They include transfers of Russian oil between ships far out at sea, in international waters that are not under the jurisdiction of any country's navy, and attempts by ships to mask their activities by turning off satellite trackers that log their location or transmitting fake coordinates.
Much of this activity had been taking place in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. But after media coverage of suspicious practices in this region, the hub moved south, off the coast of West Africa, Mr. Daniel said.
"They're exploding," he said of deceptive shipping practices. "It's happening at an industrial scale."
So far, the oil price cap appears to be accomplishing its goal of reducing the price that Russia can charge while keeping global supplies flowing. But it remains to be seen whether this shadow fleet of ships is big enough to allow Russia to buy and sell oil outside the cap, said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during a January panel discussion.
"If that fleet is big enough for Russia to really operate outside the reach" of the Group of 7 countries, the cap probably "won't have the kind of leverage that policymakers wanted," Mr. Cahill said. "I think we should know within a couple of months."

Alfred T. Goodwin Is Dead at 99; Ruled in Pledge of Allegiance Case: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He ruled the pledge unconstitutional because the words "under God" violated the separation of church and state. The Supreme Court reversed the ruling.
Alfred T. Goodwin, a federal judge who caused a furor in 2002 when he wrote the majority opinion in a decision that declared the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional, finding that the phrase "one nation under God" violated the separation of church and state -- a ruling that was later reversed by the Supreme Court -- died on Dec. 27 in Bend, Ore. He was 99.
His son Karl announced the death, in a hospice. Nominated by President Richard M. Nixon, Judge Goodwin, who spent nearly all his legal career on the bench, was one of the longest-serving federal jurists in United States history. He started in 1969 as a district court judge in Oregon, and then served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine western states, for 51 years, until his death.
It was as a member of that court that he joined in a 2-to-1 decision that struck down the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. He wrote in his majority opinion that the words "under God" in the pledge were as objectionable as "we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no God"' would be.
The ruling came in a case filed by an atheist, Michael Newdow, against a school district near Sacramento where his daughter attended elementary school.
Judge Goodwin wrote that in defending the words "under God" in the pledge, the district was "conveying a message of state endorsement of religious belief." The ruling compelled public schools in the court's jurisdiction to stop requiring teachers to lead students in the pledge.
The political blowback was immediate, coming amid a wave of patriotism in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
President George W. Bush called the ruling "out of step with the traditions and history of America." Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, said, "This decision is just nuts." The Senate passed a resolution, by a vote of 99-0, reaffirming the language of the pledge.
Judge Goodwin stayed the ruling while it was under appeal to the full Ninth Circuit court. But he was unfazed by the criticism.
"I never had much confidence in the attention span of elected officials for any kind of deep thinking about important issues," he told the Law.com website. "When they pop off after what I call a bumper strip headline, they almost always give a superficial response."
Almost a year later, the full court let stand the decision, though over the vehement objections of nine of the circuit's 24 judges. In the ruling, Judge Goodwin reinforced his earlier opinion, writing that "in the context of the pledge, the statement that the United States is a nation 'under God' is a profession of a religious belief, namely a belief in monotheism."
But in June 2004, the United States Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-3, preserved "under God" in the pledge by ruling that Mr. Newdow had lacked standing to bring the case. The court did not rule on the constitutional issue.
For a long time the Ninth Circuit had a reputation for being liberal, with its rulings being reversed at a disproportionate rate by the Supreme Court. Judge Goodwin accepted as almost inevitable that his decisions on the Ninth Circuit would be overturned if they were taken up by the Supreme Court.
"Out of the nearly 4,000 cases that we disposed of last year, I think the Supreme Court took about 28 of them," he told the Oregon Historical Society in the mid-1980s. "Well, they didn't take them to affirm."
Alfred Theodore Goodwin, who was known as Ted, was born on June 29, 1923, in Bellingham, Wash., north of Seattle. His father, Alonzo, was a traveling Baptist minister who moved the family frequently. His mother, Miriam (Williams) Goodwin, was a homemaker.
His studies at the University of Oregon were interrupted by Army service in Europe and the Far East from 1943 to 1946. After receiving his bachelor's degree in journalism the next year, he worked briefly as a reporter for The Eugene Register-Guard before turning to law. He earned his law degree from the University of Oregon in 1951.
Following four years in private practice, he became a state circuit judge in Lane County, Ore. He was appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1960 by Gov. Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who, later as a United States senator, would twice recommend Judge Goodwin to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court.
One of Judge Goodwin's opinions, in a 1969 case in which a motel owner claimed ownership of the beach outside his motel, preserved public access to all dry-sand beaches in Oregon. "He had many notable opinions," said Mary Hay, a law professor at the University of Oregon, "but his most enduring legacy was this opinion."
In his decision on the beach issue, Judge Goodwin wrote, "The rule in this case, based upon custom, is salutary in confirming a public right, and at the same time it takes from no man anything which he has had a legitimate reason to regard as exclusively his."
In late 1969, when Judge Goodwin was first nominated for the federal bench, in the District of Oregon, Sen. Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, told a Senate subcommittee: "I can't put a label on Ted Goodwin. He's not a radical or a reactionary. He's objective."
He was approved as a district court judge, and, two years later, the Senate confirmed his appointment to the appellate court.
Despite the notoriety that arose from his Pledge of Allegiance opinion, Judge Goodwin had a reputation as a low-key jurist who did not crave the limelight.
"He always tried to decide things on very narrow grounds and didn't reach out to make law," Marc Zilversmit, who clerked for Judge Goodwin in the late 1980s, said by phone. "And if there was another judge on the panel who wanted to write the opinion of a case, even if Judge Goodwin was the senior judge, he'd defer and let the other judge have it."
Judge Goodwin served on the Ninth District court with Anthony M. Kennedy, a future Supreme Court justice.
One of Judge Goodwin's best-known cases was brought by Vanna White, the longtime host and letter turner on the TV game show "Wheel of Fortune." Samsung Electronics and the advertising agency David Deutsch Associates, had, without her permission, depicted Ms. White in a published ad for videocassette recorders. In the ad, a futuristic robot, posing beside a game board that looked like the "Wheel of Fortune" set, wore a wig, a gown and jewelry that resembled Ms. White's on-air look.
In his opinion in favor of Ms. White, Judge Goodwin drolly wrote: "Vanna White dresses exactly like this at times, but so do many other women. The robot is in the process of turning a block letter on a game board. Vanna White dresses like this while turning letters on a game board, but perhaps similarly-attired Scrabble-playing women do this as well."
The court panel ruled, 2-1, in 1992, that Samsung and Deutsch had "attempted to capitalize on White's fame to enhance their fortune." Ms. White eventually received a settlement of $ 412,000.
In addition to his son Karl, Judge Goodwin is survived by his wife, Mary Ellen (Handelin) Goodwin; his daughters, Sara Clement and Meg Goodwin; two other sons, Jim and Michael; his brothers, John and Sam; and his sisters, Ruth Goodwin and Miriam Chitty. His first marriage, to Marjorie Major, ended in divorce.
Judge Goodwin was the Ninth Circuit's chief judge from 1988 to 1991 and then took on senior status.
"Simply put, being a judge was in his bones," Mary H. Murguia, the current chief judge said in a statement after his death.

Full text: HBO's video-game adaptation doesn't reinvent the apocalypse genre. But it injects an undead story with new life.
You would be forgiven for suffering, at this point, from pandemic fatigue. I'm referring here not to Covid-19 but to the many plagues that have kicked off TV apocalypses in recent years. From "Station Eleven" to "12 Monkeys," "The Walking Dead" to "The Stand," "Y: The Last Man" to "The Last Man on Earth," this is the way the world ends, and ends, and ends.
HBO's high-gloss zombie thriller "The Last of Us," beginning on Sunday, offers a biological twist on its cataclysm. An ophiocordyceps fungus, akin to the real-life one that ghoulishly takes over the bodies of ants, mutates to infest humans, turning civilization into a global mushroom farm.
In the taxonomy of horror, its undead are "fast zombies," as opposed to the shambling hordes in old-time creature features. So the mayhem comes quickly in this series. The emotional connection moves more slow-and-steady, but it eventually gets there.
The series kicks off in Standard Apocalypse-Onset Mode. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a construction contractor in Texas, starts his birthday in 2003 eating breakfast with his family and ends it amid the chaos of civilization's collapse. The intense but bloated 81-minute pilot runs up a high body count, making clear that there is minimal plot armor to go around here.
Twenty years later, in 2023, we find Joel in the military-occupied ruins of Boston, a grim, grizzled survivor. Battling fungi does not make one a fun guy. With his black-marketeering partner, Tess (Anna Torv), he lands a job escorting Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a 14-year-old who is immune to zombie bites, on a risky journey that could lead to a cure.
Ellie may or may not be the savior of humanity, but she certainly rescues "The Last of Us" from apocalyptic mope. In "Game of Thrones" (in which Pascal also did time), Ramsey was memorable as Lady Lyanna Mormont, the fearsome child leader of a northern fief. Here she's all foulmouthed verve, her adolescent insolence turbocharged by the liberation of living after the end of the world. Her fighting spirit is, well, infectious.
"The Last of Us" is based on the Naughty Dog video game of the same name, from which it takes its nine-episode first-season arc and many of its strongest scenes and best lines. (Neil Druckmann, a creator of the game, co-writes the series with Craig Mazin of "Chernobyl.")
It really finds its voice, though, when it expands on the source material. The third episode, featuring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, builds out a relationship alluded to only briefly in the game. The episode advances the plot only marginally, but it throws the show's range wide open. This is an apocalypse story in which you will be allowed to feel and even laugh, a game adaptation able to grant dimensionality to its nonplayer characters.
But the story must live or (un)die on the connection between Joel and Ellie. You may know Pascal from "The Mandalorian," in which his helmeted bounty hunter shepherds a cuddly alien through the Star Wars galaxy's sleazier precincts. "The Last of Us" posits: What if Baby Yoda could swear? A prickly buddy comedy unfolds between Joel and his unruly charge, and Pascal's laconic gunslinger appeal translates well to this bleaker universe.
What matters most about zombie stories is what they say about the living. In TV's most popular example, "The Walking Dead," it was nothing much good. Over its long run, the show fell into a pessimism bordering on misanthropy, committed to the ideas that beasts and sadists would thrive in the end times, that trust is a sucker's bet and that only your own small clan can be counted on -- if even them.
"The Last of Us" is dark, don't get me wrong. But it has if not optimism, exactly, then a generosity toward its survivors. Its hardscrabble apocalypse has antagonists, but they are not generally monsters. (Except for the actual monsters.) They're terrified kid soldiers, starving people who have suffered grievous losses, desperate leaders cracking under unasked-for responsibility.
The series suffers most from threadbare world building. The surface details are fine: HBO's budget bought some magnificent ruins, accented with the baroque tendril patterns of spent cordyceps and a nightmare menagerie of zombies, from twitching, hissing "clickers" to "bloaters," fungal giants who resemble the offspring of the Hulk and a horned toad.
But the bigger forces behind Joel and Ellie's quest are disappointingly generic: The Fireflies, a standard-issue ragtag resistance group, square off against the faceless military regime of the fictional government agency called the Federal Disaster Response Agency, or FEDRA. (Perhaps the greatest leap in "The Last of Us" is imagining that a George W. Bush-era emergency-management bureaucracy was capable of creating a functional police state.)
The story is strongest when it zooms in on its central duo, who evolve into allies and something like family. Joel's paternal fondness for Ellie, it becomes clear, scares him more than any undead beastie.
That fear is the core of "The Last of Us." It's an extended horror story of single parenting. Joel's struggle is a heightened version of the everyday experience of how being responsible for a vulnerable life makes you vulnerable yourself, how it can make you do unforgivable things for them -- or to them -- in the name of protection.
Through Joel, we feel the heartbreak of this world. Through Ellie, we see its wonder. When they come across the wreckage of a jetliner, she asks if he ever flew in one, and he recalls what an uncomfortable ordeal air travel was. "Dude," she says, "you got to go up in the sky."
It shouldn't be surprising that a drama based on a video game can have heart. A great, smart game depends on personal connection. In fact, so can a great, dumb one, as Ellie finds when she delightedly comes across a Mortal Kombat arcade machine, a relic of an age when battling to the death was casual entertainment.
The game comes up more than once in "The Last of Us," a reminder of the undying, "FINISH HIM!" appeal of stylized violence, which this series is well aware of. If it's zombie spatter you want, "The Last of Us" has it by the bucketful.
If, on the other hand, you're hoping that it will upend the plague-apocalypse genre as "The Sopranos" did the mob drama or "The Wire" did the cop show -- well, not quite. But with its smidgen of hope and its rejection of nihilism, "The Last of Us" has a few key mutations that make it a variant of interest.

Professional Tools to Elevate Your Photo Skills: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Professional photographers have long used the RAW format and editing software to turn image files into gorgeous pictures -- and you can, too.
Smartphone cameras and the software that automatically processes the images have become so good at creating fantastic photos on the fly that most people don't even carry a separate camera anymore (well, except for some Gen Z-ers going retro). There are plenty of apps that can slap a filter on a picture to make it look even better, but if you really want to elevate your mobile photography skills, consider the format the pros use: RAW.
Editing a RAW file is more work, but it allows the photographer to have more control of the light and color in the image after it's been captured -- and in some cases, enough pixels to significantly crop the photo and still have it look sharp. Here's a guide to getting started.
What is RAW?
"RAW" means raw data -- and lots of it. Many phone cameras automatically capture and save images as JPEG or HEIC files, which crunch down and discard some of the image data to reduce the file size. However, when you choose to capture images as RAW files, you get uncompressed and unprocessed data from the camera's sensor. Without the compression, RAW images contain more detail and colors to work with. But the files can be huge.
There are many specialized camera tools that capture and edit RAW files available in the app stores. (More on those later.) But if you're just dabbling for now, here's how to use the options available on the newest iPhone and Android models, as well as other free tools.
The iPhone's RAW settings
On an iPhone 12 Pro (or later Pro and Pro Max models) running at least the iOS 14.3 operating system, you can capture and store RAW files by going to the main Settings app, and choosing Camera and then Formats. Tap the button next to Apple ProRAW, which is Apple's variation on the RAW format. On iPhone 14 Pro models, you can choose the resolution to store your RAW files: 12 megapixels or a whopping 48 megapixels.
Then open the iOS Camera app, line up the shot and choose the RAW feature at the top right of the screen. Now all you have to do is tap on the shutter button to save the file to the camera roll.
A 48-megapixel file allows for photos with good detail even with significant cropping, but the file size of each photo can be 75 megabytes or larger. If you have an iPhone with a terabyte of space, the larger file sizes are less of a problem, but phones with less storage can run out of space fast.
Only images taken with the iPhone's main camera can be saved at the 48-megapixel resolution. Those snapped with the phone's wide-angle or telephoto cameras (or photos captured in night mode or with a flash) are automatically saved at the 12-megapixel resolution.
RAW options for Android
Finding the RAW settings on an Android phone varies based on the device and its manufacturer, so check your phone's support site for specific instructions.
If you have one of Google's Pixel phones running Android 13, go to the Camera app and tap the Down arrow in the upper-left corner, then choose More Settings and then Advanced. Next, tap the button next to RAW + JPEG control. The camera will capture the image in both JPEG and RAW formats, but it saves the larger files into a separate RAW folder on the Google Photos app.
On Samsung's Galaxy phones, the Camera settings includes a Pro mode and advanced picture options to save images as RAW files. In the settings, go to "Format and advanced options" and tap the button for RAW copies. For late-model Galaxy phones, Samsung also recently released its free Expert RAW camera app, which is available in the Galaxy Store.
Edit your RAW files
If you have an iPhone, you can use Apple's Photo app to edit RAW files. For Android phones, Google Photos offers "limited" support for the format, but its older photo-editing app, Snapseed, has a tool to edit RAW files. The Snapseed app, which is free and works on both Android and iOS, has a support site with an online tutorial and an instructional video on YouTube for beginners.
At first glance, RAW files can seem flat, murky and bulky. But once you start to process them in a compatible photo-editing program, you can take advantage of all that extra data.
In the editing app, you can use the onscreen slider and other controls to adjust an image's white balance, which neutralizes color casts; change the exposure; pull parts of the picture out of shadows; deepen colors and more.
Some photographers prefer to handle RAW files using tools in Adobe Lightroom, which have mobile versions for Android, iPhone and iPad devices (free, with in-app purchases). Adobe's site has a tutorial, as do many websites specializing in digital photography.
To edit your photos on a bigger screen, you can store the files in a cloud server or transfer the file from your mobile device to a desktop computer using Wi-Fi or AirDrop, and then use either Adobe Lightroom's subscription desktop version or one of the many desktop photo apps (including Apple's Photos for Mac).
Once you are ready for more advanced techniques using RAW files, you can buy or subscribe to the myriad specialized photography apps in your app store, including VSCO (for Android and iOS) and ON1 Photo RAW (also for Android and iOS). For those using iPhones and iPads for editing, you could also consider the apps Halide Mark II, Darkroom and RAW Power.
When you're done editing your RAW image, you can save it as a JPEG or other common formats for sharing, printing or making art out of.
Photograph RAW files provide more data for a photo-editing program to use. Above, an enhanced image of Lower Manhattan.; Google Photos makes it easy to identify RAW files and store them in their own folder. RAW files typically have a file extension of .dng, which is short for digital negative.; The Camera settings of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have an option to capture RAW images at a resolution of 48 megapixels, which makes for larger and more detailed files.; You might not want to always use 48-megapixel RAW files, top left, because they can be so large. Decide when to use it by tapping the RAW button on or off in Apple's iOS Camera app.; With the standard Google Camera app on a Google Pixel 7 running Android 13, above, the settings let you save both a RAW and a JPEG copy of each photo you take.

In Seoul, It's Like Another Olympics: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The inaugural Frieze Seoul fair was one sign of the city's ascent. Now a dealer invasion is underway and artists are navigating a new landscape, as competition heats up.
SEOUL -- One recent afternoon in the vibrant Itaewon neighborhood, art types trickled into a four-story building that the Berlin and Paris gallery Esther Schipper had just unveiled as a showroom, to catch an interactive performance by the artist Tino Sehgal. It involved a girl, in character, delivering a short monologue and addressing questions to her audience. At one point, she turned to an artist on hand and asked, "Would you rather feel too busy or not busy enough?" Not a fair question: Anyone trying to keep up with art in this art-mad city hardly has a choice.
New museums are opening, foreign galleries are alighting and corporations are plowing money into contemporary art. Frieze opened a fair here in September, some 120 exhibitors strong, and the international art world flew in. At Samsung's palatial Leeum Museum of Art, "Squid Game" stars and visiting museum curators watched the K-pop girl group Kep1er. At a club in the industrial Euljiro neighborhood, the artist Haegue Yang hosted a blowout that lasted into the early morning. Finally, after cautious pandemic management, this metropolitan area of 26 million -- that's half the country's population in an area the size of Connecticut -- felt gloriously alive.
Amid the action, one young gallery worker told me he was proud that Frieze, which has editions in London, New York and Los Angeles, had picked South Korea instead of rival Japan for its first fair in Asia. And the Seoul-born art dealer, Jason Haam, 32, enthused in an interview, "It's kind of like the World Cup or Olympics coming into this country." It is an exhilarating moment for art and a complicated one, as everyone navigates rapid changes, sizes up the newcomers and angles for position, as economic fears loom.
"I think it was long overdue that people recognized Seoul, Korea, as an art hub," said Emma Son, the senior director at Lehmann Maupin's gallery here. She has been in Seoul's gallery sector for more than two decades and was sitting in her office, next to a painting by the midcareer Korean artist Keunmin Lee, who channels body horror in virtuosic near-abstractions. Lehmann Maupin, which also has New York and London branches, moved into its elegant two-floor space this year, after opening a smaller showroom in 2017. Pace has also expanded dramatically, and Perrotin just added a second space. Almost 300 galleries were counted in Seoul in a 2020 survey by the Korea Arts Management Service, a government agency.
A dealer invasion is underway. In March, Tang Contemporary Art (Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong) moved into a capacious exhibition hall in the ultrawealthy Cheongdam area. In April, Peres Projects, a talent-spotting outfit in Berlin and Milan, grabbed a shop in the ritzy Shilla Hotel; it is now prepping a gallery in Samcheong, the preserve of mainstays like Hyundai and PKM. That same month, Gladstone (three New York galleries, one in Brussels) also landed in Cheongdam, where König (Berlin, London) set up in 2021 on the upper floors of an MCM store.
The collector base in South Korea "is big, but it's not as big as China, or the U.S. or Europe," Son said, "so the competitiveness is going to be tough between the galleries."
It may soon be tough between South Korea and other locales, as well. Hong Kong's political crackdown and strict coronavirus quarantine helped Seoul, but those rules have been dropped. Japan has loosened its tax rules for art, and a fair is on tap for Tokyo this summer from a team that includes the founders of what became Art Basel Hong Kong and that is also behind one starting Jan. 12 in another wealthy Asian city: Singapore.
The foreign influx has its pluses and minuses. "It is pretty nice for me because I can see those works that I would have had to see somewhere else," while traveling, said Kyungmin Lee in the basement office of Whistle, the Itaewon gallery for emerging artists she started in 2017.
Though major international galleries are coming to Seoul, they are "still separated from the Korean art scene," said the curator Haeju Kim, who organized this year's Busan Biennale in that city on the southern coast. Even the arrivals with big-name Korean artists on their rosters have largely focused on exhibiting European and American talent. In its first year in business here, Thaddaeus Ropac, a European heavyweight, did that exclusively, showing only men. (This week it opens an exhibition of three Korean female artists on the rise.)
Blue-chip dealers and deep-pocketed collectors are, of course, only two parts of a viable industry. Art scenes rise or fall on their emerging artists. While this is difficult to measure, it feels far more challenging for a vanguard-minded young local artist to be represented by a gallery in Seoul than it would be in, say, New York, which is comparatively abundant in dealers eager to take risks on the new and untested.
"I want galleries to be more open to more experimental things," the artist Haena Yoo told me, taking a break at a coffee shop near her studio on a weekend morning. Yoo, 32, makes intricate sculptures and installations that incorporate organic substances and plumb how goods and identities are packaged and transform as they flow across borders. Homemade meju, a brick of fermented soybeans used in many Korean dishes, figures in some of her work. (She made sure to get a studio with a kitchen.)
Yoo was readying a solo show at Gallery Shilla, a veteran of the city of Daegu that opened here in 2021. After college in Seoul, she got her M.F.A. in California, and now splits her time between Los Angeles and the Korean capital. She said that she has seen dealers here become more intrepid in the past couple of years, perhaps spurred on by the expectations of younger patrons and all the new competition. Local ventures like P21, Gallery 2, Cylinder and BB & M have been injecting fresh energy.
Whistle came about when Lee, 38, wanted "to have some kind of opportunity for younger artists to show in a professional way, because it was lacking," she said. One of two Korean galleries in Frieze Seoul's section for emerging Asian galleries, it presented wily abstractions of flat, bright color by the Korean artist Hejum Bä. Some local collectors had been waiting more than a year for a Bä but ceded their planned purchases to foreigners -- "they want international collectors to collect the work and for her to be more well known," Lee said. "I collect, and it's really not easy to let it go. I almost cried. Everyone was so supportive."
The hope among many artists and dealers here is that this newfound attention will endure, and open doors beyond Korea. (The worry is that this may be a largely one-way relationship, with multinational galleries simply selling to a new market.) There are astonishingly talented artists here who have shown abroad only sparingly, like Heecheon Kim, an incisive video maker; Yooyun Yang, who conjures cinematic scenes from traditional ink-and-paper painting; Rondi Park, who makes hilarious works in every medium that are cut through with pathos; and Haneyl Choi, who crafts spare, enigmatic, queer sculptures.
The government has been providing grants to push along that process, helping artists and dealers exhibit widely, intent on generating a hallyu, or "Korean wave" that has propelled K-pop and Korean cinema to worldwide prominence. Korean corporations -- the family-owned conglomerates known as chaebol that have long been art buyers and philanthropists -- have also funded art initiatives abroad.
On the home front, too, there are government efforts to bolster art-making. "Korea has a good public-funding structure for residencies and studio spaces," said Sook-Kyung Lee, who started her career in the 1990s at South Korea's National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA). She is now senior curator of international art at Tate Modern in London. "Compared to Britain, it's just so much better," she said. Agencies give grants for artists to publish catalogs and stage exhibitions, though some criticize the mechanics of the process, which involves onerous paperwork and the use of funds to rent venues for brief runs.
Real estate is pricey in Seoul -- and most galleries are modest by Chelsea standards -- but people find ways to make it work. Scrappy alternative galleries, many run by artists, dot neighborhoods like Euljiro, Mullae and Seochon, and slices of the Mapo district. (Stalwarts includes WESS, Factory 2, Space 413, Sarubia and Saga.) For better and for worse, they can feel disconnected from the commercial sphere, and they come and go with heartbreaking speed.
"To be honest, at the start, I didn't mean to do this," Jungmin Cho said at one such space, White Noise, which she directs. It is in a basement with low ceilings that once held a catering business in a stretch of the Bangbae neighborhood lined with cozy cafes. "I was just gathering my friends and doing fun, experimental things without thinking about the future."
That was in 2018. People told her to keep it going. For one night, on Dec. 30, White Noise hosted its 37th project, with Lilbiitz (a "creative food project team") offering dishes inspired by the gallery's 2022 shows. The week of Frieze, Cho had artists make presentations of their work at a design shop before it was auctioned off, live, as a D.I.Y. sendup of that market ritual.
When it comes to the global art market, South Korea remains a minor player. Its total art sales in 2021 were 922.3 billion won (about $ 726 million at the current exchange rate), according to a report from Seoul National University and the Paradise Cultural Foundation. China's were around $ 13 billion, per an Art Basel and UBS survey. Auction turnover in Hong Kong alone was $ 1.7 billion for that year, according to Artprice -- more than six times South Korea's total.
But the major houses are taking an interest. Christie's staged a blockbuster exhibition of Francis Bacon and Adrian Ghenie during Frieze Seoul; Sotheby's hired Jane Yoon (formerly of Phillips) to open a new office, and Minhee Suh has joined Phillips as regional director after a dozen years at the local K Auction. In an interview, Suh described how she has seen collecting change. "Before it was just like a hobby," she said. Now "it's a kind of culture."
What is particularly striking about being in South Korea right now is the sense of possibility in the air. About 80 percent of its art museums -- more than 200 -- were established after 2000, according to the Korea Arts Management Service. The Seoul Museum of Art has seven branches in the city, and is readying three more. The federal government, meanwhile, is planning another for the hulking collection of art, books, and antiquities donated by the family of the Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who died in 2020.
Samsung's cultural foundation has two museums of its own -- the Leeum and, just south of Seoul, the Ho-Am, which will reopen in April after a renovation. Other corporate giants, like SK and Amorepacific, also operate art institutions. In 2021, ST International (an energy concern) inaugurated a striking building for its headquarters and its art nonprofit, SongEun, which focuses on up-and-coming Korean figures.
"We wanted -- through the architecture, through making a landmark with Herzog & de Meuron -- more exposure for our young artists," said SongEun's artistic director, Laurencina Farrant-Lee.
The pace of building in South Korea awes, but there are gripes that the quality of public exhibitions, and professional standards, varies widely. Many public collections remain in nascent stages, and their acquisition budgets are not large.
The national museum, MMCA, had about $ 4 million for art buys in 2021, which would not cover half of the roughly $ 11.2 million that a collector, Kim Woong-ki, paid in 2019 for a 1971 Kim Whanki painting, the record price for Korean art at auction. It is a radiant, swirling work of minute blue marks, and it was just on view at a new art venue in an office building associated with Global Sae-A Group (clothing and more), where Kim is chairman. (Some have called for South Korea to adopt tax incentives for donating art to museums.)
Even as the city's art scene expands, there is a measure of nervousness. The Korean won has started to recover after a rough year, but economic uncertainty remains. If Frieze had been in 2021, "it would have been so much crazier," said Haam, the dealer, who opened his gallery in 2018 in an Italian restaurant that he gutted in the moneyed Seongbuk district. During Frieze, new paintings by the blue-chipper Urs Fischer hung on his walls, a feat for a young dealer with only a few years' experience.
Haam's parents are collectors, and while studying at Cornell University, he started selling art to his mother's friends back home, building an international roster. "I felt like I had a little bit of a safe haven here, especially at the incubation stage of the gallery," he said.
Those days are certainly over, but even as the scene gets crowded, Haam remains bullish, with plans to expand in Seoul. "Twenty years from now, if the country is as rich as it is right now," he said, "I think it can be like London or New York."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In September, the chip giant Intel gathered officials at a patch of land near Columbus, Ohio, where it pledged to invest at least $ 20 billion in two new factories to make semiconductors.
A month later, Micron Technology celebrated a new manufacturing site near Syracuse, N.Y., where the chip company expected to spend $ 20 billion by the end of the decade and eventually perhaps five times that.
And in December, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company hosted a shindig in Phoenix, where it plans to triple its investment to $ 40 billion and build a second new factory to create advanced chips.
The pledges are part of an enormous ramp-up in U.S. chip-making plans over the past 18 months, the scale of which has been likened to Cold War-era investments in the space race. The boom has implications for global technological leadership and geopolitics, with the United States aiming to prevent China from becoming an advanced power in chips, the slices of silicon that have driven the creation of innovative computing devices like smartphones and virtual-reality goggles.
Today, chips are an essential part of modern life even beyond the tech industry's creations, from military gear and cars to kitchen appliances and toys.
Across the nation, more than 35 companies have pledged nearly $ 200 billion for manufacturing projects related to chips since the spring of 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group. The money is set to be spent in 16 states, including Texas, Arizona and New York on 23 new chip factories, the expansion of nine plants, and investments from companies supplying equipment and materials to the industry.
The push is one facet of an industrial policy initiative by the Biden administration, which is dangling at least $ 76 billion in grants, tax credits and other subsidies to encourage domestic chip production. Along with providing sweeping funding for infrastructure and clean energy, the efforts constitute the largest U.S. investment in manufacturing arguably since World War II, when the federal government unleashed spending on new ships, pipelines and factories to make aluminum and rubber.
"I've never seen a tsunami like this," said Daniel Armbrust, the former chief executive of Sematech, a now-defunct chip consortium formed in 1987 with the Defense Department and funding from member companies.
President Biden has staked a prominent part of his economic agenda on stimulating U.S. chip production, but his reasons go beyond the economic benefits. Much of the world's cutting-edge chips today are made in Taiwan, the island to which China claims territorial rights. That has caused fears that semiconductor supply chains may be disrupted in the event of a conflict -- and that the United States will be at a technological disadvantage.
The new U.S. production efforts may correct some of these imbalances, industry executives said -- but only up to a point.
The new chip factories would take years to build and might not be able to offer the industry's most advanced manufacturing technology when they begin operations. Companies could also delay or cancel the projects if they aren't awarded sufficient subsidies by the White House. And a severe shortage in skills may undercut the boom, as the complex factories need many more engineers than the number of students who are graduating from U.S. colleges and universities.
The bonanza of money on U.S. chip production is "not going to try or succeed in accomplishing self-sufficiency," said Chris Miller, an associate professor of international history at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and the author of a recent book on the chip industry's battles.
White House officials have argued that the chip-making investments will sharply reduce the proportion of chips needed to be purchased from abroad, improving U.S. economic security. At the TSMC event in December, Mr. Biden also highlighted the potential impact on tech companies like Apple that rely on TSMC for their chip-making needs. He said that "it could be a game changer" as more of these companies "bring more of their supply chain home."
U.S. companies led chip production for decades starting in the late 1950s. But the country's share of global production capacity gradually slid to around 12 percent from about 37 percent in 1990, as countries in Asia provided incentives to move manufacturing to those shores.
Today, Taiwan accounts for about 22 percent of total chip production and more than 90 percent of the most advanced chips made, according to industry analysts and the Semiconductor Industry Association.
The new spending is set to improve America's position. A $ 50 billion government investment is likely to prompt corporate spending that would take the U.S. share of global production to as much as 14 percent by 2030, according to a Boston Consulting Group study in 2020 that was commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association.
"It really does put us in the game for the first time in decades," said John Neuffer, the association's president, who added that the estimate may be conservative because Congress approved $ 76 billion in subsidies in a piece of legislation known as the CHIPS Act.
Still, the ramp-up is unlikely to eliminate U.S. dependence on Taiwan for the most advanced chips. Such chips are the most powerful because they pack the highest number of transistors onto each slice of silicon, and they are often held up as a sign of a nation's technological progress.
Intel long led the race to shrink the size of transistors so more could fit on a chip. That pace of miniaturization is usually described in nanometers, or billionths of a meter, with smaller numbers indicating the most cutting-edge production technology. Then, TSMC surged ahead in recent years.
But at its Phoenix site, TSMC may not import its most advanced manufacturing technology. The company initially announced that it would produce five-nanometer chips at the Phoenix factory, before saying last month that it would also make four-nanometer chips there by 2024 and build a second factory, which will open in 2026, for three-nanometer chips. It stopped short of discussing further advances.
In contrast, TSMC's factories in Taiwan at the end of 2022 began producing three-nanometer technology. By 2025, factories in Taiwan will probably start supplying Apple with two-nanometer chips, said Handel Jones, chief executive at International Business Strategies.
TSMC and Apple declined to comment.
Whether other chip companies will bring more advanced technology for cutting-edge chips to their new sites is unclear. Samsung Electronics plans to invest $ 17 billion in a new factory in Texas but has not disclosed its production technology. Intel is manufacturing chips at roughly seven nanometers, though it has said its U.S. factories will turn out three-nanometer chips by 2024 and even more advanced products soon after that.
The spending boom is also set to reduce, though not erase, U.S. reliance on Asia for other kinds of chips. Domestic factories produce only about 4 percent of the world's memory chips -- which are needed to store data in computers, smartphones and other consumer devices -- and Micron's planned investments could eventually raise that percentage.
But there are still likely to be gaps in a catchall variety of older, simpler chips, which were in such short supply over the past two years that U.S. automakers had to shut down factories and produce partly finished vehicles. TSMC is a major producer of some of these chips, but it is focusing its new investments on more profitable plants for advanced chips.
"We still have a dependency that is not being impacted in any way shape or form," said Michael Hurlston, chief executive of Synaptics, a Silicon Valley chip designer that relies heavily on TSMC's older factories in Taiwan.
The chip-making boom is expected to create a jobs bonanza of 40,000 new roles in factories and companies that supply them, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. That would add to about 277,000 U.S. semiconductor industry employees.
But it won't be easy to fill so many skilled positions. Chip factories typically need technicians to run factory machines and scientists in fields like electrical and chemical engineering. The talent shortage is one of the industry's toughest challenges, according to recent surveys of executives.
The CHIPS Act contains funding for work force development. The Commerce Department, which is overseeing the doling out of grant money from the CHIPS Act's funds, has also made it clear that organizations hoping to obtain funding should come up with plans for training and educating workers.
Intel, responding to the issue, plans to invest $ 100 million to spur training and research at universities, community colleges and other technical educators. Purdue University, which built a new semiconductor laboratory, has set a goal of graduating 1,000 engineers each year and has attracted the chip maker SkyWater Technology to build a $ 1.8 billion manufacturing plant near its Indiana campus.
Yet training may go only so far, as chip companies compete with other industries that are in dire need of workers.
"We're going to have to build a semiconductor economy that attracts people when they have a lot of other choices," Mitch Daniels, who was president of Purdue at the time, said at an event in September.
Since training efforts may take years to bear fruit, industry executives want to make it easier for highly educated foreign workers to obtain visas to work in the United States or stay after they get their degrees. Officials in Washington are aware that comments encouraging more immigration could invite political fire.
But Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, was forthright in a speech in November at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Attracting the world's best scientific minds is "an advantage that is America's to lose," she said. "And we're not going to let that happen."
