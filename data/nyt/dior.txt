PARIS — There is a certain irony to the fact that of all the shows that took place during couture last week, the one designed to be the most off-line — the one conceived as an in-person experience rather than as a simple catwalk — is the one that ended up going the most viral.
The one that no one seems to be able to stop talking about — not the fashion world, nor its millions of followers.
I am speaking of the Maison Margiela Artisanal show by John Galliano. It has sent the watching hordes into ecstasies of praise and adoration, and inspired talk of “history” and “genius” and “the sublime.”
The show, held under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in a jury-rigged nightclub straight from Paris’ romantic old underbelly as a cold wind blew in off the Seine and waiters offered hot toddies and candied violets, was everything the fashion world once seemed to promise. It was sumptuous, excessive, rife with roiling emotion communicated in cloth, with models vamping, skittering and otherwise willing to sacrifice themselves on the pyre of unfettered imagination. It was the sort of immersive show that hasn’t been seen in more than a decade. Maybe two.
Exactly that sort of show. Which is why, almost a week later, I feel a lingering sense of déjà vu. And why, scrolling through the continuing paeans in the digisphere, I can’t help but wonder if the outsize reaction has less to do with Galliano and more with our own fears about the contemporary creative condition.
Fears that, as Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino told me in Paris, “the money has won,” no matter what the form of artistic expression. “Producers are stronger than musicians,” he said. “Galleries are stronger than painters. And big groups are stronger than designers.” Fears that along the way to super-brands, billions and globalization, we lost something essential and we don’t know how to get it back.
The Margiela show, with its distortions and theater, its lack of obvious commercial intent, represented a riposte to all that (even if a big group — Only the Brave, the conglomerate run by Renzo Rosso that owns Margiela and employs Galliano — actually paid for it). And if it could be greeted with such an ecstatic embrace … well, perhaps redemption was possible. Not just for Galliano, with all his talent and his transgressions, but for anyone complicit in the corporatization of inspiration.
Yet it seems to me that viewing this particular show as a solution rather than a symptom may be more wishful thinking than reality.
Still, you can understand it. No designer has been as symbolic of fashion’s modern arc than Galliano, the lonely kid born in Gibraltar and raised in South London who found himself in the fantasies of fashion at Central Saint Martins and ultimately got the keys to the luxury kingdom as creative director of Dior before collapsing under the pressure of the globalizing industry that demanded more and more collections.
When I first started going to shows, back in the early part of the millennium, the Galliano shows, both his signature label and Dior, were the hottest tickets in Paris. People would trek to abandoned warehouses on the outskirts of the city for Galliano and wait outside in the cold for an hour to be let in and transported to whatever realm the designer had dreamed up. (The neighborhoods were so sketchy that the Saks team once had its car broken into.)
Then, over the seasons, he went from being the darling of the fashion scene to its pampered dauphin, increasingly isolated in a gilded cage, taking his Dior bows with hair dyed to match the collections and in evermore elaborate costumes — now Napoleon, now an astronaut — that seemed evermore ridiculous. Ultimately he descended into drug and alcohol addiction and lost it all after an antisemitic rant in a Paris bar.
He was fired from Dior, lost his namesake label (which was owned by LVMH), convicted of a hate crime (albeit with a reduced fine) in a Paris court and spent a few years in the wilderness. He went to rehab, offered reparations, studied with a rabbi and gradually began his return. In 2014, Rosso named him creative director of Maison Margiela, and he humbly took the job, continuing founder Martin Margiela’s practice of never taking a bow at the end of a show.
In any case, it turned out Galliano had something new and relevant to say: exploring ways of cutting old garments and upcycling that brought the house’s explorations of used materials to an exquisite new level. Now, almost a decade later, he has fully made it his own, bringing the story full circle, writing his own happy ending.
How did he know it was time? Perhaps he sensed there was a Galliano revival brewing. Vintage dresses by the designer keep popping up on the red carpet. Jennifer Aniston wore a white bias-cut Galliano for Dior from 1999 to the 2020 SAG awards; Amal Clooney wore a mint-green beaded Galliano slip dress from 2009 to the London premiere of “Ticket to Paradise” in 2022; and Laverne Cox wore a periwinkle blue and silver draped Galliano gown to the Golden Globes in 2023. When I saw Galliano in Paris before the show, he was marveling at the prices his old work fetched in the auction market.
This March a documentary on his life, “High & Low: John Galliano,” by director Kevin Macdonald, will open in theaters. (Full disclosure: I am a talking head in the film.) Galliano sees himself, he said during our couture preview, as one of fashion’s earliest victims of cancel culture, even though there is a significant difference between being convicted in an actual court and being convicted in the court of public opinion.
Also, the period of Galliano’s greatest triumphs is having a nostalgic moment among millennials and Gen Z-ers, who view the age before smartphones as a halcyon time, before factionalism became an epidemic and everyone was isolated in the echo chamber of their own toxic beliefs.
As Tara Gonzalez wrote in Harper’s Bazaar after the Margiela show: “I grew up watching Galliano’s wildly theatrical shows years after the fact on YouTube, always with a tinge of bitterness. They made me feel like I’d been born into the wrong generation — what I wouldn’t have given to have been there, witnessing those scenes in real time, nothing but a notebook on my lap.”
It’s a sentiment echoed by Mark Guiducci of Vogue, who wrote on Instagram: “The John Galliano show that my generation has been waiting for. The fashion fantasy that ’90s kids were promised.”
While I can understand the desire for something you think you missed, I wonder if, in celebrating Galliano’s “return to his roots,” we haven’t somehow missed the point. That era was also full of abuses (as the #MeToo movement uncovered) and self-destructive behavior.
The truly mind-blowing aspect of Galliano’s gift is his singular ability to invent new ways to shape material and through that, the body and sense of self. That goes far beyond the obvious use of extreme corsetry out of which the flesh spills, in all its meaty glory.
When I saw him at the preview, he was chortling over the silver swallows on a black chiffon dress, which he had finally figured out how to bead on the bias to remain square rather than twisting with the cut. Seams disappeared into embroideries as if they didn’t exist. Those models — or “muses,” as he calls them — in his show weren’t hunched over with their arms protecting their guts because they were acting. The wool coats were cut to create that effect, to give the gift of gesture without effort.
And the coats weren’t wool anyway. They were layers of organza and tulle crushed together, printed to resemble men’s wear fabric, and shrouded in a veil of chiffon like a shadow.
It’s easy to miss amid all the illusory drama, but it’s also a reminder: We’ve moved beyond the idea of suffering for fashion — and that’s a good thing. The dream of fashion ought to move forward, too.

Josephine Baker as Both Artist and Activist: [Correction]

Full text: There was no shortage of epithets for Josephine Baker, the St. Louis-born polymath who took Paris by storm when she arrived there in 1925, aged 19, to headline "La Revue Nègre," a show of all-Black performers at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.
The French graphic designer Paul Colin said he'd never seen anyone move like her: "Part kangaroo, part prizefighter. A woman made of rubber, a female Tarzan." To the writer Colette, a rumored lover, she was "a most beautiful panther," and to Ernest Hemingway, "the most sensational woman anyone ever saw." Over the next decade, she was also called "Black Venus," "Black Pearl" and "Creole Goddess."
It is the Baker of this era -- doing her scantily clad "danse sauvage" -- who still looms large in the cultural imagination. She was an Art Deco icon who was inducted into France's Panthéon in 2021 and honored by Beyoncé on her recent "Renaissance" tour. A new exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin presents Baker in the round -- not as an object of entertainment, but as an artist and an activist.
The show, "Josephine Baker: Icon in Motion," which runs through April 28, is a small but dense and deeply imaginative reconsidering of her life and work. The museum's director, Klaus Biesenbach (formerly of MoMA and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art) has curated the show with the artist Kandis Williams, the scholar Terri Francis and the curator Mona Horncastle: The result emphasizes the importance of multiple interpretations.
We see familiar images, still and moving, of Baker during her Paris heyday, wearing anklets of feathers, elaborate vests made of crystals and pearls, bikinis festooned with hornlike protrusions and, of course, the infamous skirt of jewel-encrusted bananas that bounced and twinkled when she danced the Charleston. Black-and-white glamour photographs by prominent 1920s photographers show Baker's influence on high fashion of the time.
On a series of monitors, segments from her dance routines and feature films show Baker's extraordinary physical skill. In one, every part of her body seems to move independently, arms and legs akimbo, while also keeping time to the same beat. In another, she sashays and wriggles across the stage like mercury, then breaks into knee drops so extreme that I felt my own legs go weak. In yet another, she clowns between moves, rolls and crosses her eyes, purses her lips, puffs up her cheeks and waddles, wiggling her head side-to-side.
A section called "Modernist Muse" shows Baker's creative impact on prominent artists of the time, many of whom were her friends (and sometimes paramours). Alexander Calder's 1928 mobile "Josephine Baker IV" has her sparely outlined in steel wire, with sinuous curves and protruding coils for breasts. A drawing by Le Corbusier from around the same time, "Josephine Baker Sleeping," shows the notoriously unstoppable dancer in gentle repose. At the center of the display, the curators have placed a vitrine filled with books about Baker, including her memoirs, which were translated into many languages. She might have been a muse, but she was also -- literally -- the author of her own life.
Baker lived and worked across a Europe shaped by its colonial exploits and was keenly aware of how she could embody the racist ideas of her audience. "People have done me the honor of comparing me to an animal," Baker once said slyly of comments like those from Colin or Collette.
She used hackneyed colonial symbols, like bananas, palm trees and tropical creatures, to her own ends, and her pet cheetah Chiquita sometimes terrorized the orchestra pit. Her performances were self-aware appropriations, played for laughs with absolute sincerity: See how I move, see how I grin, see how stereotype and desire are entwined. See how you can't look away.
Then fascism's rise brought down the curtain. On tour in Austria in the early 1930s, churches rang their bells to drown out her performances, and once France was occupied in 1940, she was banned from the stage there, along with all Black and Jewish performers. Undaunted, she joined the French Resistance and collected intelligence while performing in North Africa, smuggling back information written in invisible ink on her score sheets.
In 1961, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre, a French military honor for feats of bravery; two years later she traveled back to the United States to attend the March on Washington, where she was one of two women to speak alongside Martin Luther King Jr.
"I was a devil in other countries, and I was a little devil in America too," Baker said to the crowd of over 200,000 people on the National Mall. In her country of birth, she was a "little devil" for her commitment to speaking out about racial segregation. A display titled "Civil Rights Activist Extraordinaire" shows photographs of Baker on the National Mall, and meeting with the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, which inaugurated a day in her honor. Baker's belief in equality and universalism extended to her personal life: She adopted 12 children of various ethnicities and nationalities, calling them her "Rainbow Tribe."
Artists and scholars remain influenced by Baker and what Francis, the co-curator, describes in a video essay that appears in the show as the performer's "prismatic" qualities: "Neither a single image nor a static representation, Baker is rather a dazzling many-ness, a structure of spectacles, formed from multiple media."
Also included are works by contemporary artists that speak to Baker's inspiration -- like Carrie Mae Weems's "Slow Fade To Black: Josephine Baker" a diptych, that frames the exhibitions entrance, or Jean-Ulrick Désert's colorful stained glass portrait, "Shrine of the Divine Negress No. 1" at the exit. Where Weems blurs two iconic photographs of Baker to the point of dissolution, Désert renders the performer in vibrant clarity, surrounded by butterflies. Most powerful and provocative is Simone Leigh's "Slipcover" (2022-3), a wall-mounted square of porcelain bananas painted in fleshy hues from pale pink to dark black. Leigh harnesses the same stereotypes Baker was exploring -- and exploiting -- in her art to make audiences think twice, look again.
In this sensitive presentation, Baker emerges as a many-pointed star, at once individual and part of a wider constellation. With its collaborative curatorial team, array of mediums and inclusion of contemporary artists, the exhibition is also a collective enterprise of reinterpretation, in which the networks between discrete objects and images are just as important.
Baker never stopped moving: onstage, onscreen, across Europe. In this exhibition, it is her identity that refuses to stay still and insists on containing multitudes.

Forgotten Hot Spot Aims to Keep Its Cool: [Style Desk]

Full text: That's the hope at the restaurant Maxim's in Paris, which recently started a new chapter after 130 years in business.
Anya Firestone's job as a luxury tour guide in Paris has brought her to many rarefied corners of the city. But only recently did she do something that countless locals and visitors have done over the last 130 years: Book a reservation at Maxim's, the storied French restaurant that opened in 1893 and has counted Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Margrethe II of Denmark, Jean Cocteau, Jane Birkin and Man Ray among its patrons.
"The place was packed," Ms. Firestone, 35, said of the night she ate there in late November. "There was energy -- the ghosts of Maxim's are probably happy."
Ms. Firestone, who has lived in Paris off and on since 2010, hadn't tried to dine there sooner because the restaurant fell "off my radar," she said, partly because she wasn't aware if it was still functioning as a restaurant. She was not alone in that perception.
"Many people, even most, did not realize it was open as a restaurant," said Pierre Pelegry, a director at Maxim's who has worked there for 27 years and was hired by Pierre Cardin, the French fashion designer, after he bought the restaurant in 1981.
The focus at Maxim's in recent years had shifted to private events, Mr. Pelegry said, and for a while it was open to diners only from Wednesdays through Saturdays. It resumed daily bookings in November, two months after the Paris Society, a French hospitality group, took over operations as part of a deal with the Cardin family. (Mr. Cardin died in 2020; his heirs have since been entangled in a battle over his estate.)
The three-story space, which has a small stage on its ground floor, has long been a favorite of the fashion set. Fendi is planning to have an event there during Paris couture week this month, and last year Maxim's hosted parties thrown by Valentino and Dior. Alexa Buckley Roussel, a shoe designer, and Alexandre Roussel, whose father is a fashion executive, had the welcome party for their wedding at the restaurant in September.
"Maxim's transports you," Ms. Buckley Roussel, 32, said, "and we wanted to give our guests a true immersion."
Over the decades Maxim's has been recognized for its food -- it once had three Michelin stars -- as well as for its interiors, which include bronze elements, velvet upholstery, stained glass and other details characteristic of the Art Nouveau style that became popular after the restaurant first opened in the late 1800s. The space has been used as a location for films, including "Gigi" and the 1952 version of "Moulin Rouge," and for Vogue photo shoots.
In 1979, its interior was designated a historical landmark by the French government. Cordélia de Castellane, the artistic adviser at Paris Society tasked with refreshing Maxim's look, said that the designation gave the restaurant's new operator little chance to change its appearance. But she was largely OK with that: When she was asked to help with the hospitality group's takeover, she recalled thinking, "I'll take the job, but I'm not touching anything!"
Ms. de Castellane, 42, who is also the artistic director of Dior's baby and home lines, said her "small interventions" at Maxim's included new floral upholstery for banquettes and changing the shades on tabletop lamps from a reddish to a pinkish hue.
She also tweaked the restaurant's logo, which under Mr. Cardin's ownership had become a stylized M that she said looked "too much" like the golden arches of McDonald's.
After Mr. Cardin bought Maxim's, it started functioning as a brand: New locations were opened in New York and around the world, some of which have since closed, and the restaurant's name began appearing on products including luggage and kitchenware.
Amanda Lear, a model and singer in Paris who formerly wrote gossip columns for British publications, said in an email that Maxim's had "lost its magic" because of those efforts to grow the business.
In the 1970s, Ms. Lear often ate at the restaurant with Salvador Dalí. "Each guest had to pass in front of his table when entering the room and of course they stopped by to salute," she said.
More recently, she went there to perform at the Dior event held last year, where she sang "Fashion Pack," a disco single she released in 1979. Its lyrics include the line "In Paris you go to be seen at Maxim's."
Ms. Lear was cautiously optimistic about the restaurant's new operator and next chapter.
"Hopefully they will resurrect it," she said. "But I am not sure that the rock stars and the Kardashians of today will succeed to bring back the glamour of this historical place."

Full text: As a personal assistant to a well-to-do retiree, Nora Szigeti is tasked with much of the usual fare: managing a calendar, booking travel, running errands. But after her 70-year-old boss recently came across an Instagram post shared by the account Class of Palm Beach, which documents outfits people have worn around that wealthy town, she took on another duty: publicist.
"My boss would be a perfect person for your site," Ms. Szigeti, 50, recalled writing in a message to the account in November. Soon after, her employer, Oblio Wish, appeared in a video shared by Class of Palm Beach, in which she showed off her wardrobe full of items from Dior, Gucci and Chanel.
She is one of the hundreds of Palm Beach residents and visitors -- whose ages have ranged from 20-something to 80-something -- who have been featured on Class of Palm Beach's Instagram, TikTok and Facebook accounts since they were started last March. Its accounts on those three platforms now have a combined audience of more than one million followers.
On the 14-mile-long island, Class of Palm Beach functions for some as a sort of social-media-age Shiny Sheet, a nickname for the Palm Beach Daily News, a paper that fills its pages with photographs from society galas and luncheons.
For others, like Ms. Szigeti, its accounts offer a near-daily glimpse into how the ultrarich dress. (A report from the U.S. Census Bureau listed the median household income in Palm Beach between 2018 and 2022 as $ 190,824.) Brunello Cucinelli, Zimmermann, and Hermès are names often uttered by people featured on the Class of Palm Beach accounts, many of whom can be seen clutching Chanel bags.
"For them, it's so ordinary: 'Oh, today I'm wearing a Rolex, and it's just a Birkin,"' Ms. Szigeti said of how casually some of the accounts' subjects can refer to watches and bags most people only dream of owning. "I have to save up two years to buy even half the Birkin."
Devorah Ezagui, 28, who lived in Palm Beach for part of her childhood, started the Class of Palm Beach accounts after moving back to the area last year. She had previously been living in New York, where she had been juggling personal training and marketing gigs, and where she would often ask people on the street about their outfits, she said.
The fashion in Palm Beach involves the same labels worn in other wealthy enclaves, but the way people wear them evokes a certain lifestyle, Ms. Ezagui said. The accounts, she added, were meant to showcase that lifestyle and offer an escape, as well as fashion inspiration.
Alanna Strei, a real estate agent in San Diego who discovered Class of Palm Beach on Instagram, said she appreciated its aesthetic of "old money glam" and its aspirational tone. Ms. Strei added that she also likes how the account features a breadth of people, not just "Real Housewives of Miami" types, as she put it.
Ms. Ezagui's videos for Class of Palm Beach are mostly man-on-the-street interviews in which she probes subjects about their clothes, accessories and fragrances while filming them on her iPhone. The approach is similar to that of other social media accounts that have started documenting outfits in well-heeled locations like Madison Avenue in New York and Greenwich, Conn.
Ms. Ezagui, whose wardrobe includes Celine flats and Maison Margiela denim shorts, is also a personal stylist to clients in the Palm Beach and New York areas. She said she spent at least four hours a day managing the Class of Palm Beach accounts, which have shared sponsored posts paid for by brands.
The accounts have also featured a few of the clients Ms. Ezagui has styled, she said, but most subjects are strangers she has encountered while out and about, whether shopping at a local Publix grocery store or at stores on Worth Avenue, a ritzy retail strip.
Though she has been to Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former President Donald J. Trump, she has yet to document any outfits there. "It was actually something I wanted to look into," she said. But there are "strict rules" about "going over to other people's tables" at the private club, she added.
The types of people she looks for have effervescent personalities and appear to have "really put intention into their outfit," she said. Ms. Ezagui added that about 70 percent of those she has asked to feature have agreed.
Most of those people are white women, a trend some followers of the accounts have pointed out in comments. Ms. Ezagui said the demographics of those featured was less reflective of her choices than it was of Palm Beach's population. A recent Census Bureau report found that about 94 percent of the town's residents were white and zero percent were Black.
"There's not everybody in this area," Ms. Ezagui said.
Some followers have also asked that she focus on a younger crowd. But Ms. Ezagui said that videos of older subjects reliably got more attention. "I know what will do well," she said.
On a rainy Saturday in January, as she was walking along Worth Avenue, Ms. Ezagui stopped to praise the outfit of a passerby, Carolina Paulino, who was wearing Zimmermann separates, Loro Piana shoes, an Hermès handbag and Cartier bracelets. Then came the question: Would she want to be filmed for a video?
Ms. Paulino, 28, who had come to have lunch in Palm Beach from Miami, agreed. She later said the outfit she was wearing was meant to evoke a "vibe of luxury, but beach."
Ms. Ezagui said that some people had asked her to feature fewer subjects in designer clothes and more in stylish items from affordable retailers like TJ Maxx. But to her, luxurious labels are a key element to Class of Palm Beach's success.
"People are trying to look for inspiration," she said.

Full text: In July 2022, just before the Balenciaga couture show, Didier Ludot returned from lunch to discover "the longest, most beautiful legs I have ever seen" at his namesake vintage couture boutique in the shopping arcades of the Palais-Royal. They belonged to Nicole Kidman, who was in Paris to walk in the Balenciaga show and was patiently waiting with her husband, Keith Urban.
They spent three hours browsing, with Mr. Urban fetching dresses for his wife, helping her to zip them up and then carefully replacing them on their hangers, prompting Mr. Ludot to jokingly offer him a post as his assistant. "They were a delight," Mr. Ludot, 72, recalled recently.
It's hard to imagine -- now that every red carpet features a "vintage" dress or two, many only a few years old and now that the term has become something of a buzzword for sustainability -- but when Mr. Ludot opened his door in 1974, he was the only boutique owner to curate his stock as if he were collecting couture for an art gallery. As much as anyone, he helped start the current phenomenon. And after 50 years, he has the stories to prove it.
He has always operated the boutique "like an art gallery, except we sell haute couture," Mr. Ludot said. "Everything in the store belongs to me. There is no consignment, I buy every piece outright. It's a galerie de la mode and I am its antique dealer. Next week, for instance, I have a rendezvous to view some Courrèges coats. If I like them and we agree on a price, madame will leave my boutique with her check."
The same month that Ms. Kidman showed up, Julia Roberts arrived in the boutique with her two bulldogs. "I need a coat!" she told him through chattering teeth -- it was an unusually cold summer. She left, he said, warmer and happier in an orange and green check Balenciaga.
"It makes me happy when my customer leaves wearing their acquisition," Mr. Ludot said.
"I love to sell clothes that modern women can actually wear," he said. "Of course I will buy a 1920s beaded Poiret gown, but that's museum quality, too fragile to wear. It will be archived, laid flat, wrapped in tissue and protected from daylight. I prefer to see these beautiful pieces having a second life, worn again -- the raison-d'être of a garment -- admired again and cherished again. Because if vintage couture represents anything, it's the embodiment of emotion."
His boutique -- now 125 square meters (1,345 square feet), triple its original size -- is well known as a showcase for one of the finest collections of vintage couture in the world, a source not only for fashion lovers seeking distinctive pieces, but also for major fashion house designers, museum curators, design students and professional collectors.
Some of the notable celebrities who have found their way there, he said, include Kate Moss, Catherine Deneuve, Stephanie Seymour, Kate Winslet, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Lucy Liu, Sarah Paulson, Fan Bingbing, Joanna Lumley, Naomi Campbell and Kris Jenner.
Mr. Ludot said his favorite celebrity memory dates to 2006 and involves a 1956 Christian Dior ball gown in silver tulle, intricately embellished with swaths of satin and fabric roses -- so exquisite that he had intended to keep it for his private collection.
He had just finished placing it in the boutique window when a group of Americans entered, asking its price. He told them it wasn't for sale. When they politely insisted, saying they represented a Hollywood actress, he said 35,000 euros, or about $ 42,700 at the time. Unfazed, they made an appointment for a fitting.
The appointment was for Reese Witherspoon and Mr. Ludot and his husband, Félix Farrington, helped her into the fragile gown. She wore it to the 2006 Academy Awards, where she won best actress for her role as June Carter Cash in "Walk the Line."
"This is the magic moment we live for!" Mr. Ludot said. "This couture ball gown was made to measure by Dior for an unknown woman. Fifty years later, another woman who wasn't even born at the time, steps into the gown and it fits as if was made for her. It brought her luck, too, as she won an Oscar."
As for designers, Karl Lagerfeld, Hubert de Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Anthony Vaccarello, Pierpaolo Piccioli, Donatella Versace, John Galliano, Calvin Klein and Azzedine Alaïa have been among his regulars.
Hamish Bowles, Vogue's global editor at large, is a frequent visitor, as is Miuccia Prada, who often arrived with Manuela Pavesi, her friend and colleague, until Ms. Pavesi's death in 2015.
"Manuela Pavesi was the most stylish woman I have ever known," Mr. Ludot said. "She'd arrive with diamonds in her hair wearing a fur coat over a pair men's pajamas and men's Westons. She once bought some vinyl Courrèges pieces from me with crocodile skin print. At the next Prada catwalk collection, there they were!
"It's not that they copy or imitate," he added, referring to designers, "they inspire themselves with the best of what they find here."
"Fashion has no memory," said Serge Carreira, director of the emerging brands initiative at Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and a lecturer at Sciences Po Paris. "Didier Ludot's brilliant curation gives us the time to examine fashion's past."
In 2010, Mr. Ludot was decorated with the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, a lifetime achievement award for his fashion antiquarian work, presented by the French Ministry of Culture.
That expertise was evident before an auction of some of his private collection early last year as Mr. Ludot examined an Yves Saint Laurent lime green satin jacket, lavishly embroidered by Maison Lesage in a tribute to the French painter Pierre Bonnard.
He pointed out that the jacket had a bolduc d'atelier, or workshop tape, stitched to its interior. To the right of the YSL monogram printed on the tape was the name of Anne Fiona, the model who wore it on the catwalk, and to the left, the label AH88, indicating it was from the fall 1988 couture collection. Both were hand written in black ink.
"This shows that this is the designer's prototype," Mr. Ludot said. "It is the perfect execution of Monsieur Saint Laurent's original vision. The proportions haven't been adjusted to fit a client or modified in any way to her taste."
He had estimated that the piece would sell for around €30,000; it went for €34,112.
It's not the age of a piece that qualifies it as "vintage," he said, it is its singularity, the defining look in a collection that reveals what he described as "the folly and fantasy" of the creator. Some of his choice examples: "Rick Owens' 2015 Sphinx collection. Or Jean Paul Gaultier's 2005 electric blue haute couture African Mask dress, with its Madame Grès-inspired bodice pleating."
On Feb. 25, to mark his 50-year anniversary at the Palais-Royal, Mr. Ludot plans to debut a weeklong retrospective, displaying emblematic pieces by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel and Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent for Christian Dior, alongside contemporary creations from Stéphane Rolland's fall 2023 couture collection, in homage to Maria Callas.
Mr. Ludot said he invited the independent French couturier to be the exhibition's guest of honor because "Stéphane Rolland's architectural creations reassure me and give me hope that haute couture can survive." In that sense, he continued, they are the vintage of the future.

LVMH Head Names 2 More Children to Board: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The move by France's richest man extends a carefully planned succession strategy for the world's biggest luxury company.
Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, announced on Thursday that he had nominated two more of his children to sit on the company board, a move to cement his family's control of Europe's most valuable conglomerate.
Those appointments, subject to the approval of a 15-person board, essentially lock in four of Mr. Arnault's five children as the chief decision makers of the company, furthering a succession strategy that Mr. Arnault, France's richest man, has meticulously mapped for years in a bid to extend LVMH's legacy into the next generation.
Mr. Arnault, 74, made the announcement as he shared LVMH's 2023 financial results. Despite economic slowdowns in Europe, the United States and China, the company's biggest markets, sales for the year were up 9 percent, to 86.2 billion euros, or $ 94 billion. Net profit rose 8 percent to €15.2 billion -- a record for the company.
"Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our brands and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges," Mr. Arnault said. Sales were driven by clothing and leather goods, as well as perfumes, cosmetics, watches and jewelry.
Mr. Arnault nominated Alexandre Arnault, 31, who is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Company, and Frédéric Arnault, 29, chief executive of Tag Heuer. They would join two older siblings: Delphine, 48, who is also chairman and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, and Antoine, 46, who runs multiple LVMH brands and is in charge of the group's image and sustainability efforts. The youngest sibling, Jean, 25, is Louis Vuitton's watch director.
"As I have always said, LVMH is a family-run group," Mr. Arnault said in a statement. He said the two brothers "will each bring interesting perspectives."
Over three decades, Mr. Arnault has forged LVMH into the world's largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France. Its brands -- 75 of them -- are the stars of the luxury world and include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne.
Mr. Arnault has long worked to ensure that the conglomerate -- which he created by acquiring European luxury brands that had been weakened by the families that owned them -- will stay firmly in his own family's hands. He persuaded the board in 2022 to raise the mandatory retirement age for the chief executive and chairman to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensured that his children -- each of whom has executive roles in the company -- would remain the top decision makers.
Such moves have ignited speculation of competition among the siblings over who will one day succeed their father. Mr. Arnault brushed off such talk in an interview last summer with The New York Times, saying: "The best person inside the family or outside the family should be, one day, my successor. But it's not something that I hope is a duel for the near future."
In 2022, Forbes named Mr. Arnault the world's richest man, a perch he lost when LVMH's share price slumped around 20 percent amid weakening growth in the demand for luxury goods. He now holds the title of the second-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, eclipsed by Elon Musk.
Last year, LVMH was also toppled as Europe's most valuable company by Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical firm that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, the popular drugs being used for weight loss.

'Barbie,' 'Saltburn,' Louis Vuitton: When TikTok Subsumes Culture: [Op-Ed]

Full text: In today's creative economy, the tail increasingly wags the dog. Marketing is driving culture as promotional campaigns overshadow the offerings they seek to elevate -- in fashion, music, art and film. With fashion weeks taking place around the world and awards season well underway, the hype machine is operating at full throttle. But few products, if any, can compete with such fanfare. On the runway, the red carpet and beyond, culture is at risk of being subsumed by the sound and the fury, the hype and the buzz, of its own promotion.
Fashion houses seemingly no longer hire creative directors for their design skills or aesthetic vision but for their marketing prowess. "The marketing guys frankly have invaded the companies," Sidney Toledano, the former chief executive of Dior, said recently. This explains why there is less creativity on the runway and the most high-profile appointment in fashion last year was the rapper and music producer Pharrell Williams. In June, Mr. Williams presented his first men's wear collection for Louis Vuitton, which, while confident and commercial, lacked "any new shapes, or ways of addressing the body, or thinking about luxury," as the fashion critic Cathy Horyn put it. For Louis Vuitton, however, the show was an unqualified success: The star-studded spectacle attracted over a billion online views.
Marketing is nothing new, whether it's deployed to promote consumer goods or creative works. First came the product, then the persuasion. But now the hype often precedes and overwhelms the product, to the point that the product seems almost irrelevant to its own success. "We have long moved beyond fabricating and selling products," said Louis Vuitton's chief executive, Pietro Beccari, contending that "fashion is becoming music, becoming pop culture, becoming a spectacle itself."
"Barbie," the top-grossing film of 2023, with nearly $ 1.5 billion in ticket revenues, was a sensation even before it opened in theaters. Its ubiquitous marketing campaign cost an estimated $ 150 million, more than its $ 145 million production budget. (In comparison, marketing across sectors averaged 10.6 percent of company budgets in 2023, according to a major industry survey.) Somewhere along the way, Barbiemania took on a life of its own, spawning countless social media memes and hundreds of items of bright pink merchandise. "It stopped becoming a marketing campaign and took on the quality of a movement," said the Warner Bros. president of global marketing, Josh Goldstine.
Mr. Goldstine's comment points to a new and expanded promotional terrain. Marketing campaigns provide the spark, but the news media kindles the conversation. By publishing articles about buzzy cultural offerings, the media responds to public interest, but also its own incentives: More clicks, views and engagement for sites and platforms. Performance metrics have laid bare the advantages of covering popular content. Social media works in tandem with these other promotional channels to reinforce the scale and scope of the phenomenon. Consider "Saltburn," which, despite its lukewarm critical reception, has become "the most talked-about film of awards season" thanks to TikTok, where "Saltburn"-related videos have netted almost four billion views.
As the chatter builds online and off, a self-perpetuating cycle takes hold: The campaign provides an occasion for press coverage; news articles fuel social media activity; viral excitement leads to more news and more posts, snowballing into a giddy and unstoppable "movement." The chatter coalesces into an autonomous phenomenon, a meta-subject that is itself dissected and discussed, making the publicists of stars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé famous in their own right.
In the 1990s, before the explosion of the internet, consumers had grown jaded about marketing and its methods, which they found manipulative. To influence this media-literate group, campaigns had to become subtler and cleverer. The internet gave advertisers even more opportunity to make ads that didn't look like ads. But the rise of social media has taken this one step further: Consumers have become active participants in the marketing of culture, posting and sharing content that is effectively promotional, even if not intended as such. (The "Saltburn"-inspired reaction memes, dance videos, cocktail recipes and scented candles that went viral on TikTok before getting picked up by the press are cases in point.) Rather than cajole or badger, campaigns now invite consumers to join the conversation. They've recognized that anyone can amplify their message, whether through social media, traditional media or brand partnerships. It's the ultimate soft sell.
Promotional movements have become as impressive as the products themselves, perhaps even more so. "Just as perfection only exists as an ideal never quite made flesh," Whizy Kim wrote of "Barbie" for Vox, "Greta Gerwig's desperately anticipated film based on the blonde plastic doll will necessarily disappoint some when the fantasy of its stunning promotion gives way to the reality of seeing the actual movie." There have always been runaway hits, such as "Titanic" and "Gangnam Style," but the product now seems strangely more like the beneficiary than the source of its promotional allure.
A video ad for the Christie's 2017 "Salvator Mundi" auction might be an allegory for our time. Titled "The Last da Vinci: The World Is Watching," the video never shows the actual painting but rather the misty-eyed, mouth-agape reactions of viewers, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Patti Smith. While the work had been dogged by questions about its condition and attribution, it overcame the issues raised by critics to become the most expensive artwork ever sold, fetching $ 450.3 million -- a result that was deemed "a triumph for the dark art of marketing." "Why Would Anyone Pay $ 450 Million for the 'Salvator Mundi'?" an Artnet News headline asked, and answered: "Because They're Not Buying the Painting."
More cultural industries are prioritizing promotion over product as their traditional businesses arrive at impasses and breaking points. Some industries have faced declining profits, including music and film, where digital distribution has undermined long established revenue streams. Others have reached record heights, as in the case of luxury fashion, where megabrands have grown so large that a slowdown feels inevitable. Whether victims of changing business models or of their own success, these industries have come to view their core products with a degree of pessimism: Can they continue to deliver?
Marketing, on the other hand, confronts none of these inherent limits. In the best-case scenario, promotional efforts strike gold and trigger a popular craze, a mass movement. Today's cultural phenomena, from "Barbie" to Taylor Swift, have approached a kind of sublime, with earnings that defy comprehension and fans so rapturous their cheers have caused seismic activity. But it is not just the cultural industries that benefit. For audiences, too, promotion adds value. Just as the crowd at the "Salvator Mundi" auction "gasped and whooped" at the artwork's winning bid, we applaud the spectacle of success. It becomes a sufficient reason in itself to consume culture.
This stands in stark contrast with the '90s, when consumers viewed marketing with suspicion and rebuked artists for going mainstream. The idea of selling out spoke to us because we encountered art in private. Discovering that something which had resonated with us so deeply was in fact a product of mass appeal brought with it a sense of betrayal. But today we venerate what is popular. We recognize that we are one in an army of consumers, and this knowledge conditions our experience of culture. In commercially successful art we find a sense of belonging. We take part in something larger than ourselves. We join the conversation. We become culturally conversant and delight in shared references. We like and comment and win public approbation. If art is a means to an end for others, why not for us, too?

Full text: Is it gauche to wear more than one ring on a hand? And once I have rings on the ring finger, what's next? Are there any ring etiquette rules? How do I make it not look tacky?
Beth, Brooklyn When Ariana Greenblatt, the 16-year-old "Barbie" actress, made her red carpet debut at the Golden Globes this month, she did so in a plain white Saint Laurent tuxedo shirt, black trousers and about 10 Chopard diamond rings, one on every finger. And she wasn't the only attendee so adorned.
The jewelry designer Irene Neuwirth, also at the Globes, stacked up seven of her pearl rings on both hands to go with her white Christy Rilling dress. "There's something a little lawless about wearing a lot of rings," she said when I asked.
Other ring aficionados include Johnny Depp, the former Gucci designer Alessandro Michele and the Dior designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, all of whom like to load on the finger jewelry, and all of whom underscore the point that there are no actual rules when it comes to how many rings you can wear at once or on what fingers you should wear them.
Still, there are certain considerations that should be taken into account. Our hands play key roles in how we interface with the world, and what we put on them matters.
On the one hand, said Rachel Garrahan, the project curator of jewelry at the Victoria and Albert Museum, "The pleasure of wearing a ring, unlike other forms of jewelry, is that the wearer gets to enjoy it as much as everyone else." Just look down at your hand when you want a shot of joy, or boost of confidence, she said. And if one ring does that, imagine what more could do.
Indeed, wearing rings you love can inspire, almost reflexively, a different, more dramatic way of speaking. One that involves a lot more gesticulating than, perhaps, has become customary.
On the other hand, a gaggle of rings can also associate you in the eye of the beholder with various aesthetic traditions -- goth, new romantics, heavy metal -- that themselves connect to specific stereotypes. So you should be prepared for the subconscious judgments that may ensue.
There are also practical considerations, Ms. Garrahan noted that what she called "prong-set gemstones" can snag on fine gauge knits. Stones like emeralds and opals are famously soft, so not practical for everyday wear.
The key to wearing them well is balance -- in jewelry, as in all things.
Ms. Neuwirth, for example, wore earrings with her rings but not bracelets or a big necklace. Ms. Greenblatt wore a few simple necklaces and only small studs. Both women kept their clothes minimal.
It's the contrast between grandeur and simplicity that is modern. If your hands are your focal points, you don't want the rest of your outfit competing for attention. That becomes less a statement than a screed.

Looks That Really Caught Our Eye: [Style Desk]

Full text: This year's revamped Golden Globe Awards brought several changes to the program. But it was business as usual on the red carpet, with hundreds of celebrities seemingly relishing the chance to give us something to ogle after last year's strikes stopped many from posing for cameras at award shows and events.
There were ball gowns. There were sequins. There was lots of red -- crimson dresses, candy apple heels, oxblood tuxedos -- with dashes of "Barbie" pink and the color purple.
Aside from maybe Jason Sudeikis, who wore a crew-neck sweater that Styles reporter Jessica Testa said induced "flashbacks to him wearing a hoodie during the awards show-by-Zoom days," almost everyone looked elegant. The 20 people on this list, however, managed to stand out just a little more than others.
Margot Robbie: Most Forever Barbie!
The actress, who wore outfits inspired by the doll's clothes for much of the "Barbie" press tour, continued that streak with a hot-pink Armani Privé gown and a tulle boa that resembled a loofah. The look was inspired by the Superstar Barbie toy.
Jeremy Allen White: Most Freshly Covered Up!
The actor, a star of "The Bear," wore a wide-lapel Calvin Klein suit over a sheer shirt. No items from his recent, nearly naked underwear campaign for Calvin Klein were included, as far as we know.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph: Most Birth of Venus!
The "The Holdovers" actress evoked a modern-day goddess in a maroon Rodarte gown with a sequined shell-style bra that channeled Botticelli's painting.
Hunter Schafer: Most Wispy!
As the actress, who attended the ceremony as a presenter, walked the carpet, her gauzy Prada gown billowed behind her. The look was equal parts eerie and captivating.
Charles Melton: Most Throwback Glamour!
The "May December" actor went with classic formal wear -- specifically, a sharp, double-breasted Armani suit in navy blue, which he accessorized with a watch that had a like-colored face.
Ali Wong: Most 20-20 Vision!
The "Beef" star's white Dior gown had an elegant braided shoulder and it draped beautifully. But her signature eyewear was what made the look sing.
Issa Rae: Most Oscar!
A glittering, floor-length Pamella Roland gown made the actress, a star of "Barbie" and "American Fiction," look a little like the statuette from the Academy Awards. Her glowing complexion enhanced the likeness.
Gillian Anderson: Most Anatomical!
The actress nodded to her role on "Sex Education" in a strapless Gabriela Hearst ball gown featuring dozens of subtly embroidered vulvas (she called them vaginas).
Colman Domingo: Most Embellished!
Two statement brooches added some sparkle to the slim Louis Vuitton suit worn by the actor, a star of "The Color Purple" and "Rustin." A pearl earring dangling from one ear upped the ante.
Florence Pugh: Most Peek-a-Boo!
The actress, a presenter at the ceremony and a star of "Oppenheimer," continued her streak of wearing sheer fabrics with a gauzy Valentino gown that showed some skin beneath its floral appliqués.
Cillian Murphy: Most Lydia Tár!
It looked as if the "Oppenheimer" star had stepped off the set of a different movie ("Maestro") when he arrived on the carpet in a black standing-collar suit and white pleated shirt.
Ayo Edebiri: Most Cherry Lip Balm!
The "The Bear" actress's strapless Prada tube dress might have been the freshest red number of the night. Helping the look pop were a sheer train and a sleek bob hairstyle.
Celine Song: Most Sewn Up!
Sticking through the waistband of the "Past Lives" director's Loewe skirt was a two-foot silver needle. The look, like her film, was understated and had the potential to draw tears.
Barry Keoghan: Most Checkered!
A pearl necklace and belt chain spiced up the "Saltburn" actor's Louis Vuitton jacket and pants -- and helped hide the fact that their prints didn't exactly match.
Billie Eilish: Most Gen Z!
The singer looked thrift-store chic in a boxy Willy Chavarria blazer, a khaki skirt and Mary Janes with socks a similar color to her bangs. She accessorized the outfit by tying a black ribbon from a birthday gift around her neck.
Oprah: Most Literal!
Was her purple Louis Vuitton gown about as surprising as florals for spring? Yes. (Oprah is an executive producer of "The Color Purple.") Did she look regal in the off-the-shoulder, sequined dress? Also yes.
Timothée Chalamet: Most Rock Star!
The actor traded "Wonka" purple for a sparkly black Celine Homme blazer that dazzled with each flash of a camera. His somewhat-buttoned shirt was a departure for someone who often opts not to wear one on the red carpet.
Rosamund Pike: Most Addams Family!
During a preshow interview with Variety, the "Saltburn" actress described her look -- a black tea-length Dior dress with a dramatic, lace veil covering her face -- as having a "weird funeral vibe." In the interview, the actress said that she had a skiing accident this winter and chose to wear the facial covering because she was concerned her injuries would not heal before the awards.
Taylor Swift: Most Mermaid!
Though the singer's "Eras Tour" film was nominated for a Golden Globe, her Gucci gown covered in sparkling chartreuse sequins seemed to be screaming "Reputation" about as loudly as possible.
Ryan Gosling: Most Ken!
She's everything, he's just ... an actor wearing Gucci.

Full text: Lily Gladstone made history, Jo Koy did not. And dressing on a theme proved a hit. These were just some of the highs and lows.
The Golden Globes had a lot to prove Sunday night. It was the award show's return to a primo broadcast time slot after a series of scandals over finances and lack of diversity upended what used to be known as the biggest party of the year in Hollywood. Now privately owned with a greatly expanded pool of voters, the Globes were making a bid for relevance. Did that bid succeed? Well, it helped that this was the first major televised ceremony since the writers' and actors' strikes brought Hollywood to a halt, and stars and studios looking to goose their Oscar chances turned out after some skipped last year's event. Then again, this wasn't the liveliest show. Here are the highs and lows as we saw them.
Most Historic Win: Lily Gladstone
In a momentous triumph, Lily Gladstone became the first Indigenous person to win a Golden Globe for best actress, for her turn in "Killers of the Flower Moon" as an Osage woman whose family members are killed in a plot to take their fortune. Gladstone, whose background is Blackfeet and Nez Perce, was only the second Native actress to receive recognition from the Globes: Irene Bedard was nominated in 1995 for "Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee," a television movie.
After receiving a standing ovation, an overcome Gladstone spoke a few lines in the Blackfeet language, "the beautiful community nation that raised me, that encouraged me to keep going, keep doing this," she explained in English.
"I'm so grateful that I can speak even a little bit of my language," she added later, "because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera." She dedicated the award to "every little rez kid" who had a dream. -- Esther Zuckerman
Least Suspenseful Rivalry: 'Oppenheimer' vs. 'Barbie'
In the end, the great "Barbenheimer" face-off was a complete fizzle. "Oppenheimer," with eight nominations, won five trophies -- best drama, director, actor, supporting actor and score. After sitting on the sidelines for most of the night, "Barbie," the ceremony's most-nominated film, with nine nods, finally got in the game with a win in the rather meaningless category of best blockbuster ("cinematic and box office achievement"). "Barbie" got a second prize in the form of best song, which was kind of a no-brainer because the film's tunes filled three of the category's six slots. Time to rev up that Oscar campaign, Babs! -- Brooks Barnes
Best Looks: Stars Dressing on a Theme
Just in case anyone forgot about the "Barbie" effect of last year, which turned entire crowds pink, Margot Robbie managed to out-"Barbie" her own red carpets past in a sequined slither of hot pink Armani paired with a bristling pink tulle boa, all of it inspired by the 1977 Superstar Barbie.
As it turned out, however, that was just the beginning of the on-theme dressing. Oprah Winfrey wore Louis Vuitton in the color purple, in honor of -- you guessed it -- "The Color Purple," for which she served as a producer. And Taylor Swift wore glimmering Gucci in the sort of bright leafy shade that evoked nothing so much as the color of money and made it impossible to forget just how much green her Eras Tour has generated.
Together they made for a more interesting trend than the traditional strapless frocks that also proliferated. (The best of those being Elle Fanning's vintage Balmain and Rosamund Pike's not-quite-vintage 2019 Dior: If you're going to go with the classics, might as well go back to the source.) And the theme dressing added a new dimension to the brand-marketing machine that the red carpet has become. -- Vanessa Friedman
Flattest Monologue: Jo Koy
I had high hopes for Jo Koy, the 52-year-old Filipino American comedian who is only the second Asian American to host the Golden Globes. (Sandra Oh was the first, in 2019.) But Koy's opening monologue felt like a highlight reel of mortifying moments. From a weird joke about being attracted to a plastic Barbie to one about the "Killers of the Flower Moon" filmmakers stealing the plot, Koy's jokes met an icy reception from the audience. To be fair, he had barely any time to prepare. "I got the gig 10 days ago!" he said from the stage. "You want a perfect monologue?" It's a shame, but Koy's jokes will probably end up being best remembered for the memes they inspire on social media. -- Christopher Kuo
Flattest Joke: Koy Riffing on Taylor Swift
Why you gotta be so mean? The host's jokes did not really improve as the night went on.
"We came on after a football doubleheader," Koy said as the ceremony returned from its first commercial break. "The big difference between the Golden Globes and the N.F.L.? On the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift."
Koy seemed to swallow the word "camera" as he said it. And when the actual camera, on cue, panned to Swift, she appeared deeply unamused, her lips pursed, her eyes stern as she sipped a drink.
It is true that Swift has been shown many, many times on N.F.L. telecasts since she began showing up at Kansas City Chiefs games to cheer on the team's tight end, Travis Kelce.
But Koy's joke, at the expense of perhaps the most famous person in a room full of famous people, fell flat again. So flat, that he muttered, "Sorry about that." -- Matt Stevens
Best Speech With a Twist: Steven Yeun
The most entertaining speeches take us on a ride. That's what Steven Yeun did when he won for actor in a limited series for his role in "Beef." He started out with a serious and vulnerable tone, saying, "The story I usually tell of myself to myself is one of isolation and, like, separateness." But then he threw in a twist, saying that once he climbed onto the stage he realized that -- wait, that inner monologue "feels a lot like the plot to 'Frozen."' It was unexpected yet heartfelt, a joke for his daughter. -- Brooks Barnes
Best Speeches With a Dose of Honesty: Kieran Culkin and Robert Downey Jr.
Awards show speeches tend to be mash-ups of gushing adjectives meant to communicate maximum gratitude -- "amazings" and "incredibles" aplenty -- but a couple of actors were refreshingly measured in their delight. This isn't the Oscars, after all. Winning for his role as Roman Roy in "Succession," Kieran Culkin told the audience, simply, "This is a nice moment for me." And when Robert Downey Jr. stepped up to the microphone, he deflected applause for his supporting performance in "Oppenheimer" by addressing the prescription medication powering his nonchalance onstage: "Yeah, yeah, I took a beta blocker," he said, "so this is going to be a breeze." -- Julia Jacobs
Biggest Upset: Best Screenplay for 'Anatomy of a Fall'
The previous group of Golden Globe voters could always be counted on to give us a few unpredictable wins, and though they weren't always welcome swerves, they at least lent the night a charge of anything-could-happen frisson. That feeling was hard to come by this year, thanks to a series of respectable, safe choices, though the unexpected triumph of "Anatomy of a Fall" in the screenplay category certainly woke up the ballroom: In years past, Globe voters almost certainly would have chosen a starrier pick like "Barbie" or "Oppenheimer," and it was fun to get a worthy upset. -- Kyle Buchanan
Worst Award: The Cinematic and Box Office Achievement Globe
The Globes added a new box-office trophy this year, with nominees required to have earned at least $ 150 million (or, as the guidelines put it, "commensurate digital streaming viewership"). The whole thing is a little silly, especially in a year in which two huge hits -- "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" -- were also popular with critics and nominated for many awards. Is it an effort to revive the academy's widely derided attempt to add a best popular film category to the Oscars? Or just to get more A-listers in the room (including, yes, Taylor Swift)?
Entertainment plaudits are basically made up of vibes and campaigning, meant to create heated discussions. But if there's anything in movies that's impossible to argue with, it's box office receipts and clicks. So what was the undisputed biggest box office achievement in 2023? "Barbie." Who won this new Globe? "Barbie." Who else could it have been? -- Alissa Wilkinson
Best Writers' Revenge: A Script 'Written' by Studio Executives
Perhaps as an ode to the recently settled Hollywood writers' strike, the presenters Daniel Kaluuya, Hailee Steinfeld and Shameik Moore announced they would introduce the best screenplay nominees with words written by studio executives -- although given the dry, stilted language, the script may well have been generated by ChatGPT.
"I am relatable," Steinfeld intoned. "I am enjoy the Golden Globes."
"I do agree," Moore said.
"As do I," Kaluuya agreed.
At least the "executives" generated a few laughs.
-- Jonathan Abrams
Least Satisfying Reunion: 'Suits'
What is a "Suits" reunion without Meghan Markle? The law-firm drama that has found unprecedented success on Netflix more than a decade after its debut deserved a moment in the sun just for the sheer number of viewers it accrued in recent months. And I'm sure the actors Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Gina Torres and Sarah Rafferty were thrilled to present the award for best drama series. But where was Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who was a star of the show and played a key character? She doesn't live very far from the Beverly Hilton, where the ceremony was held. "Suits" fans had to be thrilled that their beloved cast was alive and well, but without Meghan, can you really call it a reunion? -- Nicole Sperling
Most Improved Angle: Shots of the Audience Behind the Presenters
Keeping things interesting visually during an awards show can be a challenging task. Talking heads. Nominees. Award. Speech. Rinse. Repeat. But on Sunday night, the producers mixed it up by pulling a simple reversal and shooting some of the presenters with the audience in the background. It changed the feel while allowing us at home to peek behind some of the presenters during the more boring banter to check out the celebrities behind them. Who's paying attention? Who can't be bothered? One drawback was that the lighting didn't always favor the presenters at these varying angles. But overall, it felt fun and gave a little jolt to the proceedings. -- Mekado Murphy
Most Surprising (Apparent) Spoiler: 'Anatomy of a Fall'
"Anatomy of a Fall" took home two Globes for its taut dissection of the frictions in a marriage, exposed when a wife is put on trial and accused of pushing her husband to his death at their home in the French Alps. Under the scrutiny of a court and the couple's preteen son, Sandra (Sandra Hüller), defends herself as viewers are left to plumb the evidence for signs of whether her husband's death resulted from an assault, an accidental fall or his own leaping.
But as she accepted the award for best screenplay for the film, written with her husband, Arthur Harari, Justine Triet maybe revealed what her script did not. Describing their thinking when they completed the script, she said: "OK we are having a lot of fun but it's radical and dark, nobody's going to see this movie. It's too long, they talk all the time, there's no score -- a couple fighting, suicide, a dog vomiting. I mean, come on." The (accidental?) disclosure of the manner of death seemed out of step for one of the creators of a film so meticulously built to leave audiences guessing. -- Elena Bergeron
Best and Worst Reinvention: The Globes Themselves
With the Globes trying to claw their way to semi-legitimacy, this was a perfectly reasonable attempt, but it all felt perfunctory.
High: Intro segments tend toward the cringey at every awards show, and there were plenty of awkward moments here, too, but there were some bright spots: Keri Russell and Ray Romano's fun repartee, Andra Day and Jon Batiste's giggly banter and especially Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell's goofy dance bit. Ferrell's signature outburst -- "The Golden Globes have not changed!" -- was probably the biggest laugh of the night.
Low: Kind of everything? The whole ceremony had sort of a blah energy. The speeches were all fine, but none was especially wild. The biggest shock came when the broadcast included what sounded like glasses clattering to the floor. -- Margaret Lyons

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Next month, over 100 works by Black art stars from the couple's collection will travel to the Great Hall for "Giants."
Call it an embarrassment of riches: The musician Alicia Keys and her husband Kasseem Dean, the producer and D.J. known professionally as Swizz Beatz, have purchased such massive artworks that only a few could squeeze inside their homes in California, New York and New Jersey. Some colossal paintings by artists like Kehinde Wiley, Derrick Adams and Titus Kaphar eventually got through the door and became staples of the couple's daily routine -- backdrops to movie nights and family parties.
"We have never seen all these artworks in one room," Keys said in a recent interview. That will change on Feb. 10 when monumental artworks from their collection star in a major exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum's Great Hall.
Called "Giants: Art from the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys," the show, by dint of its location, endorses the couple as leading collectors of Black artists, though the obvious draw of their own star power cannot be denied. Keys is a Grammy Award-winning singer with a musical, "Hell's Kitchen," headed to Broadway this spring and Dean has produced hits with performers like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and DMX.
"There is great brand recognition with the Deans," said Kimberli Gant, a curator of modern and contemporary art who helped organize the exhibition of more than 100 artworks and was involved in the museum's recent Spike Lee show. "People love Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys, but they don't know them as collectors."
Dean started collecting as a teenager in the 1990s, when he bought an Ansel Adams photograph with proceeds from his first records with DMX. But the size and scale of his acquisitions of market favorites has grown since then. Five years ago, he estimated that there were about 400 pieces in his collection; now, he says, that number is in the thousands. Recent purchases include a 2018 Derrick Adams painting, "Floater 74," which will be on view at the exhibition. The 25-foot-long picture of Black figures relaxing in a pool used to hang in the couple's living room, creating a blue horizon dotted by inflatable flamingos and other pool toys above a dining area and sectional sofa.
"The reason why we doubled down on African American art is because people weren't collecting it," Dean said, explaining that it was difficult breaking into the market at first. The art world is built on relationships and few major auction houses or galleries catered to Black clientele.
"Things flow a little better now," Dean added, noting the increased diversity of artists exhibited at auctions and fairs. "I definitely see changes being made, but we as collectors must take responsibility to shape the market."
The rate of his acquisitions increased when he joined the Brooklyn Museum board in 2019 after the museum's director, Anne Pasternak, recruited him.
"I watched as they developed a collection with real passion," Pasternak recalled in an interview. "I used to go to galleries with them and see them at art fairs."
The couple said they are preparing to donate several works from their collection to the museum but declined to name exactly which or how many works will become gifts, saying the list is being finalized. Pasternak said her personal favorites included a diptych by Amy Sherald, panel paintings by Meleko Mokgosi and photographs by Gordon Parks.
Planning for the Brooklyn Museum exhibition started in 2022; Dean resigned late last year from the museum board to avoid the appearance of any conflict. "It was the right thing to do because we wanted to keep focus on the show," he said.
Nonprofit museums often rely on wealthy trustees to lend cash and clout to their institutions, but conflict-of-interest rules typically prevent those board members from financially benefiting from that relationship.
"It looks like the Brooklyn Museum is trying to avoid an appearance of conflict," said Sally M. Yerkovich, chair of the ethics committee of the International Council of Museums, who is currently leading revisions of the council's ethics code. "As a trustee, the primary focus should be on benefiting the museum, not the trustee personally." Displaying the collections of board members on the museum walls is generally frowned upon, Yerkovich said, explaining that artworks displayed at museums often gain higher financial value in the secondary market.
Dean said that the couple was neither financing the show nor intending to sell anything on view.
For the last two decades, some critics have accused the Brooklyn Museum of staging populist exhibitions that are thin on scholarship, starting with its 2002 "Star Wars" spectacle, which the New York Times critic Michael Kimmelman described as "a quick, temporary means to make headlines, boost attendance figures and raise cash."
More recently, the museum has produced or borrowed well-received shows about the musician David Bowie, "Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams" and "African Fashion" along with memoirist entertainments like the filmmaker Spike Lee's "Creative Sources." It defended to the hilt allowing the comedian Hannah Gadsby to help curate what became a highly controversial Picasso exhibition. In 2024, the museum is preparing to announce "Eyes of the Storm," an exhibition of photography by Paul McCartney from the Beatles' era. It is currently at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Va.
Pasternak defended the museum's programming. "I recognize that some are cynical about our efforts," Pasternak said. "Doing things by the book has never been what works for us. And as long as we do it with real rigor and care, I think it is important to continue experimenting."
"People make a big deal about those celebrity names, but I see them as people who are adding to culture in a significant way," the director explained. "For people who are not interested, we have five floors of our extraordinary galleries and permanent collection."
If visitors come to satisfy their curiosity about what kind of art two of the world's most popular musicians collect, pay the $ 25 special exhibition fee and stay because of the Dean collection's strengths, then the show will have been a success, Pasternak said.
"As artists themselves, Alicia and Swizz are focused on showing the synergy between musicians and visual artists who are trying to make change in the world through forms of creative expression," Gant, the curator, said.
Even frequent museumgoers would be surprised by the collection, Gant said, pointing to rare landscapes -- 14 of them -- by the portrait artist Barkley L. Hendricks and a tire sculpture by the video-maker Arthur Jafa. Other works -- including a glittering installation by Ebony G. Patterson and four sexually charged scenes by Nina Chanel Abney -- pop with color.
"I think that people are going to be very taken with what they see," Keys said, adding that her mantra when collecting art has always been: "by the artists, for the artists, with the people."

Full text: This season promises a deluge of big stars (Nicole Kidman, Kate Winslet), intriguing adaptations ("Avatar: The Last Airbender"), long-awaited returns ("True Detective") and final goodbyes ("Curb Your Enthusiasm").
Is it a delayed effect of the writers' and actors' strikes? The Year of the Dragon? Climate change? Whatever the reason, a paper-thin fall season on television screens (definitely a result of the strikes) is being followed by a deluge of attention-grabbing shows this winter. A-list stars (Jodie Foster, Nicole Kidman, Kate Winslet), intriguing adaptations and reboots ("3 Body Problem," "Avatar: The Last Airbender"), long-awaited returns (welcome back, "True Detective") and final goodbyes (so long, "Curb Your Enthusiasm") abound. Throw in all the delayed broadcast-network premieres -- your various "Chicago," "FBI," "NCIS" and "Law and Order" series, among others -- and it promises to be exhausting.
Here, based on available screeners, track record or sheer star power, are 30 of the more interesting selections, arranged in chronological order. All dates are subject to change.
'One Piece'
Episode 1,089 of the 25-year-old pirate-adventure anime marks the beginning of what is being called its Final Saga, but there's no telling how many more hundreds of episodes that might entail. (Crunchyroll, Jan. 6)
'Funny Woman'
The actress ("Skins") and writer ("Slow Horses") Morwenna Banks adapted this six-episode drama from the Nick Hornby novel "Funny Girl." Gemma Arterton plays a woman who leaves behind her life as a beauty queen in 1960s Blackpool, England, to move to London for a career in TV comedy. (PBS, Jan. 7)
'Miss Scarlet and the Duke'
No one is currently doing the self-centered, self-righteous -- but charming! -- force of nature better than Kate Phillips, now in her fourth season as Eliza Scarlet, who is still struggling to succeed as a female detective in Victorian London. (PBS, Jan. 7)
'Criminal Record'
Peter Capaldi and Cush Jumbo headline this dark London-set police thriller, while Cathy Tyson, star of the great British neo-noir "Mona Lisa," lends gravitas as the mother of a man who may have been unjustly imprisoned. (Apple TV+, Jan. 10)
'Bluey'
Your long parental nightmare is over, at least for a few hours: Everyone's favorite family of talking Australian dogs drops 10 new episodes. (Disney+, Jan. 12)
'Belgravia: The Next Chapter'
Helen Edmundson, chief writer of the quite decent British mystery "Dalgliesh," takes over Julian Fellowes's Georgian-Victorian, upstairs-downstairs melodrama "Belgravia." This second season picks up several decades after the first and centers on the son who caused such consternation in the original, now grown into Lord Trenchard (Benjamin Wainwright). (MGM+, Jan. 14)
'True Detective: Night Country'
HBO's horror noir returns after a five-year hiatus. Season 4 enters the arctic-derangement territory of "Fortitude," "The Terror" and "The Thing," as the crew of an Alaska research station collectively disappears into the 24-hour darkness. Jodie Foster plays the series's latest angsty cop. (HBO, Jan. 14)
'Death and Other Details'
Mandy Patinkin stars as the professed "world's greatest detective" in a shipboard mystery-comedy that appears to triangulate among "Only Murders in the Building," "White Lotus" and Hercule Poirot. (Hulu, Jan. 16)
'The Shift'
The talented Danish director Lone Scherfig ("An Education") created and is the showrunner of this hospital drama about a team of midwives whose high performance masks critical understaffing; the Danish title translates as "Day and Night." Sofie Grabol of "The Killing" plays the chief midwife. (MHz Choice, Jan. 16)
'Sort Of'
Bilal Baig's loosely autobiographical, Toronto-set series is known for its head-on but nonchalant approach to gender and identity. It has reached a third season -- in which Baig's character, Sabi, deals with the fallout from their father's death and their boss's longings -- because it nails the very particular texture of the Canadian dramedy: muted, expertly paced, earnestly whimsical, polished in the most nonaggressive way possible. (Max, Jan. 18)
'The Woman in the Wall'
Ruth Wilson brings her layered, off-kilter intensity to this thriller involving an Irish woman who has not recovered from her encounter with one of the country's notorious Magdalene asylums. Daryl McCormack of "Good Luck to You, Leo Grande" plays a cop investigating the murder of a priest. (Paramount+, Jan. 19; Showtime, Jan. 21)
'Griselda'
The life of the cocaine merchant Griselda Blanco gets the full-gloss treatment, with a striving-immigrant story line, lots of disco nostalgia and Sofia Vergara in the title role. (Netflix, Jan. 25)
'In the Know'
Mike Judge and Zach Woods, who worked together on "Silicon Valley," bring a similar strain of cerebral satire to the quirks and pretensions of public radio, except this time the unbearable egoists and patient enablers are portrayed by stop-motion puppets. Woods voices an NPR host with an undeniable physical resemblance to Ira Glass; his interview subjects are real people who appear on the animated studio's monitors. (Peacock, Jan. 25)
'Expats'
Janice Y.K. Lee's 2016 novel, "The Expatriates," about the lives of high-strung Americans living in Hong Kong, comes to TV as a series directed by Lulu Wang ("The Farewell") and starring Nicole Kidman as the perfect expat wife, Margaret, a bit of casting that feels inevitable. (Amazon Prime Video, Jan. 26)
'Hightown'
This engaging beach-town crime drama -- energetic but downbeat, in the general neighborhood of "Justified" -- enters its third and final season with the highly problematic fisheries agent Jackie Quinones (Monica Raymund) passed out on the Cape Cod sand after her latest blackout bender. (Starz, Jan. 26)
'Masters of the Air'
The producing team behind "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific" -- including Gary Goetzman, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg -- offers another salute to American forces in World War II, this time chronicling the crews of the 100th Bomb Group of the Army Air Force as they fly missions over Germany. Like its predecessors it has a large and not overly well-known cast, led by Austin Butler and Callum Turner. (Apple TV+, Jan. 26)
'Genius: MLK/X'
The fourth edition of the "Genius" series yokes together the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Malcolm X (Aaron Pierre), who crossed paths just once, so expect a lot of scene shifting. (National Geographic, Feb. 1)
'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'
Determined to keep us guessing, Donald Glover, working with the writer Francesca Sloane, follows up "Atlanta" and "Swarm" with a remake of the 2005 married-spies film that starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Glover and Maya Erskine, as John and Jane Smith, lead a promising cast that includes John Turturro, Michaela Coel, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Sharon Horgan and Parker Posey. (Amazon Prime Video, Feb. 2)
'Curb Your Enthusiasm'
The most recent season of Larry David's burlesque of Hollywood self-absorption was a pretty good argument for watching "Family Guy" at 10:30 on Sundays. But with more than two years to prepare for its 12th and final season, maybe the show can recapture some of its former glory. (HBO, Feb. 4)
'Gospel'
The indefatigable historian-impresario Henry Louis Gates Jr. follows up the 2021 documentary "The Black Church: This Is Our Story, This Is Our Song" with a four-hour history of gospel music, directed by Stacey L. Holman and Shayla Harris. (PBS, Feb. 12)
'The New Look'
Ben Mendelsohn, best known for dark crime dramas and thrillers ("Bloodline," "The Outsider") and for playing a shape-shifting alien in the Marvel universe, changes things up. He plays the post-World War II Christian Dior, about to revolutionize the fashion world, in a series from Todd A. Kessler, a creator of "Bloodline" and "Damages." Juliette Binoche co-stars as Dior's great competitor Coco Chanel. (Apple TV+, Feb. 14)
'Constellation'
Attention Jonathan Banks fans: With "Better Call Saul" kaput, the peerless character actor resurfaces in this science-fiction thriller. Noomi Rapace stars as an astronaut who returns to Earth after a bad trip. (Apple TV+, Feb. 21)
'Avatar: The Last Airbender'
Netflix turns an animated hit into a live-action show, as it did with the anime "Cowboy Bebop" and "One Piece." This time it transmutes the highly regarded American series about a young lama-like warrior fighting to bring about harmony among the nations of fire, water, earth and air. (Netflix, Feb. 22)
'The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy'
"Grey's Anatomy" meets "Rick and Morty" in an animated comedy set in an intergalactic hospital in the year 14,002; it is the first show created by Cirocco Dunlap, a writer on "Miracle Workers" and "Man Seeking Woman." Stephanie Hsu and Keke Palmer voice the young renegade surgeons Sleech and Klak. (Amazon Prime Video, Feb. 23)
'The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live'
Andrew Lincoln's Rick Grimes, the franchise's original alpha, and Danai Gurira's sword-wielding Michonne are revived in the seventh "Walking Dead" TV series. (AMC, Feb. 25)
'Shogun'
You could ask whose needs are being served by making another miniseries based on James Clavell's 1975 best seller, beyond those of whomever's digital pocket the film rights were burning a hole in. (Michaela Clavell, the novelist's daughter, is an executive producer.) But you can't argue with the chance to watch excellent Japanese performers like Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano and Fumi Nikaido. (FX, Feb. 27)
'Elsbeth'
Elsbeth Tascioni, the aggressively quirky lawyer played by Carrie Preston in "The Good Wife" and "The Good Fight," was a bit of an acquired taste. If you acquired it, Preston is now starring in a spinoff series also created by the generally reliable team of Michelle and Robert King. The premise is clever: Tascioni comes to New York to observe the police department as part of a consent decree (we're told the other candidate was Cary Agos, the "Good Fight" lawyer played by Matt Czuchry), setting up "Elsbeth" as more of a comic procedural than a legal drama. (CBS, Feb. 29)
'The Regime'
Will Tracy, a writer for "Succession" and "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver," cements his connection to HBO with this miniseries he created about the ruler of a fictional, failing Central European autocracy. Among the bonuses of that association: Kate Winslet as your star, Jessica Hobbs ("The Crown") and Stephen Frears as your directors and Gary Shteyngart as one of your writers. Andrea Riseborough plays the chancellor's chief minister, Hugh Grant the opposition leader and Martha Plimpton the American secretary of state. (HBO, March 3)
'Palm Royale'
Kristen Wiig stars as a woman campaigning to join 1969 Palm Beach society in a cheerfully mordant comedy from the writer and producer Abe Sylvia ("George & Tammy," "Dead to Me") that also boasts Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb, Laura Dern and Carol Burnett. (Apple TV+, March 20)
'3 Body Problem'
The producers of the blockbuster American fantasy series "Game of Thrones" adapt the blockbuster Chinese science-fiction novel "The Three-Body Problem," in some kind of apotheosis of the nerd-tech takeover of our storytelling culture. The trailer looks cool, though. (Netflix, March 21)
Other returning shows: "The Great North," Fox, Jan. 7; "All Creatures Great and Small," PBS, Jan. 7; "La Brea," NBC, Jan. 9; "SkyMed," Paramount+, Jan. 11; "The Traitors," Peacock, Jan. 12; "Family Law," CW, Jan. 17; "It Was Always Me," Disney+, Jan. 17; "Chicago Fire," "Chicago Med," "Chicago P.D.," NBC, Jan. 17; "Double Cross," AllBlk, Jan. 18; "Law & Order," "Law & Order: Organized Crime," "Law & Order: SVU," NBC, Jan. 18; "Real Time With Bill Maher," HBO, Jan. 19; "The Way Home," Hallmark, Jan. 21; "The Bachelor," ABC, Jan. 22; "Father Brown," BritBox, Jan. 23; "Abbott Elementary," "The Conners," "Not Dead Yet," ABC, Feb. 7; "Halo," Paramount+, Feb. 8; "Bob Hearts Abishola," "NCIS," "NCIS: Hawaii," "The Neighborhood," CBS, Feb. 12; "Ghosts," "So Help Me Todd," "Young Sheldon," CBS, Feb. 15; "Blue Bloods," "Fire Country," CBS, Feb. 16; "Life and Beth," Hulu, Feb. 16; "CSI: Vegas," "The Equalizer," CBS, Feb. 18; "The Good Doctor," "Will Trent," ABC, Feb. 20; "The Tourist," Netflix, Feb. 29; "BMF," Starz, March 1; "Alert: Missing Persons Unit," "The Cleaning Lady," Fox, March 5; "Animal Control," Fox, March 6; "Grey's Anatomy," ABC, March 14; "Girls5Eva," Netflix, March 14; "Call the Midwife," PBS, March 17; "Bridgerton," Netflix, May 16.

The Man Who Destroys Luxury Handbags: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under the handle Tanner Leatherstein, Volkan Yilmaz rips, burns and slices apart luxury goods to show how much he thinks they are really worth.
One video opens with a large white leather handbag covered in the signature LV logo of Louis Vuitton. Within milliseconds, a hand with a switchblade swoops in and slashes a huge gash in the side of the bag before tearing it apart at its seams. In another, the distinctive red sole of Christian Louboutin is loudly ripped from a black stiletto using a wrench; in still another, scissors snip through a $ 2,200 Prada clutch before a man sets fire to a piece of the leather and turns it to ash.
You've entered the TikTok world of Tanner Leatherstein, which has more than 950,000 followers. Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, has attracted a cult following on the social media platform -- as well as on YouTube and Instagram -- for his butchering of exorbitantly expensive items. The reason, he says, is to show his viewers the true quality of the materials and craftsmanship and then break down how much the item may have cost to make.
"In many cases," Mr. Yilmaz said from his Dallas workshop in December, "my estimates come in at about a tenth of what the price tag says. The markups that underpin the luxury business still shock a lot of people."
In the edited interview below, Mr. Yilmaz, 37, discussed his lifelong obsession with leather, how much he spends on luxury products for his platform and what people should look for when buying new leather items.
When did your love of leather goods begin?
My family owned a tannery in Turkey, so I was born into the business. Around 11, I tanned five sheepskins to make my first leather jacket. While at college in Istanbul, I worked at the tannery, then went to China to learn about leather imports and exports and then to Turkmenistan.
In 2009, I won the U.S. green card lottery and moved to Chicago. I drove a cab while I got an MBA from the University of Illinois, then worked as a management consultant, which made me feel like I was dying inside. I was still obsessed with leather, so I started my own leather brand called Pegai, teaching myself about the design side from YouTube and driving Uber jobs to make ends meet. In 2019, once the business was underway, I moved to Dallas.
Why did you start creating social media content?
Friends and even friends of friends have always asked me to check their leather purchases. What do I think of the quality? Have they paid too much?
It made me realize that people don't actually know that much about how leather is sourced or used and are suspicious about the markups on luxury leather products. So I started making some videos to answer their questions. I didn't expect them to blow up the way they have.
More than anything else, you are known for slicing up bags. Why do you do that?
When I started dissecting bags, I wanted to show that price really wasn't about the leather or the materials used -- that it was mostly about the status associated with a label. So many people automatically assume that if it's expensive, it must be good.
What was the first bag you ever cut up?
It was a Louis Vuitton briefcase. Louis Vuitton is one of the most famous leather brands in the world, but many people don't know that the iconic LV monogram material is actually canvas. The first video that went viral was a little $ 1,200 wallet from Chanel. From then on, requests to feature different brands have been rolling in nonstop.
What are you looking for when you slash a bag?
The leather quality, of course. How it has been tanned. I use acetone to remove the finish, and I can see how much plastic makeup has been applied to the leather. I burn the leather to assess what tanning process has been used. Then I look at the craftsmanship, which is reflected in the stitching, hardware and construction.
A big part of what I do is assessing the brand's claims. A bag might look good from the outside, but when you rip it open and look inside, it tells another story.
Who are the almost two million followers you have on social media?
There is definitely a demographic who hate luxury brands, full stop, who think the pricing is a scam and that people who pay for them are stupid. Then there are people who just love the entertainment value of chopping up expensive products. But many people are watching the videos because they love luxury and want a better understanding of quality products. They want to assess their luxury or vintage purchases with their eyes open.
Which brands are worth the money?
Bottega Veneta uses incredible leathers, and I've done three or four videos on their beautiful products. Though in one video -- on a $ 650 wallet -- I cut it up, and the lining was made from a lower quality leather than the one described on the label. (Bottega did not respond to a request for comment).
I really like a Scottish label called Strathberry. They make their products in Ubrique, which is this small town in Spain where brands like Loewe and Dior make their goods. But Strathberry is a fraction of the cost -- more like $ 500 instead of $ 3,000. Polene is another great label made by people who really know what they are doing. Coach is pretty good at a mid-price point.
Are you ever shocked by what you find?
I don't get positively shocked -- I'm paying a lot of money. Great if we can show a bag to be great material and design, but that should be the standard.
Do brands reach out to you now?
Not really, and especially not from the luxury space. I don't accept free items or advertising opportunities. People will trust me only if I stay totally independent.
Lots of people will have given or received leather goods during the holidays. Any tips for them?
Trust your senses. Feel it. If it feels plasticky, that's not a good sign. Smell it. There isn't only one leather smell, but there is a pleasant, slightly earthy aroma to quality leather. It should not smell like chemicals.
Look at it. Leather is an animal-sourced product. It has variations to its grain and fiber structure. The more variations you see in the fabric, the more natural and untreated it is. If it's overdone with a heavy finish, leather becomes very standardized and lower quality hides can be hidden.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Mad Max" gets a prequel, "The Wiz" returns to Broadway and Larry David gets another crack at a series finale.
The Met Looks to Right a Historic Wrong
Early in 1969, the Metropolitan Museum sparked an uproar with an exhibition called "Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968." Although conceived as the museum's first big-ticket acknowledgment of African American creativity, it included no visual art beyond documentary photomurals. Black artists, many working in Harlem just blocks north of the museum, angrily picketed the show, denouncing it as evidence of art world racism writ large.
As a student visiting New York in 1969 I saw, and was baffled by, that show, so I'm eager to see a new one that can only be viewed as a corrective to it, the marquee-scale survey of paintings, sculptures, photographs and films titled "The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism" scheduled to open at the Met in February. The announced inclusion of a wealth of African American art considered inadmissible to the Met half a century ago -- some represented by rarely seen loans from the collections of some of the country's historically Black colleges and universities -- is, on its own, an exciting prospect. And so is the exhibition's larger promise to fully position modern African American art not just as a local phenomenon, but as a generator of international modernism itself.
Furiosa Gets an Origin Story
This year brings a lot of sequels: "Inside Out 2," "Beetlejuice 2," "Joker: Folie à Deux," "Gladiator 2," "Dune: Part Two," plus new films in the "Quiet Place" and "Venom" and "Paddington" and "Godzilla" and even "Despicable Me" cinematic universes. I rarely get excited for non-original films, since most of them come off as naked cash grabs capitalizing on existing I.P. and risk-averse audiences. But I'm always curious if a sequel (or prequel or side-quel or whatever) will manage to be good, and the one I'm excited for is "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga." George Miller returns to direct an origin story for the character that Charlize Theron played in 2015's "Mad Max: Fury Road," with Anya Taylor-Joy in the Furiosa role. I love a dystopia, and few have exceeded the sheer adrenaline and dread of "Fury Road." I'm revisiting all the "Mad Max" movies in preparation.
Tom Hollander Tackles Truman Capote
Clive Owen as an aging Sam Spade on AMC's "Monsieur Spade" (Jan. 14), Helena Bonham Carter as the 1970s soap opera star Noele Gordon ("Nolly," PBS), Ben Mendelsohn and Juliette Binoche as Christian Dior and Coco Chanel ("The New Look," Apple TV+, Feb. 14) -- there may have never been a new TV year with so many intriguing bits of casting. But the one that has me the most curious is the wonderfully acidic British actor Tom Hollander playing Truman Capote in FX's "Feud: Capote vs. the Swans" (Jan. 31). Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny and Calista Flockhart play some of the society women Capote befriended and then used as material for his highly unflattering roman à clef "Answered Prayers"; if the thought of Hollander channeling Capote as he calls Happy Rockefeller "that fat-ankled harridan" turns you on, then you must tune in.
'The Wiz' Returns to Broadway
I tell everyone that my son Sidney is a musical theater kid. So naturally, his favorite movie is "The Wiz." And, of course, for his eighth birthday, we went to Baltimore, where the musical version first debuted in 1975, and its current tour started this past October. My parents even saw one of its 1,672 performances during its original four-year Broadway run, when it won seven Tonys, including best musical. Because I come from a family of avid "Wiz" fans, I find myself anticipating its return to Broadway this April at the Marquis Theater with more zeal than usual.
Based on L. Frank Baum's children's book "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and with an all-black cast, "The Wiz" is a cultural classic, so its revivals have to come with some powerful updates. Directed by Schele Williams with additional writing by Amber Ruffin, it now features Nichelle Lewis, whose TikTok audition landed her the role as Dorothy; a stirring Melody A. Betts as Aunt Em and Evillene; Kyle Ramar Freeman as the Lion, Phillip Johnson Richardson as the Tinman; Avery Wilson as the Scarecrow; and Deborah Cox as Glinda, with Wayne Brady returning to Broadway to play the Wiz. My sneak peek already has me excited about this dynamic cast, Hannah Beachler's ("Black Panther") kaleidoscopic set and the former Beyoncé choreographer JaQuel Knight's dance moves, especially when Dorothy and her squad of outsiders make their way to Emerald City.
A Double Dose of Itamar Moses
Talk about range: February brings to New York stages two exceedingly contrasting works by Itamar Moses, who previously wrote the book for "The Band's Visit." Feb. 15 through March 10, the Public Theater presents Lila Neugebauer's staging of "The Ally," starring Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor caught in the crossfire between wokeism and free speech when asked to sign a social justice manifesto. The topicality is off the charts.
Then, Feb. 28 through April 7 at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible reunites Moses with some of his "Band's Visit" collaborators for "Dead Outlaw." The musical, directed by David Cromer, with a book by Moses and songs by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, is about ... a mummy. Specifically, the mummy of a failed Old West gunslinger, used as a sideshow attraction for decades before the truth is discovered in a super-gross way. Spoiler alert -- I guess literally.

Stylish Spy Moves, Stacked Cast (and One Cat)
The concept at the center of "Argylle" -- a best-selling author discovers that what she writes comes true -- immediately reminds me of one of my favorite films, "Stranger Than Fiction." (I'm just a sucker for meta stories about the power of storytelling.) Starring Bryce Dallas Howard as a meek spy novelist whose words draw her into the dangerous world of espionage, "Argylle" (opening Feb. 2) is directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose devilishly stylish "Kingsman" franchise suggests he'll know just how to play to and satirize the spy movie genre. The cast is filled with actors who have taken on action roles but have also shown impressive comedic chops (Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson among them), while the cinematography looks to share the same sleek style Vaughn has made his signature. And an inconvenient, frazzled cat in a backpack? The cherry on top.
Larry David Does Another Finale
How in the world did Larry David do it? It's a question I've been hearing a lot lately. How did he make one of the funniest episodes of television ever out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? How did he tackle race, the Holocaust, Trump without getting in trouble? How did he make us care so much about these insufferable rich Hollywood types whining during their golf game? How did he manage the impossible feat of putting on 11 seasons of a show dominated by improvised small talk? The questions are rhetorical, of course, but everyone knows the answer. Larry David is really really (dare I say "pretty preeetty") good at what he does. So, his last season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm," which premieres Feb. 4, is a sad occasion. But it's also one of the few things on television that I will not tape but watch exactly when it airs. I don't know what the storylines of the next season will be, but here's one idea to consider: David has already written a much-anticipated finale, the one on "Seinfeld." I thought it was excellent. Many disagreed. Jerry Seinfeld has said onstage that he will be revisiting this finale in some form. Food for thought.
'Girls5eva' Hit the Road
When Season 2 of "Girls5eva" ended in 2022, my hopes for a renewal were slim; no Peacock original show has actually made it to a third season. But now it isn't a Peacock show anymore: There is a third season premiering March 14, but it will be on Netflix. Season 1 found the '90s girl group reuniting, and in Season 2 they put out their album. This season, they're heading out on tour, an experience for which they are not prepared. I am of course looking forward to the zingy jokes and warped nostalgia, but the even bigger wish is for another absolute banger that will join "Four Stars," "B.P.E." and "I'm Afraid" on my playlists.
Christmas in Spring at the Met
First things first: "El Niño" isn't an opera about weather patterns. In fact, while John Adams's energetic, eclectic two-hour score is opera-length, it's not exactly an opera at all. It's an oratorio, in the tradition of Handel's "Messiah," that tells the Nativity story without characters or naturalistic scenes. It's more of a reflection on the tale; the choral numbers and solos have their texts drawn from the Bible as well as from Latin American poetry, all sewn together by Adams and Peter Sellars.
First performed in 2000, the piece isn't always staged, but for its Metropolitan Opera premiere (April 23-May 17), the company is giving it a grand treatment. The production, directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz, boasts the conductor Marin Alsop, the soprano Julia Bullock, the bass-baritone Davóne Tines and the mezzo-soprano J'Nai Bridges -- inspired musical forces. It's a few months late for Christmas, but "El Niño" will be welcome nevertheless.
Brittany Howard Unveils Startling New Songs
Unbridled emotions, sonic ambitions and audacious singing have been the makings of Brittany Howard's songs since she arrived with Alabama Shakes in 2012. She's steeped in Southern soul and rock, and her voice has gospel-rooted power. But with Alabama Shakes and then on her 2019 solo album, "Jaime," Howard moved far beyond revivalism, pushing toward startling new hybrids; her co-producer, Shawn Everett, has also worked with SZA and Kacey Musgraves. Howard's second solo album, "What Now," is due Feb. 2, and its advance singles have plunged into the turbulence of a failing relationship, leaping between the percussive and the ethereal. The full album promises even more innovative ups and downs. Howard begins a North American tour on Feb. 6, with New York City shows Feb. 16 and 17 at Webster Hall.

The Met Looks to Right a Historic Wrong
Early in 1969, the Metropolitan Museum in New York City sparked an uproar with an exhibition called “Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968.” Though conceived as the museum’s first big-ticket acknowledgment of African American creativity, it included no visual art beyond documentary photomurals. Black artists, many working in Harlem just blocks north of the museum, angrily picketed the show, denouncing it as evidence of art world racism writ large.
As a student visiting New York in 1969, I saw, and was baffled by, that show, so I’m eager to see a new one that can only be viewed as a corrective to it, the marquee-scale survey of paintings, sculptures, photographs and films titled “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism” scheduled to open at the Met in February. The announced inclusion of a wealth of African American art considered inadmissible to the Met a half-century ago — some represented by rarely seen loans from the collections of some of the country’s historically Black colleges and universities — is, on its own, an exciting prospect. And so is the exhibition’s larger promise to fully position modern African American art not just as a local phenomenon, but as a generator of international modernism itself. — HOLLAND COTTER
Furiosa Gets an Origin Story
Next year brings a lot of sequels: “Inside Out 2,” “Beetlejuice 2,” “Joker: Folie à Deux,” “Gladiator 2,” “Dune: Part Two,” plus new films in the “Quiet Place” and “Venom” and “Paddington” and “Godzilla” and even “Despicable Me” cinematic universes. I rarely get excited for nonoriginal films, since most of them come off as naked cash grabs capitalizing on existing IP and risk-averse audiences. But I’m always curious if a sequel (or prequel or side-quel or whatever) will manage to be good, and the one I’m excited for is “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga .” George Miller returns to direct an origin story for the character that Charlize Theron played in 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road,” with Anya Taylor-Joy in the Furiosa role. I love a dystopia, and few have exceeded the sheer adrenaline and dread of “Fury Road.” I’m revisiting all the “Mad Max” movies in preparation. — ALISSA WILKINSON
Tom Hollander Tackles Truman Capote
Clive Owen as an aging Sam Spade on AMC’s “ Monsieur Spade ” (Jan. 14), Helena Bonham Carter as 1970s soap opera star Noele Gordon (“ Nolly ,” PBS), and Ben Mendelsohn and Juliette Binoche as Christian Dior and Coco Chanel ( “ The New Look ,” Apple TV+, Feb. 14) — there may have never been a new TV year with so many intriguing bits of casting. But the one that has me the most curious is wonderfully acidic British actor Tom Hollander playing Truman Capote in FX’s “ Feud: Capote vs. the Swans ” (Jan. 31). Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny and Calista Flockhart play some of the society women Capote befriended and then used as material for his highly unflattering roman a clef “Answered Prayers”; if the thought of Hollander channeling Capote as he calls Happy Rockefeller “that fat-ankled harridan” turns you on, then you must tune in. — MIKE HALE
‘The Wiz’ Returns to Broadway
I tell everyone that my son Sidney is a musical theater kid. So, naturally, his favorite movie is “The Wiz.” And, of course, for his eighth birthday, we went to Baltimore, where the musical version first debuted in 1975, and its current tour started this past October. My parents even saw one of its 1,672 performances during its original four-year Broadway run, when it won seven Tonys, including best musical. Because I come from a family of avid “Wiz” fans, I find myself anticipating its return to Broadway in April at the Marquis Theater with more zeal than usual.
Based on L. Frank Baum’s children’s book “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” and with an all-black cast, “ The Wiz ” is a cultural classic, so its revivals have to come with some powerful updates. Directed by Schele Williams with additional writing by Amber Ruffin, it now features Nichelle Lewis, whose TikTok audition landed her the role as Dorothy; a stirring Melody A. Betts as Aunt Em and Evillene; Kyle Ramar Freeman as the Lion; Phillip Johnson Richardson as the Tinman; Avery Wilson as the Scarecrow; Deborah Cox as Glinda; and Wayne Brady returning to Broadway to play Oz. My sneak peek already has me excited about this dynamic cast, Hannah Beachler’s (“Black Panther”) kaleidoscopic set and former Beyoncé choreographer JaQuel Knight’s dance moves, especially when Dorothy and her squad of outsiders make their way to Emerald City. — SALAMISHAH TILLET
A Double Dose of Itamar Moses
Talk about range: February brings to New York stages two exceedingly contrasting works by Itamar Moses, who previously wrote the book for “The Band’s Visit.” Feb. 15 through March 10, the Public Theater presents Lila Neugebauer’s staging of “ The Ally , ” starring Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor caught in the crossfire between wokeism and free speech when asked to sign a social justice manifesto. The topicality is off the charts.
Then, Feb. 28 through April 7 at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible reunites Moses with some of his “Band’s Visit” collaborators for “ Dead Outlaw . ” The musical, directed by David Cromer, with a book by Moses and songs by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, is about ... a mummy. Specifically, the mummy of a failed Old West gunslinger, used as a sideshow attraction for decades before the truth is discovered in a supergross way. Spoiler alert — I guess literally. — JESSE GREEN
Stylish Spy Moves, Stacked Cast (and One Cat)
The concept at the center of “ Argylle ” — a bestselling author discovers that what she writes comes true — immediately reminds me of one of my favorite films, “Stranger Than Fiction.” (I’m just a sucker for metastories about the power of storytelling.) Starring Bryce Dallas Howard as a meek spy novelist whose words draw her into the dangerous world of espionage, “Argylle” (opening Feb. 2) is directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose devilishly stylish “Kingsman” franchise suggests he’ll know just how to play to and satirize the spy movie genre. The cast is filled with actors who have taken on action roles but have also shown impressive comedic chops (Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson among them), while the cinematography looks to share the same sleek style Vaughn has made his signature. And an inconvenient, frazzled cat in a backpack? The cherry on top. — MAYA PHILLIPS
Larry David Does Another Finale
How in the world did Larry David do it? It’s a question I’ve been hearing a lot lately. How did he make one of the funniest episodes of television ever out of the Israel-Hamas war? How did he tackle race, the Holocaust, Donald Trump without getting in trouble? How did he make us care so much about these insufferable rich Hollywood types whining during their golf game? How did he manage the impossible feat of putting on 11 seasons of a show dominated by improvised small talk? The questions are rhetorical, of course, but everyone knows the answer. David is really, really (dare I say “pretty, preeetty”) good at what he does. So, his last season of “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ,” which premieres Feb. 4, is a sad occasion. But it’s also one of the few things on television that I will not tape but watch exactly when it airs. I don’t know what the storylines of the next season will be, but here’s one idea to consider: David has already written a much-anticipated finale, the one on “Seinfeld.” I thought it was excellent. Many disagreed. Jerry Seinfeld has said onstage that he will be revisiting this finale in some form. Food for thought. — JASON ZINOMAN
‘Girls5eva’ Hit the Road
When Season 2 of “Girls5eva” ended in 2022, my hopes for a renewal were slim; no Peacock original show has actually made it to a third season. But now it isn’t a Peacock show anymore: There is a third season premiering March 14, but it will be on Netflix. Season 1 found the ’90s girl group reuniting, and in Season 2, they put out their album. This season, they’re heading out on tour, an experience for which they are not prepared. I am, of course, looking forward to the zingy jokes and warped nostalgia, but the even bigger wish is for another absolute banger that will join “Four Stars,” “B.P.E.” and “I’m Afraid” on my playlists. — MARGARET LYONS

Full text: A quick stop at the post office, a bright spot in the sky and more reader tales of New York City in this week's Metropolitan Diary.
Post Office
Dear Diary:
I was walking my dog, Mango, early on a weekday morning when I dashed into an Upper West Side post office to drop off a pre-labeled package. I brought Mango inside with me.
The post office was nearly empty, and I expected to be there for just a minute -- only as long as it took to bring my package to the designated window and have the label scanned.
But the window I needed was overflowing with packages, so I had to wait in a short line as a worker cleared it out.
As I got to the front of the line, a man approached me from behind.
"Is that a seeing-eye dog?" he asked.
I thought it was an odd question considering that Mango is small and fluffy, not what you'd think of as a seeing-eye dog.
"No," I replied.
"Well," he said, "I thought it must be since you didn't see the sign that says no dogs allowed."
And out he went.
-- Diane Glass
Bright Spot in the Sky
Dear Diary:
I was up early to catch up on papers for my classes when I heard a garbage truck grinding down my Harlem street. It was just before 6 a.m. and still dark outside. I realized I hadn't taken out the trash.
I got the plastic and paper for recycling bagged up, but the truck was past my house by the time I got to the street.
I caught up with one of the sanitation workers on the sidewalk.
"Plastic?" I asked.
"Paper," he said.
I chased the truck to the corner and tossed my paper straight in. Just then, my eyes caught sight of an unmistakable bright spot in the starless sky.
Seeing me stop, the worker stopped as well.
I pointed up.
"Venus," I said.
His eyes followed my finger.
"This is Venus?" he said, his face breaking into a smile.
His colleague, seeing the two of us look up, looked up too.
"Venus," we all said together, standing there for a few moments without another word.
-- Frederic Colier
B. Altman's
Dear Diary:
It was the last day of B. Altman's going-out-of-business sale in December 1989. I put my husband in charge of our three young children, left our East 67th Street apartment and headed to 34th Street and Madison Avenue.
On one of the store's top floors that had been picked nearly clean of merchandise, I found a Christian Dior women's suit on a far back wall. It had been marked down six times, to $ 35.
I tried it on. It fit like a glove. I bought it. I wore it for 20 years until the skirt was lost in a move. Every time I wore it, I felt like a million bucks.
I miss that suit. I miss B. Altman's, too.
-- Martha E.H. Deegan
Crafty
Dear Diary:
I often try to craft something special for a close friend for her birthday. One year, I thought I would incorporate a patch of a painting that I had seen at the Metropolitan Museum store.
So on a hot summer day, I took the bus downtown from Harlem Hospital, where I work as a pediatric hospital clown.
When I got to the museum, the guards wouldn't let me enter because I was carrying my ukulele.
Well, I said, do you have an idea of what I can do so that I can run into the shop to buy one item?
After thinking for a moment, one of the guards suggested I ask Mary, the hot dog vendor whose cart was out front, if she would hold the ukulele for me.
She said yes, and I handed my 100-year-old Martin soprano over the top of her steamy cart. It was not a great environment for a vintage instrument, but a few minutes later, I had the patch and Mary handed me back my instrument with a smile.
The pillow I made turned out great.
-- Phyllis Capello
Fistful of Change
Dear Diary:
When I was in college in the mid-1960s, I had a part-time job as a toll collector for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
One night during the early morning hours when I was working the overnight shift at the Cross Bay Bridge in Queens, I saw the headlights of a car approaching from Cross Bay Boulevard.
The lights seemed to be moving left to right as the car approached the bridge, weaving toward me.
The driver eventually maneuvered into my lane, stopped and reached into his pocket for change for the toll, which was 10 cents at the time.
Coming up with a fistful of coins of every variety, he pressed them all into my outstretched hand.
"Here," he said. "There must be a dime in there somewhere."
-- Alan Weinschel

Full text: Barbara Guggenheim and Alan Patricof had socialized since the 1970s. By the end of 2022, everything had changed.
Shortly after signing their prenuptial agreement the morning of Dec. 7 in Miami, Barbara Guggenheim and Alan Joel Patricof were, as usual, watching the clock. Not because they were counting the days until they were married -- they are so in love, both said, that this was a given -- but because that's what their lifestyles dictate.
"I think breakneck is the only speed Alan knows," said Ms. Guggenheim, who lives in Malibu, Calif. She wasn't exactly idle that morning either. Before the ink on the prenup was dry, several clients were awaiting her at Art Basel, the international art fair that brought her to Miami.
Ms. Guggenheim, 77, and Mr. Patricof, 89, have known each other since the early 1970s, before either had established what would become formidable reputations -- Ms. Guggenheim as an art adviser to clients including Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, and Mr. Patricof in business.
Both were living in Manhattan when a mutual friend, the art historian Jonathan Brown, brought them together for dinners on the town. They were a party of six in those days: Ms. Guggenheim and an art dealer boyfriend, Mr. Patricof and his wife, Susan, and Mr. Brown and his wife, Sandra (Mr. Brown died in 2022).
The meet-ups were infrequent, both recall, but the company was memorable. "Alan liked new adventures," Ms. Guggenheim said. "He was always willing to try out new restaurants. And he was lively and interested in art history or whatever the conversation was." Mr. Patricof liked Ms. Guggenheim's passion for art, and her hustle. "Barbara was always very knowledgeable and hardworking," he said.
Mr. Patricof started his first firm, Alan Patricof Associates, in 1969, before "venture capital" was familiar business parlance and shorthand for how to breathe life into promising startups. That company later became Apax Partners. A second firm, Greycroft Partners, where he is still chairman emeritus, opened in 2006 and invested in companies including what was then known as the Huffington Post, Axios and Wondery. In 2020, he and a partner founded Primetime Partners, a fund that invests in goods, services and technology for people over 60. He is still the chairman there.
Bootstraps helped him conquer the corporate world. Born in New York in 1934 to immigrant parents -- his mother, Dorine, was from Belarus; his father, Martin, was Ukrainian -- Mr. Patricof was selling the Saturday Evening Post in the subway at age 6. "We lived a very careful life," he said. "My parents had just enough to scrape by and educate their children," which included his two younger sisters. "I didn't get on a plane or ride in a taxi until the middle of college."
At Ohio State University, he studied finance, graduating with a bachelor's degree after three years. Two years later, he earned an M.B.A. from Columbia while working as an analyst for an investment firm.
An early marriage, in 1958, ended in divorce in 1966 after the first of his three sons, Mark, now 59, was born. In 1970, he married Susan, who became a well-known philanthropist, supporting children and global health. "My wife was brilliant and beautiful, and she was the sweetest person in the world," he said. Ms. Patricof died of Alzheimer's disease in January 2021; the couple had two sons, Jon, 50, and Jamie, 47.
Ms. Guggenheim, despite her familiar name, comes from a family that is entirely distinct from the one behind the Guggenheim museums and foundation. She grew up attending Quaker school in Woodbury, N.J., with a younger sister, Eileen Guggenheim Wilkinson. Their parents, Lester and Sylvia Guggenheim, owned dress shops, but Sylvia was more passionate about art than fashion.
That passion rubbed off on both girls. Ms. Guggenheim Wilkinson is chair of the board at the New York Academy of Art and a former aide to King Charles III; both sisters have doctorate degrees in art history. Before Ms. Guggenheim earned hers, from Columbia, she worked as a lecturer at the Whitney Museum of American Art to finance her way through graduate school. Her master's degree in art history also came from Columbia. Her bachelor's degree in art history is from Douglass College at Rutgers University.
"I've seen the art world from different angles," she said, including as the entrepreneur behind the '70s-era Art Tours of Manhattan, which brought visitors to art studios and galleries, and as the head of the American Painting Department at the auction house Christie's.
In 1981, she founded an art advisory company that morphed into Guggenheim, Asher Associates. She is still president there. She didn't marry Bert Fields, an entertainment lawyer known for representing Hollywood film studios and clients including George Lucas, Michael Jackson, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, until 1991, when she was in her early 40s.
The couple had no children but several homes. "I collect houses, not art," said Ms. Guggenheim, who owns four but considers Malibu her primary residence. "I don't want to compete with my clients."
Like Mr. Patricof's, her marriage was enduring. When Mr. Fields died last year of complications from long Covid, Mr. Patricof went to the memorial in Los Angeles. And because the couples had socialized throughout the years, Ms. Guggenheim, likewise, mourned with Mr. Patricof when Susan, whom she had long admired, died.

"We both had great marriages," Mr. Patricof said. Their decision this fall to start a new one together surprised them more than it surprised friends.
"I think them finding each other was a comfort they didn't expect," said Dr. Wayne Winnick, a sports medicine doctor who has been close with Mr. Patricof for more than 30 years.
They're as well matched energetically as they are socially, he said. Mr. Patricof runs marathons -- last year, he was the oldest person to complete the New York City Marathon -- and Ms. Guggenheim is a competitive ballroom dancer. Both write books in their spare time. Mr. Patricof's "No Red Lights: Reflections on Life, 50 Years in Venture Capital and Never Driving Alone," published by Post Hill Press, came out last year; Ms. Guggenheim has written five books on art, including "Art World: The New Rules of the Game," published by Marmont Lane in 2017, and is working on a collection of stories.
Neither would call the courtship traditional. In 2020, when Ms. Patricof's disease had progressed so much she was confined to the couple's Upper East Side apartment, Mr. Patricof often found himself in need of a partner for social obligations. "I told my children and my friends, don't be surprised if you see me out with someone," he said. "Barbara and I were both unbelievably dedicated to our marriages. But it's tough to be alone."
Ms. Guggenheim, on the West Coast, was too far away to be in his lineup of possible companions. She was also busy caring for Mr. Fields, whose health was declining. But she helped in another way. "Alan would need a plus-one, and I would vet them," she said. By 2022, she was noticing a shift in how she felt about her vetting duties.
When visiting New York, "I would go places with him, and if we ran into someone he had gone out with or was going to go out with, I felt a little pang of jealousy," she said. Both went on a few blind dates after their spouses died, but by the end of 2022, "I think we both came to the conclusion that we'd rather be with each other than with anyone else," she added.
Both reject the idea that their romance was built on convenience. "It's nice to be with someone who fits in with your friends and your family," Mr. Patricof said. "But it's as simple as, we fell in love. We have a love affair now." As Ms. Guggenheim put it, "I always laugh, because people probably think we're two old losers who just decided, let's glue it together. It's not like that."
The relationship glue known as marriage hadn't occurred to either when they were at a cocktail party in September in the Hamptons and a friend congratulated them on their engagement. "He mentioned the name of a mutual friend who had told him we were getting married," Mr. Patricof said. The friend had started the rumor -- neither knows why, but both found it amusing. A few days later, they took a long walk in East Hampton. "I said, 'Since he said it, why don't we do it?"'
Among the things Ms. Guggenheim loves about Mr. Patricof, she said, is that he's game. That day, she was game. She said yes.
On Dec. 10, they were married in the Park Avenue apartment Mr. Patricof has lived in since 1970. Just 40 family members and a few close friends had been invited.
David Gelfand, the rabbi at Temple Israel of the City of New York, officiated a traditional Jewish ceremony. Before each stomped a glass to mark the start of their marriage, Rabbi Gelfand told guests the wedding was life affirming. "People their age are typically going to funerals," he said. Not them.
Mr. Patricof often tells people he expects to live to 114. "I promised Barbara we'd have 25 years together," he said. She's counting on it. "Alan is irresistible," she said.

Where Park Avenue, New York
Recycled Rings During the ceremony, the couple exchanged rings. But not new ones. Each gave the other the band they had worn in their previous marriages. "Our marriages were both long and good," Ms. Guggenheim said. "We figured it was a good omen."
Something Spectacular Ms. Guggenheim turned 77 on her wedding day. During a reception in the apartment, while guests sipped bellinis and mimosas and helped themselves to a buffet of lox and bagels, a bouquet of flowers arrived. "In the middle of everything, I got birthday flowers from Tom Cruise," she said. It was not a small bouquet. "He does nothing that's not spectacular."
And Something Signature For her short walk down the living room aisle, she carried a lily of the valley bouquet -- her mother's favorite flower -- and wore a white Dior pantsuit she pulled from her closet. Mr. Patricof wore his signature outfit, a blue suit from J. Crew.
Collection Intact Ms. Guggenheim will move to New York in the new year, though she will hang onto her other properties, including the Malibu home.

The Year Fashion Went Backward: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Skinny models. White male designers. Shoulder pads. This year, fashion failed on many of its promises.
It started with all the talk about how we were going back. Back to the office. Back to normalcy after two years of pandemic upheavals. Back to -- maybe -- actual dressing. Remember?
Turns out, when it came to fashion, one part of that was exactly right. In 2023, we went back. And not just to big 1980s shoulders and bigger Edwardian sleeves or even Y2K trends: low-rise cargos, cropped tops, Uggs.
But back to skinny models. Back to mostly white men getting the top jobs at big fashion brands. Back to the flying circus of destination show spectacles. Back to fast fashion. Backward.
With great influence (influence being the currency of fashion as it intersects with culture) comes great responsibility, to paraphrase both Spider-Man and Winston Churchill. Yet for an industry that is supposed to be about the future, it was an awfully retrograde year.
After a messy period of confusion about what happens next -- maybe the metaverse, with all that implies about identity and self-expression and clothes; maybe a change in the system so we could right-season and get sales under control; definitely a future dedicated to inclusivity, diversity and cultural sensitivity -- fashion is, in many ways, in the same place it was in 2019.
The first sign was on the runways. Despite real change when it comes to racial inclusivity, size inclusivity was practically nonexistent. According to Vogue Business, "95.6 percent of looks" in the fall 2023 shows, which took place in February and March, were between US size 0 and 4. Only 0.6 percent were plus size (defined as size 14 and up; the remaining 3.8 percent were midsize, or size 6 to 12).
In the most recent spring 2024 shows, held in September and October, 0.9 percent of the models were plus size, while 3.9 percent were midsize. That doesn't even begin to take into account the narrow representations of age and physical ability.
Backstage at many shows, chaos and public nudity, decried during the immediate aftermath of the #MeToo movement, returned. The Fashion Worker's Act, a bill introduced in New York to address the rights of models and other contract workers, fell victim to legislative gridlock and was tabled in the State Assembly until next year.
By summer, it was clear that despite the pandemic-induced hiccup in the show system, there would not be fewer shows; there would be more, involving more travel, more hoopla and more products. Not only did brands that had resisted coming back, like Ralph Lauren, stage a return to the official schedules, but mega-brands like Dior and Vuitton added new interim shows to their circuit -- Dior holding its prefall show in Mumbai and Vuitton, men's prefall in Hong Kong.
And those were just two of the destination blowouts that took place. Others included Carolina Herrera in Rio, Gucci in Seoul, MaxMara in Stockholm, Boss in Miami.
"We didn't really learn anything from Covid-19," Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino told me in late 2022, and it was clear he was right.
Come October, a flurry of new designer appointments took place, and though the arrival of Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton men's wear in February had been an unmistakable jolt to the status quo, it turned out to be the exception, not the rule. Among the nine designers named to big jobs in 2023, there was one woman (Chemena Kamali at Chloé), one person of color (Mr. Williams) and seven white men. Many of those men didn't just have similar resumes, they had similar facial hair.
Finally, at her spring show and at COP28, Stella McCartney showcased new materials -- biodegradable sequins! Biofluff plant-based-fur! -- but evidence suggests that promising as they are, such pilots are not scalable enough to make any real difference. Mylo, the mushroom leather Ms. McCartney championed in 2021 and 2022, was discontinued by its parent company, Bolt Threads, and Renewcell, the largest textile-to-textile recycling plant in the world, is pausing production, both for lack of demand. Despite incremental advances from LVMH and the members of the Fashion Pact like Kering and Prada, the industry has yet to grapple with its most elemental issue: its sheer amount of stuff.
Indeed, speaking of stuff, Shein, the biggest and fastest of the ultrafast fashion giants, recently valued at $ 66 billion, reportedly filed to go public, suggesting that no one thinks the consumption model is going away any time soon. Nor are the problems with supply chains. Transparentem, a nonprofit that focuses on environmental and human rights abuses, recently released a new investigation highlighting wage slavery in factories in Mauritius that produce goods for, among other Western brands, Diesel, Armani and PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. While some of those brands have been responsive to the findings and worked to remediate the situation, others have remained silent.
"We had a phase of awareness," said Achim Berg, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company and one of the leaders of McKinsey's global Apparel, Fashion & Luxury Group. "Then a phase of commitment." But we have not, he said, made enough of a leap to action. Instead, fashion, nervous in the face of an uncertain political and economic environment, is crossing its fingers, hoping technology comes to the rescue, and defaulting to the familiar while it waits.
Still, looking ahead to 2024, there are some glimmers of disruption. The recent return of full-on red carpet eccentricity after the SAG-AFTRA strike has been a reminder of the joy, and complexities, of dressing up, suggesting this could be an awards season to remember. The chaos of New York Fashion Week, full of upstart brands by nontraditional designers defining success on their own terms and with their own fan base, is exciting.
The big brands that made the most waves -- Loewe, Bottega Veneta and Miu Miu -- did so because of their inherent idiosyncrasy, the willingness of the designers Jonathan Anderson, Matthieu Blazy and Miuccia Prada to pave their own peculiar paths. To, for example, change the silhouette by redefining high-rise pants (Loewe) or transforming leather pants into denim (Blazy) or getting rid of pants entirely (Miu Miu). Phoebe Philo came back under her own name and in her own way: online, without any formal marketing fanfare, at the most luxurious of price points, practically demanding her clothes be viewed as long-term investments.
Maybe it will work. Maybe it won't. But at least she's trying something new.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Diane Neuville went looking for a finer piece to give her daughter. When she didn't find what she wanted, she decided to create her own.
"When I was maybe 3 years old or so, I was given a gold bracelet with dragons on it from my grandmother," Diane Neuville said on a video call from Versailles, France, where she lives and works. "My mother is Vietnamese, and in Vietnam jewelry in gold with gemstones is given to children and handed down from mother to daughter. It's symbolic, like a message of love from the family."
So four years ago, when the 34-year-old jeweler had a daughter, she wanted to give her a gift of precious jewelry, designed for a child. "I looked around" and found nothing, "so I decided to make my own," she said. The result, which debuted last year, is Les Pierres d'Anna (the Gemstones of Anna), a brand named for her 4-year-old daughter.
Ms. Neuville uses 18-karat rose and yellow gold with emeralds from Brazil, blue Ceylon sapphires from Sri Lanka and pink, purple and yellow sapphires from Madagascar. "I've always been amazed by the vivid colors of gemstones," she said, "and I wanted colorful gemstones for children."
The brand consists of earrings, necklaces and bracelets; additional lengths of chain can be purchased so the jewelry can continue to be worn as the child grows. Each piece can be customized, with the desired selection of gold and gems, and the signature clasp -- shaped like a lotus, the national flower of Vietnam -- can be engraved with a name or a monogram.
Les Pierres d'Anna offers different designs, with more to come. "I wanted motifs that speak to children; I wanted something playful," Ms. Neuville said. Two examples are her floral and butterfly designs which "are always presented in a colorful way." The body of the butterfly is a marquise-cut sapphire, and is centered between golden wings; the flower's petals are made of gemstones. A constellation design features gemstones sparkling on golden chains, like stars.
There is also a Cinderella collection. Its design features a gold outline of Cinderella's pumpkin carriage. "I designed it to appeal to parents and to children," she said. "Your mother, your grandmother, all generations know this fairy tale. It represents the identity of my brand, to create jewelry that lasts a lifetime" and that can be passed on.
The Melody collection is also personal to Ms. Neuville, with earrings and necklaces featuring treble clefs of gold, and a bracelet with five strands of gold links like the staff in a musical composition, with gemstones in place of musical notes. "I loved music, and studied in the music conservatory in Versailles for 10 years when I was younger."
Before becoming a jeweler, Ms. Neuville studied business. She has a master's degree in marketing and finance from the École Des Hautes Études Commerciales du Nord, known as EDHEC, in Lille, France. After graduation, she worked on the business side of luxury maisons such as Parfums Christian Dior, Van Cleef & Arpels and Bulgari.
The experience was invaluable, she said: "I worked in marketing and planning and merchandising and learned about the jewelry making process and consumer relations. It gave me valuable insight into the jewelry industry and helped me develop a strategy."
Ms. Neuville then studied at the Haute École de la Joaillerie in Paris. "I wanted to understand the basics of jewelry making, to fully understand the process, so I took a course in the importance of craftsmanship," she said. "I also wanted to learn the technique of gouache painting because I wanted my artisan to know what I wanted to create."
She also made contacts, and when her designs for Les Pierres d'Anna were ready to be produced she knew the artisan she wanted to create them. "I really wanted someone used to the traditional know-how of Parisian jewelry, to have this quality," she said. "The workshop is based in the heart of jewelry industry, near the Place Vendome."
In an email, the artisan, Didier (who declined to give his last name for this article) said, "I love adapting my jewelry-making expertise to these small-sized creations." He added that he pays "special attention to polishing in order to achieve soft angles that are comfortable for children to wear."
"I have worked for renowned jewelry houses, but this is the first time I have been asked to work on such a concept of 18-karat gold and gemstones for children which, to me, is unique in Paris."
Les Pierres d'Anna is sold online, but Ms. Neuville hopes to start working with stores internationally. The most expensive item is the Melody bracelet at 1,800 euros, about $ 2,000. The least expensive, which can appeal to all genders, is one of the butterfly or blossom motifs in gold, strung on a colored cotton cord, starting at €260. Les Pierres d'Anna also includes mother and daughter bracelets, sized for women and children. Ms. Neuville said she was thinking of creating a line for boys. She won't have to look far to find a name for the line: Augustin, her 7-year-old son.

At the Pyramids of Giza, a 'Mystical' Wedding: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lamis Azazy and Sherif Abdelhalem celebrated their marriage at one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, complete with a concert by a pop star.
Lamis Khaled Hassan Azazy dreamed of having a wedding in front of the pyramids of Giza for as long as she could remember.
She grew up in Cairo and first visited the pyramids when she was a child, but she never thought it would be possible for them to be the backdrop of her wedding.
That changed in December 2022, when Dior put on a men's fashion show in front of the pyramids. Ms. Azazy, a follower of fashion, attended the show with Sherif Medhat Abdelhalem, her fiancé at the time. "It was surreal," she said. "When you step in the desert, you just feel like it's magic."
And so the quest to hold their wedding in front of the pyramids was on. "The Dior show opened our eyes," said Mr. Abdelhalem, 36.
It wasn't easy. Over the next 11 months, the couple had several conversations with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, which aims to protect and preserve the heritage and ancient history of Egypt. The pyramids of Giza were built more than 4,500 years ago, and carry a deep cultural and historical significance.
For this reason, the couple had their own concerns. "I was very scared because we were doing it in front of a really monumental and really historic place," said Ms. Azazy, 25.
Their love story began with brunch: Ms. Azazy and Mr. Abdelhalem met on March 10, 2021 at a gathering with friends at Pier 88, a restaurant by the Nile in Cairo. As soon as he saw Ms. Azazy, Mr. Abdelhalem was entranced.
They were sitting at opposite sides of the table, so he pulled up a chair and sat next to her. Though it was noisy inside the restaurant where they met, and they could barely hear each other, they still connected and talked for four hours. "She's very intelligent and smart," Mr. Abdelhalem said. "And also, she's so beautiful."
He took her phone and put his number in it. "Sherif Medhat," he said. "Just save it." (She said he sounded arrogant. He said, "That wasn't my intention.") In response, she took his phone, put her number in it and said "Lamis Khaled."
"And the story began from here," Mr. Abdelhalem said.
"He was very straight up," Ms. Azazy said of her first impression, and she liked it. "He wasn't shy."
The next day, they had breakfast with the same friends, and a few days after that, the group planned to meet for dinner by the Nile. Mr. Abdelhalem was excited to see her again, so he texted her beforehand, but she didn't answer.
At dinner, he approached her and said, "Why didn't you text me?" She made up an excuse and said that she hadn't planned on coming and changed her mind last minute.
"I'm not very easygoing with everyone," Ms. Azazy said. "Maybe that's why I didn't answer him the second time."
After the dinner, they didn't speak for two weeks. Ms. Azazy's grandmother was sick with Covid at the time, and she was busy taking care of her. But "I felt like something was drawing me back to Sherif, so I texted him back," she said. "We instantly connected."
Even when she hadn't replied, Mr. Abdelhalem still had the feeling that they would come back to each other. "I knew that she's going to call or text," he said. "I don't know why."
They met several more times in group settings. In April 2021, during Ramadan, they had their first date at a cafe called Qahwa after breaking their fast during a feast called Iftar. It was the first time they had spent time together alone.
They then started seeing each other almost every day. They traveled a lot -- to the northern coast of Egypt, London, Paris and Ibiza, Spain. "He always told me, 'I'm going to marry you,"' Ms. Azazy said. She would tease him in response: "'No, you're not."'
In October 2021, the couple traveled to London, where Mr. Abdelhalem proposed. "It was a very special trip," Ms. Azazy said. Her father, Khaled Azazy, the founder of an education company called the Azazy Group, was present, along with her mother, Hoda Elwan, and two brothers.
Binge more Vows columns here and read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here .
In July 2022, the couple bonded on a trip to St. Tropez, France -- a "roller coaster trip," as Ms. Azazy described it. It was Mr. Abdelhalem's birthday trip, and on their last day, they went to Loulou beach. They rented a cabana and left their bags there for a few minutes while they took a dip in the ocean.
When they returned to the cabana, Ms. Azazy's bag was missing. Their wallets and her wedding band and phone were in the bag. The couple went to the police, but they struggled to communicate with them because of the language barrier. They needed to catch their flight to Monaco later that day, but they thought their passports were also in the missing bag.
By chance, Mr. Abdelhalem had removed one credit card from his wallet and put it in his small bag, which did not get stolen. While trying to find cash in his small bag, he stumbled upon the one credit card and their passports. They were ultimately able to catch their flight that day. They laughed it off, went to McDonalds, and ordered two trays of sandwiches.
"We put all our sadness and disappointment in the food," Ms. Azazy said.
"We forgot everything about the robbery," Mr. Abdelhalem added, calling it "one of the best trips" they had ever been on.
"We got to explore different sides of each other," Ms. Azazy said. "Sherif was very supportive when I got robbed, and I really appreciated that. I felt like he had my back. I really felt like, 'This is my man."'
Ms. Azazy graduated from King's College London with a bachelor's degree in history. She also has a master's degree in business administration and management from Imperial College London. Ms. Azazy is the vice chairwoman of Malvern College Egypt.
Mr. Abdelhalem graduated from German University in Cairo with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. He is the owner of two food and beverage companies, Premier Food Industry and Masters Food Company, and a construction company called Hamfers Construction, all based in Cairo.
The couple were not able to have their legal ceremony at the pyramids, so they married a few days before, on Oct. 29, at the Prince Mohamed Ali Palace in Cairo. Mustafa Hosny, an imam at Al-Bilal Mosque, officiated.
On Nov. 3, they celebrated with over 2,000 guests in a tent built for the occasion, with a panoramic view of all three pyramids -- which, in agreement with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, were surrounded by security guards as a precaution.
For her bridal entrance, Ms. Azazy emerged from the desert in a custom gold Elie Saab gown, escorted by her father and accompanied by white horses. "It was very magical," she said. "I felt like I was on another planet."
The couple hired Amr Diab, a pop superstar in the Arab world and a friend of Ms. Azazy's father, for a private, two-hour concert at the wedding. Afterward, Rampa, a popular house D.J., performed a set for a dance party. "I don't know how to describe it more than to say that there was just love in the air," Ms. Azazy said.
The celebrations began at 9 p.m., and guests stuck around until 5 a.m. "It felt like it was just a second," Ms. Azazy said. "This energy from the pyramids, it was really reflected inside the wedding," she added. It was not an extravagant wedding, she said, but "a mystical wedding."
On This Day
When Nov. 3, 2023
Where The pyramids of Giza, Cairo
Pop Superstar Amr Diab, the best-selling Middle Eastern artist, performed the couple's favorite songs during the reception. He also performed an unreleased song that mentioned the pyramids. In the middle of his performance, Mr. Diab left the stage to sing and dance on the dance floor with the guests.
Elie Saab Couture Ms. Azazy's custom gold dress from the Lebanese designer Elie Saab was so heavy that she needed help from two people who work for the designer to get into the car that took her to the pyramids from her hotel. Mr. Abdelhalem noticed how happy and lively she was on the dance floor, even in the heavy dress. "She was so into the wedding," he said, that the weight of the dress didn't matter.
'A Mystical Wedding' Vincenzo Dascanio Event Production, a company based in Milan, and Dina Iskandar, a company based in Cairo, set up an Arab tent by the pyramids for the reception. People in traditional Bedouin outfits, along with camels, were all around the desert and around the tent. The pyramids were illuminated with special lights for the occasion. And there were two opera singers performing, one outdoors and one indoors. "I didn't want the wedding to finish," Mr. Abdelhalem said. "It was so beautiful, and I loved every second."

From Legoland to the Thrill Ride of 'The Crown': [Style Desk]

Full text: When Meg Bellamy got the call that would change her life -- the one telling her that after months of auditions, it was she, among thousands of hopefuls, who would play Kate Middleton in the final season of "The Crown" -- she was already standing in the shadow of Windsor Castle. But she wasn't looking the part of a royal just yet.
"I was crouched in costume among the bin lorries of a delivery car park at Legoland," Ms. Bellamy, 21, said at a London hotel suite last month. "Until that point, my most regular acting gig had been playing a red plastic brick."
In 2022, and with no professional acting experience, she was working as a performer at the theme park when she spotted a casting call on Twitter for the role of Kate Middleton. Competition to play one of the most famous women in the world during her college years was fierce. Thousands of young actresses were posting videos about their auditions. But after a neighbor remarked on her resemblance to Britain's future queen, Ms. Bellamy, crushed after several drama school rejections, decided to try out for the part. Three weeks after sending a tape, she got a call -- the first in what would be a several monthslong casting process.
"I never really believed I would get the role, not in the beginning anyway," she said. "But then with every round, I started to feel like I had a real chance, and that it might actually be mine to keep. When it was, I was completely shellshocked."
Now, more than two years after that call, Ms. Bellamy's trajectory from obscurity to the brink of stardom appears to be well underway. Last week, she appeared on the front of The Daily Telegraph, which used a still from the series that recreated the moment in 2002 when Ms. Middleton, on a charity fashion catwalk in a daringly sheer dress, was rumored to have first turned the head of Prince William.
This week, ahead of the release of Part 2 of "The Crown" on Dec. 14, Ms. Bellamy was on the red carpet at the London premiere in a creamy Valentino column gown -- 24 hours after attending the Fashion Awards, where she wore a blazer dress with a suit and tie by Huishan Zhang.
And for months she has been courted by big fashion names like Gucci and Dior -- she attended Dior shows in Paris in July and September -- which have a habit of snapping up emerging talent with juicy contracts before they ascend to heights of celebrity. After all, if a fashion house can't hire the Princess of Wales to sell lipstick and handbags, perhaps the unknown actress playing her to an audience of millions is the next best thing.
Over its six seasons, the casting of "The Crown" has largely been anchored by a constellation of established performers, though it has also boosted the sparkly careers of several new faces, including Emma Corrin, who played Princess Diana in Season 4. What was it about Ms. Bellamy that prompted executives to take a chance on her for this role?
"We found that there was an openness to her, an intelligence and a sweetness to her, and a chemistry between her and Ed McVey, who plays Prince William," said Robert Sterne, the casting director for "The Crown." "You wanted to go on the journey with Meg. You wanted her to tell you the story."
Doing Kate Justice
Much has already been made of the parallels between Ms. Bellamy and Ms. Middleton, beyond their delicate features and masses of glossy auburn hair. How both were raised by close families in the royal county of Berkshire. (Ms. Bellamy was actually born in Leeds, in Yorkshire, and has a light Northern twinge that still lingers on some of her vowels.) How both were extremely sporty at school, with a particular love of lacrosse. (Ms. Bellamy, who said she was academic, was also head girl, which is similar to a class president.)
But unlike the Princess of Wales, who studied art history at the University of St. Andrews, Ms. Bellamy didn't attend university. After a number of star turns in school musical productions, including Sandy in "Grease" and Scaramouche in "We Will Rock You," she wanted only to act. She is acutely aware that people wait a lifetime for a break like hers, which came months after leaving high school.
Before the six month shoot, Ms. Bellamy spent months preparing to play Ms. Middleton. She watched documentaries and read newspaper clips compiled by researchers. She also worked with movement and voice coaches to perfect her performance. She took home costumes -- a nostalgic Noughties-inspired wardrobe of low-rise flared jeans, peplum tops, chunky belts and fringed suede knee-high boots -- to wear as she practiced her lines.
"I must have looked insane," Ms. Bellamy said. "I would be dressed as her, reading a book about her and trying to sound like her while walking around the house." She noted that while there is endless footage of Ms. Middleton after she formally joined the royal family in 2011, there is little -- beyond a handful of paparazzi photographs -- from her time at St. Andrews, where she first befriended and then fell in love with Prince William.
"Her first press interview was when she became engaged at 29, so she was something of a blank canvas," Ms. Bellamy said. "I spent a lot of time thinking about what she would have been like before she knew where life would take her and that William would become her husband. I hope that I've done Kate justice."
At the same time, she added, it was nice to remove the layer of complexities that come with being a royal and just play her as a girl who's going to university and falling in love.
When photographs of Ms. Bellamy and Mr. McVey filming at St. Andrews emerged this spring -- and ever since then -- there was intense online interest in her private life and next career steps. (So far, Ms. Bellamy has yet to announce her next role.) Lately she has been working with the stylist Felicity Kay to hone her public image and build a brand for herself.
Has being thrust into the spotlight given her a vague notion of what it must be like to be a royal?
"It's something I've been thinking about, especially as we've done more press ahead of the release," she said. "I really can't imagine the level of pressure royals face day to day. I mean, until last month I'd never been to Hollywood. Then I was not just there, but on a red carpet with people shouting my name."
She added: "But I keep telling myself that this is something I've always dreamed about. You have to remember that, before all of this, I wore a school uniform and could only afford high-street brands like Primark."

DHL Workers Walk Out At Kentucky Cargo Hub: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Workers who load and unload cargo planes at DHL's hub near Cincinnati walked out after months of negotiations failed to produce a contract.
More than 1,100 workers at DHL Express's global air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport went on strike on Thursday after months of failed negotiations with the parcel carrier.
A group of DHL workers at the hub who load and unload planes voted in April to unionize with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has been in contract negotiations with the company since July. The union has filed more than 20 unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board since then, accusing the company of retaliation against organized workers. Teamsters Local 100, which represents the unionized workers, voted to authorize a strike on Sunday.
"The company forced this work stoppage, but DHL has the opportunity to right this wrong by respecting our members and coming to terms on a strong contract," Bill Davis, president of Local 100, said in a statement.
DHL Express is the U.S. unit of the world's largest logistics company, Deutsche Post, but accounts for only 2.3 percent of the market in the United States in package volume, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. As a German company, it is not able to ship between domestic airports within the United States, so it has to contract out those services and instead focuses on handling international shipments.
A DHL spokesman said the company "was fully prepared for this anticipated tactic and has enacted contingency plans" like redirecting shipments to avoid Cincinnati and adding replacement staff members.
The company noted that roughly 4,000 employees at the facility were still on the job. It said it did not "anticipate any significant disruptions to our service performance."
"Unfortunately, the Teamsters decided to try and influence these negotiations and pressure the company to agree to unreasonable contract terms by taking a job action," the company spokesman said in a statement.
The DHL strike comes at a time of increased tensions in the industry between companies and organized labor.
On Thursday, the Teamsters threated to strike at a United Parcel Service facility in Louisville, Ky., accusing the company of engaging in "similar practices to disrespect and abuse our members in the same state" by laying off administrative workers who had just voted to unionize. The union threatened to strike at UPS as well if it "doesn't get its act together" by Monday.
UPS narrowly averted a strike over the summer after contentious negotiations with the Teamsters, which threatened to halt operations for the country's largest parcel service.
The facility where DHL workers are striking is directly in front of Amazon's Air Hub, where a unionization effort is underway. Workers there have accused Amazon of illegally impeding organizing efforts.

Rectifying Fashion's Neglected History: [Correction]

Full text: The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute reimagines the record of fashion, celebrating designers known but also those long, and wrongly, forgotten.
Last October, when it was announced that Sarah Burton was leaving Alexander McQueen, the house she had nurtured to new gorgeousness after the suicide of its founder, and would be replaced by an Irish designer named Seán McGirr, it set off a sort of tsunami of angst in the fashion world.
See, it turned out that with McGirr's appointment, every designer in the stable of its owner, Kering, the second-largest fashion conglomerate in the world, would be a white man. And it only got worse when, in quick succession, three more white men, all Italians, were named to the top jobs at Moschino, Tod's and Rochas.
Where were the women (not to mention the designers of color), in an industry that largely caters to women? Weren't we supposed to have moved beyond this? Cue the breast-beating and TikTok wailing.
And then, cue the corrective, which comes courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.
"Women Dressing Women" is a celebration of work from the museum's own collection by over 70 different female designers from the early 20th century to the present. It is the first time the museum has ever held a survey dedicated solely to the work of women, and it will be the first time that at least half of the 83 pieces on display have ever been seen.
That makes the show both a symptom of the problem (it's kind of shocking to think that in the 85 years since the Costume Institute joined the Met no one has done this before, despite the complications of a show based on gender) and, perhaps, a signpost for a possible solution.
Indeed, rarely has an exhibition been more perfectly timed. Even if Mellissa Huber, the associate curator of the Costume Institute, who created the show along with Karen Van Godtsenhoven, the guest co-curator, did not intend it that way.
Intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States in 2020, "Women" was conceived in 2019 and postponed when Covid lockdowns changed the exhibition schedule. That delay has recast the result in a way that makes it feel, ironically, even more politically relevant, not just because of developments in the fashion world, but because global events have renewed the debate over women's bodies and who controls them.
The miracle is that Huber and Van Godtsenhoven have avoided polemics in favor of simply letting the work, in all its astounding variety and breadth of imagination, speak for itself. And it does.
In whispers and songs, silk faille and satin, cotton and wool, it reimagines the record of fashion, filling in the gaps and wardrobes of history with names and pieces long, and wrongly, forgotten; elevating them, finally, to the pedestals on which they belong.
Literally: the show opens with two tall columns as you descend the steps to the Anna Wintour Costume Center.
Atop each column are pieces by the only two female designers to be granted solo shows at the Met: a draped white goddess evening gown from Madame Grès, whose retrospective finally took place in 1994 -- despite the fact that the former Costume Institute curator Diana Vreeland began advocating for it in 1980, according to Huber -- and a black moth-eaten sweater and skirt from the avant-gardist Rei Kawakubo, whose retrospective occurred in 2017.
Meanwhile, what greets attendees when they reach the Costume Center itself is three sumptuous black gowns from the troika of fashion wisewomen, Coco Chanel (a "fireworks" tulle dress, glittering with sequined starbursts), Madeleine Vionnet (a dark brown velvet column with a gold beaded "ribbon" at the waist) and Elsa Schiaparelli (a midnight blue velvet embroidered evening jacket and skirt). Set in a mirrored triangle that refracts the work in an endless loop, this one-two opener drives home the point: Everywhere you look there are works by women at the top of their game.
That the message is conveyed so subtly is what gives the exhibit its power. This is a damning story, gently told. The revelations begin in the Carl and Iris Barrel Apfel Gallery, which focuses on that time, in the 1920s and '30s, when female designers actually outnumbered men, and serves up introductions to many names that have been lost to history.
Premet, for example. What's that? A French house led by a series of women designers, all of whom introduced iterations of the little black dress starting in 1923, a few years before Coco Chanel is credited with its invention. On view is one of their many LBDs, a graceful tiered number from 1929 by the designer Charlotte Larrazet.
And what about Marie-Louise Boulanger (of the house of Louiseboulanger)? She was responsible for the extraordinary dropped-waist beige satin frock being shown, the skirt a highly contemporary mix of straw and ombré dyed ostrich plumes. Or Mad Carpentier, the house co-founded by Madeleine Maltezos and Suzie Carpentier, the women behind a draped organdy gown from the late 1940s that undulates in shades of blue like the surface of the Mediterranean Sea?
It's impossible to see their work and not think that they should be part of the general designer canon -- and that if they were, perhaps our understanding of the foundations of the modern fashion world might be different.
A video of seamstresses bent over their machines, reminder of all the anonymous women who found their livelihood in fashion, provides the bridge from these foundational creators to the world of ready-to-wear: a 360-degree vision housed in the Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery and anchored by an amethyst velvet Maria Monaci Gallenga gown from 1925 strewn with gold lotus blossoms. Previously attributed to Mariano Fortuny (oops) and in fragile condition, it has been repaired and is making its exhibition debut.
From there the show takes you on a whistle-stop tour through the kaleidoscope of female imagination contained in clothing, leapfrogging through Ann Demeulemeester's appropriation of the undertaker's suit and Donna Karan's cold-shoulder gown, Norma Kamali's parachute ruching and the draped chiffon of the Indigenous designer Jamie Okuma. The galleries are so multilayered with identities and invention it can be hard to keep track of who made what, though it's fine to just abandon yourself to enjoyment.
There is unexpected delight in discovering the web of connections the show uncovers, both in the history of who made the clothes and who wore them. On one wall, for example, an animated family tree traces the way the houses of Jeanne Hallée and Paquin trained two designers -- Madame Madeleine and Madeleine Lepeyre, who in turn gave birth to the house of Madeleine & Madeleine, which they led. It's a bit delicious to learn that Louise Nevelson, known for her monochromatic sculptures, donated the Bonnie Cashin mohair plaid ensemble and that Lauren Bacall had been the proud owner of the Sonia Rykiel powder pink skirt and striped sweater in the show (both designs never before exhibited).
Six "intergenerational" juxtapositions are shown back to back in the center of the main gallery, with a two-way mirror between each pair so the reflection of one shadows the other, like a ghost, hovering just behind: Prada's oily feathered coat against Schiaparelli's emerald metallic faille gown; Fortuny's pleated Delphos dress (the one that Mariano's wife and muse, Adele Henriette Elisabeth Nigrin Fortuny was instrumental in creating) against Ester Manas's ruched mesh (both made by a wife-and-husband team, both structured to conform to the body, rather than the other way around).
The totality creates an unexpectedly emotional experience while refusing to cater to reductionist generalities about "female" design (or who gets to wear the clothes; one of the mannequins is male, a reminder that the show may be gendered, but reality is not necessarily).
Indeed, Van Godtsenhoven pointed out, an underlying theme here is that the axiom that female designers create clothes for life while male designers create clothes for fantasy is as much a canard as the fetishization of the male designer as a sacred monster or an impossible artist.
After all, for every Kangaroo dress by Isabel Toledo that drapes gracefully over the maternal body, there is a silver sequined fairy tale of a halter-neck gown, like the one by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, that is so physically unforgiving it required a specially-ordered mannequin; for every minimalist trouser suit by Jil Sander, there is a lumps- and- bumps explosion of weirdness by Georgina Godley; for every 3-D printed futuristic bodysuit by Iris Van Herpen, there is an adaptable dress like the one Jasmin Soe designed for women with achondroplasia, which causes short stature, to adjust to their own taste.
In other words, the breadth of the exhibit makes a potent argument that the idea there are not enough women in fashion is misguided; that it is not really about a lack of female representation (or auteurship), but an institutional failure on all parts of the industry -- brands, schools, museums, media -- to recognize it, remember it and celebrate it.
"When we keep repeating the same names -- Dior, Balenciaga -- we create a canon and a history, and people start to drop off," said Van Godtsenhoven, the co-curator. And then, "all of a sudden, all we are talking about are 'masters' and 'fathers,"' rather than "mothers"
But really, the fashion world is replete with extraordinary women, if people would only look. That's on all of us.
As Claire McCardell once wrote, "Most of my designs seem startlingly self-evident. I wonder why I didn't think of them before." The same could be said of this show, as Huber pointed out. When asked why it took so long (and why it took two women to finally make it happen), she hedged diplomatically.
Whatever the reason, we should just be thankful the moment is finally here. After all, there are big jobs still to be filled at major European fashion brands, including Givenchy. Here's hoping their C.E.O.s take the time to stop in at the Met. They might leave with a different sense of the possible.

The revelations begin in the Carl and Iris Barrel Apfel Gallery, which focuses on that time, in the 1920s and ’30s, when female designers actually outnumbered men, and serves up introductions to many names that have been lost to history.
Premet, for example. What’s that? A French house led by a series of women designers, all of whom introduced iterations of the little black dress starting in 1923, a few years before Coco Chanel is credited with its invention. On view is one of their many LBDs, a graceful tiered number from 1929 by designer Charlotte Larrazet.
And what about Marie-Louise Boulanger (of the house of Louiseboulanger)? She was responsible for the extraordinary dropped-waist beige satin frock being shown, the skirt a highly contemporary mix of straw and ombré dyed ostrich plumes. Or Mad Carpentier, the house co-founded by Madeleine Maltezos and Suzie Carpentier, the women behind a draped organdy gown from the late 1940s that undulates in shades of blue like the surface of the Mediterranean Sea?
It’s impossible to see their work and not think that they should be part of the general designer canon — and that if they were, perhaps our understanding of the foundations of the modern fashion world might be different.
A video of seamstresses bent over their machines, reminder of all the anonymous women who found their livelihood in fashion, provides the bridge from these foundational creators to the world of ready-to-wear: a 360-degree vision housed in the Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery and anchored by an amethyst velvet Maria Monaci Gallenga gown from 1925 strewn with gold lotus blossoms. Previously attributed to Mariano Fortuny (oops) and in fragile condition, it has been repaired and is making its exhibition debut.
From there the show takes you on a whistle-stop tour through the kaleidoscope of female imagination contained in clothing, leapfrogging through Ann Demeulemeester’s appropriation of the undertaker’s suit and Donna Karan’s cold-shoulder gown, Norma Kamali’s parachute ruching and the draped chiffon of Indigenous designer Jamie Okuma. The galleries are so multilayered with identities and invention it can be hard to keep track of who made what, though it’s fine to just abandon yourself to enjoyment.
There is unexpected delight in discovering the web of connections the show uncovers, both in the history of who made the clothes and who wore them. On one wall, for example, an animated family tree traces the way the houses of Jean Hallée and Paquin trained two designers — Madame Madeleine and Madeleine Lepaeyre, who in turn gave birth to the house of Madeleine & Madeleine, which they led. It’s a bit delicious to learn that Louise Nevelson, known for her monochromatic sculptures, donated the Bonnie Cashin mohair plaid ensemble and that Lauren Bacall had been the proud owner of the Sonia Rykiel powder pink skirt and striped sweater in the show (both designs never before exhibited).
Six “intergenerational” juxtapositions are shown back to back in the center of the main gallery, with a two-way mirror between each pair so the reflection of one shadows the other, like a ghost, hovering just behind: Prada’s oily feathered coat against Schiaparelli’s emerald metallic faille gown; Fortuny’s pleated Delphos dress (the one that Mariano’s wife and muse, Adele Henriette Elisabeth Nigrin Fortuny, was instrumental in creating) against Ester Manas’ ruched mesh (both made by a wife-and-husband team, both structured to conform to the body, rather than the other way around).
The totality creates an unexpectedly emotional experience while refusing to cater to reductionist generalities about “female” design (or who gets to wear the clothes; one of the mannequins is male, a reminder that the show may be gendered, but reality is not necessarily).
Indeed, Van Godtsenhoven pointed out, an underlying theme here is that the axiom that female designers create clothes for life while male designers create clothes for fantasy is as much a canard as the fetishization of the male designer as a sacred monster or an impossible artist.
After all, for every Kangaroo dress by Isabel Toledo that drapes gracefully over the maternal body, there is a silver sequined fairy tale of a halter-neck gown, like the one by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, that is so physically unforgiving it required a specially-ordered mannequin; for every minimalist trouser suit by Jil Sander, there is a lumps- and- bumps explosion of weirdness by Georgina Godley; for every 3D printed futuristic bodysuit by Iris Van Herpen, there is an adaptable dress like the one Jasmin Soe designed for women with achondroplasia, which causes short stature, to adjust to their own taste.
In other words, the breadth of the exhibit makes a potent argument that the idea there are not enough women in fashion is misguided; that it is not really about a lack of female representation (or auteurship), but an institutional failure on all parts of the industry — brands, schools, museums, media — to recognize it, remember it and celebrate it.
“When we keep repeating the same names — Dior, Balenciaga — we create a canon and a history, and people start to drop off,” said Van Godtsenhoven, the co-curator. And then, “all of a sudden, all we are talking about are ‘masters’ and ‘fathers,’” rather than “mothers.”
But really, the fashion world is replete with extraordinary women, if people would only look. That’s on all of us.
As Claire McCardell once wrote, “Most of my designs seem startlingly self-evident. I wonder why I didn’t think of them before.” The same could be said of this show, as Huber pointed out. When asked why it took so long (and why it took two women to finally make it happen), she hedged diplomatically.
Whatever the reason, we should just be thankful the moment is finally here. After all, there are big jobs still to be filled at major European fashion brands, including Givenchy. Here’s hoping their CEOs take the time to stop in at the Met. They might leave with a different sense of the possible.

Vintage Shop to Stars Holds Its Own Against Rivals: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent afternoon in SoHo, Seth Weisser and Gerard Maione were checking in on their shop, What Goes Around Comes Around, a luxury vintage boutique on West Broadway that has long been a downtown destination for stylists and celebrities.
They stepped past Jean Paul Gaultier shirts from the late 1980s and Harley-Davidson biker jackets from the 1960s before entering the area containing their vast Levi's collection. Mr. Weisser, who was wearing a vintage Hermès jacket, gingerly took hold of a pair of 1950s-era jeans. The price was $ 3,000.
"These might look like ordinary Levi's, but the denim connoisseur who sees someone wearing these is going to know exactly what they are," he said. "This is the beginning of quiet luxury."
One of their regular customers, Stefon Diggs, a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills, was browsing near a mannequin holding a quilted Chanel purse made in the 1990s.
"You beat my Jets yesterday," Mr. Maione called out.
"Yeah, but you guys beat us last time," Mr. Diggs replied.
Mr. Diggs ended up buying two Chanel purses. Outside the store, a friend took pictures of him modeling his purchases in front of an S.U.V.
"I've been shopping at What Goes Around Comes Around for a long time," Mr. Diggs said, mid-pose. "I like vintage because it's timeless, so I like to stack up on it here."
Mr. Weisser, 56, and Mr. Maione, 55, grew up in neighboring towns on Long Island. Mr. Weisser's mother was a gym teacher, and his father was a lawyer; Mr. Maione's family ran an Italian deli.
The two men became friends at Syracuse University in the late 1980s. They began thrifting at street fairs and flea markets in the 1990s, when they learned that their best shot at getting into Manhattan nightclubs like Spy Bar was to have a slick look.
The hunt for vintage became their obsession. At a rag house in the Bronx, they filled trash bags with rock concert T-shirts and a pair of Levi's made during the Eisenhower administration; at the Rose Bowl parking lot in Pasadena, Calif., they bought rare denim from the backs of vans.
They opened What Goes Around Comes Around in 1993. In those days, secondhand meant second-rate to much of the fashion set, and the duo saw themselves as downtown entrepreneurs whose mission it was to preach the gospel of vintage.
"The stigma was that people felt it was beneath them to buy something used," Mr. Weisser said, "but we saw wearing vintage as giving someone individuality."
Their first regulars included Jean Paul Gaultier and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Stylists for "Sex and the City" found outfits there for the show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, who became a client herself.
"New York has a long history of vintage, but it's the way they pursued pieces with legacy that always made them stand out," Ms. Parker said. "There will be only one of something there, not multiples of it. And that's when vintage gets really special."
"They're not the RealReal," she added. "What they do feels a little more rarefied. Sometimes you have to be a bit of a fashion historian to understand what they have, but it's worth the effort."
After three decades in business, What Goes Around Comes Around has an outpost in Beverly Hills and a recently opened second boutique in SoHo. Its customer base includes Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Lenny Kravitz and Kate Moss. Items now on sale include a Hermès "pochette" purse ( $ 34,500), a Chrome Hearts alligator zip pouch ( $ 3,500) and a leather Christian Dior cap ( $ 775).
In recent years, as high-end vintage wear became a booming business, Mr. Weisser and Mr. Maione found themselves competing against the venture capital-backed consignment platform the RealReal, the online marketplace Vestiaire Collective and other similar businesses.
To bolster their e-commerce division, they recently started an online shop, in partnership with Amazon, and began producing a livestream shopping series hosted by the handbag historian Mason Howell. Episodes have included "Gossip Girl Style" and "Inspired by Priscilla Presley."
"In terms of all our online competition, we were a bit late to the game in chasing that idea, so we've had to decide how to differentiate ourselves," Mr. Weisser said.
Mr. Maione offered the opinion that their rivals buy more indiscriminately. "Lots of the stuff is fluff," he said. "We curate to a very high level, and the only closets we're going into are ones that we know have pinnacle pieces."
"That's why we get the stylists and the celebs," he continued. "Because they know they'll be the only ones out there wearing something if they've gotten it from us."
They also reflected on a less obvious edge they might have on the competition: their decadeslong friendship.
"We've been through a lot together, from recessions to 9/11," Mr. Maione said. "But we always have each other."
Their bond, they said, helped them endure a painful downsizing during the pandemic that forced them to close locations in Miami, East Hampton and the Upper East Side. Since 2018, they have also been in litigation with Chanel, which sued What Goes Around Comes for trademark infringement, an allegation they deny. (Chanel, which has an uneasy relationship with the luxury resale sector, sued the RealReal that same year.)
When asked how they hunt for vintage clothing these days, Mr. Weisser and Mr. Maione said the particulars of acquisition are trade secrets, but allowed that they make visits to the closets of a stylish eccentric on Central Park South and that they take regular trips to the Paris flea market at Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine.
"We still fight to get into the best closets," Mr. Weisser said. "The hunt is what keeps us going."
As evening approached, the duo drove through the Holland Tunnel toward their 35,000-square-foot warehouse office in Jersey City. They entered by freight elevator and made the rounds of cavernous stockrooms filled with boxes of Rolex watches, bundles of 1970s rock concert T-shirts and towering piles of Louis Vuitton monogram bags.
They paid a visit to their e-commerce team and greeted a member of their authentication division, who was examining a Gucci bag with a magnifying glass for any signs of sophisticated fakery. Then they stepped into a room filled with heaps of Levi's.
Mr. Maione ran a hand across a pair of jeans with a few tears in the fabric.
"It's getting harder to find the old Levi's stuff," he said. "There's not much of it left out there now. The source of it is all drying up. But denim never goes bad. It only gets better."

Holiday Windows Aim to Delight and Wow: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Let's light it up!" the actress Jennifer Lawrence said on Monday night as she helped to reveal the holiday windows and kick off the annual lights show at Saks Fifth Avenue.
As is tradition, onlookers crammed behind barricades near 50th Street as performers -- in this case from the Martha Graham Dance Company -- flooded Fifth Avenue. Behind them, nearly 300,000 lights illuminated what is described as a "wheel of fortune" installation, which covered 10 stories of the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship facade. The wheel is adorned with zodiac signs and decorated with symbols related to the Dior brand, like the star and flowers (for Christian Dior's love of gardens).
Ms. Lawrence, a longtime Dior ambassador, gathered alongside other actresses, including Tracee Ellis Ross, Rachel Zegler, Ashley Park, Alexandra Daddario, Lola Tung and Maya Hawke. They packed onto bleachers across the street for the show, which included fireworks launched from the roof of the department store.
The traditional and ornate holiday windows, a marketing stalwart that R.H. Macy has been credited with originating in 1874, are part of a storied tradition in New York City that has declined in recent years as department stores have closed or moved away from the practice.
The four widely known window displays that remain in Manhattan -- Bloomingdale's, Saks, Macy's and Bergdorf Goodman -- continue to exhibit elaborate scenes that can take months to conceive and build.
In interviews, the people who helped craft the displays discussed the themes this year and the inspiration behind each one.
Bergdorf Goodman
David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman, said that every year the team looks for a theme that is "slightly oblique" but will still provide a surprise factor.

"It has to be just right," he said. "Not too specific, not too broad. And related to holiday, if a little bit tangentially."
For the seven windows at the company's Fifth Avenue store, they came up with a theme of "Isn't It Brilliant," which Mr. Hoey described as "bright lights, bright ideas, bright horizons, everything brilliant."
The displays each feature a mélange of sparkly props with subtitles. The window "First Light," for example, refers to dawn and shows crystal balls hovering over farm animals -- two roosters, a cow and a pig -- covered in a similar sparkly exterior. Another window, called "Tripping the Light Fantastic," features creatures resembling Pegasus, the flying horse in Greek mythology.
The mannequins were dressed in designer ensembles from Thom Browne, Balmain, Rodarte, Alexander McQueen, Christopher John Rogers and Paco Rabanne.
More than a hundred people worked on the displays, Mr. Hoey said, and the installation took about three weeks and 25 people.
Describing the craft of holiday window displays, Mr. Hoey, who has worked on Bergdorf's windows for over two decades, said, "It's a little bit of theater. It's a little bit of fashion. It's a little bit of commercial art. It's an exhibition space, but definitely a public one."
Macy's
For the third year in a row, Macy's blue reindeer, Tiptoe, returns to Herald Square.
The theme for this year's windows, "Give Love," is splayed across the company's storefront on Broadway near 34th Street. The displays focus on "togetherness and festive nostalgia," said Manny Urquizo, the national windows director for Macy's.
The windows center on Tiptoe and her friends in scenes that represent her favorite things from the holiday season. Like a page in a storybook, a short narrative describes the displays and an interactive component animates each one.
In a music-themed window, piano keys snake around a trumpet-playing polar bear. Viewers can play the piano by pressing on a set of keys on the glass. And on a window with a sparkling pink candy carousel, viewers can scan a QR code that directs them to a reindeer filter on Instagram.
Mr. Urquizo, who has worked on Macy's windows for the past four years, said, "I really want that tradition to carry on." He added, "I bring my kids every year. They're my harshest critics. But you know, they really enjoy it."
Bloomingdale's
This year, Bloomingdale's teamed with Warner Bros. to create scenes inspired by the upcoming film "Wonka," in which Timothée Chalamet stars as a young Willy Wonka.
"We're looking at everything through two lenses: How does this delight a child? And how does this just wow the adult?" said John Klimkowski, who is the senior director of visual merchandising at Bloomingdale's and has worked on the store's holiday windows for more than a decade.
Mr. Klimkowski said that the team embraced a candyland-like theme, with a hint of Wonka, for the windows on Lexington Avenue near 59th Street. One displays the facade of a candy store (a nod to the 1971 Wonka movie starring Gene Wilder), with sparkly interiors, giant cupcakes and swirling lollipops. A working six-tiered chocolate fountain is at the center of the display. One mannequin, dressed like Mr. Wonka with a top hat, a cane and a purple ensemble, motions the viewer to enter the store.
In another window, mannequins with ruffled hair display the effects of candy designed to make people fly or help their hair grow quickly, another reference to the fictional chocolatier's fantastical creations.
A display with a theme of "Candy Wonderlandscape" was produced in collaboration with Abby Modell, an artist who specializes in handblown glass. Lollipops and floating rock candies covered in Swarovski crystals hover over glass gummy worms next to giant chocolate drops on top of marshmallows.
"I just hope that for a few minutes, no matter what is going on in the world and someone's personal life," Mr. Klimkowski said, "they can just relax and enjoy the beauty and the spirit of the holidays because it's once a year."
Saks Fifth Avenue
This year, the window displays at Saks explore Mr. Dior's first visit to the United States and New York, in 1947, a trip that ignited his fascination with the city.
The collaboration was the first time that Saks had partnered with a luxury fashion house for its holiday display.
In the displays, with the theme of "Dior's Carousel of Dreams at Saks," miniature figurines of Mr. Dior, who died in 1957, are placed in various scenes of the windows along Fifth Avenue.
The windows trace Mr. Dior's journey from Paris to New York City, fusing references to the fashion house with miniature versions of notable landmarks, such as the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, wrapped in Dior's Bar jacket; and the Rockefeller Center ice rink, with Mr. Dior and his beloved dog, Bobby, on a sled full of perfume bottles. And a model of Times Square on New Year's Eve shows Mr. Dior standing next to a figure of a woman dressed in the fashion house's signature New Look of 1947, which he introduced in his first collection and which helped shape his career.
In one window, a replica of the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship is complete with the light installation on the facade, a changing traffic light, a hot-dog stand in the corner and steam rising from the grates.
Andrew Winton, who is the senior vice president of creative at Saks and oversees the window design, said, "It really has been this devoted group of people from around the world, just hundreds of artisans crafting the story."
He added: "It's something that's always been this gift to the city."

World-Class Shopper Will Sell Some of Her Treasures: [Style Desk]

Full text: Mouna Ayoub has a huge collection of haute couture, and now, 252 of her Chanel pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld are going up for auction.
Once upon a time -- 1976, in fact -- a beautiful, poor 18-year-old Lebanese waitress named Mouna Ayoub was cleaning tables in Paris. She caught the eye of an older man, a billionaire from Saudi Arabia. They married, and he soon whisked her away from France to a life of gilded splendor in the desert kingdom.
A rags-to-riches story -- but not exactly a fairy tale. Ms. Ayoub was often lonely and unhappy. To distract herself, she threw herself into a new pastime: buying clothes. Not just any clothes, but haute couture looks made to order by a handful of Parisian houses that can cost anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 300,000.
Today Ms. Ayoub, who divorced her husband in 1997, owns more than 2,700 pieces, making her collection of haute couture one of the world's largest. On Nov. 20, 252 pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel will go on sale in Paris.
The sale, called the Golden Years of Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel From the Mona Ayoub Haute Couture Collection, is organized by Maurice Auction in Paris and the British fashion auctioneer Kerry Taylor. The pieces are from the early 1990s to 2014 and include embroidered lace evening gowns, sequined cocktail suits and classic wool crepe jackets, along with classic flap bags, belts, jewelry and shoes.
So, why is Ms. Ayoub selling them now?
"Well, for one thing, I don't fit into my clothes anymore," Ms. Ayoub, 66, said. She was seated in a private salon at the Hotel Costes in Paris earlier this month and wore a monochrome tunic of graphic camellia prints with a matching bag and black patent leather knee-high boots. (All brand-new fall 2023 Chanel, of course.)
"But the real reason," she said, "is that I've carefully looked after many of these Karl pieces for 30 or 40 years now, and he is no longer with us. So it's about time they were seen and that somebody else got a chance to wear and enjoy them."
Ms. Ayoub has rules when it comes to her collection. She requires four fittings for each outfit, but preferably six. If a piece is not perfect, it will be returned. Many couture houses have their very own Mouna mannequin so that they can tailor clothes to her in case she is not available for a fitting. ("Essential," she said.)
She never wears the same dress twice, and sometimes never at all. She guessed that 90 percent of the Chanel auction lots have never been worn in public. Instead, they have been preserved in special boxes in which they lie flat and are shielded from light, dust, humidity and the archenemy -- moths -- in a high-security warehouse outside Paris.
"I am fanatical about couture," Ms. Ayoub said. "For so long it was my greatest passion." Often, she said, she acquired pieces simply for their beauty and craftsmanship.
"The world doesn't always see couture pieces as works of art, which it should," she said. "When I started buying couture in the early 1990s, it was because I wanted to protect this world and the beauty it created at a time when as a business it was under threat."
"Don't forget, my collection came from the fact I could buy what I wanted, but I couldn't publicly wear what I bought," she said, referring to restrictions on what women could wear in Saudi Arabia. "My favorite part was the fitting, with the wonderful seamstresses, and being surrounded by all the love and attention they would give you."
Part of the proceeds of the auction will go to Fondation des Femmes, a French charity for women affected by violence and abuse. Four of its shelters had been earmarked for closure after a drop in funding. Money from the sale will help keep two of them open.
Ms. Ayoub said her biggest passion now is her eight grandchildren. She still buys couture, but for a specific wedding or red carpet event. She likes Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Virginie Viard at Chanel, and Giorgio Armani, but she is particularly excited by the couture creations of Daniel Roseberry, the American designer now at Schiaparelli, and Kim Jones at Fendi. She still wears a piece only once.
Was there an outfit from the auction collection that she loved the most? A long black Coromandel coat from the fall 1996 Chanel show at the Ritz in Paris, she said, where it had been modeled by Stella Tennant.
Inspired by the 18th-century Chinese lacquer screens that adorned Gabrielle Chanel's private apartment, it was said to have taken seamstresses at Maison Lesage more than 800 hours to create. In 2012, Ms Ayoub wore it to a party at a Chanel boutique, open with a black turtleneck and pants. Mr. Lagerfeld was not happy.
"He was very annoyed," Ms. Ayoub said. "He said that it was not at all how it was supposed to be worn and that it should be closed." She explained to him that she had gained weight since the 1990s and that fastening it would be impossible.
"He thought that was very funny," she said with a smile. "He said, 'Oh, Mouna, join the club!"'

Full text: Alix Brown immerses herself in records, cinema and books before preparing a favorite Italian dinner.
About a decade ago, Alix Brown, a canny and kittenish 39-year-old bassist from Atlanta, parlayed her obsession with obscure music and her playful '60s "It-girl" persona into a career as a D.J. She spins at special events for fashion labels like Chanel, Fendi and Armani and has honed the signature sound for the Soho Grand Hotel and the Roxy Hotel in New York.
After years playing in bands like Daisy Glaze, La Femme, Golden Triangle and Angry Angles, Ms. Brown is focusing on work as a music supervisor for films. She finds songs that enhance the movie's tone and negotiates rights clearance with both songwriters and record labels.
Ms. Brown lives on the Upper East Side with her partner, Michele Civetta, 47, a film director.
THE EARLY BIRD I wake up pretty early naturally -- usually like 6:30, 7 in the morning. I D.J. a lot, but I don't D.J. super late-night things anymore. But even when I did, I could never sleep in for some reason.
I usually go into the living room and lie on the couch and meditate for 15 or 20 minutes, and then I'll put on a record, something really chill. Lately I've been spinning Lou Donaldson's "Alligator Boogaloo," Lonnie Liston Smith & the Cosmic Echoes' "Visions of a New World" and Astrud Gilberto's "Look to the Rainbow." I'll do some stretches, some yoga. And then I'll get into the coffee. Usually our coffee pot starts brewing at around 8 a.m., so that's when I'll have my first cup. Around 9, Michele gets up.
SUNDAY TRADITIONS My biggest routine that I've been doing since I was a kid is watching "CBS Sunday Morning." When I was growing up, my mom would cook a lot of breakfast and we would sit and watch it together. It's funny because we kind of still do. I'll put it on at 9. She'll text me, and she'll be like: "Oh, did you watch this segment? What did you think of this?" Or I'll call her. They have the best news stories and interviews with regular people. And it's not overly politicized. I try to talk to my mom every day.
PLAYLIST TESTING I do a little power walk along the East River, listening to some playlists I've made to make sure the songs are cohesive and flow together. Then I'll walk over to Agata & Valentina to go food shopping with Michele.
BOOKS AND RECORDS I moved here in 2007 and worked at Academy Records for a couple of years. It was my first job in New York. I love to go by and see them and see what records they have. I'm always looking for tunes, old and new. The last film I did music supervision for used a lot of modern bands. The one I'm working on now is using a lot of punk music and '60s and '70s rock 'n' roll.
Then I usually walk through Tompkins [Square Park] to go by Mast Books. Michele will meet me there. They have great new, used and rare books and ephemera. They have so many books there I can't even afford, but it's nice to just look at them.
(PAS) AU HASARD Maybe I'll meet Michele or my friend Illyse Singer, the director of Roxy Cinema, for brunch at Balthazar. I get the salade niçoise or the steak frites. Depending on how I'm feeling, maybe I'll have a glass of champagne.
And then after that, I go to Roxy Cinema for a movie. It's in the Roxy Hotel. I've been working with them for over 11 years. It used to be the Tribeca Grand back in the day. I started as a D.J., and then when they renovated the rooms and made it the Roxy, I was the musical director there. I started making all their playlists. They put record players in the suites, so I started a curated vinyl collection in those rooms. There are 10 records in each suite, and the penthouse has a bigger selection, 20 or 30 records.
CONNECTING THE DOTS I'm really into Italian music and soundtracks. Michele's father is Italian, and they spend their time between the U.S. and Italy. We were in Italy for most of the pandemic, so that's how I got really into it.
I've also been working with an Italian record label called CAM Sugar that's been around since 1959. They've been doing Italian and French reissues of movie soundtracks, so I'm hosting some screenings at Roxy Cinema with them. We just did "La Planète Sauvage," the animated French movie from the '70s. It has a sexy, psychedelic jazz soundtrack that's pretty important because a lot of rappers sampled from it, so I was thinking: Instead of doing listening parties, it'd be great to do screenings. And we're screening Ennio Morricone films for his birthday. They're putting out some of his unreleased works from soundtracks that he did.
ITALIAN SUNDAYS If it's a special occasion, we'll go to Antonucci, my favorite restaurant uptown. They have amazing art on the walls and amazing pasta. The duck tortelli is insane.
But we love to cook! If it's just a casual, lazy Sunday, we'll make a simple pasta, like spaghetti alle vongole, my favorite. We'll usually put on a jazz, soundtrack or library record or an amazing Italian playlist I made or sometimes even a movie in the background. Maybe I'll throw in tomatoes or zucchini blossoms if they're in season. I like to eat it with Calabrian chiles. And then we probably watch something else and chill, and maybe eat some ice cream or gelato.
EVERYTHING IS RESEARCH You've got to keep up with what's going on with film, the film world, streaming and all these things, and after the pandemic and the change in how people watch movies, you have to see what people are watching now, and ask, why is this show so popular?
Depending on what we're watching, how tired I am and who chose what to watch, I'll go to bed between 10 and 11 -- midnight if something really has my attention.
I'm always connecting, always on the hunt, always taking in new information.

Helen Williams, 87, Trailblazing Model: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She was one of the most photographed Black models of the 1950s and '60s, seen mainly in magazines, like Ebony and Jet, aimed at the Black middle class.
Swan-necked and with an arched-eyebrow hauteur, Helen Williams was the aspirational face of the Black middle class in the 1950s and 60s -- the most photographed, and highest paid, Black model of her era.
She was a frequent cover girl for Ebony, Jet and Tan magazines, and the face aligned with many of the products advertised within, from Kodak to Modess to Simplicity Patterns.
She was a ladylike beauty in Budweiser ads; a poised career girl smoking Kent cigarettes. She telegraphed luxury for Bulova watches and put on a sporty mien for Mum deodorant. When she spent a month in Paris in 1960, working as a house model for Christian Dior and Jean Dessès, Ebony covered the trip of "America's most successful Negro model" in breathless prose.
By the end of her visit, the magazine wrote, she had received three marriage proposals (all politely declined), including one from a French suitor who became, as Ebony noted, "so carried away by her beauty that he passionately kissed her foot, murmuring, 'I worship the ground you walk on, mademoiselle."'
Yet as she told a reporter in 1965, "Why can't we Negroes be recognized in our own backyards?"
Helen Williams, often described as the first Black supermodel, who paved the way for models like Naomi Sims, Pat Cleveland and others who broke barriers in mainstream fashion, died at 87 on July 26 at a care center in Moorestown, N.J., near her home in East Riverton. Her death, which was not widely reported at the time, was confirmed by her cousin Osa Meekins, who said the cause was Alzheimer's disease.
Like everything else in America during the postwar years -- and beyond -- media and the advertising that supported it were often segregated. The success of Ebony magazine, which began publishing in the 1940s, however, showed the buying power of the Black consumer, and so-called mainstream companies began advertising there.
"They realized that Black people had money, too," said Fath Ruffins, curator of African American history and culture at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian in Washington. "It became safe to attract Black people. Helen is part of that process. She is from the generation who grew up in and worked as an adult in a segregated environment."
Outside of racial stereotypes like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben, one didn't see many Black faces in ads in the mainstream press. Fashion magazines were another hurdle. When Richard Avedon photographed Donyale Luna, a young Black model from Detroit, for Harper's Bazaar in 1965, there was a backlash from subscribers and advertisers, many of whom canceled their subscriptions and orders.
Ophelia DeVore, a model turned modeling agent and charm school director, started her business, the Grace de Marco Modeling Agency, to focus on the burgeoning Black consumer market, and Ms. Williams became one of her biggest stars.
"She was very much a product of her time," said Norma Jean Darden, the fashion model turned restaurateur who was also once represented by Ms. DeVore (and who was one of 10 Black American models who participated in the so-called Battle of Versailles in 1973, when American designers faced off against French designers, another pivot point in the history of Black models). She added, "And Helen was everywhere," walking the runways of local Black fashion shows held most weekends at Black churches and community centers in and around New York City in the 1950s.
"Young girls and their mothers were following her career with great pride and delight," Ms. Darden said. (When a manufacturer of mannequins wanted to make Black mannequins, both Ms. Darden and Ms. Williams were asked to pose as models.)
What was also notable about Ms. Williams' success was her dark skin. Magazines and advertisers of the period often privileged lighter skin over darker.
"Back then they didn't want you to look too colored," said Audrey Smaltz, a Black fashion model and fashion commentator who was a contemporary of Ms. Williams. "They wanted you to have color -- and look white. They wanted 'high yellow.' We didn't get to see Black women as dark as Helen, so I think for that reason she also took off. You name it, they wanted Helen Williams."
Helen Marie Williams was born on Sept. 16, 1935, in Burlington County, N.J., and grew up in East Riverton, a Delaware River town about 15 miles northeast of Philadelphia. Her father, Ellis L. Williams, was a chauffeur; her mother, Helen (Blackstone) Williams, a homemaker.
After high school, Helen found a job as an assistant at Pagano Studios, a commercial photography studio in Manhattan used by catalogs and advertising agencies. Bert Pagano, the owner, also specialized in children's photography. Ms. Williams eventually worked as a stylist there, and often hired the models. Ms. Darden recalled being hired by her for a catalog shoot, and showing up in her typical uniform, slacks and no makeup.
"It was not a bandbox look, and Helen did not approve," said Ms. Darden. "She came from the era of gloves and matching purses and hose, with an extra pair stored in your bag in case you got a run."
Ms. Williams had a brief, early marriage to John Clayton Anderson. She married Norman Jackson, a men's clothing salesman, in 1977. He died in 2017.
When Ms. Williams retired from modeling in the 1970s, she continued styling and had her own company, H & H Fashion, with Henry Castro, a photographer, working mostly for women's clothing catalogs.
"Helen Williams was my inspiration," Bethann Hardison, the fashion model -- another alum of the Battle of Versailles -- and activist whose recent documentary, "Invisible Beauty," chronicles her history in the industry, wrote in an email. "Much respect. She was it."

Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Influencer: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crashed on July 16, 1999, killing both Mr. Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (as well as Carolyn's older sister), at the peak of their glamour and celebrity, the couple became not just another tragic story, but a symbol.
Think pieces proliferated about what it all meant: about the Kennedy curse and promises unfulfilled; about another chapter in, as The New York Times wrote in an editorial, the story of "unfinished journeys, of magnetic personalities cut down far too early."
He founded George magazine; she had been a publicist at Calvin Klein. Together they embodied not only the next golden generation of a sprawling, mythic family, but also the apotheosis of the collision between fashion, pop culture, magazines and politics that defined New York in 1990s. Seemingly it was the last gasp of the monoculture, when discretion in both dress and demeanor was its own kind of currency and everyone agreed on who did it best.
Little wonder that as fascination with that era reaches a new pitch, Ms. Bessette Kennedy has emerged as the ghost influencer of the season -- one who has particular resonance as stealth wealth evolves into an embrace of more functional minimalism in the face of global chaos; disillusionment grows with the cesspool that the digital world has become; and the question of what exactly it means to be "American" takes center stage.
"She used fashion as her way of having a conversation or dealing with the public," said Sunita Kumar Nair, the author of "CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion," to be published next month. The book focuses entirely on Ms. Bessette Kennedy's style as seen through essays and interviews with designers, photographers and fashion figures. And now, when it comes to that conversation, fashion is talking back. Perhaps more than ever.
This fall, the brand Sporty & Rich published an ad campaign recreating some of the most famous paparazzi shots of Carolyn and John: walking their dog or his bike in the streets of TriBeCa in crew necks and boots, clutching hands and newspapers in jeans and flip-flops. On runways throughout New York Fashion Week and beyond, the building blocks of the C.B.K. wardrobe -- white shirts, pencil skirts, jeans, loafers and pumps, slip dresses, men's overcoats -- dominated. The pieces were often referred to as "timeless" or "classic" or "understated," but with just enough rigor to seem interesting.
Though anniversaries often inspire a reassessment of historic figures (next year will be the 25th anniversary of the plane crash), and despite the Kennedy family finding itself once again in the news (Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is seeking the White House, and a coming Ryan Murphy show will include a portrayal of Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's younger sister), the C.B.K. revival is at once broader and more nuanced than that.
The Ubiquitous White Shirt and the 1990s
Like Diana, Princess of Wales, whose royal status, beauty and untimely death made her into a legend, Ms. Bessette Kennedy exists less as a person than an idea. Because she was so notoriously private, because she married into a family that had already colonized part of the public imagination, and because our memories of her are essentially preserved in amber (which is to say, a finite number of photographs, most of them taken between 1994, when she started dating Mr. Kennedy, and 1999), she will never age, get Botox, post an unthinking comment, get messy -- or change her style.
Instead, Ms. Bessette Kennedy offered an example of a different way to be in the world, one that valorized what wasn't shown. And because she never gave a single interview after her marriage, what she wore has become a stand-in for who she was.
That ethos has propelled her onto the mood boards of such disparate labels as Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang; hovered in the air above the slip dresses and shirtdresses at Staud; and helped make the white button-up shirt the single most ubiquitous item of the season.
There were white artists' shirts at Altuzarra, worn over full midi-skirts; crisp white shirts at Bally, paired with neat white pencil skirts; and asymmetric white shirts at Dior. There were long white shirts-cum-dresses at Peter Do, white shirts buttoned to the neck at Loewe and white shirts paired with the sort of boyfriend jeans Ms. Bessette Kennedy favored at Stella McCartney. That's before you even get to the camel pencil skirts, another Bessette Kennedy staple, at Michael Kors, Gucci, MaxMara and Saint Laurent, to name a few.
"The woman this season is much quieter, less bold, with less nudity and fewer cutouts and leather 'powerful' looks," said Alexandra Van Houtte, the founder of the fashion search engine Tagwalk. "She's more discreet, also wears more wearable clothes, and colors on a whole have been a little bland: black, white, light blue" -- which pretty much sums up the Bessette Kennedy palette, with the addition of gray.
Indeed, across more than 11,000 images from the last round of shows in Paris, London, Milan and New York, Tagwalk found a 45 percent increase in the number of shirts compared with spring 2023, and an 8 percent increase in white, Ms. Van Houtte said. "Minimalism" was up 46 percent, and the 1990s was the single most searched tag. (In the TikTok style channel, videos related to the 1990s have more than 93 million views.)
If Kate Moss represented the grunge side of the '90s, Ms. Bessette Kennedy was its understated chic.
It was an aesthetic that married strong Social Register vibes (she wore headbands and even the occasional kerchief) with an appreciation for cut and material and a certain insouciance that never looked as if she was trying too hard.
"The Kennedys developed a style you could call casual but purposeful," said John Hellmann, a professor of English at Ohio State University and the author of "The Kennedy Obsession: The American Myth of JFK." "It seemed uniquely American but also modern in the best sense of the word. There was an economy to how they dressed. And Carolyn was in many ways the most updated version of that."
At a time when New York fashion is undergoing one of its periodic paradigm shifts, with the big brands that once defined a national aesthetic giving way to a melting pot of new names with diverse identities and reference points, she represents a certain touchstone in the ontology of American style.
Mystery, Minimalism, Sustainability
"She was minimalism with character -- she wasn't sterile or boring," said Wes Gordon, the creative director of Carolina Herrera, who, like many of the designers now channeling Ms. Bessette Kennedy's style, knew her only through the imagery. He thinks of her, he said, when he is removing an extraneous ruffle from a shirt or otherwise toning down the label's usual flamboyance. "I think I've seen every picture that exists of C.B.K.," he said.
It's this limited record that is part of her appeal, said Elizabeth Beller, whose book "Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy," a more formal biography, will join the Bessette Kennedy chorus when it is published next spring. "In the age of social media, where lives are often curated for show, Carolyn's reserve is especially appealing."
Professor Hellmann agreed. "In an age of extreme image replication and proliferation, there's a mystery to John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy that gives them dignity," he said.
She and Mr. Kennedy were one of the first celebrity couples to marry in total privacy in the age of tabloids and paparazzi, releasing only one picture they approved to the breathless public, who could not get enough of the simple silk slip dress Ms. Bessette Kennedy wore at her wedding -- designed by the then-unknown Narciso Rodriguez, a friend from her Calvin Klein days, who did not remain unknown for long.
"She would never have been on the Vogue.com wedding website," Ms. Liang said. "There's something very special about that. The archive is the archive."
Ms. Beller added that Ms. Bessette Kennedy "resonates with the cultural vibe of 'stealth wealth' and interest in sustainability."
She might have worn Yohji Yamamoto or Prada, but, Ms. Nair said, "she only had, like, 30 to 40 pieces in her wardrobe" -- unusual at a time when public figures are rarely seen in the same thing twice.
"You just think, 'Oh, OK, that's quite an edit right there,"' Ms. Nair said. "One of her friends said, 'You'd open up her wardrobe, and there's like, five black pants, a selection of really well-fitted shirts.' The rest sometimes she would borrow if she needed to go to gala events." She had a consistency that made her clothes feel as if they were "part of her psyche," Ms. Nair said. As if she had chosen them, not a stylist.
Put another way: She had an Hermès Birkin, but it looked used, chock-full of the stuff of everyday life; she even toted it on the subway. That makes Ms. Bessette Kennedy an object of fascination not simply because of what she wore, but because of how she handled what she wore.
"I'm always wondering, 'Would she wear this?"' Ms. Liang said. "Or what would she wear this with?"

If You Plant Milkweed, They Will Come: [Real Estate Desk]

Author: Roach, Margaret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: These underappreciated plants attract a "hungry throng" of beneficial insects. They're not bad to look at, either.
To see a field of common milkweed in midsummer -- a sea of a thousand nodding pink flower heads -- you would not imagine that anything could ever stand in the way of the genus Asclepias.
Yes, common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), the most widespread milkweed east of the Rocky Mountains, can colonize disturbed sites and form impressive stands. But it is an exception among the more than 90 recognized North American species of milkweed, many of which often find it not so easy to continue making themselves at home.
"The milkweed is a displaced citizen in its own land," writes Eric Lee-Mäder in the opening of his new book, "The Milkweed Lands: An Epic Story of One Plant, Its Nature and Ecology." "Where once it owned the continent, it's now a kind of vagrant, occupying the botanical equivalent of homeless encampments."
As one example, he cites 2012 research, by John M. Pleasants of Iowa State University and Karen S. Oberhauser of the University of Minnesota, that estimates a nearly 60 percent decrease in the milkweed populations of the Midwest since 1999.
"Milkweeds, at least the North American ones, are like so many other meadow and grassland species," Mr. Lee-Mäder said in a recent conversation. "They're both dependent upon us and also subject to the various indignities of coexisting with us."
The beginnings of our agrarian legacy set much of their displacement in motion, when vast tracts of original prairie sod were plowed up to create croplands. Since the 1990s, the use of increasingly sophisticated chemical herbicides that kill everything but the crops genetically engineered to resist them has essentially "targeted milkweeds for elimination," he said.
Once, milkweed "would get shredded and pulverized by cultivation equipment, but it would spring back from the live rhizomes underground," he continued. Now, "the milkweed within those systems just dies."
We have relegated milkweed to ditches and abandoned lots, said Mr. Lee-Mäder, an ecologist at the invertebrate-focused Xerces Society, where he is the co-director of pollinator and agricultural biodiversity. He directs the nonprofit's private-sector initiatives, supporting pollinator-conservation work across thousands of acres with companies like General Mills, Nestlé and Danone, undertaking habitat restoration on farms that supply them with ingredients like almonds and blueberries.
Mr. Lee-Mäder and his wife, Mari Lee-Mäder, also operate Northwest Meadowscapes, in Port Townsend, Wash., a supplier of regional native seeds that also provides consultation services for meadow makers.
They know something that anyone who gives milkweed refuge will soon learn: If you welcome this plant, a diverse, living fan base will follow close behind -- and not only monarch butterflies.
If you plant it, they will come. Sometimes as if out of thin air.
A Two-Way Chemistry Equation
If someone says "milkweed," maybe you also hear "monarch butterfly" in your head. It's almost as if the two are inextricably linked.
Mention of this plant probably also brings to mind stories of its distinctive chemistry. Many plants defend themselves against herbivory by producing unpalatable or toxic chemicals, but "milkweeds take this strategy especially seriously," Mr. Lee-Mäder writes.
Asclepias produce potent steroids called cardenolides "that can disrupt the life functions of vertebrate animals unlucky enough to feed on them," he adds. (A bonus: These chemicals may also discourage deer.)
But while milkweeds have evolved their chemical defenses to protect themselves, they may also "be gifting these chemical defenses to some of the animals that live in association with them," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "as much as using these to check and control the amount of herbivory that they have to sustain."
One notable example: monarchs, which have famously evolved to ingest milkweeds without harm. Their larvae rely on Asclepias as an obligate host plant, or a food required for at least one stage of development. Eating it fosters an anti-predation chemical defense of their own.
So critical is this relationship that female monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed leaves, ensuring that the needed sustenance is at hand when offspring emerge.
"They use their olfactory sense to identify the locations of milkweeds on wind currents," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "tracking those down like bloodhounds on a trail, to be able to lay their eggs on those plants."
The monarch-milkweed connection is often spoken of as "chemical warfare," but Mr. Lee-Mäder prefers to think of it as a "two-way relationship" or "a partnership."
The monarchs' part: Although the adult butterflies are not great pollinators, they do visit milkweed flowers for nectar, potentially moving some pollinia (milkweeds' pollen-bearing structures) long distances during their migrations.
"That gene flow that monarchs may facilitate is probably unmatched by other flower visitors to milkweeds," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
Not Just Monarchs
As intimate and celebrated as the plants' relationship with monarchs is, the community surrounding milkweeds is far more diverse.
"The hungry throng" that Mr. Lee-Mäder enumerates includes at least 40 insect species that "feed often or exclusively on North American milkweeds in the summer," he writes. They include butterflies, moths, beetles and aphids.
In a milkweed seed-farm field in the Midwest, he recalls witnessing a cloud of aphids descend on the breeze, as if tuned in by GPS to the emerging crops' location. "It's like seeing nature sort of manifest itself out of thin air around this plant," he said.
Before you say, "No, not aphids; not in my garden," think about their role in the big picture, Mr. Lee-Mäder said -- as food for beneficial insects like lady beetles and lacewing insects, for instance, which are, in turn, food for birds. And one of the most abundant milkweed-visiting aphids, the nonnative oleander aphid, is host-specific, meaning it doesn't eat other plants.
Other invertebrates, including slugs, snails and spider mites, may feast on milkweeds, too, as do some larger animals, like rabbits and ground squirrels, which are apparently resistant to poisoning.
Beyond so many opportunities for herbivory, Asclepias flowers provide nectar to adult butterflies and moths, along with an astonishing lineup of bee species and wasps.
And just look at them: Milkweeds are "among the most elaborate in the plant kingdom," he writes, with "a complexity comparable to that of rare orchids."
Which Ones to Grow?
It's easy to take delight in a stand of common milkweed or its Western counterpart, showy milkweed (A. speciosa) -- whether in bloom or later, holding their substantial seed-filled pods, or follicles. Lanky as these three- or four-footers may be, they put you "face to face with the wildness of what this genus can represent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
He expresses awe for rush milkweed (A. subulata), a three- to five-foot plant with whitish-green blooms that grows alongside the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) in nearly rainless parts of the desert Southwest. "It's a plant made up of stems -- it produces almost no leaves," he said, explaining its adaptation for survival.
There are other choices for gardens without a meadow-size space to offer, though, or those that aren't in the most arid places.
It's no surprise that butterfly weed (A. tuberosa), with its vivid orange flowers, has received the most horticultural attention.
"It's beautiful, it's compact, it's charismatic," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, noting also that orange is fairly uncommon among prairie and meadow flowers. Although the palette of Asclepias is generally quite different from East to West, "tuberosa is one that crosses the Continental Divide," he said, residing even in parts of the desert Southwest.
At just about two and a half feet high, a mature plant can produce "strikingly abundant blooms for the space that it takes up, and attract a really remarkable spectrum of flower visitors," he added. It is also pretty well adapted to the often highly altered soils of our human landscapes.
As its common name implies, swamp milkweed (A. incarnata), with its distinctive magenta flowers on stems of up to about four feet, can handle it wet. With rain gardens and bioswales increasingly being planted to manage more insistent runoff in a changing climate, this widespread species should get more play. Do you have a spot for it just beneath a downspout, or maybe at a pond's edge?
Another important but underappreciated species that Mr. Lee-Mäder wants to put in a word for, especially with Western gardeners, is the lavender-and-white-flowered narrowleaf milkweed (A. fascicularis), "one of the most widespread breeding plants for Western monarchs," he said.
Unlike Eastern butterfly populations, which overwinter in Mexico, Western monarchs spend the winter in coastal California and then move inland around March for breeding season. Their clusters break up and typically move straight eastward, into the Central Valley or Sierra Nevada foothills, fanning out from there.
"A monarch that wintered in Monterey might end up in Las Vegas or Boise or Spokane that next spring and summer," he said. They need more narrowleaf milkweed along their routes.
Like so many native plants, milkweeds may have persisted only on the fringes in nature, but gardeners can offer them prominent spots. A good place to begin researching which ones to choose is the Xerces Society's Project Milkweed and its region-specific plant lists.
"Planting milkweeds in a garden may be a small dent -- but it's a dent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said. "If everybody does it, it will add a different kind of richness to our landscapes."

Full text: With a Ph.D. in chemistry and inspired by her daughter, Aude Livoreil-Djampou is trying to address the dearth of salon options in France for people with coiled or curly hair.
When it came time to find a salon for her daughter with coiled hair, Aude Livoreil-Djampou discovered what many women with curly or textured hair in Paris already knew.
"I realized there was no hair salon where I could take my daughter," Dr. Livoreil-Djampou said. "We live like certain people do not exist. People don't like when I speak of hair apartheid, but it is what it is."
The dearth of salons specializing in textured hair has been a common and longstanding complaint among curly-haired Parisians, especially those with ties to North Africa, West Africa and the Caribbean, but Dr. Livoreil-Djampou felt she was uniquely positioned to do something about it.
For many years, she was the head of a laboratory at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company, overseeing straightening and perm hair products.
A scientist with a Ph.D. in chemistry, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou, 53, had never wanted to confine herself within the walls of a laboratory. At L'Oreal, which she joined in 1998, she made frequent field visits to research centers in the United States and Brazil, two of the primary markets for her products, where she could examine people's hair and talk to those with expertise in styling it.
"I would hear a hairdresser explain things that I could understand through molecular chemistry," Dr. Livoreil-Djampou said.
She'd then return home to experiment for L'Oreal in her quest to invent more inclusive beauty products for women.
But it wasn't until Dr. Livoreil-Djampou -- whose own hair is straight -- went shopping for a salon for her daughter, whose father is from Cameroon, that it dawned on her that it wasn't only products that needed to do a better job of catering to different hair types.
While Paris was not entirely without salon options for curly hair, they were hard to find, especially in the center of the city.
"I found it abnormal, going all over Paris to find a rare gem, when I wanted it to be as easy to find a hairdresser as it was for my straight hair," Dr. Livoreil-Djampou said.
So she switched roles, from scientist to entrepreneur.
In 2015, she opened her first hair salon in Paris, Studio Ana'e, and has since added two more salons in the French capital and one in Lyon, with further expansion planned.
Nestled in the fifth district of Paris, an upscale neighborhood home to the Sorbonne and the Panthéon, the original Studio Ana'e has the feel of a sanctuary. On a Friday in September, soft music played while a client closed her eyes as a hairdresser massaged and shampooed her hair.
In theory, Studio Ana'e is a place for all hair types, and for men and women, but on that September day, the steady stream of clients was almost exclusively women with textured hair.
The salon offers haircuts, coloring, braiding and custom-made wigs, and it has become common for clients to stay for hours, sometimes stepping out to take work calls. Other clients isolate themselves in a space that can be closed with shutters, a room often used by women wearing hijabs who want more privacy.
One woman was receiving a deep moisturizing treatment, while another was getting blonde highlights. "I have never seen my hair like this," said a customer as she smiled at herself in the mirror after having her Afro styled.
"We hear extraordinary stories every day," said Aïcha Gobba, 42, the manager of the salon. "Some women always thought of their hair as suffering on their heads," she added. "I've even seen clients crying when they realized what their hair could look like."
While conceding that her salons' services aren't cheap, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou said that the broad menu of treatments includes affordable options, and that her salons had many clients with lower incomes who would come every six months, or once a year, to treat themselves.
Dr. Livoreil-Djampou grew up in Toulouse, studied chemistry as an undergraduate in Montpellier, then earned her doctorate in 1996 while doing research in Strasbourg in the laboratory of Jean-Pierre Sauvage, who would later win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. While she liked academia, she wanted to use her passion for science on something that could be part of "real life," she said.
She met her Cameroonian husband, a driver for the Paris tramway system, in 2006, and their daughter was born in 2008.
While her hair salon venture has been a success, she faced a big challenge right from the start: finding employees trained in treating textured hair.
The hairdressers who work for her were for the most part trained in-house, in private institutions, or by foreign professionals -- because the French education system didn't offer a certification in the styling of textured hair.
But that changed this year.
Building on the work of Black French activists, who for years advocated more inclusivity in the training of hairdressers, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou used her scientific background and her determination to help influence government officials to create a certification program in curly hair for the country's coiffeurs.
In 2021, she helped a member of the Senate draft a question to the minister of education about textured hair. In response, the Education Ministry, at the time headed by Pap Ndiaye, the first Black person to hold the post, said it was working on addressing the training issue. In 2022, it created an advanced-level certification program available to those who have already secured a basic hairdressing license.
Last month, five schools in France began offering this new, specialized training.
Rokhaya Diallo, a journalist and filmmaker who interviewed dozens of Parisians about their experiences and challenges related to their hair for her book "Afro!", said the new certification was a welcome first step but that more needed to be done.
"It is an important advancement that also shows how necessary it would be for this skill to no longer be an option but a requirement," said Ms. Diallo, who is one of France's most prominent voices in antiracism efforts.
In finally getting the government to act, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou credits the efforts of activists like Taj, a famous Parisian stylist from Martinique, who died in 2019 and who had long championed this cause. And, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou added, the timing was also right.
"It was the right moment," she said, referencing the widespread debates about identity and discrimination that were then taking place in France on TV, in social media and on the streets. Plus, she said, "I knew how to speak their language. I had the expertise and the experience at L'Oreal. Did it help that I was white? Partly."
As she got her own salon project off the ground, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou herself went back to school to be trained as a hairdresser, in part because banks had been reluctant to finance the venture if she lacked that credential.
With the official training program just getting started, Dr. Livoreil-Djampou has had to teach some of her own employees.
Pieranlly De La Cruz is one of them. The 35-year-old hairdresser, who is from the Dominican Republic and who has lived in France since 2010, said she has learned from her boss to be meticulous about her work. She only cuts hair when it's dry, to better control the precision of the desired length.
As she started working on a first-time customer, Ms. De La Cruz first asked for permission before gently combing through the woman's voluminous black hair.
"What do you love the most about your hair and what do you like the least?" Ms. De La Cruz asked the new client, Houleye Thiam, who had commuted to the salon from the outskirts of Paris, where many residents have to rely on uncertified hairdressers.
Ms. Thiam, 26, whose parents come from Senegal, wanted mahogany highlights and also to get some advice on how to moisturize her hair. She had spent her childhood braiding her hair because her mother couldn't afford much more, and only got what she called her first "real" haircut at 22.
"I am so happy," Ms. Thiam said some hours later, as she checked out the results in the mirror. "It's exactly what I wanted."

Unseen Legacy With Quiet Jewish Roots: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Gaby Aghion, Chloé's founder, didn't just make a brand for herself, she made one for all women.
For only the second time in its almost 120 years, the Jewish Museum is holding a fashion exhibition -- and it is the first in New York dedicated to Chloé, the French ready-to-wear brand founded in 1952 by the Egyptian-born designer Gaby Aghion. "Mood of the Moment: Gaby Aghion and the House of Chloé" seeks to rectify both oversights, while introducing its founder, and her connection to her own Jewish identity, to the broader public.
Born Gabrielle Hanoka in Alexandria in 1921, Aghion moved to Paris in 1945, after her marriage to Raymond Aghion, and opened Chloé -- named for a friend -- in 1952, at a time when designer-dictated couture (made-to-order clothes for the elite) still dominated the French fashion scene, and Jewish roots were kept relatively quiet. Though she wasn't formally trained, Aghion, who identified as a Communist, believed women needed something easier -- chicer, simpler, more whimsical -- to wear every day, and she set out to offer them just that, hiring an assortment of talented young designers to realize her vision and setting a template that would define the brand.
In 1966 Karl Lagerfeld joined the house, working closely with Aghion until 1983; in 1987, after Aghion sold the brand to the Richemont Group, Martine Sitbon stepped in as creative director, to be followed by Lagerfeld again (1992-1997), and seven more designers, including Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo and Clare Waight Keller. Aghion died in 2014, but the "Chloé girl" she created lived -- and lives -- on.
The exhibition seeks to foreground Aghion at the brand, repositioning Chloé as a historically important fashion name and giving the museum a pop culture edge. Whether it succeeds was the subject of a debate between Vanessa Friedman, the chief fashion critic for The New York Times, and Max Lakin, a contributing culture critic.
VANESSA FRIEDMAN Fashion shows in New York tend to land at the Met, the Brooklyn Museum, or specialist institutions like the Fashion Institute of Technology, which makes this show something of a black swan. So what exactly is going on here? Do you think this is a teachable moment about cultural preconceptions, an effort by the museum to reach a new audience, or both?
MAX LAKIN This is what intrigued me about siting this here. The Jewish Museum has mounted art-historically important exhibitions, though as you say, infrequently about fashion (their first was a buoyant Isaac Mizrahi survey in 2016). Yet this show only really addresses Aghion's Jewishness -- and, for that matter, Aghion herself -- sidelong, despite her being the nominally animating principle.
Aghion's biography basically takes up half of the first gallery, with photos of her lolling among the desert dunes of her youth, after which the show becomes a mostly linear brand history, from boutique upstart to global industry player. I don't necessarily think this is a curatorial failure: like the majority of diasporic Jewry, Aghion was largely secular; most designer-entrepreneurs did not foreground their Jewishness. ("Ralph Lauren" is of course the savvy Anglicization of Ralph Lifshitz.) She subsumed her own identity in the Chloé name, an invention she chose mostly because she liked the way the roundness of the letters looked together. Despite its consumer popularity, Chloé is relatively understudied, no?
FRIEDMAN Very understudied. In part, that's because museums tend to be either interested in fashion as: 1) an art form, or a textile art form, which means couture: the super-fancy clothes made for the very few; or 2) an expression of a sociocultural trend, in which case work from different brands makes the argument. It's rare for one show to focus on a single ready-to-wear brand such as Chloé. Yet that's what the Jewish Museum is doing, and it suggests that brand has something very important to say. But beyond simply giving Gaby Aghion credit where credit is due -- here is a Jewish female entrepreneur in a fashion world where those three words rarely get acknowledged as going together -- what, exactly, is that?
After seeing the show I'm not sure. The exhibition moves on from its founder fairly quickly through nine (count 'em!) other designers for the label, only one of whom identifies as Jewish (Stella McCartney) and two of whom were men.
LAKIN It's instructive to follow the progression of the design that's touched so many points of culture and how tastes have changed, but it's also very clearly brand service -- the bulk of the show is directly from the Chloé archive -- though it is not reminiscent of the kinds of "exhibitions" Vuitton or Gucci have given themselves in recent years, which are really walkable marketing campaigns. This is a sober exhibition with an argument, which is that an enormous part of fashion history -- Lagerfeld and McCartney and Philo -- doesn't happen without Aghion.
FRIEDMAN At least the show is not actually sponsored by Chloé, the way the recent Dior extravaganza at the Brooklyn Museum was underwritten by Dior, so it's not a brand advert, which is a good thing (the sheer fact that there is no part of the show devoted to perfume is a huge relief).
LAKIN It also credits Aghion with "elevated ready-to-wear" which predated Saint Laurent, and which is compelling. The fact that this is the legacy of a Jewish woman largely becomes subtext.
FRIEDMAN That is actually more than compelling -- it's potentially revolutionary. Saint Laurent, as you point out, is generally credited with creating ready-to-wear when he opened his Rive Gauche boutique in 1966, but Aghion had her first show featuring "elevated" off-the-rack clothes in 1956 at Café de Flore as friends breakfasted all around (she liked the idea of situating her models in the middle of the life where her clothes were meant to be worn).
To trumpet to the world that a Jewish woman in the 1950s actually was first to the post with this idea is quite a big deal. Especially given, as you point out, fashion's historic unease with its own Jewish roots. This is an industry, after all, that often still holds its ready-to-wear shows during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, making no concession to the Jewish High Holy Days in its scheduling.
LAKIN The exhibition moves as breezily as an organza tunic, and makes and abandons these points quickly, which to me was perhaps a concession to tight attention spans.
FRIEDMAN What comes across in the clothes, from the painterly early Lagerfeld dresses through his surreal period (the body as a violin! the body as a showerhead!), and on to Philo's gauzy nymphs and It bags and Waight Keller's ruffled urbanity, is the idea that Aghion set the easy-breezy-feminine tone that then launched so many careers. The room I found most interesting was the final blouse room, which features 50 different shirts from almost all of the designers of the label mixed in with each other, and begins to lay the groundwork for a common Chloé vocabulary and value system: pretty, undemanding, functional but not fussy. I almost wish the curators had started with that. Pointedly, the catalog does.
LAKIN The blouse room is an affecting tribute, beautiful to look at (and, not least of all, makes you slow down). It's an enveloping wall of diaphanous crepe chiffon and damasks in endless shades of creamy earth tones -- colors Aghion loved to wear because they reminded her of the Egyptian beaches of her youth. But it does also feel like here someone finally remembered what the point of the exhibition was supposed to be. I do wonder how much of Aghion's Egypt each successive designer thought about in creating a garment. Certainly every brand produces a delicate silk blouse?
FRIEDMAN Yes, but not always in desert tones with an abstract ruffle. My other favorite part of the exhibition: the fact the curators chose to show the garments on hangers rather than artsy mannequins. It gives the clothes an air of accessibility that seems authentic to the house and bolsters the argument that Aghion created Chloé -- and, again, the idea of ready-to-wear -- in part as a riposte to the prevailing stiffness of couture.
These curatorial choices also take away from the sense that you're seeing Important Fashion, a message on which museum costume shows are so often predicated. That's another subversive aspect to this show that is interesting, and makes it relatable. After all, one of the purposes of fashion in a museum is to attract an audience that otherwise might not see that institution as relevant to their lives. And I do think this show feels relevant, both politically, given what is going on in the world, and aesthetically.
LAKIN The exhibition makes a good case, probably inadvertently, that clarity doesn't always translate to elegance; McCartney and Gabriela Hearst, of the Chloé designers, are certainly the loudest here. Their designs, punkish, insouciant Y.B.A. -- for the Young British Artists of the '90s -- and wealthy Coachella attendee, respectively, seemed more interested in asserting their own vision than interpreting Aghion's ideas of lightness and ease. Sitbon and Waight Keller were perhaps more faithful to that vision, producing sensual, refined garments, and in Waight Keller's case, ones almost defiantly feminine and romantic.
FRIEDMAN I was struck by how hard it was to identify which piece came from which designer. When I was talking to the curators, Choghakate Kazarian and Kristina Parsons, they acknowledged that when you think of Chloé, you don't really think of a person. They wanted to change that, but after seeing the show I wonder if that was not actually the point: Gaby Aghion didn't make a brand for herself, she made one for all women. She deliberately left herself out. And try as they might, the curators can't quite get her back in.
LAKIN This is actually the most interesting part of the exhibition: contrapuntal to nearly every other founder-designer in fashion history, Aghion wasn't interested in becoming a brand name. She was after something modern -- an ease of dressing, and recognized it would take more people than she to accomplish: "I have no talent. I recognize the talent in others," she said. It's the difference between something like Expressionism, which overwhelms you with the virtuoso gesture of the artist, and Conceptualism, where the idea is the thing, which anyone could execute.
Aghion's insistence on ceding the mantle of the individualist ends up looking like a profound choice, and -- perhaps -- reflective of a kabbalist idea: "There are six hundred thousand letters in the Torah," each unique as every person is, but meaningless without the rest -- that our individual strengths are only fully pronounced in concert within the collective. The exhibition deliberately avoids this spiritualism, as it seems Aghion did. And yet, by dint of where the show is taking place, that spiritualism is invited. It's a triumph of her vision, one that's proven endlessly elastic, that we're still talking about it.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Throughout her four-decade career, the actress has become known for playing difficult women. But it's the difficulty of the roles themselves that really interests her.
THIS IS WHAT it means to command a room. Onscreen, the long-distance open-water swimmer Diana Nyad, as incarnated by Annette Bening in the new biopic "Nyad," does not slink, sashay or flounce. Watching her walk, it seems absurd that such verbs should even exist. After all, this is a woman who, having retired from her athletic career on her 30th birthday, decided at 60 -- an age at which many women find themselves shunted to the sidelines -- to revive a dream of swimming the more than 100 miles from Havana to Key West, Fla., through waters regularly roiled by storms and teeming with sharks and swarms of venomous box jellyfish, whose stings have been likened to electrocution by those fortunate enough to survive them. There's no strategic coyness to her stride, no adjustment to the wants of others. Bening's Nyad moves through the world absolutely certain of her place in it. Which is not to say smoothly: Rather, she fully occupies her body, fully is her body, attenuated perhaps with the toll of age, but still a compact of muscle and force, presence and weight. She possesses space. She concedes nothing.
For much of the film's two-month shoot in 2022, Bening, now 65, spent three to eight hours a day in the water, in a 233-by-233-foot tank off the coast of the Dominican Republic. Two stunt doubles stood idly by. The film's husband-and-wife directors, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, are no strangers to feats of athleticism and grit: Their Academy Award-winning documentary, "Free Solo" (2018), chronicles the American rock climber Alex Honnold's terrifying ascent without ropes or safety gear of the 3,000-foot cliff El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. But watching Bening, they were astounded. "The stunt coordinator said, 'This is crazy,"' Chin, 50, recalls. " 'Nobody does this."' She did long stints in a constricting full-body jellyfish-proof suit while wearing a silicone mask and acrylic retainers, which Nyad had used to keep jellyfish from slipping into her mouth and stinging her tongue -- a setup that made it tough to breathe. All the while Bening had to act, of course: the wild agony of a jellyfish attack, the disorientation as her strength fades.
In theater -- Bening's first love; she did not appear in a film until she was 30 -- truth is conjured out of scraps and sometimes less, and actors may take on any age or body type, without makeup or prosthetics, and be believed. But in film, a genre that visually collapses the distance between viewer and performer, more is required. Before "Nyad," Bening's most intensive ocean experience had been working as a cook on a scuba diving boat off San Diego when she was 16. So she started training with the American Olympic swimmer Rada Owen in 2021, a year before shooting. Owen "also coaches kids, so she was used to dealing with beginners," Bening tells me over a late breakfast in Los Angeles in June, under the brooding of the marine layer, calmly elegant in dark jeans and a plaid shirt unbuttoned two stops below the neck.
The first time she plunged into a pool after reading the script, she was almost immediately out of breath. "I had no idea what I was doing," she says. "But I liked that."
IN HER 35 years in film, Bening has shown a particular genius for characters who are themselves performers. Some are literally so, like the blithely dissolute movie extra in the 1990 comedy "Postcards From the Edge" (based on Carrie Fisher's novel of Hollywood misadventure), who pronounces the malapropism "endolphin rush" with dazzling self-assurance, and the imperious actresses of "Being Julia" (2004), "Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool" (2017) and "The Seagull" (2018): creatures of the stage who are unable to shake the habit of pretending when off, each with their own fine shadings of narcissism, coquetry and tenderness. Others bring a facade to their daily encounters, deploying charm to get what they want while holding their real selves in reserve, as with the small-time con artist in "The Grifters" (1990) who wears ditziness like a halo, her voice as sunny and juicy as an orange put to the squeezer, and the ravenous-to-succeed real estate agent in "American Beauty" (1999), with her metronomic mantras and immaculately disheveled hair, which with each scene grows more vertical and more like a barely tamed animal, ready to spring.
Her latest role might seem a departure: a woman with no apparent interest in the social niceties of artifice. "It was liberating," she says, to play someone so free to pursue what she wants. Yet her version of Nyad is also eyeing the crowd, with the marathon swim as her greatest performance, a bid for the history books and an audience for eternity. What fascinated Bening about the character in the script -- and she's careful to note the distinction between the actual Nyad, 74, whom she befriended while making the film and says is "incredibly warm and charming," and the domineering persona she plays onscreen, whose thorniest traits give the narrative arc and momentum -- was in part the swimmer's fanatical devotion to her mission. (Because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, which started in July, Nyad, a sports commentator, wasn't available for an interview.) Bening is drawn to obsessives: She talks admiringly of the 2022 documentary "Turn Every Page," about the maniacally meticulous biographer Robert Caro, and those who in their drive to master their craft exhibit a sometimes excessive desire for control over not only themselves but the world around them.
She tells me how one night in high school, when she was the lead in a play, during intermission the theater teacher picked up a table and slammed it down on the floor because she thought the cast lacked energy. "She wanted to wake us up," Bening says, still marveling at the memory. "I was in awe." The actress loved the disproportionality of it, of caring so much. Too much. "For people who are doing serious things like brain surgery, that's a different matter," she says, but "in our case, or with any creative act, it's not rational to care so much.
"That whole thing about caring -- I still feel it," she says. "And when I notice it in myself, because I'm older now, I go, 'What is that?' The thing that keeps you up at night. Sometimes I can't sleep. I want to sleep."
Although Bening has portrayed a number of historic figures -- among them Senator Dianne Feinstein in "The Report" (2019) -- she had never done a full-fledged biopic. She's tended instead to gravitate toward original material, projects that rely on the imaginations of writers and that are increasingly under threat as studios turn to what they call I.P., or intellectual property, pre-existing entertainment that comes with a built-in fan base. One approach to the biopic is the kind of deep, uncanny impersonation that has won accolades for actors like Austin Butler in last year's "Elvis." (Nyad, an openly gay athlete, was already a public figure -- having set long-distance swimming records in her 20s -- before the fame that came with her Cuba-to-Florida swim.) But Bening knew that for the sake of her latest film's narrative success, she needed to burrow further into the character's dark corners, "wanting to portray her in a way that's authentic," she says, "but at the same time have some laughs and tell a story that people enjoy."
Bening has long been heralded for playing so-called difficult women, from the monumentally self-absorbed poet manqué in "Running With Scissors" (2006) to the impatiently efficient doctor with a drifty wife in "The Kids Are All Right" (2010), convinced that she alone is keeping her family afloat (she's not wrong). "It's not about quote-unquote strong women," she says. "That's really boring, to only have stories about strong people. We need to know: What are their faults? Their blind spots? We all have them."
Sometimes audiences resist, wanting more gold-hearted heroines to root for. "She captures female intelligence, power and strength," says the director Mike Mills, 57, who entrusted Bening with a role inspired by his mother in the quietly profound and profoundly funny "20th Century Women" (2016). "Which the world isn't always ready for." After "Nyad" premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September, an article in Variety suggested that the title character might be too "challenging" for viewers -- in other words, hard to love. In any script, Bening sees herself as her character's "advocate," she says. "I felt very protective of Diana. Can you imagine someone playing you -- how vulnerable you would feel?" (Bening says that the two of them "ended up being able to talk very frankly," and when Nyad visited the set, they swam together in the ocean.) Vasarhelyi, 44, recalls deep conversations over a tricky scene in which the swimmer tries to bulldoze her navigator into going back out to sea after he's told her the weather conditions are too dangerous. Bening experimented with different registers, testing how far she could take the character's reckless disregard for the lives of others without crossing the line into villainy. But there's no malice to her Nyad, just a single-minded ambition of the type that tends to be applauded in male leads (see, most recently, Cillian Murphy in "Oppenheimer").
"How to get it right?" she asks. "It's always a bit of a gamble. When you're making something, you just don't know."
WHEN BENING WAS trying to break into films in her late 20s, after seven years as a stage actress in San Francisco, Denver and New York (where she made her Broadway debut in 1987 in Tina Howe's "Coastal Disturbances" as a young woman oscillating between neurosis and rapture, for which she earned her first Tony nomination), she auditioned for "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988), an adaptation of a play based on Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's barbed 18th-century novel about the antics of restless aristocrats. Hardly any lines were on offer -- she was up for the role of the saucy courtesan on whose alabaster backside the libertine Valmont pens a letter -- and she didn't get the part. But shortly after, in an odd and maybe karmic coincidence, she instead landed one of the leads, the Marquise de Merteuil, in Milos Forman's "Valmont" (1989), which draws from the same material.
By then, Glenn Close, in the 1988 version, had made the character her own. Rarely do you get to see two world-class actresses go head-to-head in the same role at almost the same time, although at that point Close already had four Oscar nominations under her belt and Bening, 11 years younger, had no Hollywood credits beyond a few minutes on a 1987 episode of "Miami Vice" and a single film, the largely unnoticed 1988 farce "The Great Outdoors." Where Close as Merteuil is scornfully magisterial, Bening is silkily sly, half-kitten, half-snake. "Dangerous Liaisons" is the greater film: It gives the antics of its louche characters the heft of tragedy, which is a kind of redemption. "Valmont," which flopped in its rival's wake, is frothier and thus ultimately bleaker. You can hear the devastation coming in Bening's laughter when she reveals to Valmont, her ex-lover, that she's been sleeping with a younger man. Even as she laughs -- and keeps laughing, cruelly, triumphantly and then fraying into hysteria -- she knows she's gone too far; that this is a Pyrrhic victory, a blow from which they, but above all she, will never recover.
"She's so deft that way, to be serious and funny at the same time, to flip that switch so fast," says Lisa Cholodenko, 59, who directed Bening in "The Kids Are All Right." An entire taxonomy could be organized around Bening's laughter, which spans octaves, from Champagne bubbles to the peatiest depths of Scotch. Bening can do more with a laugh than most actors do with whole monologues. In "American Beauty," humiliated at a party by her husband's flat-affect revelations, she comes close to opera, with a cascade of giggles ascending into little high near yips. Her bit-part floozy in "Postcards From the Edge" has only three minutes of screen time but makes of it an incandescence, opposite Meryl Streep, no less, offering at one point a low, worldly chuckle, then dropping her jaw so the sound kicks up to the roof of her mouth and becomes an almost conspiratorial snicker. There's a tinge of one-upmanship -- she and Streep's character have bedded the same man -- but so faint that, were she accused of such a thing, she could bat her lashes and claim plausible deniability.
This ability to tap into ever-shifting microclimates of mood may have saved Bening early on from being defined (and confined) by her looks. Forman, who cast her in "Valmont," clearly saw how she could use the appearance of vulnerability as a weapon, with her delicate, fine-boned face blossoming upward like a heart. So did the director Stephen Frears, who passed on her for "Dangerous Liaisons" but a year later gave her what would become her breakout role, as Myra Langtry, the giddily upbeat con artist in "The Grifters." Here again Bening evades the obvious, rejecting the standard markers of a femme fatale. When a jeweler tells Langtry, not unkindly, that the goods she hopes to sell are fake, she stops at the door on the way out, closes her eyes and smiles, so purely that it's not even a con, and turns, beaming, to offer the jeweler the "one thing" she has left. "You're looking right at it," she says and, instead of bravado or desperation, what comes through in her voice is the bright pop of optimism: the expectation that, no matter how cornered, through sheer willpower she can manifest an escape.
The tabloid headline from Bening's star turn in "Bugsy" (1991), released when she was 33, was that she'd won the heart of the film's lead, Warren Beatty, 21 years her senior and, for three decades, Hollywood's most tenacious bachelor. While the film was still being edited, Bening announced that she was pregnant, and the couple married in 1992; they had their 31st anniversary this year. In the clamor over their love story, it was easy to miss the radical refusal at the heart of her performance as the gun moll Virginia Hill, who doesn't tease in the way of a classic siren so much as lay down terms, and who insists on treating her gangster lover as an equal.
If there's a through line in Bening's work, it's how her characters seem ever to be negotiating their status as objects of desire -- although what they're really grappling with is power: how to get it, wield it and keep it, in a world threatening to take it away at every step, which closely tracks the shifts in the zeitgeist from decade to decade. She has a knack for appearing in films that define the moment: "The Grifters," which is based on a 1963 novel and speaks to the amoral avarice of boom-time America in the Reagan years; "American Beauty," a commentary on the spiritual dead end of American prosperity; "The Kids Are All Right," with its relaxed, matter-of-fact treatment of gay marriage. When I ask if this is a quality she explicitly looks for in a script, she demurs: "It's all in the writing," she says, adding that it's important to remember that in the midst of the Writers Guild of America strike.
Part of the battle sometimes is simply claiming the leading role, if only in her characters' own lives. There's a parallel here to Hollywood itself, which remains resistant to the idea of the older woman as the protagonist. Bening has defied that to a certain extent: "Nyad" is the eighth film in which she's played a major role in the past decade. Not all found success at the box office. "I've made so many movies that nobody paid any attention to," she says. "In my profession, you do a lot that people aren't interested in -- but we are." While making "Nyad," she says, it struck her that "it wouldn't have mattered" if Nyad had never completed the swim; if she had just tried and tried again, always falling short and always rallying for a return, however stung, swollen, battered and sapped of strength. Until "the efforting," as Bening puts it, became an achievement itself.
THE ACTRESS HAS appeared in nearly 40 films throughout her career, and yet in recent years she's been somewhat out of the public eye, less visible than some of her peers, like Angela Bassett, Frances McDormand, Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton. This is hardly for a lack of ambition. Rather, she seems, almost anachronistically, not particularly interested in putting herself forward, beyond the screen. Ask Bening about herself and you may discover that you're suddenly talking about someone else. She's a master at the gentle deflection and quick to praise the contributions of others, saying that one of the perks of the job is being surrounded by interesting people who are passionate about what they do, from the underwater photographer Pete Zuccarini, who shot pictures on the "Nyad" set ("He takes this gigantic breath and then he goes down") to her "beast" of a co-star Jodie Foster, who plays Nyad's best friend and reluctant coach with equal parts generosity and exasperation ("She's a badass, and she doesn't suffer fools and she's smart as hell").
This attunement to others is in part a reflection of Bening's time on the stage, where the bond of the ensemble is paramount. "There's a built-in selfishness to film acting," says the playwright and actor Tracy Letts, 58, who starred alongside Bening in "All My Sons" on Broadway in 2019. The theater demands a kind of self-effacement in which, he says, "your concern is not making yourself look good but making everybody around you look good."
Letts wondered if Bening's gifts -- "I'm a bit wistful that we might've lost the great American theater actress to films" -- could be attributed to her "Midwestern sensibility." She was born in Topeka, Kan., spent her early childhood in Wichita and still thinks of her family as Midwestern, even though they moved to San Diego when she was 7. A trace of Midwestern propriety clung to her the first time she met with movie agents in New York when she was 25: "I remember seeing another girl who was in jeans and looked really casual and kind of hip, and I was in this little suit, a skirt and blouse," she recalls. Even now, despite more than half a lifetime in Los Angeles -- she and Beatty, 86, are known for presiding over lively dinner parties ("If you go to that household, you've got to be prepared to talk about politics and 20th-century history," Mills says) -- something of the Midwest persists in her public manner, that paradox of simultaneous warmth and reserve. For our breakfast, she chooses an unassuming neighborhood spot in the San Fernando Valley where the waiter treats her exactly as he treats me, with no special deference. When I tell Bening that after our meeting I'm visiting my father-in-law, who lives nearby, she offers to give me a ride.
You could argue that the ensemble is in fact Bening's natural habitat. She was the last of four children born within five years, and she and Beatty have four children of their own. (Only the youngest, Ella Beatty, 23, is an actress, too, and graduated from Juilliard last year.) When Bening had their first child, she was startled to find that she'd lost her desire to act, though she's uneasy with the idealization of motherhood, "what a good mother is or isn't -- what a good woman is or isn't -- and is that defined by sacrificing the self?" Nevertheless, there were roles she turned down -- famously, Catwoman in "Batman Returns" (1992) -- because she was pregnant or didn't want to be away from her children for too long. "The thing that being in the theater really teaches you is that sense of mutual vulnerability and mutual purpose," she says, which could as easily be a description of a family. "She's really close to her parents," Vasarhelyi says. Bening's mother, now 94, was a stay-at-home mom who sang in church; her father, who died in September at the age of 97, sold insurance. Up until his death, they still lived in the same ranch-style house in the neighborhood that Bening grew up in, San Carlos.
While in high school, Bening did some secretarial work for her father, who was teaching classes on Dale Carnegie's principles of salesmanship. Foremost among them: being interested in other people. The key is not faking it. You have to genuinely care.
BENING'S PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION as Nyad is remarkable, rigorous and free of vanity. But equally so, perhaps, is the transformation she's undergone onscreen and off over the past two decades: her acceptance of the steady, mundane process of aging, which so many in Hollywood, female and male, have tried to defy. In casting the role, Vasarhelyi says, "We needed an actor who wasn't afraid of what a 64-year-old looks like."
Not that Bening thinks her decision to forgo cosmetic alterations is in any way noble. "There's all this pressure on women to have plastic surgery," she says. "And then when they do, they're punished for it." She hardly set out to be a flag-bearer for aging gracefully, whatever that means. "You do it as you go," Bening says. "As I've been inching along, I've felt more and more free." She remembers, from her childhood, her mother slathering on Noxzema or Ponds. That was it. When her mother went out, she "had her eyebrows done and her lipstick on," Bening says. "Now I'm just down to the lipstick." As if on cue, she pulls a lipstick out of her bag and slides on the color without breaking eye contact, no mirror required. It's a reminder of how much of beauty is aura and certainty -- knowing who you are, that you have a place in the world.
"Am I thrilled every time I see my wrinkles? No," she says. "But when I thought about being an actress, I always imagined it happening over my whole lifetime. That was my aspiration." The trouble -- and this is a banality -- is that Hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with older actresses who aren't straining to look younger. In the 1990s, Bening was consistently paired onscreen with older men: Michael Douglas (a 14-year gap), Robert De Niro (15), Harrison Ford (16) and Beatty (21). Then the pendulum swung and, in "Being Julia," she was 22 years older than her callow (and frankly boring) lover, played by Shaun Evans, and 18 years older than Corey Stoll in "The Seagull" (2018). She reunited with her husband onscreen for "Rules Don't Apply" in 2016, only she, at 58, was relegated to the role of mother of the young starlet, whom he -- at age 79, playing Howard Hughes -- seduces.
In an early scene in "Nyad," Bening, restless and keyed up, slashes at a Ping-Pong ball. "I'm not done," she says. "I have more in me." Now, in this improvised restaurant backyard abutting a parking lot, with AstroTurf below and the June gloom over the valley starting to clear, Bening is unruffled. She acknowledges that she's privileged to be able to choose whether to work or not; to take only the jobs she wants. "But there's always something I want," she says, her voice sinking almost to her ribs. She doesn't move, but it's as if she's leaned in. There's a flicker in her eyes -- wickedness? exultation? -- and it's gone.

Full text: The designer Rebecca Schoneveld provides an inside look at how she prepares for New York Bridal Fashion Week.
For the last decade or so, the designer Rebecca Schoneveld, who plans to relocate her to studio to Pleasantville, N.Y. next month, has participated in more than a dozen bridal fashion shows, sometimes presenting twice in one year. Although her designs change with each season, her process remains the same.
"I start with the fabric, that's most important," said Ms. Schoneveld, 40, who usually begins working on her collection around six months before the presentation. "It's the visual and textural foundation."
This year, Ms. Schoneveld presented her spring 2024 line at New York Bridal Fashion Week, which took place Oct. 10-12. She debuted her designs at the Horizon Bridal Showcase, a white-box space near Hudson Yards in Manhattan that some bridal designers have used to showcase their newest collections.
To get an insider's feel for what goes into presenting a collection, I followed Ms. Schoneveld's journey to creating her line, from conception to completion -- and every step in between. Here is an edited and condensed summary, in Ms. Schoneveld's own words, about how the collection took shape.
The Concept
For this collection, I was drawn to subtly intricate designs that were clean and airy. Two story lines emerged. One was almost translucent, and romantically textured with shapes that were a nod to midcentury American fashion. This included lots of 3-D florals, corsets with full skirts à la Dior's "new look," crisply tailored garments worn with gloves, and the perfect sunglasses.
The other story spoke to a sensual, Old Hollywood red carpet moment. There are bias-cut Italian crepe-satin gowns, styled with fluid capes; hand-beaded featherweight sheath dresses; and pieces with whimsical embroidery reminiscent of a stained-glass butterfly wing.
The Starting Point
All year, I research and collect fabrics and construction details and silhouette ideas. But my real start is in January at the Première Vision New York textile show, because they are two years ahead of the market. I'm looking for standouts, themes, and what's trending. For example, I fell in love with a Chantilly-style lace made of hand-pressed satin daisies from a Dutch textile design house that became the anchor point for my collection. I ordered 10 yards of eight different fabrics and waited two months for them to arrive from the mills.
Arrivals
Fabrics arrive by March or April. I spend time connecting with them to see how pliable and fluid they are, how the light shines through them and how they move with your body. Brides want to look fresh, but not too weird. They want beautiful and interesting. I make a list of fabrics I feel strongly about. Then, in an old-fashioned sketchbook, I draft a grid of minuscule rough sketches.
The Design Process
From May to June, the collection goes from visuals on paper to sample dresses. During this time, I'll make up to 35 dresses in my studio to consider. I start with a sketch, then make a flat pattern, tailor the mock-up, do a round of fittings, and then cut the piece out of the true fabric, which turns into the dress. During several revisions, my tailor and I adjust details like the boning placement and skirt construction.
Prototypes
By mid-July, I've completed half of my prototypes. The other dresses arrive from factories overseas that I've sent designs to. This is the point where I start to see the whole picture come together. I physically try on everything to see how it looks and feels. I also use models. If it needs tweaking, we do alterations -- lowering a waist seam or adjusting a neckline shape.
Visual Storytelling
At this point, I have racks filled with gowns that are mostly done. I start to see what's working and what's not. This collection specifically speaks to my sense of beauty and strength. I'm making wearable art that others will put on their bodies and celebrate life in, so I need to make sure each piece is successful on its own but doesn't rob attention from another dress. They need to be cohesive. The dresses go on models; I take photos and scrutinize every design detail. Some pieces I don't love as much; others are wonderful but don't fit the collection. Those get moved to the back room for future contemplation. Winning pieces get a last round of alterations and styling adjustments.
Hard Edits
By mid-September, I've narrowed 35 pieces down to 20. Then I name each dress. They all have a personality, and it's an emotional choice for a bride to choose. Naming it gives the dress more life. "Vaughn" is far easier to love and wear than, say, "Style 103." With these designs, I'm helping people feel seen and celebrated, which is a very special thing to do.
Organization
Preparation for the bridal market begins a week later. I start styling -- pairing gowns with veils, capes and shoes. I make a shot list of every look for the photographer. Casting for models happens; hair and makeup stylists are hired. This year, we did a two-day video and photo shoot, as I want to capture multiple sizes on different models.
Final Steps
The pieces are now completed. An empowered, sensual, evocative and artistic experience has evolved during this process. I really care about representing women the fashion world has traditionally ignored. I had two models at the show, a size 10 and 20. Over those three days of the show, influencers, editors, buyers from stores and other designers saw my collection. As exhausting as it was, and although the work often feels solitary, when I do a show like this with other designers, new and old, I leave feeling inspired for the next round.

Miuccia Prada: [TGreats]

Full text: The designer reimagined fashion's relationship to art -- and forever transformed what the world considers beautiful.
EVEN BEFORE HEADING from the Fondazione Prada, a contemporary art complex housed in an old distillery on the southeastern edge of Milan, to Miuccia Prada's office about a mile away, I'm reminded of her towering presence everywhere I look. A docent, dressed in a black Prada uniform, shepherds a pair of tourists, both carrying Prada handbags, into a screening of "Four Unloved Women, Adrift on a Purposeless Sea, Experience the Ecstasy of Dissection," a short film by the Canadian director David Cronenberg accompanied by a wunderkammer of 18th-century anatomical wax sculptures. Once outside, I pass an abandoned rail yard and billboards for two other Fondazione exhibitions: a permanent re-creation of the home studio in Switzerland where Jean-Luc Godard edited his final movie, and a survey of videos, photographs and other works by the New York-based artist Dara Birnbaum on view at the Osservatorio, a satellite venue overlooking Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the shopping arcade where Mario Prada, Miuccia's maternal grandfather, opened the brand's first store in 1913. Down another few blocks, an old woman in a pair of Prada sunglasses walks by with her dog.
At 75, Mrs. Prada, as she's known to strangers and friends alike, is perhaps the most peculiar and certainly the most innovative fashion designer of her generation. In 1975, she took over her family's leather goods business. Two years later, she met her future husband, Patrizio Bertelli, now 77 and the chairman of the Prada Group, with whom she began building a global empire. (In 2022, the company's annual revenue was $ 4.5 billion.) In addition to Prada, the couple has ownership stakes in Miu Miu, which might be described as Prada's unruly niece; the footwear brands Church's and Car Shoe; and the Pasticceria Marchesi pastry shops. (As of last year, they can also claim some of those dusty train tracks: Prada Holding, which owns 80 percent of the Prada Group and is controlled by the Prada family, is one of three entities that acquired the plot of disused land for roughly $ 190 million to convert it into a park, housing, offices and the Olympic Village for the 2026 Winter Games.)
Those with no interest in fashion have at least seen the house's triangular logo and know Prada's name, whether through movies (in 1999's teen comedy "10 Things I Hate About You," a student explains, "There's a difference between like and love. Because I like my Skechers, but I love my Prada backpack") and TV shows (in a 2019 episode of "The Simpsons," Homer relieves himself behind "Prada Marfa," a replica of a Prada store created in 2005 near Marfa, Texas, by the artists Elmgreen & Dragset), books (Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel, "The Devil Wears Prada," which became a hit film) or music (Beyoncé, Doja Cat and Drake have all name-checked the brand). And yet no matter how far and wide her influence extends, Prada hasn't made it easy to know her, which is, like everything she does, deliberate.
Upon my arrival at the Prada headquarters, a set of stern buildings that occupy approximately 108,000 square feet, I'm confronted by my potential expulsion: the notorious stainless-steel slide connecting the designer's third-floor work space to the courtyard. The German artist Carsten Höller, who installed it in 2000, says it was intended to help her "leave quickly, traveling through the floor under her office to have a glance at the people working there and then land right where her chauffeur is waiting." But, he adds, "It's also a good way to get rid of people."
INTERVIEWING MIUCCIA PRADA, unlike talking to her, can be a tricky enterprise. From her desk in an austere room with white walls and poured concrete floors -- what might be mistaken for an operating theater, were it not for the Gerhard Richter painting and a silver bar cart stacked with cookies -- she seems to begin every other sentence with, "Between us. ..." She is 5-foot-4, with hazel eyes and wavy blond hair, and has the measured confidence of someone who's about to deliver the bad news first. Despite her warmth and frequent laughter, she also seems ready, maybe even eager, to spar. She, too, is recording the conversation and taking notes. When I ask what she does to relax, her answer is "no."
Although she's less inscrutable than her intellectual peers -- Rei Kawakubo rarely speaks to journalists; Martin Margiela never has -- she's certainly not as flamboyant as Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana or Donatella Versace, flashier designers from the height of Italy's sex-bomb era. And while she refuses to acknowledge personal achievements ("I leave it to other people to say what I did," she says), she's not above engaging in some mythmaking of her own: There's a reason her last fragrance was called Paradoxe.
"If Harvard was a billionaire woman, it would be Miuccia Prada," says the Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli, her close friend and frequent travel companion. The Belgian stylist Olivier Rizzo, who has worked with her since 2005, tells me she's changed the way we dress and think about clothing "on every possible level on all levels forever and ever." She's "a challenger," says the Italian creative director Ferdinando Verderi, who has consulted for the brand since 2019. "She'd even challenge the idea of being a challenger." The American artist Theaster Gates, chairman of Prada's Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, says, "If you're trying to get a character sketch of Miuccia, she's [expletive] sincere. And sincerity is better than being right all the time." The actress Uma Thurman, who developed a relationship with the designer after wearing a lilac Prada gown to the 1995 Oscars, likens her to "a growing tree, letting herself have new barks," while the musician Frank Ocean, who was photographed for the brand's spring 2020 campaign, draws an analogy between her "tone," he says -- "how she resonates, basically" -- and the meditative sound of om. The Italian gallerist Carla Sozzani, the founder of the 10 Corso Como concept store in Milan, who remembers "applauding like children" with her friend at runway shows in the 1970s, says, "Some people are more reserved when they're in public. I'm not saying she's another person [in private], but she's more open."
Though that might be accurate, it's also true that no other female designer has produced such a robust body of autobiographical work. (The punk iconoclast Vivienne Westwood came closest; one screamed, the other sublimates.) Prada may not seem especially eager to reveal herself in conversation, but she's always communicated more freely through her clothes, which make the case against what she calls "cliché beauty" and "the isolation of fashion." Instead, she has grounded her work in the idea of a uniform -- she's as likely to find inspiration in nuns as in sex workers -- craving the proximity to what she considers more noble, or at least more honest, professions. If Yves Saint Laurent created a wardrobe for the modern woman in the 1960s, then Prada, a champion of bad taste and the jolie laide, gave her permission to be weird and mercurial; to be, in a sense, her. "One of the reasons I started doing clothes was because I couldn't find anything to wear," she says.
It's almost as if she comes up with her designs because they could be -- and maybe so that they will be -- deemed unflattering or unsexy. "She's always looking for something that's unseen," says the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova, who consults for Miu Miu, which was established in 1993 as a less intellectualized and slightly less expensive alternative to Prada. Earlier this year, at Miu Miu's fall 2023 show in Paris, some of the models wore underwear as outerwear; many had frizzy hair and cowlicks. The British hairstylist Guido Palau, who contributed to his first Prada show in 2004, says that the designer wanted the models to look as if they'd been caught in a gust of wind. A few seasons earlier, for Miu Miu's spring 2022 collection, Prada delivered raw-edge chino micro-miniskirts belted below the hip bone. "Sometimes it's the breasts, sometimes it's the back," she says about fashion's obsession with the female form. "What wasn't trendy was the lower waist, so I said, 'Let's make it as low as possible."' The garment, which was her way of poking fun at things like fashion magazines, showed up in all of them.
"It's a lot about being against something," she says. Prada's spring 1996 collection, its first of many "ugly chic" offerings, incorporated jarring colors (rust, mustard and "bile green," as one critic would call it) and banal prints (later described as "Formica"), a response to the relentless sex appeal at the time of brands like Gucci, then stewarded by Tom Ford. But for fall 2002, to avoid being reduced to her somewhat prim, vaguely retro aesthetic -- which had, however improbably, come to define Italian style as much as an Armani suit -- she released what became known as a "porno chic" collection of transparent PVC coats and knee-high black leather boots. "Clothes were never about doing clothes," she says. "It's about living different parts of your personality."
PRADA STILL RESIDES in the Milanese apartment where she and her two older siblings, Marina and Alberto, grew up. In 1958, her mother, Luisa Prada -- a "beautiful, elegant lady," says Sozzani -- took over Miuccia's grandfather's shop, which she then ran for nearly 20 years. Her father, Luigi Bianchi, owned a company that made putting-green mowers. The details of that period bore her. "Nothing bad, nothing good," she says. But she sits a bit straighter when it comes to her teenage years. "That," she says, "was the big political moment."
While enrolled at the University of Milan (where she also earned a Ph.D. in political science), Miu Miu, as she'd been known to her family since childhood, joined the youth-led demonstrations and worker strikes that became referred to across Europe as the protests of 1968 (an era that in Italy would morph into the violent Years of Lead). "I really believed we could transform the world," says Prada, who also studied mime for five years at Milan's Piccolo Teatro. When she was a young member of the Union of Italian Women, a feminist offshoot of the Communist Party, the films of Godard and Pier Paolo Pasolini, both avowed Marxists then, greatly influenced her; fashion, on the other hand, was considered an inconsequential pursuit. "I was ashamed," she says. "But nevertheless, I pursued it because I liked it."
She was also compelled by a sense of duty. "I started kind of against my will," she admits. "Somehow it just happened." A couple of years after taking control of the company, she attended a trade show where she met Bertelli, who had recently given up on an engineering degree to run a leather factory that manufactured belts and bags. "We started as competition, and we're still competing," she says fondly. "In the end, that's something that keeps us together."
People tend to speak about Bertelli, a shrewd industrialist who collects vintage sports cars and sails several yachts -- and with whom Prada has two children, Lorenzo Bertelli, 35, the Prada Group's head of corporate social responsibility, and Giulio Bertelli, 33, a sailboat racer -- as if they were describing a movie villain they're secretly rooting for. "He has amazing charm," says Sozzani. "You have to love Bertelli. Or you don't." Francesco Risso, Marni's creative director and a member of Prada's design team for eight years until 2016, recalls "the most theatrical fights" between the couple. "It didn't feel unhealthy ever, but it felt like fireworks, that's for sure," he says. But as much as they might bicker -- he was initially against, for example, her decision to do a sneaker collaboration; she released it anyway -- Bertelli is also quite protective of her: Seldom does one approach Prada about a project without going through him first.
"If I hadn't met my husband, I don't know if I would've done this job," says Prada, who set out opening factories with Bertelli and creating an international brand for "good women, bad women -- the richness of all these different people." The designer, who has no formal training and doesn't sketch, begins each collection with concepts rather than silhouettes. One of her earliest pieces, in 1984, was a statement of intent: a modest backpack made not from crocodile or calfskin but black Pocono, an army-grade nylon more commonly associated at the time with parachutes than with purses. Nearly 40 years later, that utilitarian bag and its many iterations remain unlikely objects of desire. "Any bourgeois subject that I approached," she says, "I always wanted to destroy it." (Well, maybe not any bourgeois subject: "You shouldn't eat, you shouldn't drink, you should just work and work and work," Risso recalls Prada telling him at one of his first staff meetings. "I could see that she was trying to push me to be better.")
With the 1988 debut of her ready-to-wear line -- some models came out in black and brown jackets inspired by men's tailoring, others in hot pink dresses with 1950s silhouettes; almost all of them in flats -- she introduced house codes that now include specific garments and accessories (knee-length skirts, bucket hats) and signature styles (geometric prints, color blocking). It's often said that she and her trusted design director, Fabio Zambernardi (who is leaving the brand this month after more than three decades), determine the trends one season that others follow the next, which, though true, is incomplete; the clothes are only one part of it. At some point, it became almost obligatory for luxury brands to mount cultural, educational or philanthropic initiatives. But back then, she was the only one. "Basically, now every fashion house is a cultural platform," says Vezzoli. "Bottega Veneta does a show with Gaetano Pesce chairs and Gaetano Pesce becomes the most sought-after Italian designer. Saint Laurent produces a movie for Pedro Almodóvar. But Prada did it 30 years ago."
The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, whose research and design studio, AMO, has created the environments for every Prada show since 2004, says that each season the conversation starts with a word or two to "trigger intentions." The prompts for the spring 2024 men's presentation, which featured curtains of slime dripping from the ceiling down to an industrial steel grate on the floor -- the cascading goo also made an appearance at September's spring 2024 women's show -- were "creepy," "flesh and skin" and "organic minimalism." James Jean, a Taiwanese American painter who in 2007 designed the wallpaper for the brand's SoHo store (his drawings of fantastical creatures and flowers were later printed on Art Nouveau-inspired skirts, trousers and bags for the spring 2008 collection), recalls their project beginning with three adjectives: "romantic," "nonlinear" and "surreal." The French sound artist Frédéric Sanchez, who has scored most Prada shows since the mid-90s, was, in a similar way, also creating for an idea of clothes rather than a finished garment. "With Margiela," says Sanchez about his other longtime collaborator, "it was very physical"; sometimes they'd even repeat the same soundtrack season after season. His experience with Prada, he says, has been more "cerebral."
It's difficult to overstate how radically Prada has changed the landscape of contemporary luxury, a word she hates ("hate," on the other hand, is one she really likes). These days, every reference seems to lead back to her, whether it's a padded headband or a utility vest. Such a fixture is Prada on other designers' mood boards that for her spring 2000 collection -- which she referred to as "the ABC of fashion" -- she paid homage not only to the work of Yves Saint Laurent but also, rather cheekily, to her own, in the form of reinterpreted cardigans and schoolboy shorts. And yet, what Prada has put out into the world feels more substantial and transgressive than a khaki crop top or the very notion of so-called quiet luxury -- both things, mind you, that came from her. "It's much cooler than being eccentric," says the designer Marc Jacobs, a friend of hers. "With Mrs. Prada, it's that thing of style with substance. It's not just a shell that looks good."
THE SOUL OF the Fondazione Prada is the Haunted House, a four-story gilded tower that contains work by the sculptors Robert Gober and Louise Bourgeois. On the second floor, there's a Bourgeois installation called "Cell (Clothes)" (1996), in which pants and dresses appear to be trapped by a ring of wooden doors. On the top floor, there's a 2010 wax sculpture by Gober of a child's leg -- almost Prada-like in a white sandal and matching ankle sock -- weighed down by an anchor. There are no other clothes on this floor. Instead, Gober has installed a storm drain with water running beneath it. Under the metal bars, among the rocks and debris, sits an illuminated heart -- discarded, but still beating.
Journalists inevitably like to bring up Prada's political past, and not just because she likes to bring it up, too -- though as a New Yorker article about her from 2004 notes, "in the '60s it was almost a rite of passage for thousands of young middle-class Italians" to join the Communist Party. Prada, however, does seem to have a genuine need to reconcile the idealism of her youth with the choices she's made since; and if ambivalence can be paralyzing, in her case it appears to have had the opposite effect. In 1993, her days of on-the-ground protest behind her -- she'd long stopped handing out flyers at rallies -- Prada and Bertelli created Milano Prada Arte, which later became the Fondazione Prada. It would give them a place to house their growing art collection but, for Prada, it also became a way to funnel her revolutionary spirit -- and her money. "I tell my people in the Fondazione all the time to thank me," she says. "I have to sell a lot of expensive handbags to run a museum." ("Handbags are not art," the British sculptor and painter Damien Hirst, a friend, recalls her saying. "Whereas when you meet other people, they're constantly telling you that they are art, and you need 100.")
From the beginning, Prada has been dutifully managing and scrutinizing every detail of the Fondazione's programming -- even showing up at Gober's studio in Manhattan to convince him to contribute. Gober remembers that when she appeared on his doorstep, she said, "Like everything else, I have to do this myself!" (Her exit was equally quotable: When Gober sent her home with some books, she took one look at the tote bag he offered and said, "I'll carry them.") In 1999, she and Bertelli dropped in on Koolhaas at his studio in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. "They were bored with their stores," Koolhaas says, and wanted him to oversee the construction of their New York flagship. "All my friends in the art world, or let's say in the cultural sector, were extremely skeptical whether this would be a desirable collaboration," he says. Koolhaas reimagined the Epicenter, as it's called, on the site of what was once the Guggenheim Museum's SoHo location, with an undulating wood floor and motorized hanging displays. In 2008, OMA, Koolhaas's firm, was hired to design the Fondazione Prada.
Thirty years in, having worked tirelessly to earn her place in the art world, Prada has chosen to become the new director of the foundation. "My main track is [the Fondazione Prada]," she says. "I'd decided that I wanted to keep it separate from fashion. And no one knew -- I never told anybody." As she deliberates over what to say next, I'm reminded of something that the filmmaker Wes Anderson -- who's partnered with her on various film and art projects and who designed Bar Luce, the 1950s-style cafe at the Fondazione Prada -- told me. "You quickly sense her vulnerability, which can sort of disappear from a person with such authority. I think without a bit of that, you can't quite reach them. She can be fearless, but I don't think she's fearless," he wrote in an email. "Maybe it's because I'm getting older," Prada continues, "but I want to reconcile my whole life and declare my job: I run the Fondazione."
"She's properly a patron," says Hirst. "She really, genuinely sees art as something beneficial to other people." And unlike almost every other collector who tells him they're building a museum, he says, she actually did. The two were out to dinner one night when Hirst, who grew up working class, ordered caviar for the table. Prada sighed. "I really struggle to eat caviar," she said. "Why would you struggle with that?" he recalls saying. "And she was like, 'Oh, I was a communist."'
FOR THE PAST few years, Miuccia Prada hasn't had to do quite as much all by herself. In February 2020, just before the pandemic forced Italy into lockdown, the Belgian designer Raf Simons was announced as her co-creative director. The two of them, she said, would be jointly responsible for Prada's women's and men's wear going forward. (She's still the sole designer at Miu Miu; "When I change floors, I change mentalities," she says.) The next day, Simons flew home to Antwerp. Upon his return to Milan that June, he mostly communicated with Prada through a screen.
It was a challenging start to an ambitious experiment. They both had simple reasons for wanting it to succeed. Prada was, as she puts it, "fed up working alone." She was also, of course, planning her succession. "But they don't want me to talk about that because they're afraid it looks like I want to leave," she says. "I don't want to leave at all." Simons, 55, had briefly worked for Prada and Bertelli before going to Dior and then Calvin Klein. (He was the creative director of Jil Sander from 2005 until 2012; the Prada Group sold the brand in 2006.) Following his two-year stint at Calvin Klein, a tumultuous period he describes as "hysteria," he'd vowed to never again run someone else's fashion brand.
"I'm not a stupid guy," says Simons, who now lives in the Milanese apartment where the first Prada shows took place. When Bertelli reached out to set up a meeting, Simons says he knew they wouldn't be discussing Church's shoes. "It was more like, 'Miuccia and I, this is our age, this is our reality,"' he recalls Bertelli saying. (In January, she and Bertelli stepped down as co-chief executive officers of the Prada Group and were replaced by Andrea Guerra, formerly the chief executive officer of the Luxottica eyewear conglomerate. Their son Lorenzo is expected to assume the role down the line.) Prada had wondered if Simons, who'd overseen his own cultish men's wear brand for 24 years at that point (the line has since been discontinued), might want to look after the men's collections. "But in three seconds," says Prada, Simons suggested, " 'Why don't we do the two together?' And I immediately said, 'Yes, why not."'
In practice, they couldn't be more different. Simons, whose cool aesthetic conveys restraint, would rather adhere to deadlines; she "loves to design today what needs to go on the runway tomorrow," he says. And yet they share an aversion to traditional clothes. "It wasn't a shock, like, 'Oh my god, what a left-field choice,"' says Marc Jacobs. "If I were doing this movie, I'd have cast Raf."
After years of having to make every decision on her own -- even now, she's thinking about the most recent installment of "Women's Tales," Miu Miu's ongoing short film series, by the Croatian-born director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović, and the Fondazione's next two art shows -- Prada is relieved to sit down with Simons and discuss the upcoming women's collection. "Listen," she says the day after the men's show in June from her office, where she's spent part of the morning reading the (good) reviews. "Every single moment you have to have ideas on so many things. Your brain evaporates." Recently, she and Simons have resolved, at least temporarily, not to divulge the references or describe the characters in their collections with the world. "I decided that I didn't want to tell stories anymore," she says. "We'll see how long it lasts."
When it comes to how her own story is eventually told, she hopes not to have, as she puts it, "thrown my life out on superficial things." Her goal, today, as it was in 1968, is to have done something good. "And deep down," she says, "political." But on my way out, I ask Prada if she ever wonders how her life might have looked had she not become a designer. "Always," she says without hesitation. Then, as the elevator door begins to close between us, she smiles. "And never."

Monumental Metaphors: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: It's one of the great origin stories in contemporary art, a flash of instinct that would revolutionize a field. In 1998, El Anatsui was walking around Nsukka, Nigeria, and noticed a bag of aluminum bottle caps by the roadside.
Anatsui, then a professor at the University of Nigeria who was drawn to daily-life materials in his own art practice, took the bag to his studio. He began to play with the caps: folding them, slicing them in rounds and opening their cylindrical sides.
Working with assistants, he found a method. He punctured the metal bits in several places and linked them with copper wire. The compositional language rewarded scale: Soon individual works would enfold hundreds of thousands of these molecules. They would dance when hung on walls and cover entire buildings.
As they have awed viewers worldwide -- at the Venice Biennale in 2007 or the Brooklyn Museum in 2013, for instance -- Anatsui's bottle-cap confections have defied description and category. Is he sculpting, or weaving? Is this art modern, abstract, universal, African?
The answer to all of these is: Yes.
This week, Anatsui's latest monumental work opens in the cavernous Turbine Hall at Tate Modern in London. Titled "Behind the Red Moon," it evokes the celestial and the maritime. Come down the entry ramp and an immense red-on-red sail with a central orb billows over your head. Its back unfurls in shades of yellow. At the far end, another sheet dips to the ground, dark like a looming shore. In between, panels of silvery diaphanous rings glitter in the light; they suggest human figures and come together to form a globe.
Twenty-five years after Anatsui's roadside intuition, his bottle-cap compositions still reward and elude. Grand but down-to-earth, they exude sensuousness and sweep, yet, on approach, grow prickly and particular. They invite close looking -- for the sheer craft, but also for insights, in their weave of recirculated materials, about the world we live in. With its navigational theme and the fact that it is on view in London, "Behind the Red Moon," which Anatsui conceived working with the Tate curators Osei Bonsu and Dina Akhmadeeva, carries allusions to colonial trade and empire while operating through metaphor.
For the Princeton University art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu -- an Anatsui expert who helped organize a major 2019 Munich retrospective -- Anatsui has done nothing less than reinvent sculpture.
"When you look at these gossamer structures in space, monumental in scale yet so fragile, that paradoxical invocation of power and poetry, it's hard to find equivalents," Okeke-Agulu said. "It's a completely new proposition."
IN LATE AUGUST, I met Anatsui in the new studio he has built in Tema, the port city near Accra, Ghana's capital. Born and raised in Ghana, Anatsui spent 45 years in Nigeria before returning two years ago.
Tema is a utilitarian place, a planned city with a container terminal, oil refinery and aluminum smelter. Anatsui's studio sits near the main highway, neighboring low-slung warehouses, the truck yard for a cement company and a home-goods superstore. When I arrived, Anatsui, 79, was working with 10 assistants on new works.
Even a small Anatsui piece fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars; his metal works were among the first pieces of African contemporary art to clear the million-dollar bar, setting key market benchmarks and building value for cohorts of young artists behind him.
The proceeds sustain a whole economy. Anatsui's materials are inexpensive, but he requires huge quantities. The work is immensely labor-intensive and now straddles two countries. Between Ghana and his larger studio in Nigeria, he employs nearly 100 people.
I watched Anatsui review sections of bottle-cap weave laid on the floor of a hexagonal atelier. Two assistants worked at a small table puncturing aluminum pieces with wood awls -- the tedious fundamental labor.
The sections on the floor shimmered in gold, silver, purple, yellow. Some were streaked with contrasting colors and forms; others had multiple layers.
More developed pieces hung on the studio walls. As we considered a jagged rectangle composition about 10 feet wide, made of deep reds and softer pinks with an irregular gold central field, I asked Anatsui how he knew a work was finished.
"It has to hang on the wall a certain time and undergo scrutiny and reflection," he said. He asked me to interpret the piece: "Can you see anything?"
I hesitated. "When people ask that, you will start to think there is something there," he said. The work was entirely abstract. "There is nothing there."
Anatsui, whom everyone calls "Prof," is soft-spoken and witty. The more analytic the point, the more likely he will offset it with a chuckle or wry smile.
His art comes pre-loaded with meaning. Sorted into crates and sacks in the studio, the caps and foils -- from alcohol, other drinks, medicines -- suggest a kind of material sociology of daily life, consumption and commerce. He still obtains them mostly in Nigeria but is building his Ghana circuits; minor local differences in products and tastes could ramify through his artwork into new colors and patterns.
In societies where adaptive reuse is the norm, Anatsui rejects the premise of trash. Consider the foil buffet trays at weddings or funerals, he said, which can be smelted back into cooking pots. "We are not working with waste material, because there are other people who use them for other things," he said. Art is one option in the cycle.
He is keenly conscious of his own work's industrial organization -- particularly now that its supply chain crosses countries. The Nsukka studio produces works up to the point where his eye and touch are needed. Folded into crates, they are shipped by DHL to Tema, from where the finished pieces head out into the world.
In designing the Turbine Hall work, Anatsui said, he had in mind the trans-Atlantic triangular trade in enslaved people and plantation commodities -- particularly sugar, which built the wealth of Henry Tate, the museum's 19th-century patron. In a sense, he said, Nsukka to Tema to London "replicates a triangle in the way the whole work comes about."
But he keeps a space now at Tema port, to generate fresh ideas near the docks and vessels. The setting, he said, "offers new challenges and opportunities to me as an artist."
THEY MISS HIM in Nsukka.
"You can say that again," said Chijioke Onuora, a former student of Anatsui who is now a fine art professor at the University of Nigeria.
Anatsui arrived there in 1975 and became a fixture for 45 years. He impressed students with his nontraditional assignments, and by "doing the kind of art that was a little weird to us," said Onuora, who studied with him in the early 1980s. "He would tell us to find something common and experiment with ways to make it into interesting sculptures."
Nsukka, in eastern Nigeria, was no ordinary college town. After the Biafran war ended in 1970, it attracted intellectuals, notably the novelist Chinua Achebe. The painter and sculptor Uche Okeke oriented the university's art program toward "natural synthesis," his term for modern art that drew on local and traditional aesthetics and knowledge.
At a time when writers and artists around Africa craved ways to ally their colonially shaped training and study in the Western tradition with the local cultures it disparaged or ignored, Nsukka offered a community and institutional home.
Anatsui had trained conventionally, at a university in Ghana. But in the early 1970s, while teaching in Winneba, a coastal town west of Accra, he began working on round wooden trays that were common in markets there, and into which he began burning his adaptations of Adinkra symbols, which express social concepts and proverbs.
When Anatsui joined the faculty in Nsukka, his art grew to encompass many media -- wood, ceramics, printmaking. He created wood pieces lined up like xylophone keys that could be shown in many sequences, which earned him notice abroad -- including the 1990 Venice Biennale. He broke and reassembled ceramic vessels. He made art from local practical objects, including wood mortars and iron cassava graters.
Thanks to Anatsui, Onuora said, "it dawned on everybody that anything at all could be used to make a sculptural statement."
Anatsui's international visibility, which grew in the 1990s before the bottle-cap works turbocharged it, offered ballast against the vagaries of Nigeria -- the years of dictatorship and economic crisis that pushed many peers and students to emigrate. Nevertheless, Anatsui told me, he bought land in Ghana as early as 1999, sensing the time would come.
In Nsukka, Onuora said, the view was that Anatsui might never have left, were it not for escalating insecurity in the region, notably kidnappings for ransom.
But when I asked Anatsui what motivated his decision, he emphasized the importance of change, and the duties of age. "As an artist, you need to have a variety of experiences," he said. "And growing old, you need to establish something at home. "
THE NEXT DAY, I met Anatsui on the Accra-Tema highway, well before dawn to beat the traffic. We were headed to Anyako -- his ancestral town, where he was born, on a lagoon peninsula near the border with Togo.
Anatsui is investing. In Tema, a huge studio extension, two-thirds the size of a football field, is nearly complete. It will have areas for wood sculpture -- which Anatsui never stopped doing -- and metal, ceramics, even a sound studio.
But in Anyako his mission is personal. Even as a child, he told me, he was rarely there, because he was raised by an uncle who was a pastor in other towns. He did not know much about home, he said, but was always soothed by the breeze on the lagoon.
Now he shows up -- to the weddings, the funerals, the naming ceremonies. He has purchased land next to a nephew's home -- Anatsui himself is a lifelong bachelor -- and intends to build a cultural center. The lagoon is overfished, unemployment is soaring; culture, he said, should bring value.
"Before long I'll be living here," he said. "It's not good to just come and live in the world and go, and not leave any contribution."
At the waterside we entered long wood canoes and crossed the lagoon. Returning, we had the wind at our backs. The boatmen roped the canoes together, then raised a mast -- a Y-shape arrangement of two branches -- and a sail made from flour sacks.
Nothing was wasted. The perfect sculpture billowed us home.

Judy Chicago And Sisterhood Share the Stage: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Judy Chicago was anxious, unusually so. For most of her six-decade career as a feminist multimedia-ist, she was out of step with the art establishment -- occasionally crossing paths with the institutions that canonize cultural weight but mostly zigging off course: a 5-foot-1 dynamo in platform sneakers, doggedly pursuing her own goals.
Now, though, the art world is paying attention to what she has been saying: that when art by women is viewed holistically, through the arc of history, it can shake everything -- us -- to the core.
It is enthralling and unnerving to suddenly have her own work understood this way, she said last week, as she marched in her embroidered denim through "Herstory," her first major New York survey -- ever -- at the New Museum.
Spanning four floors, it includes a grounding show-within-a-show of more than 80 artists and thinkers, including Hilma af Klint, Zora Neale Hurston, Georgia O'Keeffe, Virginia Woolf and Frida Kahlo, giving their pieces, and hers (twin goddess figures, a triptych collage) an imagined sisterhood.
"To see it in the context that I have carried in my heart and in my mind, and it's sustained me -- that's overwhelming, completely overwhelming," Chicago said. She never thought she would live to see it; most pioneering women artists don't.
At 84, Chicago is busier, and more robustly in demand, than ever: Besides the New Museum exhibition, which opened Thursday, she will have her first major London solo, at the influential Serpentine gallery, next summer. The blue chip interest is driven not only by her willingness to adapt to new platforms, like fashion, but by the fact that her foundational obsessions -- gender equity and power dynamics, women's bodies -- are yet again in the cross hairs.
Chicago "has built, if you will, the House of American Art, has rebuilt it and reshaped it," said Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the New Museum. "You think, oh, this is an artist who is so great, deserves that celebration, she led us in a better place. But then you realize that building she built gets perennially dismantled."
If she is disillusioned or worn out by this constant churn, it doesn't show -- she may be fueled by it. Chicago and her husband, Donald Woodman, a photographer, live between Albuquerque and tiny Belen, N.M., where she maintains a rigorous studio practice. She's in the spare, cream-colored space six hours a day, reprising past ideas and perfecting new techniques in high-pressure substances like glass. "Glass seemed to me to be such an incredible metaphor for the human condition -- strong and vulnerable," she told me.
The top floor of the New Museum houses Chicago's largest interactive digital piece, a "quilt" of international responses to the 11 questions she posed in a series of embroidered banners, including "What If Women Ruled the World?"
Chicago has long positioned herself in the direct-communication sphere of social activists. "She was always aware that she needed to speak to a larger audience because the narrow audience or professional one wasn't even listening to her," Gioni said. "If she had stuck to the artwork, she would have not found her audience and probably not survived."
From her earliest days, Chicago's work communicated through vibrant colors, anatomical and biomorphic shapes, enormous scale, and, for the last few decades, through words, often in her own neat, good-girl cursive.
As "Herstory" lays out, she has, with hardly any fanfare, been part of every major artistic movement since the 1960s: minimalism, land art, conceptual and performance art, identity exploration and environmental justice. She accumulated new skills, apprenticing as a pyrotechnician for her "Atmospheres" series (1968 -1974), sending plumes of pigmented smoke and flares into the ether -- staking a claim on space.
In every shift, her imagery was dismissed as emotional (or sexual) provocation, her color palette "too feminine" --- until eventually she unapologetically embraced the gendered reputation. Even as she hewed to formalist techniques in increasingly unforgiving mediums, like bronze and kiln-fired glass, her work shouted: yes, I create -- I see! -- like a lady.
All of this culminated in -- and to her sometime chagrin, has largely been dwarfed by -- "The Dinner Party," her monumental installation that sets a place at the table for generations of overlooked women artists. Permanently ensconced at the Brooklyn Museum since 2007, it's still one of the most popular exhibits, attracting over 100,000 visitors in the last year, a spokeswoman said. (Gioni did not attempt to beckon it across the river; it is, Woodman joked, a Judy Chicago subway series.)
To represent the constellation of women's work in "Herstory," there is "City of Ladies," the fourth-floor installation of female and genderqueer artists, performers and writers. It is a far-flung and rare grouping, culled partly from private collectors and spanning continents and centuries, starting with Hildegard von Bingen, the 12th-century sainted German mystic, leader and composer. No living artists were included, a decision Gioni -- who conceived "Herstory" with Chicago, and with curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Margot Norton and Madeline Weisburg -- described as equal parts practical and political.
"The moment you involve living artists, any exclusion would have become much more meaningful," he said.
For Chicago to be the only working artist represented among the masters is perhaps audacious -- but then, so is her whole career. As she put it: "Contemporary art has not stood the test of time yet -- except me, because I've been here so long."
And in the museum's billing, "City of Ladies" is a catalog of her inspirations, an "introspective" rather than a retrospective. It builds on her decades of research into historical predecessors that helped her feel a sense of community, when compatriots were scarce, and the path she opened for other makers who work in ceramics, china painting ("The Dinner Party") or needlework (" Birth Project") to be considered as more than merely decorative.
Long before major artists acknowledged their assistants or fabricators, Chicago had openly assembled her creative life around collaboration: she made precisely zero of the stitches in her trademark needlework. They are the painstaking work of volunteer artisans like Jacquelyn Moore Alexander, a quilter, stitcher and appliqué expert who started with Chicago around 1980, when she answered an ad in a decorating magazine. "The sample she sent was of a fetus in a uterus -- we had to replicate that," she recalled. "It was very cleverly drawn; it had curves and points. She was looking for precision."
The stitchers did piecework solo and assembled them in Belen for critiques. Moore Alexander, 85, saw herself as a "transitionalist," a link between traditional and contemporary notions of womanhood. She quilted the 11-foot-long black-and-white "Earth Birth," which gave a birthing body undulating, heroic energy. "It lived on my kitchen table for a year," she said, covered in a sheet that no one could touch, annoying her family. But when her daughter saw it finished, hanging in a museum, "she started to cry," Moore Alexander recalled. "She saw it as art. My most cherished experience."
In projects like the 1972 installation "Womanhouse" -- where Chicago, Miriam Schapiro and other young artists restored a falling-to-pieces Hollywood mansion as workshop and performance space -- she also helped develop a framework for female-centered education and engagement.
"When you think of her world, she's at least 20 years ahead of the thinking in so many ways," said Karen Keifer-Boyd, professor of art education and women's gender, and sexuality studies at Penn State, which houses Chicago's ever-expanding teaching archives. "The notion is, it's generative -- it grows by its use," Keifer-Boyd said of the collection.
"Womanhouse" and "The Dinner Party" are still minting new fans, like Maria Grazia Chiuri, the slyly radical creative director of Dior with whom Chicago has collaborated since 2020. The embroidered "What If Women Ruled the World?" banners were created for one of their fashion shows, in what turned out to be an enduring partnership. (Dior is a sponsor of the New Museum exhibition.)
"Judy furthered my understanding of how urgent and how relevant our commitment to promoting and communicating feminism is in all industries, especially in fashion," Chiuri wrote in an email. "She leads by example and she has taught us the importance of coherence, of resistance, of commitment."
Chicago is still quick to rile. Her early work was revolutionary, partly because it upset rigid beliefs about men and women; she wanted to upend that thinking. Now that our understanding of gender is vastly expanded -- a spectrum, not a binary -- how, I asked her, could her artistic message fit in?
She fired up immediately. "We also have a worldwide pushback against all the changes that have grown out of our new understanding," she said. "It is incredibly powerful, and the outcome is unknown."
There was still room -- there was still need -- for art that challenged every norm. "If my work can contribute to the awakening," she said, "then it's doing its job."
Born Judith Cohen, she has played with self-image since she rechristened herself Judy Chicago -- after her hometown -- in 1970, to eschew patriarchal influence. (Her earliest work is credited to Judy Gerowitz, a married name.) She dressed and acted macho when she was trying to fit into the crew of artist dudes she started out with in California --- "even when I almost lost a breast in the table saw, I wouldn't ask for help," she wrote in her 2021 autobiography, "The Flowering."
Her most profound technical learning came after she earned her M.F.A. at the University of California in Los Angeles, when she enrolled in auto body school, to learn how to spray paint. Fusing color and surface, the symmetrical sprayed car hoods she made in that moment are organic, personal and flowery -- a flounce atop the macho.
Visiting her in Belen, an industrial blip that's a rail switching hub, her vibe reminded me of a veteran post-punk rocker: leather jacket, cobalt blue glasses, lipstick the color of a well-enjoyed cabernet, and nail polish that matches her wavy hair (lately it's a glittery gold). Woodman, her husband of nearly 38 years, coordinates his manicure to his rainbow-swirl glasses -- they go to the salon together.
He is a frequent collaborator with his wife, most notably on "Holocaust Project," which started in 1985 out of interest in their shared Jewish heritage, and merges his photography with her painting and stained glass. It took them eight years of research and prototyping, during which they never considered its marketability.
"I said, 'Honey, do you realize neither of us ever said, once in all those eight years, I wonder if anybody will ever buy this work?"' Chicago recalled. (It was exhibited at Jewish and secular regional museums; during a preview for "Herstory" on Tuesday, someone wept in front of it.)
Theirs is a #couplesgoals romance. As they recounted to me, tag-teaming the story over chips and queso at dinner, they married three months after an encounter at a Santa Fe festival. "We ignited," Chicago said. They remain mutually captivated renegades. (Asked what attracted him to New Mexico, Woodman, 78, said: "It's where the outlaws ended up.")
Neither had children. Woodman trained as an architect -- it was at his urging, and with his handiwork, that they now have a growing network of properties in New Mexico, including Through the Flower, a nonprofit education center that Chicago started in the aftermath of "The Dinner Party."
During the pandemic, they reprised her smoke blasts around their garden -- their local fire chief "became an art critic after about the second one," Chicago said, laughing; a clarion peal that sounds like someone who knows how to have fun. She has fairly new gallerists, in Jessica Silverman and Jeffrey Deitch, and the Whitney Museum of American Art purchased its first Chicago work, "Trinity," a minimalist sculpture, just last year. The "Atmospheres" series had already been selling out with collectors.
The home in Belen, a former railroad boardinghouse, is decorated with her portraits, on paper and in ceramics, of the couple's many cats. In her studio, beneath a color spectrum annotated in her script -- "carmine lustre," "fir green" -- she puzzles out how to tackle intense subjects like "The End," a series on mortality she made after a health scare a few years ago. The images are small, painted on black glass in luxe colors, purposefully made in her own hand. She wanted them to be intimate and pretty.
"The function of beauty is to help us look at subjects that otherwise would be unbearable," she said.
For the last two months, she has been holed up, alone, in her Albuquerque home, working on a project for "Revelations," next year's Serpentine gallery exhibition. "Just me in my drawing studio and my colored pencils -- drawing, drawing, drawing," she said. "I've totally loved it."
Chicago has been studying art since she was five, and documented every work she made, on index cards and slides, since the '60s; they are neatly organized in a warehouse in Belen. After she discovered "the erasure of women's cultural heritage," she made a vow: "It's not going to happen to me, if I can help it."
Visibility; recognition; context; pizazz: they matter. At the opening for "Herstory," she was resplendent in a Dior suit and pink and purple hair, painted to match her early palette. The scene was frenzied. But after all her worry, she glided through, smoothly articulating, in the "City of Ladies" gallery, about the value of women getting fully seen.
I complimented her on her calm. "What I learned in auto body school," she said, gleefully. "Presentation is all."

Judy Chicago Makes ‘Herstory’: Beyond the Ladies of the Dinner Party

Judy Chicago was anxious, unusually so. For most of her six-decade career as a feminist multimedia-ist, she was out of step with the art establishment — occasionally crossing paths with the institutions that canonize cultural weight but mostly zigging off course: a 5-foot-1 dynamo in platform sneakers, doggedly pursuing her own goals.
Now, though, the art world is paying attention to what she has been saying: that when art by women is viewed holistically, through the arc of history, it can shake everything — us — to the core.
It is enthralling and unnerving to suddenly have her own work understood this way, she said last week, as she marched in her embroidered denim through “Herstory,” her first major New York survey — ever — at the New Museum.
Spanning four floors, it includes a grounding show-within-a-show of more than 80 artists and thinkers, including Hilma af Klint, Zora Neale Hurston, Georgia O’Keeffe, Virginia Woolf and Frida Kahlo, giving their pieces, and hers (twin goddess figures, a triptych collage) an imagined sisterhood.
“To see it in the context that I have carried in my heart and in my mind, and it’s sustained me — that’s overwhelming, completely overwhelming,” Chicago said. She never thought she would live to see it; most pioneering women artists don’t.
At 84, Chicago is busier, and more robustly in demand, than ever: Besides the New Museum exhibition, which opened Thursday, she will have her first major London solo, at the influential Serpentine gallery, next summer. The blue chip interest is driven not only by her willingness to adapt to new platforms, like fashion, but by the fact that her foundational obsessions — gender equity and power dynamics, women’s bodies — are yet again in the crosshairs.
Chicago “has built, if you will, the House of American Art, has rebuilt it and reshaped it,” said Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the New Museum. “You think, oh, this is an artist who is so great, deserves that celebration, she led us in a better place. But then you realize that building she built gets perennially dismantled.”
If she is disillusioned or worn out by this constant churn, it doesn’t show — she may be fueled by it. Chicago and her husband, Donald Woodman, a photographer, live between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tiny Belen, New Mexico, where she maintains a rigorous studio practice. She’s in the spare, cream-colored space six hours a day, reprising past ideas and perfecting new techniques in high-pressure substances like glass. “Glass seemed to me to be such an incredible metaphor for the human condition — strong and vulnerable,” she told me.
The top floor of the New Museum houses Chicago’s largest interactive digital piece, a “quilt” of international responses to the 11 questions she posed in a series of embroidered banners, including “What If Women Ruled the World?”
Chicago has long positioned herself in the direct-communication sphere of social activists. “She was always aware that she needed to speak to a larger audience because the narrow audience or professional one wasn’t even listening to her,” Gioni said. “If she had stuck to the artwork, she would have not found her audience and probably not survived.”
From her earliest days, Chicago’s work communicated through vibrant colors, anatomical and biomorphic shapes, enormous scale, and, for the last few decades, through words, often in her own neat, good-girl cursive.
As “Herstory” lays out, she has, with hardly any fanfare, been part of every major artistic movement since the 1960s: minimalism, land art, conceptual and performance art, identity exploration and environmental justice. She accumulated new skills, apprenticing as a pyrotechnician for her “Atmospheres” series (1968 -1974), sending plumes of pigmented smoke and flares into the ether — staking a claim on space.
In every shift, her imagery was dismissed as emotional (or sexual) provocation, her color palette “too feminine” — until eventually she unapologetically embraced the gendered reputation. Even as she hewed to formalist techniques in increasingly unforgiving mediums, like bronze and kiln-fired glass, her work shouted: yes, I create — I see! — like a lady.
All of this culminated in — and to her sometime chagrin, has largely been dwarfed by — “The Dinner Party,” her monumental installation that sets a place at the table for generations of overlooked women artists. Permanently ensconced at the Brooklyn Museum since 2007, it’s still one of the most popular exhibits, attracting over 100,000 visitors in the last year, a spokesperson said. (Gioni did not attempt to beckon it across the river; it is, Woodman joked, a Judy Chicago subway series.)
To represent the constellation of women’s work in “Herstory,” there is “City of Ladies,” the fourth-floor installation of female and genderqueer artists, performers and writers. It is a far-flung and rare grouping, culled partly from private collectors and spanning continents and centuries, starting with Hildegard von Bingen, the 12th-century sainted German mystic, leader and composer. No living artists were included, a decision Gioni — who conceived “Herstory” with Chicago, and with curators Gary Carrion-Murayari, Margot Norton and Madeline Weisburg — described as equal parts practical and political.
“The moment you involve living artists, any exclusion would have become much more meaningful,” he said.
For Chicago to be the only working artist represented among the masters is perhaps audacious — but then, so is her whole career. As she put it: “Contemporary art has not stood the test of time yet — except me, because I’ve been here so long.”
And in the museum’s billing, “City of Ladies” is a catalog of her inspirations, an “introspective” rather than a retrospective. It builds on her decades of research into historical predecessors that helped her feel a sense of community, when compatriots were scarce, and the path she opened for other makers who work in ceramics, china painting (“The Dinner Party”) or needlework (“Birth Project”) to be considered as more than merely decorative.
Long before major artists acknowledged their assistants or fabricators, Chicago had openly assembled her creative life around collaboration: she made precisely zero of the stitches in her trademark needlework. They are the painstaking work of volunteer artisans such as Jacquelyn Moore Alexander, a quilter, stitcher and appliqué expert who started with Chicago around 1980, when she answered an ad in a decorating magazine. “The sample she sent was of a fetus in a uterus — we had to replicate that,” she recalled. “It was very cleverly drawn; it had curves and points. She was looking for precision.”
The stitchers did piecework solo and assembled them in Belen for critiques. Moore Alexander, 85, saw herself as a “transitionalist,” a link between traditional and contemporary notions of womanhood. She quilted the 11-foot-long black-and-white “Earth Birth,” which gave a birthing body undulating, heroic energy. “It lived on my kitchen table for a year,” she said, covered in a sheet that no one could touch, annoying her family. But when her daughter saw it finished, hanging in a museum, “she started to cry,” Moore Alexander recalled. “She saw it as art. My most cherished experience.”
In projects like the 1972 installation “Womanhouse” — where Chicago, Miriam Schapiro and other young artists restored a falling-to-pieces Hollywood mansion as workshop and performance space — she also helped develop a framework for female-centered education and engagement.
“When you think of her world, she’s at least 20 years ahead of the thinking in so many ways,” said Karen Keifer-Boyd, professor of art education and women’s gender, and sexuality studies at Penn State, which houses Chicago’s ever-expanding teaching archives. “The notion is, it’s generative — it grows by its use,” Keifer-Boyd said of the collection.
“Womanhouse” and “The Dinner Party” are still minting new fans, like Maria Grazia Chiuri, the slyly radical creative director of Dior with whom Chicago has collaborated since 2020. The embroidered “What If Women Ruled the World?” banners were created for one of their fashion shows, in what turned out to be an enduring partnership. (Dior is a sponsor of the New Museum exhibition.)
“Judy furthered my understanding of how urgent and how relevant our commitment to promoting and communicating feminism is in all industries, especially in fashion,” Chiuri wrote in an email. “She leads by example and she has taught us the importance of coherence, of resistance, of commitment.”
Chicago is still quick to rile. Her early work was revolutionary, partly because it upset rigid beliefs about men and women; she wanted to upend that thinking. Now that our understanding of gender is vastly expanded — a spectrum, not a binary — how, I asked her, could her artistic message fit in?
She fired up immediately. “We also have a worldwide pushback against all the changes that have grown out of our new understanding,” she said. “It is incredibly powerful, and the outcome is unknown.”
There was still room — there was still need — for art that challenged every norm. “If my work can contribute to the awakening,” she said, “then it’s doing its job.”

Birkenstock Saunters to Wall Street: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This may be a tale about the rise of a German sandal brand, but it is not a straightforward fashion story.
After all, for a large chunk of its 249-year history, Birkenstock was synonymous with extremely unfashionable stereotypes. The sandals were often worn by hippies and off-duty hikers, eccentric aunts and science teachers with a penchant for pairing them with ankle socks.
Over time, these orthopedic-looking shoes drew a loyal following thanks to their comfortable cork and latex molded footbeds and their durability. They found particular favor with German health care professionals and a handful of high-profile anti-establishment, anti-conformist types like the Apple founder Steve Jobs, the onetime owner of a battered brown pair that sold for $ 218,750 at auction last year.
High fashion, however, Birkenstock definitely was not.
But then a weird thing happened. Beerken-schtock, as it is pronounced in its homeland, started to become cool. In 2012, Phoebe Philo, then the fashion maestro of the French luxury house Céline, showed a fur-lined version of what appeared to be the double strap Arizona sandal at Paris Fashion Week, prompting industry excitement and gushing articles.
Birkenstock, which went public in New York on Wednesday morning, may not initially have been ready for this attention -- the Furkenstock, as it was known, was not even an official collaboration -- but the company soon realized that consumers wanted comfort co-signed by fashion's most revered designers. Other partnerships followed, with brands like Dior, Valentino, Manolo Blahnik and Rick Owens, which continue to this day.
In the 2010s, as workplaces grew more casual and comfort became a priority, Birkenstocks surfaced as winners of the "ugly shoe" trend. And today, spurred further by the impact of pandemic dressing and working from home, the sandals have become the informal footwear of choice for people everywhere who once wouldn't have been caught dead in them.
"Weird and ordinary has become deeply cool, as has looking authentic and feeling healthy," said Valerie Steele, the director of the Fashion Museum of Technology in New York.
"Their popularity nowadays is pretty wild," Ms. Steele added. "It's not often that you see a total turnaround in public brand perception in the way we have with Birkenstock."
Today, five core styles make up 76 percent of the business, the company said, with prices that start at 40 euros (about $ 42). For limited-edition luxury styles, that figure can be 40 times as much -- up to $ 1,700. The company said that 30 million pairs of Birkenstock sandals were sold in 2022, with sales of 1.24 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion at current exchange rates), up from 292 million euros ( $ 307 million) in 2014.
According to the shopping platform Lyst, a clog style known as Boston was the most searched for shoe of 2022, thanks in part to the superfan Kendall Jenner. After a cameo in a pivotal scene in "Barbie," online searches appeared to spike.
Now, Birkenstock is betting big in a bid to capitalize on the momentum. On Wednesday, under the ticker symbol BIRK, the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a valuation of more than $ 9 billion, after selling just over 32 million shares at $ 46 each. Though Birkenstock pulled off the stock sale, its share price fell 11 percent once trading began.
Birkenstock said it raised $ 1.48 billion, which it will use to pay down debts. It also wants to make the Birkenstock empire truly global; today, 90 percent of sales are in Western Europe and the United States. L Catterton, a private equity group with ties to the French luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, became the majority owner of Birkenstock in 2021 and will retain ownership after the I.P.O.
In a lofty pitch to investors in its prospectus, Birkenstock said that it was "undeterred by fashion trends and proudly German, with shoes that could be found on surgical wards and fashion runways, in law firms, school -- and everywhere in between."
"Birkenstock is more than a shoe," the prospectus read. "It is a way of thinking, a way of living." The company isn't the first footwear brand to go public. AllBirds and Doc Martens had I.P.O.s in recent years, with mixed results.
And although there are plenty of industry observers who feel optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, others are cautious. "While Birkenstock is profitable, we think it is fair to say that the valuation mark is too high, especially for a company that was valued at just $ 4.3 billion in early 2021," David Trainer of the investment research firm New Constructs wrote to investors. He added that the only footwear companies with larger market capitalizations are Nike and Deckers (owner of Ugg and Hoka, among others).
Sleeping Giant, Swimming Whale
Much of Birkenstock's recent success can be attributed to Oliver Reichert, 52, who was named chief executive in 2013. A 6-foot-6 mountain of a man with a booming voice and a reddish-gold beard, he grew up in the Bavarian countryside wearing Birkenstocks. From an early age, he wore a U.S. shoe size 12.5; Birkenstocks were the only shoes that fit.
In 2008, Mr. Reichert's interest in the brand turned professional, when he became an adviser to Christian Birkenstock, a scion lost in a chapter of dysfunctional management and infighting among the family heirs.
The Birkenstock legend began back in 1774, when church records from the rural village of Langen-Bergheim, near Frankfurt, registered Johannes Birkenstock as a local cobbler. In the early 20th century, the company specialized not in shoes but in their flexible rubber and cork insoles, developed by Konrad Birkenstock, who became an orthopedic authority, as did his son Carl.
It was Carl's son Karl who furthered the technology and created sandals that could evenly distribute weight and reduce sole friction, starting with the classic single strap 410 style in 1963 (called the Madrid after 1979, when most styles were given geographical names). His sons -- Stephan, Alex and Christian -- had taken over the company in 2002. The status quo was not a happy one.
"It had become a very complicated situation," Mr. Reichert, a former journalist and sports media executive, said recently in his office in Munich. "All three brothers had been controlling different aspects of the company and taking them in different directions, with one dominant father still watching from the sidelines." The Birkenstock family, who stepped away from the day-to-day oversight of the business in 2013, declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Reichert was the first chief executive from outside the Birkenstock bloodline. (A co-chief executive appointed at the time, Markus Bensberg, left to run the family office of Alex Birkenstock in 2021.) Mr. Reichert quickly set about reorganizing the 38 subsidiaries into a group with cohesive sales and distribution channels.
He also invested heavily in the company's German factories. His aim was to transform what he called "this sleeping giant" into a global sandal sensation, albeit with foot health at its core. Savvy collaborations, primarily via the Birkenstock premium line 1774, were part of the plan.
"Birkenstock customers had this longstanding reputation for being female, old and sick," Mr. Reichert said. "But we loved them because they loved our products for the right reasons -- functionality and purpose."
"Those ideals are why we exist," he continued. "But I was also afraid we would wake up in our own museum, surrounded by traditional pieces that had no relevance to today. Which is why it is important to build bridges to other people's creativity and energy -- to offer them a white canvas and the paint and say: 'Go!"'
Mr. Reichert avoids "fake" influencer marketing, as he describes it, and said his favorite designer collaborations are the weirder ones in which "one plus one equals three." Rather than following elitist or whimsical trends, he wants Birkenstock to be perceived as a producer of steady, democratic goods. "Barbie" may have given him the kind of blockbuster marketing that most companies would kill for (and for free, given that it wasn't paid placement), but he hadn't yet seen the movie.
"I just don't like the idea that people think Birkenstock is having 'a moment' when in fact it is the world that is now coming in our direction," he said. In his sunlit office, a child's train set was set out in one corner. The whitewashed walls were lined with several electric bikes, a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk and images of the artists Joseph Beuys and Ai Wei Wei. A fan of metaphors, he compared the company to a deep-sea whale, always swimming under the surface.
"With these high-end collaborations, we pop our head out of the water, and then some people go, 'Oh, there's a whale!"' Mr. Reichert said.
Even Our Haters Love Us
Birkenstock's plan was laid out in the initial public offering filings released in September. Today, baby boomers, millennials and Gen X all generate about 30 percent of sales, the company said. Almost three-quarters of customers are women, and 45 percent of revenue comes from people earning more than $ 100,000 a year.
A little more than half of Birkenstock's sales comes from North, South and Central America. The company's growth may be tied to new markets like India and China, and could also be fueled by expanding distribution and a directly controlled online store that currently reaches customers in more than 75 countries.
The influence of LVMH, the world's largest luxury fashion group by sales, is also getting stronger. Alexandre Arnault, the son of Bernard Arnault, will sit on Birkenstock's board after the I.P.O.
Sales growth has slowed since the pandemic, and there is no shortage of counterfeit products and brazen rip-offs by rivals. (Birkenstock had a falling out with Amazon over its policing of copycat shoes and stopped selling directly through Amazon in 2018.)
And for a footwear name long associated with family ownership and social movements linked with critiques of capitalist systems, going public at a time of global economic volatility could create reputational blowback. Especially if pleasing investors means compromising on quality or shifting production away from Germany, where 95 percent of products are assembled, then hand-checked in factories owned by the brand.
Mr. Reichert was adamant that moving production out of Germany wouldn't happen "in a million years." He pointed to Birkenstock's profit margins compared with many rivals and scoffed at the suggestion that the company might struggle to drum up consumer desire for another pair of Birkenstocks, noting that the average customer owns three to four pairs. (For the record, he owns more than 500.)
"Whether you like fashion or not, wearing Birkenstocks shows that you care about yourself and your sense of well-being," he said. A significant appeal for consumers was "being perceived as real." Birkenstock doesn't "just have customers but fans," he said. Then, with a chuckle, he went one step further.
"Even our haters still wear our shoes because they know they are good for your feet. Not many other businesses can say that."

This may be a tale about the rise of a German sandal brand, but it is not a straightforward fashion story.
After all, for a large chunk of its 249-year history, Birkenstock was synonymous with extremely un fashionable stereotypes. The sandals were often worn by hippies and off-duty hikers, eccentric aunts and science teachers with a penchant for pairing them with ankle socks.
Over time, these orthopedic-looking shoes drew a loyal following thanks to their comfortable cork and latex molded footbeds and their durability. They found particular favor with German health care professionals and a handful of high-profile anti-establishment, anti-conformist types like Apple founder Steve Jobs, the onetime owner of a battered brown pair that sold for $218,750 at auction last year.
High fashion, however, Birkenstock definitely was not.
But then a weird thing happened. Beerken-schtock, as it is pronounced in its homeland, started to become cool. In 2012, Phoebe Philo, then the fashion maestro of French luxury house Céline, showed a fur-lined version of what appeared to be the double strap Arizona sandal at Paris Fashion Week, prompting industry excitement and gushing articles.
Birkenstock, which went public in New York on Wednesday morning, may not initially have been ready for this attention — the Furkenstock, as it was known, was not even an official collaboration — but the company soon realized that consumers wanted comfort co-signed by fashion’s most revered designers. Other partnerships followed, with brands like Dior, Valentino, Manolo Blahnik and Rick Owens, which continue to this day.
In the 2010s, as workplaces grew more casual and comfort became a priority, Birkenstocks surfaced as winners of the “ugly shoe” trend. And today, spurred further by the effect of pandemic dressing and working from home, the sandals have become the informal footwear of choice for people everywhere who once wouldn’t have been caught dead in them.
“Weird and ordinary has become deeply cool, as has looking authentic and feeling healthy,” said Valerie Steele, director of the Fashion Museum of Technology in New York.
“Their popularity nowadays is pretty wild,” Steele added. “It’s not often that you see a total turnaround in public brand perception in the way we have with Birkenstock.”
Today, five core styles make up 76% of the business, the company said, with prices that start at 40 euros (about $42). For limited-edition luxury styles, that figure can be 40 times as much — up to $1,700. The company said that 30 million pairs of Birkenstock sandals were sold in 2022, with sales of 1.24 billion euros ($1.3 billion at current exchange rates), up from 292 million euros ($307 million) in 2014.
According to shopping platform Lyst, a clog style known as Boston was the most searched for shoe of 2022, thanks in part to superfan Kendall Jenner. After a cameo in a pivotal scene in “Barbie,” online searches appeared to spike.
Now, Birkenstock is betting big in a bid to capitalize on the momentum. On Wednesday, under the ticker symbol BIRK, the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a valuation of more than $9 billion, selling just over 32 million shares at $46 each. Although Birkenstock pulled off the stock sale, its share price fell 11% once trading began.
Birkenstock said it raised $1.48 billion, which it will use to pay down debts. It also wants to make the Birkenstock empire truly global; today, 90% of sales are in Western Europe and the United States. L Catterton, a private equity group with ties to French luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, became the majority owner of Birkenstock in 2021 and will retain ownership after the IPO.
In a lofty pitch to investors in its prospectus, Birkenstock said that it was “undeterred by fashion trends and proudly German, with shoes that could be found on surgical wards and fashion runways, in law firms, school — and everywhere in between.”
“Birkenstock is more than a shoe,” the prospectus read. “It is a way of thinking, a way of living.” The company isn’t the first footwear brand to go public. AllBirds and Doc Martens had IPOs in recent years, with mixed results.
And although there are plenty of industry observers who feel optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects, others are cautious. “While Birkenstock is profitable, we think it is fair to say that the valuation mark is too high, especially for a company that was valued at just $4.3 billion in early 2021,” David Trainer of investment research firm New Constructs wrote to investors. He added that the only footwear companies with larger market capitalizations are Nike and Deckers (owner of Ugg and Hoka, among others).
Sleeping Giant, Swimming Whale
Much of Birkenstock’s recent success can be attributed to Oliver Reichert, 52, who was named CEO in 2013. A 6-foot-6 mountain of a man with a booming voice and a reddish-gold beard, he grew up in the Bavarian countryside wearing Birkenstocks. From an early age, he wore a U.S. shoe size 12.5; Birkenstocks were the only shoes that fit.
In 2008, Reichert’s interest in the brand turned professional, when he became an adviser to Christian Birkenstock, a scion lost in a chapter of dysfunctional management and infighting among the family heirs.
The Birkenstock legend began back in 1774, when church records from the rural village of Langen-Bergheim, near Frankfurt, registered Johannes Birkenstock as a local cobbler. In the early 20th century, the company specialized not in shoes but in their flexible rubber and cork insoles, developed by Konrad Birkenstock, who became an orthopedic authority, as did his son Carl.
It was Carl’s son Karl who furthered the technology and created sandals that could evenly distribute weight and reduce sole friction, starting with the classic single strap 410 style in 1963 (called the Madrid after 1979, when most styles were given geographical names). His sons — Stephan, Alex and Christian — had taken over the company in 2002. The status quo was not a happy one.
“It had become a very complicated situation,” Reichert, a former journalist and sports media executive, said recently in his office in Munich. “All three brothers had been controlling different aspects of the company and taking them in different directions, with one dominant father still watching from the sidelines.” The Birkenstock family, who stepped away from the day-to-day oversight of the business in 2013, declined to comment for this article.
Reichert was the first CEO from outside the Birkenstock bloodline. (A co-CEO appointed at the time, Markus Bensberg, left to run the family office of Alex Birkenstock in 2021.) Reichert quickly set about reorganizing the 38 subsidiaries into a group with cohesive sales and distribution channels.
He also invested heavily in the company’s German factories. His aim was to transform what he called “this sleeping giant” into a global sandal sensation, albeit with foot health at its core. Savvy collaborations, primarily via the Birkenstock premium line 1774, were part of the plan.
“Birkenstock customers had this long-standing reputation for being female, old and sick,” Reichert said. “But we loved them because they loved our products for the right reasons — functionality and purpose.”
“Those ideals are why we exist,” he continued. “But I was also afraid we would wake up in our own museum, surrounded by traditional pieces that had no relevance to today. Which is why it is important to build bridges to other people’s creativity and energy — to offer them a white canvas and the paint and say: ‘Go!’’’
Reichert avoids “fake” influencer marketing, as he describes it, and said his favorite designer collaborations are the weirder ones in which “one plus one equals three.” Rather than following elitist or whimsical trends, he wants Birkenstock to be perceived as a producer of steady, democratic goods. “Barbie” may have given him the kind of blockbuster marketing that most companies would kill for (and for free, given that it wasn’t paid placement), but he hadn’t yet seen the movie.
“I just don’t like the idea that people think Birkenstock is having ‘a moment’ when in fact it is the world that is now coming in our direction,” he said.
In his sunlit office, a child’s train set was set out in one corner. The whitewashed walls were lined with several electric bikes, a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk and images of artists Joseph Beuys and Ai Wei Wei. A fan of metaphors, he compared the company with a deep-sea whale, always swimming under the surface.
“With these high-end collaborations, we pop our head out of the water, and then some people go, ‘Oh, there’s a whale!’” Reichert said.
Even Our Haters Love Us
Birkenstock’s plan was laid out in the IPO filings released in September. Today, baby boomers, millennials and Generation X all generate about 30% of sales, the company said. Almost three-quarters of customers are women, and 45% of revenue comes from people earning more than $100,000 a year.

Full text: As a 20-something woman who considers herself a feminist, I can't help but wonder how my fashion choices contribute to beauty standards for women. Putting on a cute outfit or bright lipstick seems harmless, but what about foundation, contour and shapewear? By choosing to wear items that conceal my flaws, am I upholding the unrealistic expectation that every woman has to look flawless in order to be considered beautiful?
-- Maya, Santa Rosa, Calif. This is a complicated question, but for me, feminism is largely about choice: the power for women to make choices over their lives, bodies and future. And to decide who they want to be and how they want to look to communicate that identity to the world.
Fashion thus becomes a tool of feminism, because it is one of the prime means we have of self-expression. And I am not talking about Maria Grazia Chiuri's famous (and famously silly) Dior T-shirt blaring the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie quote, "We Should All Be Feminists."
I am talking about the fact that if wearing a certain outfit, even if it is classically "feminine" (pink, flowery, frilly), or if using makeup is your choice, rather than someone else's choice that had been imposed upon you, it can be a feminist act.
The important thing is that you make that decision to please yourself rather than social convention. That you think about why you want to wear a garment, or red lipstick, instead of just putting it on: Is it about concealing your flaws or making you feel confident enough to face the world? Those impulses may sound similar, but between the two is an ocean of difference.
When people tell me that they never think about fashion, they say that because they worry that thinking about clothes or makeup makes them appear frivolous. But not thinking about these two subjects -- why you make the choices you do -- is actually ceding agency to often outdated strictures. That is the truly nonfeminist act.
Gloria Steinem told Lena Dunham that her signature look -- jeans, belted at the hip, a turtleneck and a pendant -- was her "power outfit." Alicia Keys said she felt empowered when she decided to go barefaced. When Michelle Obama became first lady and chose not to wear brightly colored skirt-suits, often opting instead for A-line dresses, she was making a statement. She essentially reclaimed those silhouettes, often associated with 1950s housewives, and gave them new context.
The point is that there's no blanket rule to follow, other than your own gut. Well, except for one: Whatever you choose, it should not cause pain or limit you in any way. But ultimately, the more individual we look, the more options available to everyone for how they choose to engage with the world, the more liberated we all will be.
So the question for you is, "Do your choices make you feel strong and like the best versions of you?" Because in those feelings, real beauty lies.

Full text: During Paris Fashion Week, almost every color could be spotted on the streets and the runways.
A particular color can often dominate both the runways and the crowds at any fashion week. But this season, instead of coalescing around a certain shade, designers and attendees seemed to embrace many of them.
On the streets at Paris Fashion Week, summery yellows mixed with autumnal oranges. Dries Van Noten and Valentino evoked springtime by filling their collections with vibrant greens. Black, while not absent, was less potent: Even Rick Owens, who has been called the prince of fashion darkness, brightened up his show by sending clothes in dusty fuchsias and pinks down the runway as plumes of neon-colored smoke were released and vibrant flower petals floated down.
While the runways featured many palettes, there were far fewer body types. Aside from at the Nina Ricci show in Paris, where people of different sizes walked the runway, models were as skinny as I've seen them in the more than 10 years I've been documenting fashion weeks. And as suggested by the spate of colorful collections this season, variety is never a bad thing.

Full text: Why do runway models always look miserable? They always look as if they would bite your head off if you spoke to them. What's wrong with smiling? Did they ever? And if so, when did things change?
Lisa, Baltimore Designers do sometimes ask their models to smile. Giorgio Armani did it this season for his Emporio Armani show. When she was alive, Sonia Rykiel used to do it all the time; she even had her models skip down the catwalk to add extra zest. And it is almost always ... terrifying.
The truth is, it's awfully hard to maintain a believable expression of great joy when you are walking in front of hundreds, if not thousands, of strangers, all there to render their judgment on what you are wearing. As a model, your shoes probably don't fit, since they are samples, and you are concentrating very hard to avoid slipping or falling, and you are modeling chiffon in winter or leather in September, and you are partially blinded by the flashes of a zillion photographers.
Besides, while clothes are meant to make consumers feel good, they should also make them feel safe, strong, confident, protected. Michael Kors used to have posters backstage scrawled with phrases like "own the room" and "walk like you mean it" to inspire his models. That kind of pantomiming doesn't always come with a beaming face. Smiling can make one seem like a supplicant, and fashion is supposed to make you feel powerful in your skin.
Little wonder, really, that when a happy face is required, it turns, very quickly, into a frozen rictus that doesn't reach the eyes -- a facial disjunction that can be very disturbing to watch. It's hard to concentrate on clothes when you are wondering if the woman who is wearing them has a knife secreted somewhere.
That is why Tyra Banks always instructed the contestants on "America's Next Top Model" to "smize," or "smile with your eyes." Smiling with your actual mouth for the length of a runway generally looks just plain weird.
Aside from a brief period in the 1970s when models like Pat Cleveland danced down the runways, or the moment in 1991 when the supermodels from George Michael's "Freedom!" strutted down the Versace runway lip-syncing to the song, or that time in 1993 when Naomi Campbell fell off her Vivienne Westwood platforms and couldn't help bursting into laughter, smiles have rarely been the runway expression of choice. Look at any vintage photo of a classic couture salon, like Chanel or Christian Dior, and the mannequins are entirely po-faced.
Remember: The absence of a smile is not the same thing as the absence of attitude.

Full text: Barbara Mullen, who vaulted from a job in a New York beauty parlor to the pinnacle of the genteel modeling world of the 1950s, despite a beanpole figure and a gaptoothed smile that defied the narrow beauty standards of the day, died on Sept. 12 at her home in Albuquerque. She was 96.
Her death was confirmed by a friend, Lori Katz.
Ms. Mullen was 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a 20-inch waist -- a figure that would have fit better with the waif look of the 1990s. Emerging in the postwar 1940s, she was a far cry from the ideal set by voluptuous Hollywood stars like Rita Hayworth.
In her later years, Ms. Mullen often said that she never thought of herself as beautiful. Early on, fashion's string-pullers seemed to agree.
Upon meeting her, Eileen Ford, the founder of the Ford modeling agency, which would represent Ms. Mullen for years, informed her that she had a terrible profile. Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, deemed her "a big, ugly Irish girl." When Ms. Mullen met the photographer Lillian Bassman in 1948, serving as a stand-in for a model who did not show up for a shoot, she called her "the replacement girl," adding, "This girl is a monster."
By the early 1950s, however, beauty standards within the industry had started to evolve, and Ms. Mullen was at the vanguard of that evolution. "There came to be a group of mannequins in the French tradition of the belle laide" -- a term that translates to "beautiful ugly" -- Jessica Daves, a former editor of Vogue, wrote in her 1967 history of American fashion, "Ready-Made Miracle."
"Barbara Mullen," Ms. Daves added, "was the first of these to be accepted as a top mannequin. Her eyes were slightly too prominent; the proportions of her face were not those of classic beauty. But the proportions of her body were made for modern clothes. Her tiny head, long neck and delicately elongated torso were the essence of the new elements."
Eventually, Ms. Bassman, who spent a decade shooting Ms. Mullen for Harper's Bazaar, starting with the Paris couture collections of 1949, would declare her her favorite model.
"She came into the studio, with her shoulders down, and her head down, and her coat too long," Ms. Bassman said in an interview done in conjunction with a 2009 exhibition of the photography of her and her husband, Paul Himmel, "and you looked at her and thought, 'Oh my god, this girl could never be a model."' But, Ms. Bassman added, "Put her under the lights and she would just bloom."
Barbara Elise Mullen was born on June 3, 1927, in Floral Park, N.Y., on Long Island, the youngest of two daughters of Matthew Mullen, a bank clerk, and Izma (Shirley) Mullen, a switchboard operator and seamstress.
Ms. Mullen was 18 and working as an assistant at a beauty salon in Queens in 1945 when she took a job as a model sporting the latest fashions for moneyed shoppers at the Bergdorf Goodman department store.
She got her break two years later, when Vogue called her in for a shoot with the photographer John Rawlings to model a pink tulle dress that had been cut for her wispy figure and did not fit other models.
At first, she was nervous. "I'm not shy now, but I was then -- and the camera didn't talk back," she said in a 2013 interview with the British newspaper The Observer. Still, she added: "You stepped into those wonderful couture dresses and you were taken out of your everyday element. We were ordinary girls, but you felt elevated."
The resulting shot of her peering over her shoulder while seated on a green sofa, accompanied by the caption "The new beauty is part attitude," gave her exposure in a bible of fashion, and other work soon followed. By the early 1950s she had become a go-to model for Harper's Bazaar and many other magazines, working with celebrated photographers like Richard Avedon, Karen Radkai and Toni Frissell.
"My favorite model was Barbara Mullen," the celebrated photographer William Klein, who worked with her in the late 1950s, said in a 2012 interview with Financial Times. "She was a tough Irish American living in Brooklyn, and she had a foul mouth." (Mr. Klein's geography was inexact: Ms. Mullen in fact had spent her early childhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan before her family moved to Woodside, Queens.)
Represented by the powerhouse Ford agency, she began to cultivate a continental elegance in manner and speech befitting her perch near the top of her profession, Michael Gross, the author of the 1995 book "Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women," said in a phone interview.
Even so, Mr. Gross said, "she wasn't the era's equivalent of a supermodel. She wasn't Dovima, she wasn't Jean Patchett or Suzy Parker."
Ms. Mullen did not achieve name-brand recognition outside industry circles in part because of her "chameleon quality," John-Michael O'Sullivan, a journalist who is writing a biography on her, said in a phone interview. "In an era when models still did their own hair and makeup, Barbara proved to have a mastery for reinvention."
With her peak modeling years drawing to a close, Ms. Mullen moved to Switzerland in 1959 and opened Barbara's Bazar, a boutique, in the Alpine ski village of Klosters. It proved an early showcase for designers like Kenzo and Emanuel Ungaro and lured patrons like Greta Garbo, Deborah Kerr and Princess Margaret.
Ms. Mullen leaves no immediate survivors. Her first husband, James Punderford, died in 1955. Her second husband, Fredi Morel, whom she married in 1962, died in 2019.
In a 2010 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Ms. Bassman gave further tribute to Ms. Mullen. "There are models that are not models but muses," she said. "She had everything marvelous: a beautiful neck, grace, the ability to respond to me."
Interviewed for the same article, Ms. Mullen recalled: "I moved very well in front of the camera. My arms, my legs -- I seemed able to do anything with them -- I felt absolutely wonderful when I moved with Lillian. It was like being free -- it was like being in heaven."

Fabulous Framing, but Where Are the Big Ideas?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Saint Laurent and Dior play it safe in Paris.
In the middle of the Champ de Mars, not far from the foot of the Eiffel Tower silhouetted in the evening sky like a power postcard, Anthony Vaccarello of Saint Laurent constructed a monumental faux-marble platform, the better to showcase his spring collection. Austin Butler arrived and embraced his "Elvis" director, Baz Luhrmann, who was sitting next to Anna Wintour. Hailey Bieber posed with Kate Moss. Smartphones flashed. On the sea of grass below, a sea of onlookers gawked.
Yet sometimes the bigger the brand, the more grandiose the scenography, the higher the celebrity wattage, the smaller the ideas. Or so it seemed as Paris Fashion Week began.
After all, what appeared in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower as dusk fell, despite the fabulous framing, was essentially 49 shades of flight suit.
There were flight suits with big patch pockets, strong shoulders and cinched waists; strapless flight suits; flight suit cargo pants with sheer leotard tops; flight suit shirt dresses; tank tops (the kind you wear under a flight suit) cut slightly longer, so they became a mini dress; and cloudlike mousseline in the same color as a flight suit.
The reference and the palette was Yves Saint Laurent's safari collection of 1967; the muse was Amelia Earhart. If she had landed her plane at Le Bourget airport just outside of Paris, accessorized and went straight to Raspoutine for a martini, this is exactly how she might look. But strip away the needle-sharp stilettos, the leather gauntlets and aviator caps, the shades and chunky gold jewelry -- take away the très chic styling -- and what remains is still a jumpsuit.
Granted, it was beautifully cut; both more covered up and utilitarian than usual for Mr. Vaccarello's Saint Laurent. And there's no question that sometimes it's hard not to read the news of the day and think that taking off and escaping to parts unknown is exactly what you need. That less is liberating. But even so, you'd probably want more than one outfit in your luggage.
As it happens, there were a few at Dior, though they were hard to see through the bells and whistles of the set. Maria Grazia Chiuri had enlisted the Italian artist Elena Bellantoni, who is firmly in the Barbara Kruger/Jenny Holzer school of contemporary art, to create a video installation that circled all four walls of the temporary Dior megalith in the middle of the Tuileries Garden.
"Barbie"-centric neon pink and yellow gave way to advertising photos of stereotypical babe-like women that were juxtaposed against messages such as "No-body is yours; No-body is perfect," "Reverse the mirror, subvert the rules" and "Liberation of bodies is not commercial liberalism." (The irony of the latter being used at the behest of one of the biggest commercial entities in luxury does not seem to have occurred to anyone.)
In a preview, Ms. Chiuri said the point was that we are so inundated with images in the constant stream of our digital lives that we forget to interrogate what we see, and the images (and what they represent) become absorbed into our consciousness and form our opinions without us even realizing it, creating the messy world in which we now live. It is important, she said, to step back and confront those received conventions.
Which in her case, translated as confronting the idea that Dior, or the Dior woman, was merely a Bar jacket and a New Look skirt. Instead she offered terrific crisp shirts wrenched to the side to show a shoulder (inspired by an archival 1948 design) or cut with only one sleeve, paired with cool monochromatic tailored separates -- jackets, skirts and pants -- silk screened with X-ray photographs by Brigitte Niedermair of the (yes, again) Eiffel Tower, or blurry maps of Parisian streets.
Lace woven with sorcerer's symbols like the moon and stars made up loose, almost Victorian dresses that teased the body beneath -- now you see it, now you don't; fishnet dresses and skirts were paired with fuzzy knits and leather motorcycle jackets; ribbed knits were speckled with ghostly moth holes; and denim was charred at the hems, as if it had been rescued from the stake.
The familiar, going up in flames, is a powerful suggestion, but it was subtly made -- as was the collection as a whole. Maybe too subtly. Ms. Chiuri's subversion is in the details. Her rebellion is less in the overt feminism she espouses in her collaborations, which is really just candy for the smartphone set, and more in the way she insists on the wearability of a pleated skirt, and then weaves witchcraft into the weft.
Perhaps that's the bargain with the devil that designers need to make right now: easy-to-sell clothes that don't really challenge preconceptions, just nudge them slightly onward, but are themselves dressed up with enough peripheral pizazz to explode through the small screen.
But who, really, do such unbalanced ambitions serve? Once upon a time Dior upended all ideas of what women should wear and caused a scandal in Paris; once upon a time Saint Laurent's collections regularly sent editors into conniptions, they were so shocked out of their comfort zones by what they saw. Both designers changed how women dressed -- how women expressed themselves and claimed their place in the world -- forever.
This may be an anxious, risk-averse time. But maybe that's actually the perfect time to do it again.

Family Fight, With Pierre Cardin's Legacy at Issue: [Style Desk]

Full text: The Pierre Cardin heirs are in an epic battle over the designer's legacy. The French fashion world is getting the popcorn ready.
The French fashion designer Pierre Cardin liked to brag about all he had accomplished since he started his brand in 1950. When he welcomed a reporter into his studio at 27 Avenue de Marigny in 1999, he showed off big black-and-white photographs of his factory in France in the 1970s and pictures of him standing in Red Square with models in 1986; Cardin logo items produced by hundreds of licenses; and a catalog of his most famous futurist looks.
"All the couturiers were influenced by me," he said. "Everyone knows Pierre Cardin."
What he didn't like to talk about was what would become of his company after he was gone. Indeed, three months before Mr. Cardin died in December 2020, at 98, after a bout of Covid-19, he told a Paris Match reporter: "After my death? I don't think about it. I didn't organize anything. NOTHING."
That lack of organization has led to an epic legal battle among 22 of Mr. Cardin's grandnieces and grandnephews who claim to be his heirs, as he never married or had children. His longtime business and life partner, André Oliver, died in 1993.
On one side of the fight is Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, the 52-year-old Italian grandson of Mr. Cardin's older brother Erminio. (Mr. Cardin, né Pietro Cardini in 1922 near Treviso, Italy, was the youngest of 13.) Mr. Basilicati-Cardin -- he annexed the Cardin name in 2018 -- worked for his great-uncle for more than 20 years. Since 2020, he has been the general manager of the holding company, Pierre Cardin Evolution, and artistic director of the Pierre Cardin brand. On Monday night, he will stage a Pierre Cardin fashion show at the French Communist Party headquarters in Paris.
Mr. Basilicati-Cardin insists that he is the rightful heir -- the one designated by Mr. Cardin, per an unsigned, unregistered will -- and his brother and sister support his claim. He wants to maintain ownership of the company and continue to serve as the head of its business and run the creative side.
In the other camp are 19 cousins from six other family branches, who want to sell the company and cash out. Four of these cousins, Patricia, Laurence, Régine and Marie-Christine (the granddaughters of Mr. Cardin's sister, Giovanna Cardin), have filed civil lawsuits and criminal complaints against Mr. Basilicati-Cardin, accusing him of crimes, including elder abuse and forgery, all of which Mr. Basilicati denies.
"It's sad that such a storied house come to this," said Mr. Cardin's great-nephew Louis Cardin-Edwards, who worked in the Pierre Cardin studio for 20 years and was fired by Mr. Basilicati-Cardin days after Mr. Cardin's death. "So inelegant."
Mr. Cardin arrived as a toddler in France when his parents fled Mussolini's Italy, after World War I. The Cardini clan settled in Saint-Étienne, a small city in central France, and the name was shortened to Cardin.
Mr. Cardin studied architecture, but his love of fashion and tailoring was stronger. He arrived in Paris after World War II and worked for the Paquin and Schiaparelli couture houses before landing a studio job with a young designer named Christian Dior. Among the ensembles Mr. Cardin personally cut and sewed for Mr. Dior's debut collection in February 1947 was Bar, a black and white hourglass suit that came to symbolize the house's New Look.
Three years later, Mr. Cardin founded his namesake house. He made his reputation the following year when he designed 30 costumes for Carlos de Beistegui's extravagant masquerade ball in Venice. In 1958, Mr. Cardin introduced men's wear, which is still a strong business for the label, and he is credited with inventing the bubble dress, a fitted bodice with a full skirt pulled in at the knees.
During the space age and Pop Art movements of the 1960s, Mr. Cardin embraced futurism, turning out mod outfits in geometric shapes and bold colors. In 1970, he hired an 18-year-old Parisian named Jean Paul Gaultier as an assistant.
"Pierre Cardin invented things," Mr. Gaultier said during an interview with The New York Times in 2018. "It was true modernity."
Mr. Cardin was forward-looking in business too, selling in the untapped luxury markets of Japan in the 1950s, China in the 1970s and the Soviet Union in the 1980s. He became the king of licenses, slapping his logo onto everything from perfume to frying pans. In 1981, he bought Maxim's, the Art Nouveau restaurant gem, and licensed that name as well.
In his spare time, Mr. Cardin bought property -- a lot of it -- including buildings and apartments near the Élysée Palace, where he had his company headquarters and home. He also owned a mill in Normandy; an apartment on Fifth Avenue; the 13th-century Palazzo Ca' Bragadin in Venice, where Casanova once lived; the 17th-century Chateau de Théoule and the avant-garde Palais Bulles on the Côte d'Azur; and the 11th-century Château de Lacoste, the Marquis de Sade's former home in Provence, along with dozens of apartments and houses in the surrounding hilltop village. The inheritance of all of this, and more, is in question.
"I was surprised that the family would inherit because my uncle told me that he wanted the company to continue and not transmit it to his family," said Mr. Cardin-Edwards, 39, who was the lone family member to work with Mr. Cardin in the studio. He is not an heir, though his mother, Marie-Christine, is, and she is among the four sisters suing. "My uncle said he didn't understand the concept of family inheritance," he said. "He was against it."
But Mr. Cardin was also against dealing with the issue. "Every time we said, 'Let's go to the notary and put it down on paper,' he canceled at the last minute," Mr. Cardin-Edwards said. "He couldn't imagine someone replacing him."
Emmanuel Beffy, who Mr. Cardin employed to oversee Asia licenses, real estate and cultural projects, concurred: "He didn't want to hand over his power. He wanted to keep it until the end."
Enter Mr. Basilicati-Cardin. Born and raised in Padua, Italy, he was a civil engineer by training when, at 25, he finally got to know his famous uncle at an art exhibition in Venice that Mr. Basilicati-Cardin had organized. "He said, 'Tell me about yourself,' and we spent two hours talking," Mr. Basilicati-Cardin recalled during an interview with The Times. "Then he said, 'Why don't you live here, in my palazzo?"'
Mr. Cardin employed Mr. Basilicati-Cardin to oversee the Tuscan source that supplied Maxim's mineral water and, later, several other companies based in Italy. In 2018, Mr. Cardin named Mr. Basilicati-Cardin the general manager of the holding company. It was then that Mr. Basilicati, as he was known, decided to add Cardin to his name. "I went to the Treviso town hall and did all the administrative procedures," he told La Gazette Drouot.
While Mr. Basilicati-Cardin held an important title in the company, Jean-Louis Rivière, the lawyer representing the four sisters, said: "He didn't have the right to sign a contract or sell anything. No power whatsoever." Mr. Basilicati-Cardin said the arrangement was to prepare him for eventual takeover of the business.
That changed in late 2020. While gravely ill after a Covid-19 infection, Mr. Cardin gave Mr. Basilicati-Cardin power of attorney. Mr. Rivière described the document's signature as "suspicious" since, he said, "Mr. Cardin was in a coma, or semi-coma, at the time."
Not so, Mr. Basilicati-Cardin said: The document was signed by Mr. Cardin at home, before a notary and two doctors who attested to his mental competency.
Nevertheless, the Cardin sisters accused their cousin of elder abuse, fraud and breach of trust. The Paris prosecutor's office opened an investigation earlier this year.
Since assuming control, Mr. Basilicati-Cardin has brought in the respected Paris Society hospitality group to revive Maxim's -- it will reopen at the end of October -- and sold several of the Lacoste properties to the Savannah College of Art and Design, which has a campus in the village. He also fired Mr. Cardin-Edwards, who he accused of theft in a police report.
At issue is a pair of scissors and one of Mr. Cardin's Académie des Beaux-Arts jackets; he asked to be buried with them. Mr. Cardin-Edwards said that, with permission of the studio head, he took the jackets and two pairs of scissors to the hospital for Mr. Cardin to make his choice. Mr. Cardin-Edwards dropped off the selected ones at the funeral home and returned home with the others.
Mr. Basilicati-Cardin accused Mr. Cardin-Edwards of stealing the rejects and asserts that Mr. Cardin-Edwards said he would return them only if he received a raise and a promotion, an allegation Mr. Cardin-Edwards denies. Mr. Cardin-Edwards said he returned the jacket to the studio but kept the scissors.
"They were plain scissors, nothing special, and they didn't belong to the company anyway," he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Basilicati-Cardin fired him.
Mr. Cardin-Edwards was stunned by the charge, and his ouster. He often spent vacations as a boy with Mr. Basilicati-Cardin at Mr. Cardin's retreat in Théoule-sur-Mer -- times he recalled as "perfect."
"I gave 20 years to the house and was close with my uncle," Mr. Cardin-Edwards said. "To be fired one day to the next and treated as a thief days after the death -- it's nearly indecent to behave like that." Mr. Cardin-Edwards filed an unfair dismissal suit with the French labor court; it, too, is pending.
Most upsetting to the family is Mr. Basilicati-Cardin's claim that he is Mr. Cardin's sole heir. He said that Mr. Cardin's wishes were detailed in a will dated Nov. 10, 2016, which Mr. Basilicati-Cardin said he discovered last year in Mr. Cardin's apartment in Paris, just as heirs who are in favor of selling received an offer by French business group to buy the Cardin group for 800 million euros.
Because the will was not found during the original inventory of Mr. Cardin's estate and, though initialed, was unsigned and never registered with French authorities, the four sisters charge that it is invalid. Mr. Beffy is skeptical, too: "Pierre Cardin always signed documents 'Pierre Cardin,' not with initials."
In March, a judge ruled the will invalid, a decision Mr. Basilicati-Cardin has appealed. The Paris court of appeals will hear arguments on Nov. 2 and is expected to rule by the end of the year.
"There are two possibilities of resolution," Mr. Rivière said. "The Basilicati-Cardin will is canceled and my clients and their cousins are legitimized as heirs, or it is confirmed and he gets control of everything."
To complicate matters, Mr. Beffy has another will by Mr. Cardin, from 2013. In it, Mr. Cardin stated that Mr. Beffy would receive the Norman manor, Marie-Christine Cardin-Edwards would get an apartment, and Mr. Beffy and Mr. Basilicati-Cardin would inherit all that is "movable," meaning furniture, cars, jewelry, artwork and bank accounts. The document was signed and dated, but, Mr. Beffy said, "the notary didn't register it."
"I am now waiting to see what happens," Mr. Beffy said.
And then there is the question of company ownership. At the time of his death, Mr. Cardin held 99.999 percent of the company. The remaining 0.001 percent is held by Mr. Basilicati-Cardin, who said that his great-aunt Giovanna, the mother of the four sisters suing him, signed the share to him a month before she died in 2000, at 97.
Impossible, say the sisters, as well as Mr. Cardin-Edwards. "I saw her that month, and she didn't recognize me, so I find it hard to understand how she could sign a document so important," he said.
All awaits judgment. Potential buyers -- "big groups," Mr. Rivière said -- are circling in case Mr. Basilicati-Cardin loses and the family is able to put the company up for sale.
"We are serene," Mr. Rivière said, "because we believe in justice."

An article last Thursday about a dinner celebrating the collaboration between the artist Jean-Michael Othoniel and Dior misstated, in some copies, the year in which Charlize Theron became the face of Dior's J'adore perfume. It was 2004, not 1999.
OBITUARIES
Because of an editing error, an obituary on Monday about Dick Clark, who as a United States senator from Iowa pushed for a more liberal foreign policy, particularly toward Africa, misspelled the surname of a former South African chief propagandist. He was Eschel Rhoodie, not Roodie.

Full text: At the start of New York Fashion Week, the artist Jean-Michel Othoniel co-hosted a meal to celebrate his latest collaboration with Dior.
"There's a fountain with perfume in it?" asked the English actor Leo Woodall, his eyebrows raised in disbelief. One might think the star of HBO's second season of "White Lotus" would be unfazed by extravagant decoration, but this he'd never seen.
To celebrate the release of Dior's new L'Or de J'adore fragrance and the house's most recent collaboration with the French sculptor Jean-Michel Othoniel, the brand hosted a 100-person dinner at the Palm House inside the Brooklyn Botanic Garden the night before New York Fashion Week began. Spaced out across two long banquet tables were, indeed, 14 miniature Murano glass fountains -- made for the occasion by Othoniel, the event's co-host -- which bubbled quietly with a watered-down version of Dior's scent all night.
"Oh yeah, I got a whiff," said Woodall, after inhaling deeply while standing over one. It was about two feet tall and made of golden glass orbs stacked on top of one another -- a nod to the perfume bottle's design. Now curious, the actress Meghann Fahy, one of Woodall's "White Lotus" co-stars, did the same, pronouncing the scent "gorgeous -- and subtle, too." Developed by the perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, it has notes of orange blossom, jasmine and centifolia rose.
The cool, fragrant air inside the Victorian-style building offered much-needed respite from the sweaty, 80-degree weather outside, where six new pieces by Othoniel were on display as part of his latest exhibition, "The Flowers of Hypnosis," sponsored by Dior's Cultural Gardens Initiative. The brand began working with the artist, whose pieces often resemble looping configurations of giant jewelry beads, in 2012, and for the L'Or de J'adore release, the house commissioned 100 miniature versions of his "Golden Rose" (2023) sculpture to accompany a limited-edition version of the perfume's bottle.
"In the house of Dior, gardens have always been so important," said Véronique Courtois, the president and C.E.O. of Parfums Christian Dior, in a toast. "Mr. Dior cultivated them as places of memory and rebirth. Of course, flowers inspired so many of his couture creations and so many of his fragrances, which were considered the finishing touch of the dress."
Today, Othoniel believes gardens are just as significant to everyone's well-being, if not more so. "People need places like that to relax and leave the stress of the city," he said. With this dinner, his hope was to activate all the guests' senses -- sight, sound, touch, smell and taste -- at once, forming lasting memories. "Working for the souvenir is what I love," he added. "It's not like a museum, where you can come back. This is so spectacular. It's just something you remember as a crazy night."
The attendees: In addition to Woodall, 27, and Fahy, 33, guests included the actresses Charlize Theron, 48 -- who has been the face of Dior's J'adore perfume since 2004 -- Alexandra Daddario, 37, Rachel Brosnahan, 33, Natalia Dyer, 28, Anna Diop, 35, and Stephanie Hsu, 32; the artist Mickalene Thomas, 52, who has collaborated with the brand a number of times, most recently for the spring 2023 couture collection; the art dealer Mariane Ibrahim; the gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin, 55, who represents Othoniel; the photographers Brigitte Lacombe, 72, and Maripol, 76; and the model Maye Musk, 75.
The table: This was Othoniel's first time hosting a dinner with the fashion house, something he'd long dreamed of doing. "It's really like a fairy-tale presentation," he said. "My sculptures are quite abstract and minimal, but the dinner was totally baroque, which is what I love." For the event, he and his team made 14 fountains (seven for each table); 50 vases, filled for the meal with pink and white roses; and 50 lamps that glowed with a golden hue from within -- all produced in Murano, Italy. They were placed on a long centerpiece made of Murano glass, as well, which Othoniel described as a "gold brick road." He also designed the dinner plates featuring watercolor versions of his gold L'Or de J'adore sculpture design.
The food: The meal began with a salad of beets, white strawberries, gem lettuce, buckwheat and goat cheese, plated in the form of a blossoming flower. Next came striped bass served atop a pillow of yellow jeweled rice -- a nod to L'Or de J'adore's gold-hued bottle -- as well as carrots and snap peas mixed in. For dessert: a dark chocolate tart topped with salted caramel and Cara Cara orange slices, followed by bite-size fruit-flavored gummies and chocolate and caramel bonbons for guests to enjoy on their way out the door.
The drinks: A Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc and a Newton Vineyard unfiltered cabernet sauvignon, plus Ruinart Champagne with dessert.
The music: During cocktail hour in the garden before dinner, the Harlem Chamber Players performed Mozart's "Spring" quartet, as well as pieces by Franz Joseph Haydn, Joseph Bologne and Ludwig van Beethoven.
The conversation: The Palm House naturally inspired talk of nuptials. One guest noted that she'd gotten married in the same building years earlier and had attended another wedding at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden this summer. Is it all booked up? The garden's president and C.E.O., Adrian Benepe, nodded emphatically. In fact, after dinner, the space had to be cleared for a wedding the next day at 4 p.m. (Benepe hoped to keep some of the Dior set decorations intact.) That said, it's a relatively well-kept secret that two small ceremonies are permitted per day on Saturdays and Sundays in the garden for the low cost of $ 600. The only catch is that they must be held from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.
Tips: Of course, Othoniel loves to put flowers on his table at home. "But not in this very grand way," he said with a laugh. Fahy's entertaining rule: "You can't run out of wine; that's a big no-no." (She prefers a cold sauvignon blanc.) Woodall added that you might also want to have a little yourself before guests arrive. "As host, you've got to set the tone, so you've got to be as chilled out as you possibly can be," he said. "It can be stressful, and if you put that energy out, people are going to think, 'Oh, this isn't going well."'

At the Top of an Empire Built on 'Desirability': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: One afternoon in July, not long after being named the wealthiest man on the planet by Forbes, Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, took his place on a stage with a view of the Eiffel Tower before a packed crowd of French dignitaries and reporters.
In the front row sat four of his five adult children -- the fifth was watching from New York, where he is an executive at Tiffany & Company. Their father had raised all of them since they could walk to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.
The occasion was Mr. Arnault's announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million euros (about $ 161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies will play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler whose clients once included Napoleon's wife Joséphine, will design the Olympic medals, and Moët Hennessy wines will flow in hospitality suites.
"The partnership will help promote France throughout the world," Mr. Arnault declared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of communications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge company his father has built: "For a dream, there is no price."
It was a moment of public triumph for Mr. Arnault, a sign of how embedded in the fabric of France LVMH has become. Over more than 30 years, he has forged LVMH into the world's largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France, with a presence in 81 countries. His brands -- 75 of them -- are the stars of the luxury world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne. It has given him entree to prime ministers and presidents, and allowed him to amass a museum-worthy art collection.
But his success has brought challenges. In France, Mr. Arnault has become a lightning rod for anger over growing economic inequality. In April, 10 days after Forbes put him atop its annual list of richest people, protesters stormed his office in Paris during nationwide strikes over raising the retirement age. His effigy was burned as a symbol of capitalist evil.
Mr. Arnault's five children were taught in France's best schools and raised to take leadership posts in the business, but his dream of keeping LVMH in the family may force him to elevate one above the rest.
And in recent months LVMH's stock has taken a beating, down 19 percent since hitting a high in April. The company reported a dip in U.S. sales in the second quarter, and the Chinese economy, a big source of LVMH's revenue, is faltering.
The falling shares mean that Mr. Arnault (now worth about $ 195 billion, Forbes says) dropped to the second-richest person in the world in June, eclipsed by Elon Musk. This month, LVMH was replaced as Europe's most valuable company by Denmark's Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, the hugely popular drugs being used for weight loss.
At 74, Mr. Arnault has been working to make sure his company -- created by gobbling up many European luxury houses that had been weakened by bickering family owners -- will stay firmly in his family's hands, safe from corporate raiders like himself. Last year, he persuaded the board to raise the mandatory retirement age for the chief executive and chairman to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensures the family's control of LVMH, locking in his children -- each of whom has been named to highly visible positions within the company -- as the chief decision makers.
Mr. Arnault has broadened LVMH beyond extravagant playthings into the world of experiences, acquiring over 50 grand hotels and resorts. And with the Olympics deal, he has extended his tentacles more deeply into the world of sports.
Mr. Arnault's changes mean he doesn't have to retire next year as originally expected. That hasn't stopped speculation about whether he can ensure that his heirs -- who dress in almost identical Dior navy suits (save for Delphine, his one daughter, who often wears Dior skirts) -- avoid a "Succession"-like drama.
The French media is full of headlines comparing the Arnaults to the Roys, the fictional family in the HBO series. There are TikTok videos explaining why the Arnaults are "the real 'Succession' family." The family hates this talk, and takes pains to play down parallels to the show.
A Family Affair
The eldest sibling is Delphine, 48, chairman and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture and a member of the LVMH executive committee and its board. Antoine, 46, is not only in charge of the group's image and sustainability efforts but chief executive of its men's wear brand Berluti, chairman of the Italian luxury house Loro Piana, chief executive of Christian Dior S.E. and a member of the LVMH board. Both are from Mr. Arnault's first marriage, to Anne Dewavrin. The youngest three are from Mr. Arnault's second marriage, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist: Alexandre, 31, is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany; Frédéric, 28, is chief executive of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 24, is Louis Vuitton's watch director.
In a rare interview in LVMH's discreetly lavish headquarters in Paris -- this article is the first for which Mr. Arnault and his children have agreed to talk on the record to an international newspaper -- Mr. Arnault brushed off any comparison to television's Roys with a wave of his hand.
"It's not an obligation, nor inevitable, that a kid is my successor," he said, leaning back in a buttery leather chair at a round table in his private conference room. On one wall was a Picasso; on two others, Warhols. His son Antoine, in his role as image gatekeeper, sat across the table.
Mr. Arnault was wearing a white shirt, a blue tie, a navy jacket and black slacks, though these days he's usually without a tie, Antoine said, part of a more casual uniform that has accompanied new efforts to engage with the outside world. The children have been instrumental in pushing their father to be more open about the conglomerate.
"The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor," Mr. Arnault continued. "But it's not something that I hope is a duel for the near future."
Still, legacy is clearly on Mr. Arnault's mind. He grew up in Roubaix, once a booming textile center in northern France, and watched family industrial dynasties collapse as children or grandchildren took their eyes off the business or squandered inheritances.
"After one or two generations, it broke down because they had it too easy," he said. It was a mistake he vowed not to make with his own children. "I didn't want them to start going to big parties," Mr. Arnault said. "I made them work."
Business at the Dining Table
Every month, the five siblings meet with their father over lunch on the top floor of LVMH's headquarters.
For an hour and a half, they discuss business, including finances, the curve of the bracelet on a new €50,000 Vuitton watch, upcoming product introductions and the social media payoff of over-the-top events. For example, a Vuitton men's wear show by the brand's new designer, Pharrell Williams, shut down Paris's Pont Neuf and attracted such names as Kim Kardashian and LeBron James, resulting in over 16 million YouTube hits.
"Make no mistake," Jean said. "We discuss things, but at the end, it's he who decides."
Amid the bonhomie, the siblings say, Mr. Arnault is gauging how each of his children is measuring up.
A graduate of France's elite École Polytechnique, Mr. Arnault honed his children's math skills nearly every night before dinnertime. Antoine recalled that getting anything less than a perfect grade on important exams "wasn't acceptable."
Jean jokes about having "24 years of experience, because every lunch and dinner was always about work."
Ian Rogers, a former chief digital officer at LVMH, said Alexandre had told him, "My business education started when I was 9, at the breakfast table."
By age 10, Delphine was accompanying her father to Dior stores. He has made weekend inspections of LVMH properties in Paris with his children a routine for more than three decades. Alexandre said: "I remember, age 7, thinking, 'Why is he doing this, and why is he asking the same question to the same salesperson, every Saturday of the year?"'
The father paired each of his children with a mentor as they entered the business, to teach them the brands and monitor their performance. Delphine and Antoine started in novice positions (Delphine sold Dior perfume at age 17) before ascending to the C-suite. The three youngest moved more quickly into senior roles, "probably because he feels time is running out and he needs to speed up the process of learning," said Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former chief of the LVMH fashion group and the current chief executive of Tory Burch.
All of them understand that the family itself is now as much a brand as the brands they own, and have wasted no time making their presence known.
In less than two years at Tiffany, Alexandre helped seal a deal with Beyoncé and Jay-Z, creating a social media sensation. (In 2016, Alexandre persuaded his father to acquire Rimowa, a German maker of aluminum suitcases, which was founded in 1898. He immediately set about making the utilitarian luggage company cool.) Delphine created the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, a high-profile talent competition. And Antoine has thrown wide the previously closed doors of many LVMH companies with a series of "open days" that invite the public inside factories and workshops.
Their father never forced them to join LVMH, the children said. Even so, Frédéric said, "he found a way to make me want to give my life to the family business like he did." (Children from both marriages grew up vacationing together, and were raised to play tennis and piano -- their father's favorite pastimes.)
The clan has gotten bigger after two glamorous marriages: Antoine to the model and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova, and Alexandre to Géraldine Guyot, who has an accessories brand, Destree, that is independent of LVMH. Delphine's partner is a digital entrepreneur and billionaire, Xavier Niel.
When Alexandre wed Geraldine in Venice in 2021, guests included Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Roger Federer (who frequently plays tennis with Mr. Arnault). His three brothers were groomsmen. They share a family group chat, in which they swap baby pictures.
"I know it's disappointing for a lot of people," Antoine said, "but we actually get on well."
The iPhone vs. Dom Pérignon
Mr. Arnault was born into a construction company run by his father and founded by his grandfather, who took him to building sites when he was 7.
When Mr. Arnault was 28, his father handed him the keys to the business. He refocused it on real estate, and soon after moved to New Rochelle, N.Y., to expand in an environment friendlier to entrepreneurs than socialist France.
It was the era of the corporate raider, and Mr. Arnault soaked in the more aggressive approach to mergers and acquisitions. When he returned to Paris at 35, after a rather unsuccessful run developing condominiums in Palm Beach, Fla., he came back as a barbarian at the gate -- and with a new idea: A New York cabdriver had told him that he didn't know the name of France's president, "but I know Dior!"
As it happened, the French government wanted to unload a bankrupt textile conglomerate that included Dior. Mr. Arnault bought it for 1 franc, fired 9,000 people and discarded everything except Dior, which he then used to help finance a brutal takeover of LVMH, a group recently formed from the luggage maker Louis Vuitton and the Moët Hennessy Champagne and cognac house.
The battle for LVMH made his reputation. Enlisted by Henry Racamier, one of LVMH's founders, to buy shares and prevent another group from gaining control, Mr. Arnault did as he was asked, but didn't stop. He ultimately turned the tables, seized control of LVMH and forced out Mr. Racamier, who said at the time, "We would like to find a modus vivendi, but it's hard with a person like that."
His style sent shock waves through the clubby world of French business, where he became known as "the Wolf in Cashmere." It was the beginning of a three-decade spree of empire building. He pursued family-owned brands known for craftsmanship and style: Pucci, Fendi, Celine, Loro Piana. Some were happy to be bought out; some were not. Losses were rare: Gucci and Hermès slipped through his fingers after ugly public battles.
During Mr. Arnault's takeover of Tiffany in 2020, as the pandemic hurt earnings, he was accused of enlisting the French government's help to delay the deal's closing, and in the end won a discount on the negotiated price. (At $ 16 billion, it remains the luxury sector's biggest deal.)
He has expanded LVMH into luxury hospitality in recent years. LVMH's holdings include the Cipriani hotel in Venice, the Orient Express train and the "21" Club in New York. There are restaurants in flagship stores for Tiffany and Dior, and a new four-story Moët cocktail bar in Paris.
Mr. Arnault's bets have usually paid off. Luxury, in all its forms, has been one of the most resilient investments on Wall Street in the last decade.
"He was always saying, 'The iPhone is great, but who knows if we will be using an iPhone in 10 years?"' Mr. Rogers, the former chief digital officer, said. "'Whereas I know people will continue to drink Dom Pérignon."'
Mr. Arnault has steered clear of picking sides when dealing with polarizing world leaders, whether cutting the ribbon on a new Vuitton factory in Texas alongside Donald J. Trump, who was president at the time, or meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to seal a loan of art to his museum in Paris, the Fondation Louis Vuitton.
"We are like Henry Kissinger," Mr. Arnault said. "We are not there to agree or disagree on the political aspect of the country in which we are doing business."
'They Need to Find a Type of Enemy'
Mr. Arnault insisted repeatedly during the interview that his main goal was not profits. "It's desirability," he said, "and we must make sure that in 50 years we are still at the top."
"Desirability," said Mr. Roussel, the former LVMH executive, is the most popular word at the company. But it highlights a potential problem, he said: "A consumer waking up and saying, 'You know, I'm buying this product, but there's someone making so much money out of it."'
"Is it desirable that you're buying a product from someone who is the richest man in the world?"
That sentiment was not evident this summer when Mr. Arnault visited China, one of LVMH's most lucrative markets. The "richest man" headlines from months earlier earned him a rock star's welcome. In Shanghai and Chengdu, crowds followed him and vied for selfies. Mothers asked him to bless their babies.
"Like the pope. Can you believe that?" he said. He was called, he said with a laugh, "the God of Fortune."
But back home, where passion about social and financial inequality stretches back to the French Revolution, Mr. Arnault is a divisive figure: hailed by the business and political worlds for building France's biggest corporate titan, and reviled by others for his almost unimaginable wealth.
For a family that tries to keep its fortune discreet, the "richest man" ranking this year still brings an unwelcome spotlight.
"The attention that you get when you're on the top of that list," Antoine said, "you can't really prepare for that."
In April, as France's raucous nationwide protests gathered steam over President Emmanuel Macron's bid to raise the retirement age two years to 64, demonstrators broke into the LVMH headquarters, lighting smoke bombs and denouncing Mr. Arnault as the embodiment of the ultrarich.
"He is a symbol of what is wrong in this society!" one shouted. Others carried signs showing Mr. Arnault as Mr. Monopoly in a top hat, with accusations that he evaded taxes, exploited workers and laid off thousands to build power and wealth.
This month, when Mr. Arnault announced that the Arnault family would donate €10 million to Restos du Coeur, a food bank, critics said it was a drop in the bucket.
"They need to find a type of enemy," Mr. Arnault said. "France is not a country which is motivated by business success, unlike the United States."
When his friend Warren Buffett walks around Manhattan, Mr. Arnault added, "he's like a Beatle." But when Mr. Arnault visits his stores in France, "I have to be careful," he said. "I don't like this, but I need bodyguards."
Antoine has advised his father to push back, and these days Mr. Arnault stresses the company's economic contributions: hundreds of thousands of jobs created worldwide, €5.5 billion paid annually in French taxes, and vast sums for art and culture, energy sustainability, scientific research, sports and youths.
Who's Next?
What no one debates is that Mr. Arnault understood, before almost anyone else, luxury's potential as a generator of profit -- that creating beautiful things is about aspiration and belonging.
The question now is who can keep desirability at the heart of LVMH in an age of protests and global economic uncertainty.
Last year, Mr. Arnault tinkered with the corporate structure of his empire, concentrating decision-making with his five children. Each has a 20 percent stake, and they cannot sell their shares for 30 years without unanimous board approval.
His heirs "have been schooled by the best player in the world: All of them know the business," said Sidney Toledano, head of the LVMH fashion group and one of Mr. Arnault's longest-serving executives. "Are they going to be the pilots? Maybe."
If the next chief executive is not named Arnault, the children say they are OK with that. After all, Alexandre said, "there's the risk that none of us is able to run the business as well as he has."
The siblings are beginning to discuss how they can raise their own children with the same sense of duty that was instilled in them, Delphine said. Mr. Arnault has begun taking her elementary-school-age daughter on his weekend rounds of stores.
But Alexandre added: "By the time they reach ages where they can have responsibilities, my father will still probably be C.E.O. of LVMH. He'll be 110 years old."

PARIS — One afternoon in July, not long after being named the wealthiest man on the planet by Forbes, Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods empire, took his place on a stage before a crowd of French dignitaries and reporters.
In the front row sat four of his five adult children — the fifth was watching from New York, where he is an executive at Tiffany & Co. Their father had raised all of them to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.
The occasion was Arnault’s announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million euros (about $161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies will play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler, will design the Olympic medals, and Moët Hennessy wines will flow in hospitality suites.
“The partnership will help promote France throughout the world,” Arnault declared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of communications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge company his father has built: “For a dream, there is no price.”
It was a moment of public triumph for Arnault, a sign of how embedded in the fabric of France LVMH has become. Over more than 30 years, he has forged LVMH into the world’s largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France, with a presence in 81 countries. His brands — 75 of them — are the stars of the luxury world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom Pérignon Champagne.
But his success has brought challenges. In France, Arnault has become a lightning rod for anger over growing economic inequality. In April, 10 days after Forbes put him atop its annual list of richest people, protesters stormed his office in Paris during nationwide strikes over raising the retirement age.
And in recent months LVMH’s stock has taken a beating, down 19% since hitting a high in April. The company reported a dip in U.S. sales in the second quarter, and the Chinese economy, a big source of LVMH’s revenue, is faltering.
At 74, Arnault has been working to make sure his company — created by gobbling up many European luxury houses that had been weakened by bickering family owners — will stay firmly in his family’s hands. Last year, he persuaded the board to raise the mandatory retirement age for the CEO and chair to 80, from 75, and created a corporate structure that ensures the family’s control of LVMH, locking in his children — each of whom has been named to highly visible positions within the company — as the chief decision-makers.
Arnault’s changes mean he doesn’t have to retire next year as originally expected. That hasn’t stopped speculation about whether he can ensure that his heirs avoid a “Succession”-like drama. (The French media is full of headlines comparing the Arnaults with the Roys, the fictional family in the HBO series. The family hates this talk, and takes pains to play down parallels to the show.)
The eldest sibling is Delphine, 48, chair and CEO of Christian Dior Couture and a member of the LVMH executive committee and its board. Antoine, 46, is not only in charge of the group’s image and sustainability efforts but CEO of its menswear brand Berluti, chair of the Italian luxury house Loro Piana, CEO of Christian Dior SE and a member of the LVMH board. Both are from Arnault’s first marriage, to Anne Dewavrin. The youngest three are from Arnault’s second marriage, to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist: Alexandre, 31, is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany; Frédéric, 28, is CEO of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 24, is Louis Vuitton’s watch director.
In a rare interview in LVMH’s headquarters in Paris, Arnault brushed off any comparison with television’s Roys.
“It’s not an obligation, nor inevitable, that a kid is my successor,” he said. “The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor. But it’s not something that I hope is a duel for the near future.”
Every month, the five siblings meet with their father over lunch on the top floor of LVMH’s headquarters.
For an hour and a half, they discuss business, including finances, upcoming product introductions and the social media payoff of over-the-top events. For example, a Vuitton menswear show by the brand’s new designer Pharrell Williams attracted such names as Kim Kardashian and LeBron James, resulting in over 16 million YouTube hits.
“Make no mistake,” Jean said. “We discuss things, but at the end, it’s he who decides.”
Amid the bonhomie, the siblings say, Arnault is gauging how each of his children is measuring up.
A graduate of France’s elite École Polytechnique, Arnault honed his children’s math skills nearly every night before dinnertime. Antoine recalled that getting anything less than a perfect grade on important exams “wasn’t acceptable.”
Ian Rogers, a former chief digital officer at LVMH, said Alexandre had told him, “My business education started when I was 9, at the breakfast table.”
By age 10, Delphine was accompanying her father to Dior stores. He has made weekend inspections of LVMH properties in Paris with his children a routine for more than three decades.
The father paired each of his children with a mentor as they entered the business, to teach them the brands and monitor their performance. Delphine and Antoine started in novice positions before ascending to the C-suite. The three youngest moved more quickly into senior roles, “probably because he feels time is running out and he needs to speed up the process of learning,” said Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former chief of the LVMH fashion group and the current CEO of Tory Burch.
All of them understand that the family itself is now as much a brand as the brands they own, and have wasted no time making their presence known.
In less than two years at Tiffany, Alexandre helped seal a deal with Beyoncé and Jay-Z, creating a social media sensation. (In 2016, Alexandre persuaded his father to acquire Rimowa, a German maker of aluminum suitcases, which was founded in 1898. He immediately set about making the utilitarian luggage company cool.) Delphine created the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, a high-profile talent competition. And Antoine has thrown wide the previously closed doors of many LVMH companies with a series of “open days” that invite the public inside factories and workshops.
Arnault insisted repeatedly during the interview that his main goal was not profits. “It’s desirability,” he said, “and we must make sure that in 50 years we are still at the top.”
“Desirability,” said Roussel, is the most popular word at the company. But it highlights a potential problem, he said: “A consumer waking up and saying, ‘You know, I’m buying this product, but there’s someone making so much money out of it.’
“Is it desirable that you’re buying a product from someone who is the richest man in the world?”
In France, Arnault is a divisive figure: hailed by the business and political worlds for building the country’s biggest corporate titan, and reviled by others for his almost unimaginable wealth.
In April, as France’s nationwide protests gathered steam over President Emmanuel Macron’s bid to raise the retirement age two years to 64, demonstrators broke into the LVMH headquarters, denouncing Arnault as the embodiment of the ultrarich. “He is a symbol of what is wrong in this society!” one shouted.
The question now is who can keep desirability at the heart of LVMH in an age of protests and global economic uncertainty.
Last year, Arnault tinkered with the corporate structure of his empire, concentrating decision-making with his five children. Each has a 20% stake, and they cannot sell their shares for 30 years without unanimous board approval.
His heirs “have been schooled by the best player in the world: All of them know the business,” said Sidney Toledano, head of the LVMH fashion group and one of Arnault’s longest-serving executives. “Are they going to be the pilots? Maybe.”
If the next CEO is not named Arnault, the children say they are OK with that. After all, Alexandre said, “there’s the risk that none of us is able to run the business as well as he has.”

Full text: Mr. Adams hosted fashion designers at Gracie Mansion, Dior held a dinner at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and J. Crew had the Strokes perform for its 40th anniversary party.
On Thursday evening, Mayor Eric Adams walked into a dining room at Gracie Mansion wearing a bright red blazer with polka-dot elbow patches.
"I just love this color," he said, continuing, "I just pick out of the closet whatever my mood is." (He didn't know where he got the jacket from.)
Mr. Adams was co-hosting the CFDA and Spotify NYFW Kick Off party at his official residence with the designer Thom Browne, and the mayor said his mood was "joyful."
"I was hanging out with fashion folks," he said, adding, "which I really, really love." He was sitting at a table adorned year-round with a white tablecloth, two unlit candles and a decorative soup tureen.
Just beyond the room, about 200 celebrities, fashion designers and media figures were packed tightly into a light-blue ballroom in the mansion. As "Bam Bam" by Sister Nancy and "What It Is" by Doechii played through the speakers, guests turned at an angle to shimmy past other attendees, who included Anna Wintour, Stacey Bendet, Gabriela Hearst, Vera Wang, David Lauren, Jordan Roth, Kathryn Newton and young designers from the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund.
The night before, Mr. Adams hosted a different event on the other side of Central Park. In his opening remarks at a town hall, he addressed the migrant crisis in New York, saying, "This issue will destroy New York City."
Asked about the impact of those provocative comments, which have been criticized by immigrant advocacy groups and some Democrats as discriminatory, Mr. Adams emphasized that he was referring to the implications of the situation, not the migrants, but he reiterated a similar message.
"The crisis, not the people, the crisis is undermining the economic strength of our city," he said. "The people want to come here to work, and their inability to do so, they can't contribute to the city. We're about to spend $ 12 billion. It is going to impact our schools. It's going to impact our police, it is going to impact our streets, it is going to impact everything in our city."
"And it is just wrong for New York City residents, taxpayers," he continued. "We came so far from the pandemic, and now this crisis is undermining everything this city has built and recovered from and it is going to hurt our city."
But during a speech addressing the attendees, Mr. Adams kept the focus on the fashion industry, its place in the city and the delight he takes in getting dressed, often wearing multiple outfits a day.
"It's a Shakespearean tragedy," he said, "to go into a city as beautiful as this and not really absorb every aspect of it, and the individuality of our designs, our fashion, our expression."
How did you want to feel tonight?
What was your idea behind getting dressed tonight?
Later that night, across the East River, partyers spread out in the lush Lily Pool Terrace of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for cocktails and a dinner hosted by Parfums Christian Dior to celebrate a limited edition bottle of the L'Or de J'adore perfume with the French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel.
Guests walked around votive candles as the Harlem Chamber Players performed alongside the sound of a water fountain. The crowd included Charlize Theron, the brand's longtime ambassador, as well as Maye Musk, Alexandra Daddario, Rachel Brosnahan, Meghann Fahy, Stephanie Hsu and Thomas Doherty.
Several of the large abstract beaded flowers in "Jean-Michel Othoniel: The Flowers of Hypnosis," an exhibit that runs through Oct. 22, emerged from the pond. (The limited-edition L'Or de J'adore bottle, which Mr. Othoniel created, features a miniature model of his sculptures and is sold in select Dior stores and on Dior.com for $ 15,000.)
Inside the Palm House, customized with cream carpeting and temporary walls, guests ate strawberry beet salad and striped bass. A few bubbling, gold-tower centerpieces, designed by Mr. Othoniel, emitted a special edition of the L'Or de J'adore scent into the room.
This was Mr. Othoniel's first exhibition with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and a return to the borough after his exhibit with the Brooklyn Museum over a decade ago.
"In my work, I want to bring people back to reality," Mr. Othoniel said. "I want people to enjoy being in the garden, to be protected by a garden out of the world, to be in a beautiful space where they can escape reality."
What did you keep in mind when you got dressed tonight?
Do you ever worry that you will offend people with perfume?
Earlier in the week, on Tuesday night, the Strokes took the rooftop stage at Pier 17 at an event celebrating the 40th anniversary of J. Crew.
As the band opened with their 2001 song "The Modern Age," many of the 600 attendees walked slowly toward the stage, set against the New York City skyline.
"Probably one of the coolest backgrounds we've ever had. Thanks, J.," Julian Casablancas said. (The first J. Crew store opened nearby at the South Street Seaport in 1983.)
The 90-degree evening with little breeze didn't stop guests from enjoying the melting ice-sculpture tower filled with oysters, shrimp and little neck clams.
At a time when J. Crew is still bouncing back after filing for bankruptcy protection in 2020 -- installing Brendon Babenzien as its men's creative director in 2021 -- the question of whether the brand can be "cool" again, hung in the heavy air.
"Anyone know what the J. stands for?" Mr. Casablancas, who was wearing sunglasses, a sleeveless vest and one fingerless glove, asked the audience.
For about half an hour, the band played their classics, including "Reptilia," "Last Nite" and "Is This It," as well as deeper cuts like "Hawaii." The crowd of guests included Joan Smalls, Diane Keaton, Sadie Sink, Adam Scott, Leon Bridges, Jenna Lyons, Cass Bird, Joshua Jackson and Jodie Turner-Smith.
Near the stage, in the front row, a handful of people danced with their full bodies, while the rest of the crowd head-bobbed tastefully.
At the end of the set, Blake Bensman, who said he had been to about 10 Strokes shows, said the rooftop performance was better than others he had seen.
"I have seen them at music festivals in other cities when they were not feeling it," Mr. Bensman said, adding: "I thought this was going to be a little paid in and out, but I think they had fun."
Do you feel cool?
What comes to mind when you think about J. Crew?

Birkenstock Files for I.P.O. In New York: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Birkenstock, the German shoemaker whose sandals have long been known as the brand favored by hippies and increasingly by hipsters, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting the company's aim to raise its global profile while still retaining its roots in Germany.
Since Birkenstock was acquired two years ago by the private equity firm L Catterton and the family investment company of Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire behind the luxury conglomerate LVMH, the company has established collaborations with well-known shoe designers and expanded its profile into more of a lifestyle product.
The offering could value the company at more than $ 8 billion Bloomberg News reported. Birkenstock plans to list the week of Oct. 9, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss business plans.
For the six months that ended on March 31, Birkenstock reported a net profit of 40 million euros, or $ 43 million, compared with €73 million it made during a year earlier.
Why It Matters: A start-up with deep roots in Germany
In a letter submitted with the offering application, Oliver Reichert, the company's chief executive, drew a link between Birkenstock's founding in 1774 to its present-day aspirations.
"We see ourselves as the oldest start-up on earth," Mr. Reichert said. "We are a brand backed by a family tradition of a quarter of a millennium with the resilience, timeless relevance and credibility of a multigenerational business."
From its beginnings as a shoemaker to the development of its unique orthopedic arch support in the early 20th century, the footwear brand has risen to become a fashion icon, appearing on the catwalks of New York and Milan. And in this summer's blockbuster movie, "Barbie," Birkenstocks are the down-to-earth alternative that Barbie is forced to accept over her jeweled stilettoes.
In recent years, the brand has introduced its sandals made with non-animal materials and a dizzying array of styles and colors. Collaborations with prominent shoe designers, including Christian Dior, Manolo Blahnik, Stüssy and Valentino Garavani, have helped to generate buzz and create demand in fashion circles.
The company's sales increased to €1.24 billion in 2022 from €292 million in 2014, according to the filing.
Background: A shoe not just for hippies
The shoes were introduced to Americans by a German woman who discovered them on a trip home to Germany in the 1960s, filled her suitcase with the shoes and tried to persuade U.S. retailers to market them. Traditional shoe stores rejected them, but they found a market in health food stores, where they were embraced by young people seeking an alternative lifestyle.
Today, the U.S. market accounts for more than half of Birkenstock's sales, with a network distributors and a growing online store that reaches customers directly in more than 75 countries.
Birkenstock's most basic two-strap styles, made from a more environmentally friendly, softer plastic, sell for about $ 40, while the most exclusive designer models can fetch up to $ 1,600. But the heart of the product remains its flexible, contoured foot bed, produced in Germany.
Women, who entered the work force in large numbers in the 1980s, are among the most loyal customers embracing the practicality and comfort offered by Birkenstocks, and make up 72 percent of the company's customers. But the shoes' appeal reaches across generations, making them as popular with millennials as they are with the boomer generation.
Potential Risks: The trick of taking tradition public
Birkenstock's statement said the company would face a number of risks in going public. Among them are the dangers posed by counterfeit products, it said, along with the "intense competition" from established companies and newcomers in the shoe market.
But with Birkenstock's profile deeply rooted in its reputation as a company from a small town in Germany, and as part of a counterculture uniform, even the decision to go public could cost it customers. "The transition from a historically family-owned German company to a publicly held company listed on a U.S. stock exchange may negatively impact our reputation," the statement said.

Full text: As the creative force for Christian Dior longer than its founder, he maintained a reputation for playful elegance throughout fashion's endless cycles.
Marc Bohan, the longest-serving creative director at Christian Dior, who spent nearly 30 years spinning out classically attuned looks with a touch of whimsy that, however resplendent, were meant to be worn, not gazed at on mannequins or in fashion magazines, died on Wednesday in Châtillon-sur-Seine, France. He was 97.

Full text: It's going to be something to see, from designer debuts to the celebrities on the front rows.
It's fashion month! The news may be full of Trump indictments, extreme weather and war, but the shows stop for almost no crisis (pandemics excepted). For anyone in need of a moment of escape or some inspiration to gird yourself for the day, they may, in fact, represent an increasingly important pressure valve. There's a reason, after the Covid lockdowns, the shows have returned in full, or even greater, force -- not just as industry events, but as full-fledged entertainment happenings that are extending their tentacles far beyond the runway. So prepare yourself for approximately four weeks of impossibly glamorous photos, street style and gossip. Here's what you need to know:
All Eyes on Milan
After seasons of relative calm and predictability (some might say stultifying sameness), Milan has become the city to watch, with the two debuts of the season. First up: Sabato De Sarno at Gucci. The former Valentino No. 2 is a relative unknown, and he's taking on a huge job, following in the footsteps of Alessandro Michele, whose version of Gucci may have looked familiar at the end but which changed not only the fortunes of the brand, but the direction of fashion itself. The stakes are very high for the $ 10 billion house, which reportedly wants to move in a more classic (read: Hermès) direction. We'll know if this is the case -- and if it works -- on Sept. 22.
Then there's Peter Hawkings, another longtime deputy, who became the creative director of Tom Ford in April after the brand was sold to Estée Lauder and Mr. Ford stepped down. Mr. Hawkings worked beside Mr. Ford for decades, and judging by his official portrait, is very much in the mold of his mentor (down to the tinted aviators). Given that Mr. Ford could be said to have coasted on his greatest hits in the last few years, there's hope that Mr. Hawkings will take the brand in something of a new direction.
Finally, while Moschino searches for a new designer (Jeremy Scott, who made it meme central during his 10-year tenure, left in March), the brand is handing over its 40th-anniversary show to four stylists -- Katie Grand, Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and Lucia Liu -- for a one-season-only inspired-by-the-archives extravaganza. The result is pretty much guaranteed to remind of us what we lost when we lost the very talented Mr. Moschino at only 44 in 1994 and why brand founders really matter.
Speaking of the Next Big Thing
Peter Do is the name to know in New York. The much-feted young designer is unveiling his first collection for Helmut Lang on Day 1 of the official New York Fashion Week schedule, no less. The beloved brand, currently owned by Fast Retailing (a.k.a. the company that started Uniqlo), had been languishing ever since the departure of its founder back in 2005. The name remains redolent with potential and good will, but not so much profit. Mr. Do's job is to make it the epicenter of cool again. No pressure there.
Also under pressure: Victoria's Secret, which will offer a de facto curtain raiser for New York Fashion Week with the premiere of the "Victoria's Secret World Tour" film/happening. It's a complicated reset of ye olde VS show involving four cities around the world, 20 designers, artists and filmmakers and a model cast that is as inclusive as possible. It's the company's first foray back to the runway since 2018. Will it be enough to convince the public that Victoria's Secret really has changed? Will there be wings? These are some of the questions.
Not the Only Thing to Watch
"Watch" being the operative word: Just in time for fashion month come three different documentaries on famous models, all of whom changed the dynamics of the industry and opened the door to the age of the influencer and the influencer-activist.
Two of the flicks are on streamers. First, "Donyale Luna: Supermodel," coming to Max on Sept. 13, tells the story of the first Black model to appear on a Vogue magazine cover. Then, on Sept. 20, "The Super Models," the much-anticipated documentary series that looks back at the careers of Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, has its debut on Apple TV+. Given the furor the models' recent cover of Vogue created, chances are this will be fodder for water cooler conversations everywhere.
Then there's "Invisible Beauty," a feature documentary that has been on the festival circuit and will be released in select theaters on Sept. 15. This is the story of Bethann Hardison, a pioneering Black model (she walked in the so-called "Battle of Versailles") and activist who started her own agency to expand fashion's narrow definition of beauty, then went on the create the Black Girls Coalition and become one of fashion's most celebrated change makers. The doc features the rare fashion figure willing to speak truth to power, even onscreen.
Speaking of Movies, Fashion and Celebrities ...
Hollywood's loss may be fashion's gain. The actors' strike has meant a dearth of red carpet appearances and film premieres, and as celebrities twiddle their thumbs, the brand ambassador gig has suddenly taken on a whole new dimension. There are no rules against commercial work during the strike, and SAG-AFTRA has actually encouraged it. Theoretically, stars are free to show up in front rows at will, and their appearances will not only keep their names and likenesses in the headlines, but help support the ecosystem of stylists, hairdressers and makeup artists generally employed for public appearance and hit hard by the strike.
That means we could be in for a few weeks of glittering frows not seen ... well, ever. Louis Vuitton counts among its contractual "friends of the house" Zendaya, whose film "Challengers" was pulled from the Venice Film Festival because of the strike, and Emma Stone, who skipped the festival even though her movie "Poor Things" was shown, as did one of the film's other stars, Margaret Qualley, a Chanel ambassador.
Dior has Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman and Anya Taylor-Joy. Gucci has Dakota Johnson. And that's before we get to the K-pop supersonics and athletes who have become brand favorites.
In other words, this could really be an all-star season, in more ways than one.

Fashion Only Women Could Create: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This fall, the Metropolitan and three other museums give female designers their due.
It is one of those ironies rarely discussed in the fashion industry -- that a world focused largely on catering to (or exploiting, depending on how you look at it) the dreams and identity of women is run mostly by men.
Men run the biggest luxury groups; men make up the largest percentage of the chief executives; and for years the most celebrated designers who take their bows at the end of the runways of the biggest global brand names were men.
To a certain extent, that dynamic has finally begun to shift: In 2016, Dior named its first female creative director for women's wear, Maria Grazia Chiuri; in 2019, Chanel appointed its first female designer since Coco, Virginie Viard; Hermès has women at the head of its women's and men's lines, Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski and Véronique Nichanian; and Phoebe Philo's return this fall under her own name may be the most anticipated new line of the year.
But LVMH, the largest luxury group in the world and Dior's owner, has only two other female designers at its 14 total fashion brands (plus a partnership with Stella McCartney). Kering, the second largest fashion-focused global luxury group, has but one female designer among its six ready-to-wear brands: Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen. There's still a long way to go.
Which is why the announcement that the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art will devote its fall show to a survey of the work of female designers is so striking. Perhaps even more shocking is the fact that this is the Costume Institute's first such retrospective in the roughly 85 years of its existence.
While the Costume Institute has held a sprinkling of single shows dedicated to the work of women who changed fashion (Coco Chanel, Madame Grès, Rei Kawakubo, Elsa Schiaparelli and Miuccia Prada), it has never before taken a broad look at the female fashion canon -- or, indeed, posited that there is a female fashion canon and that it should be a larger part of the general fashion canon.
Even more notably, when the Met show opens on Dec. 7, it will be the punctuation mark at the end of months of museum shows celebrating women.
The correction starts in September with "Ann Lowe: American Couturier" at Winterthur in Delaware, the largest exhibition yet of the work of the visionary behind Jackie Kennedy's wedding dress and a Black designer who remained unsung for decades.
Next up, in October, is "Mood of the Moment: Gaby Aghion and the House of Chloé" at the Jewish Museum in New York, the first major exhibition devoted to the brand and its founder to be held in the city. That will be followed in November by "Iris van Herpen. Sculpting the Senses" at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. All of which should add up to a potent reminder of the breadth and contributions of women designers -- not to mention a spur for the future.
"It can be complicated to do a show based on identity," said Mellissa Huber, an associate curator at the Met's Costume Institute and the co-curator, with Karen Van Godtsenhoven, of the museum's show "Women Dressing Women." "We don't want to categorize all female designers as working the same or being the same. Perhaps that's one thing that deterred people in the past. But this exhibit really is intended to be about celebration and acknowledgment."
As it happens, Ms. Huber and Ms. Van Godtsenhoven had proposed similar female-focused retrospective shows to Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's curator in charge, around the same time in 2019, the year before the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage. They decided to team up, but the Covid-19 pandemic intervened, postponing the show to this year.
The result showcases the work of about 70 designers held in the Costume Institute's collection, which stretches from the turn of the 20th century to today and includes names both famous (Jeanne Lanvin, Claire McCardell) and little known (Augusta Bernard, Madeleine & Madeleine). And it is a reminder that once upon a time, the industry looked very different.
"The '20s and '30s were a period when women designers were incredibly active and prolific, and it's the one moment in history when women actually slightly outnumbered men in leading the creative direction of fashion," Ms. Huber said. "But that moment never really, truly occurred again."
As to why the shift, Ms. Huber said it had to do with "gender and social change and a lack of confidence on the part of the financial community to invest in women" after World War II. "When we had the New Look in '47 with Dior, there was a major tidal change," she continued. "We've never entirely recovered."
To illustrate how we got here, the Costume Institute show traces the work of female designers from their anonymous beginnings, when, Ms. Huber said, "many women were working in a field that didn't recognize the contributions of individual makers" through the hegemony of the French couture houses, when Chanel, Schiaparelli, Vionnet and Grès dominated.
Then it moves on to what Ms. Huber calls "the boutique generation" of the 1960s -- designers like Mary Quant and Bonnie Cashin, who cleared their own path -- culminating in pieces by designers working today and "thinking collaboratively, considering notions of sustainability and inclusivity."
Along the way the exhibition rights a few historical wrongs, such as the often mistaken attribution of the famous Fortuny Delphos gown solely to the Fortuny founder, Mariano Fortuny, instead of to his wife, Adèle Henriette Negrin Fortuny.
"The Delphos dress is a great example of something that is very canonized, very familiar, even to nonspecialists," Ms. Huber said. But the pleating patent that had been filed for the gown includes a handwritten note from Mr. Fortuny noting "that Henriette Negrin Fortuny was actually the rightful inventor and that essentially he filed it under his name for expediency," Ms. Huber said.
"To realize that there was actually another person behind the dress who had been removed from the historical record for so long was astonishing," Ms. Huber added.
The show also enabled the curators to add the work of at least a dozen new names to the museum's holdings, including Marine Serre, Anifa Mvuemba of Hanifa and Hillary Taymour of Collina Strada, thus carving out a permanent space for them in the historical record and ensuring, Ms. Huber said, that this is simply the start of "a much longer ongoing conversation."
"I think it's a very exciting moment for women designers," she added. What really matters is what happens next, now that "this critical mass of voices is suddenly coming together."

Full text: In 2021, Cédrine Scheidig had just graduated with a master's degree from the National School of Photography in Arles, France, and won the Dior Photography Award for Young Talents. She should have been riding on a high. Instead, she felt hemmed in. Scheidig, who is French Caribbean, felt that the Eurocentric education she'd received in France was preventing her from bringing her full self to her art.
Two South African photographers, Santu Mofokeng and Jodi Bieber, helped shift her perspective. In their work, she said, "I was able to find references to what I want to do."
Scheidig was inspired to explore her own identity, in particular her Blackness, through her work, which brought her to Martinique. Seldom represented in the international media, Martinique is both a Caribbean island and a territory of France. While taking the photographs for this story, Scheidig dived deep into the culture of the island, exploring how urban and spiritual life intersect and what Blackness means to these young men.
Her camera enables her to do this work. "Photography is a tool that I like because it allows me to be in a space, engage with people and stories, with which I would not necessarily have any affinities or common ground," she said. STEVEN MOITY

Full text: In revisiting early modern European history, artists and designers are finding old ways to address contemporary anxieties.
The Algerian Brazilian director Karim Aïnouz's new film, "Firebrand," which debuted at Cannes in May, takes place at a vast country estate where members of the British elite have retreated to avoid a rapidly spreading plague. Inequality has reached new heights, the role of religion in public life is a matter of urgent debate, political factionalism is tearing society apart and Europe is destabilized by war. The year: 1546. Based on the English writer Elizabeth Fremantle's 2012 novel, "Queen's Gambit," the film depicts the last months of Henry VIII's reign from the vantage of his sixth and final wife, Katherine Parr, portrayed by Alicia Vikander. Playing fast and loose with the historical record, it's an allegory for our own era in the guise of a period drama.

Full text: For a brief moment, after Celine canceled its men's wear show in Paris because of the recent unrest in France, there were concerns about whether last week's couture shows would go as planned. But by the time guests started to arrive at Alaïa, one of the first events of couture week, dutifully carrying the custom chairs that the brand had sent them to sit on, it had become clear: The shows would go on.
At Schiaparelli, gold adornments and the house's signature Surrealist details were on full display. Thom Browne, for his debut couture show, turned an opera house into a wonderland full of fantastical suiting. Valentino showed ethereal gowns against the backdrop of the Château de Chantilly, a palatial property outside Paris and one of the most extraordinary venues I've ever photographed. Cardi B, who sat in several front rows, was seemingly the must-have celebrity guest of the season.
In the crowds outside the shows, there was noticeably less peacocking. Some people retired bright palettes for more subdued monochromatic looks. Others traded boxy clothes, which have dominated the style of guests and fans in recent years, for pieces with softer, more fluid silhouettes.

Full text: In Paris, the extraordinary came down to earth. Relatively speaking.
The couture shows began in Paris in the shadow of national unrest over the police killing of a teenager of Algerian and Moroccan descent, with its charges of racism and discrimination.
For a while, there was a question about whether the shows would -- or should -- take place, given their symbolic ties to privilege and insularity. Hedi Slimane canceled his Celine men's wear show, scheduled for the night before the couture was to begin. Bulgari canceled a cocktail party.
The rest stood fast, monitoring the situation and noting, when asked, that there were few industries as representative, globally, of France's economic and artistic strength as fashion. And that the couture is a celebration of that craft at the highest level; escapism and beauty that, thanks to social media, is now escapism and beauty for everyone to look at, not simply for the elite few to buy.
But it was jarring to walk past protests in front of one set of historic buildings (the Assemblée Nationale, the Palais de Justice) on the way to see extraordinarily elaborate frocks in another (the Petit Palais, the Musée Rodin).
Perhaps as a result, there was less bidding for social media virality and more restraint. Even at Schiaparelli, where last season's life-size wild kingdom heads-on-dresses broke the internet, the Surrealist clichés were toned down and the imagination turned up.
Daniel Roseberry, the designer, abstracted thoughts of Lucian Freud, Yves Klein and James Whitton into black collars swirling around the shoulders of exacting white coats, wooden accessories piled on bronzed body parts and suits covered in mirrored mosaics. The show was supposed to be Part 2 of a couture "Divine Comedy" trilogy, but rather than suggesting purgatory, the results seemed closer to divine.
Here's what else we saw.
Jeans were a trend
Jeans -- or their very fancy doppelgängers -- were the biggest trend of the week. At Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli opened his magical show at the Chateau de Chantilly with jeans, although not just any jeans: jeans made from silk gazar entirely embroidered in micro beads dyed 80 different shades of indigo to resemble denim.
Later, amid the feast of lush colors, cashmere and taffeta as casually tossed on as a pair of sweats, came a pair of upcycled Levi's from its rare 1966 Big E edition appliquéd in gold, worn with a plunging white shirt and a nubby knit coat in deep sapphire blue shrugged off to the elbows so it slithered behind like a train.
There were more jeans, likewise made from trompe l'oeil beading, in the Jean Paul Gaultier collection guest-designed by Julien Dossena, and lots of jeans in all stages of distress at Balenciaga, which also were not denim but oil-painted canvas that took two and a half months to make.
The idea of luxury faux jeans is not exactly new -- Matthieu Blazy transformed leather into denim for his Bottega Veneta debut a year ago -- but it may represent, more than any ball gown, where all of this is heading: toward clothes as a secret only the wearer would know, because only the wearer knows how much work it took to make something so apparently simple. Something that is impossible to make, except by hand. In the age of A.I., that may be the most precious thing of all.
Gwyneth Paltrow made a guest appearance
Or rather, her words did, courtesy of Viktor & Rolf's 30th anniversary collection, featuring a whistle-stop tour through its past show concepts, all remade in the form of bathing suits. Case in point: the 2008 "No" collection of bas-relief quotes-in-clothes, here represented by Ms. Paltrow's famous last words to her antagonist during her recent ski crash trial: "I wish you well."
And Thom Browne had a theatrical debut
Thom Browne, the American designer who has made his name redefining the gray flannel suit, finally took his mission to the highest level: the couture stage. Or, to be specific, the stage of the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera Ballet.
There, in front of an audience of 2,000 cardboard gentlemen in gray suits (the IRL audience sat in the wings), he told the tale of a man (actually the model Alek Wek) alone at a train station, watching his life go by in 58 iterations of gray and prepster suiting, each one more intricate and referential than the last.
They came in patchworks etched in gold bullion that painted pictures straight from Cape Cod; in stripes and plaids picked out in beads or shimmering micro-paillettes; in Irish knit woven from strips of tulle. At the end, there was a bride in a simple white chiffon shirtdress with a very long train. Double entendre alert!
Mr. Browne can get overly enchanted with his own skills; hence his penchant for putting his models in unwalkable shoes to inch painfully, and tediously, along. His dramas can veer very close to high camp charades.
But there's no denying his achievement in taking a garment once synonymous with anonymity and reinventing it as an expression of individuality. Couture may be the vestigial tail of fashion, but that's a resolutely contemporary idea.
Cardi B was everywhere
To every season there is a celebrity, and this time it was Cardi B, embracing her role as paparazzi catnip with aplomb. She made an entrance at Schiaparelli as a high fashion yeti; modeled two different but equally enormous coats at Balenciaga; stood patiently in the middle of the Fendi catwalk as her stylist tended to her hair; and showed up so late for Gaultier that she didn't even make it to her seat.
So was casual couture
Beyond jeans, "casual couture," as Demna called it backstage after his Balenciaga show, or "couture you don't see," has been a hallmark of the season.
At Chanel, Virginie Viard set her show on a cobblestone bank by the Seine and sent her models out carrying straw baskets of flowers, as though they just happened to pop out to an open air market in their bouclé after raiding their grandmother's closet. As one does (if, maybe, one is French).
At Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri offered a minimalist take on the goddess in every woman, one of her groaningly favorite subjects, though this time with enough alluringly fierce rigor in its expression to evoke armored high priestess rather than new age claptrap. At Gaultier, Mr. Dossena (the creative director of Rabanne, formerly Paco Rabanne) created a bricolage version of a "crowd of characters," the kind you see every day outside the window, out of a mishmash of Gaultier-isms (marinières, cone bras, the spring 1988 "Concierge" show).
And at Fendi, where Kim Jones said he was inspired by Delfina Delettrez Fendi's high jewelry designs for the house, the result was less tiara, more sculptural, down to the asymmetric nude jersey columns and crystal mosaic wraps that slid off the torso with a calculated ease. That's brand synergy for 'ya.
There was a Marvel-ous moment
It wasn't all understatement, all the time. Giorgio Armani played a game of how many red roses can one designer get into a single collection, and Iris van Herpen explored the life aquatic. Or rather, "architectonics," as inspired by Oceanix, the floating city being planned for South Korea.
That meant bionic minidresses, shards of abalone covered in silicon, and iridescent chiffon that floated around the body like soap bubbles, like the wardrobe of a royal court on some far-off moon. Why Marvel hasn't yet hired her as a creative director is a mystery.
And some modern armor
The Balenciaga show began with Danielle Slavik, one of the brand's original house models from the 1960s, wearing a velvet dress Demna had recreated from the archive, and ended with Eliza Douglas, the designer's current muse, as a video-ready Joan of Arc in an armored dress 3-D-printed in galvanized resin, coated in chrome and lined in flocked velvet. Together they traced an arc of history in two looks by way of funnel-shaped silhouettes, overcoats molded to appear frozen mid-gale and dresses made from thousands of loose silk threads.
The obvious connection was "life is a battle," or to Balenciaga's own battles of late last year. (Celebrities, at least, seem to be over the issue: Cardi B, Offset and Michelle Yeoh were in the front row; Isabelle Huppert walked in the show.) Demna said after the show that he believed couture was a sort of "antivirus" for fashion; for the "fake creativity" and "endless marketing and selling and all this blah, blah that has cannibalized, I think, the whole industry." Then he compared couture to the Moderna Covid vaccine, come to save the day.
Is it enough to inoculate everyone against the shift toward fashion-tainment, which increasingly seems inexorable (and for which Demna bears some responsibility)? Doubtful. Some of the Balenciaga content seemed more like a placebo. But when it works, it's a gesture of faith: in humanity, imagination, the singular power of transformation.

Looming Strike Spurs Supply Chain Woes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Businesses around the country are facing what could be the latest disruption to how they get their goods to their customers in a timely and affordable fashion.
Kathryn Keeler and her husband, Stuart de Haaff, own an olive oil company in the hills of central California. The couple spend their days harvesting olives, bottling the oil, labeling the glass bottles and shipping them out, relying primarily on UPS to get their product to kitchens throughout the United States.
They are far from alone. UPS handles about a fourth of packages shipped each day in the United States, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index, many of them for small businesses like Ms. Keeler's company, Rancho Azul y Oro.
But with the labor contract between UPS and 325,000 of its workers expiring at the end of the month and a potential strike looming, business owners around the country are facing what could be the latest in a series of supply chain disruptions they have confronted since the start of the pandemic.
Some are pre-emptively turning to FedEx, the next largest private carrier in the United States, or the Postal Service. Others are calling their third-party shippers -- firms that work with the likes of UPS, FedEx and DHL to handle their clients' shipping needs -- to ensure that their packages can still get to their final destinations even if there is a strike.
The logistical challenge is just one more burden on businesses that have been stretched thin over the past few years.
"Maybe a larger business can withstand those types of situations," Ms. Keeler said. But as small-business owners, she and her husband "don't have a lot of extra time in our day to be on the phone with the post office or FedEx."
Since 2020, the pandemic has strained the global supply chain in a number of ways. E-commerce reached record levels as stuck-at-home Americans bought clothes, furniture, workout equipment and groceries online. Companies had to navigate Covid-related shutdowns at factories in China and Vietnam. There were worldwide delays when a large container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, leading to containers piling up at the Port of Los Angeles. Those situations affected the way goods came into the United States.
A UPS strike could hobble the way brands move their wares domestically.
"This is something that affects us on our home turf, and how do we solve for that?" said Ron Robinson, the chief executive of BeautyStat Cosmetics, which uses UPS to ship its skin care products to retailers like Ulta and Macy's.
One strategy that his team will lean on is trying to bundle packages, sending as many as it can out at once, he said.
Switching to another carrier is going to cost some companies.
Ryan Culver, the chief executive of Platterful, a monthly charcuterie board subscription service, also uses UPS. Switching over to FedEx Express -- necessary to ensure that the meats in his packages reach consumers in time -- would cost about $ 5 to $ 10 more per delivery.
Teri Johnson, the founder of Harlem Candle Company, received an email on June 26 from her third-party shipper about a potential UPS strike. It suggested she switch to FedEx. That will cost her about $ 2 extra for each candle shipped in the greater New York area. Sending her candles to California will cost even more.
"We don't really have a choice right now," Ms. Johnson said.
FedEx said it was accepting additional volume for a limited time and would assess how much capacity its network could accommodate. "Shippers who are considering shifting volume to FedEx, or are currently in discussions with the company to open a new account, are encouraged to begin shipping with FedEx now," the company said in a post on its website on Thursday.
The Postal Service said in an emailed statement that it "has a strong network, and we have the capacity to deliver what is tendered to us."
Larger companies are relying on sophisticated backup plans that have been tested over the past few years. The pandemic and previous tariff trade wars pushed many major retailers with global supply chains to diversify the countries where their vendors are and the parcel carriers they use.
"We've been focused on investing in a lot of transportation solutions that allow us to more nimbly move freight between carriers," said Alexis DePree, the chief supply chain officer at Nordstrom. "We can do that with a lot more flexibility and speed than we were able to in the past."
Some third-party carriers are seeing a boost in their businesses as the possibility of a UPS strike comes into focus for their clients. Stord, a third-party logistics and technology provider based in Atlanta whose clients include apparel makers and consumer-package companies, has been sending emails out telling its clients not to worry. Stord uses a cloud-based platform to offer services like warehousing and fulfillment and handles tens of thousands of their packages a day.
By combining the volume of its broad portfolio of client brands and using software to make decisions, Stord has the leverage to better negotiate prices with the large parcel carriers, said Sean Henry, the company's chief executive.
"We've been negotiating with FedEx and U.S.P.S. about rates around UPS so our customers don't have to do that," he said.
Stord said more of its clients had asked it to negotiate with carriers on their behalf. He said that equated to "tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue" for his business.
Still, some business owners are not letting the possibility of a UPS strike stress them out just yet.
Bill McHenry, president of Widgeteer, which sells cookware to large retailers, said he felt "kind of numb" after navigating the pandemic-related challenges. "I've seen a lot of stuff and the stories that I've heard and things we've had to go through and survive -- not just the pricing but the upheaval of thinking you have a container but don't," he said.
He said the potential rail strike last December had been a bigger concern for him.
In the meantime, the possibility that a deal could be reached between UPS and the union that represents its workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, remains. The union announced on Wednesday that negotiations had broken down, after previously saying the sides had reached a tentative agreement. If an agreement is not reached, a strike could happen as early as Aug. 1.
If that occurs, "we would be collateral damage," Ms. Keeler said.

PARIS — The couture shows began in Paris in the shadow of national unrest over the police killing of a teenager of Algerian and Moroccan descent, with its accusations of racism and discrimination.
For a while, there was a question about whether the shows would — or should — take place, given their symbolic ties to privilege and insularity. Hedi Slimane canceled his Celine menswear show, scheduled for the night before the couture was to begin. Bulgari canceled a cocktail party.
The rest stood fast, monitoring the situation and noting, when asked, that there were few industries as representative, globally, of France’s economic and artistic strength as fashion. And that the couture is a celebration of that craft at the highest level — escapism and beauty that, thanks to social media, is now escapism and beauty for everyone to look at, not simply for the elite few to buy.
But it was jarring to walk past protests in front of one set of historic buildings (the Assemblée Nationale, the Palais de Justice) on the way to see extraordinarily elaborate frocks in another (the Petit Palais, the Musée Rodin).
Perhaps as a result, there was less bidding for social media virality and more restraint. Even at Schiaparelli, where last season’s life-size wild kingdom heads-on-dresses broke the internet, the surrealist cliches were toned down and the imagination turned up.
Designer Daniel Roseberry abstracted thoughts of Lucian Freud, Yves Klein and James Whitton into black collars swirling around the shoulders of exacting white coats, wooden accessories piled on bronzed body parts and suits covered in mirrored mosaics. The show was supposed to be Part Two of a couture “Divine Comedy” trilogy, but rather than suggesting purgatory, the results seemed closer to divine.
Here’s what else we saw.
Jeans Were a Trend
Jeans, or their very fancy doppelgangers, were the biggest trend of the week. At Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli opened his magical show at the Chateau de Chantilly with jeans, but not just any jeans: jeans made from silk gazar entirely embroidered in micro beads dyed 80 shades of indigo to resemble denim.
Later, amid the feast of lush colors, cashmere and taffeta as casually tossed on as a pair of sweats came a pair of upcycled Levi’s from its rare 1966 Big E edition appliqued in gold, worn with a plunging white shirt and a nubby knit coat in deep sapphire-blue shrugged off to the elbows so it slithered behind like a train.
There were more jeans, likewise made from trompe l’oeil beading, in the Jean Paul Gaultier collection guest-designed by Julien Dossena, and lots of jeans in all stages of distress at Balenciaga, which also were not denim but oil-painted canvas that took 2 1/2 months to make.
The idea of luxury faux jeans is not exactly new — Matthieu Blazy transformed leather into denim for his Bottega Veneta debut a year ago — but it may represent where all of this is heading: toward clothes as a secret only the wearer would know, because only the wearer knows how much work it took to make something so apparently simple, something that is impossible to make, except by hand. In the age of artificial intelligence, that may be the most precious thing of all.
Gwyneth Paltrow Appears
Rather, Paltrow’s words did, courtesy of Viktor & Rolf’s 30th anniversary collection, featuring a whistle-stop tour through its past show concepts, all remade in the form of bathing suits. Case in point: the 2008 “No” collection of bas-relief quotes-in-clothes, here represented by Paltrow’s famous last words to her antagonist during her recent ski crash trial: “I wish you well.”
Thom Browne Had a Theatrical Debut
Browne, an American designer who has made his name redefining the gray-flannel suit, finally took his mission to the highest level: the couture stage. Or, to be specific, the stage of the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera Ballet.
There, in front of an audience of 2,000 cardboard gentlemen in gray suits (the real audience sat in the wings), he told the tale of a man (represented by model Alek Wek) alone at a train station, watching his life go by in 58 iterations of gray and prepster suiting, each one more intricate and referential than the last.
They came in patchworks etched in gold bullion that painted pictures straight from Cape Cod, in stripes and plaids picked out in beads or shimmering micropaillettes and in Irish knit woven from strips of tulle. At the end, there was a bride in a simple white chiffon shirtdress with a very long train. Double entendre alert!

But there’s no denying his achievement in taking a garment once synonymous with anonymity and reinventing it as an expression of individuality. Couture may be the vestigial tail of fashion, but that’s a resolutely contemporary idea.
Cardi B Was Everywhere
To every season there is a celebrity, and this time, it was Cardi B, embracing her role as paparazzi catnip with aplomb. She made an entrance at Schiaparelli as a high fashion yeti; modeled two different but equally enormous coats at Balenciaga; stood patiently in the middle of the Fendi catwalk as her stylist tended to her hair; and showed up so late for Gaultier that she didn’t even make it to her seat.
So Was ‘Casual Couture’
Beyond jeans, “casual couture,” as Demna called it backstage after his Balenciaga show, or “couture you don’t see,” has been a hallmark of the season.
At Chanel, Virginie Viard set her show on a cobblestone bank by the Seine and sent her models out carrying straw baskets of flowers, as if they just happened to pop out to an open air market in their boucle after raiding their grandmother’s closet. As one does (if, maybe, one is French).
At Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri offered a minimalist take on the goddess in every woman, one of her groaningly favorite subjects, though this time with enough alluringly fierce rigor in its expression to evoke armored high priestess rather than new age claptrap.

Some Modern Armor
The Balenciaga show began with Danielle Slavik, one of the brand’s original house models from the 1960s, wearing a velvet dress Demna had re-created from the archive, and ended with Eliza Douglas, the designer’s current muse, as a video-ready Joan of Arc in an armored dress 3D-printed in galvanized resin, coated in chrome and lined in flocked velvet. Together, they traced an arc of history in two looks by way of funnel-shaped silhouettes, overcoats molded to appear frozen mid-gale and dresses made from thousands of loose silk threads.

David Gilmour, 91, an Entrepreneur Who Put Fiji Water in Square Bottles: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An entrepreneur for more than 50 years, he built a luxurious club in Fiji and started a bottled water company, now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States.
David Gilmour, a Canadian-born entrepreneur who in the 1990s built a luxury resort on Wakaya, a tiny island he owned in Fiji, and then created Fiji Natural Artesian Water, turning a local resource into a leading bottled brand, died on June 11 in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said David Roth, a friend and business partner.
By the time he bought Wakaya from two business partners in 1987, Mr. Gilmour had built several businesses over 30 years. He imported Scandinavian home furnishings and built high-end stereos. He helped assemble a chain of hotels in the South Pacific, which made him familiar with the archipelago nation of Fiji, and he co-founded a gold-mining company.
But there was something different about Wakaya. At the time, he was mourning the death of his only child, Erin Gilmour, who had been murdered in her apartment in Toronto in 1983.
He called the island "the last bastion of sanity in the world," his wife, Jillian (Sweeney) Gilmour, said in a phone interview. "He thought when everything went kerflooey, this is where he would go.
"The island itself is so beautiful," she continued. "There's an area called Chieftain's Leap, with soaring cliffs, where peregrine falcons make their nests."
In 1990, Mr. Gilmour opened the Wakaya Club & Spa, a cluster of eight free-standing suites on a former coconut plantation. At the time, he said, he opened it as "really just a place where my friends, those I can't put up in my own home, can come and share the peace." He added: "I don't see it as terribly commercial, frankly. It will probably only break even."
It nonetheless became popular with celebrities, including Tom Cruise, Bill and Melinda Gates (who spent part of their honeymoon there) and Keith Richards, who fell out of a palm tree there in 2006 and was flown to a hospital in New Zealand with a head injury.
One day in the 1990s, Mr. Gilmour saw guests at the property drinking Evian water.
"He said, 'There's something wrong with this picture,' and I said, "What do you mean?"' Ms. Gilmour said. "And he said, 'We're on our own island, and they're drinking water from Lake Geneva. I know that with Fiji's rainfall, there must be a greater water source."'
Mr. Gilmour learned of an underground aquifer beneath the volcanic highlands of the Fijian island of Viti Levu, with water rich in the mineral silica. In 1996, his company began packaging and shipping its distinctive square bottles around the world.
Mr. Gilmour said the water's purity was the result of Fiji's geographic remoteness. "There's no acid rain, no industrial pollution, no pesticides," he told The Palm Beach Post of Florida in 1998. "It's the purest virgin ecosystem."
Fiji is now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States (after San Pellegrino), according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation.
David Harrison Gilmour was born on Nov. 5, 1931, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in Toronto. His father, Adam Gilmour, was an investment banker, and his mother, Doris Godson Gilmour, was an opera singer.
Mr. Gilmour studied business management for a year at the University of Toronto. He then accepted his father's offer of a $ 10-a-day stipend to travel through Europe, which he did for a while before returning to Canada.
"I learned what people are really like," he told Palm Beach Illustrated in 2015. "I learned to touch only what I totally believe in 100 percent. And I learned how to take care of myself."
He turned down his father's offer to join his bank and instead moved to Montreal, where he sold pots and pans door to door for a year.
His first business was importing modern, streamlined Scandinavian housewares and furnishings. He followed that in 1958 with the start-up Clairtone Sound, a collaboration with Peter Munk, a Hungarian-born electrical engineer. The company made critically acclaimed, sophisticated hi-fi systems whose buyers included Frank Sinatra and Hugh Hefner. But it foundered after branching into televisions and shifting operations, disastrously, to Nova Scotia.
Amid steep losses, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were forced out of the company in 1968 and later settled a lawsuit claiming that they sold shares before the announcement of poor quarterly results in 1967.
They recovered quickly and in 1969 started Southern Pacific Properties, which accumulated more than 50 hotels in Australia and New Zealand as well as in Fiji, New Caledonia, Tahiti and other islands. An ambitious development that was to be built near the pyramids in Giza, Egypt, was eventually nixed by President Anwar Sadat in 1978.
Three years later, Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a Singaporean banker, purchased Southern Pacific for a reported $ 130 million. But Wakaya remained separately owned by Mr. Gilmour and his partners, until Mr. Gilmour bought them out.
In the early 1980s, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were among the original partners in Barrick Gold, one of the world's largest gold producers. Mr. Munk was its longtime chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Gilmour was a board member until 2001. Mr. Munk died in 2018.
Mr. Gilmour described his working relationship with Mr. Munk in 2008 with The Globe and Mail of Toronto. "I am more the entrepreneurial type who likes challenges of starting up, and Peter loves growing a colossus," he said. "Once it reaches a critical mass, I kind of get bored sitting around a boardroom table."
Fiji Water, marketed as a luxury brand, was a major commercial success. But, like other brands, it drew scorn from environmentalists, who criticized the industry for the amount of energy it consumed and the greenhouse gases created in making and shipping plastic bottles, and for the plastic waste they leave behind. Fiji, in particular, was singled out for shipping water to consumers thousands of miles away.
Mr. Gilmour sold Fiji Water to Roll International in 2004, and Wakaya to Clare Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram's liquor fortune, in 2016, after a Category 5 cyclone devastated the island. "We sold it for 10 cents on the dollar," Ms. Gilmour said. In 2020, Ms. Bronfman was sentenced to prison for her role in enabling the Nxivm sex cult.
Mr. Gilmour's wife is his only immediate survivor. His marriages to Anna Wilmot, Erin's mother, and to Diane Williams ended in divorce. He lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
Mr. Gilmour, who sold his Palm Beach estate last year for $ 44.9 million, had one last company in his portfolio at his death: Wakaya Perfection, a wellness company that sells powders and capsules of ginger and turmeric grown in volcanic soil in Fiji and Nicaragua.
"David had this belief that organic, single-source, very pure, high-quality ginger and turmeric would be something that people wanted," Mr. Roth, who started the company with Mr. Gilmour, said by phone. "And Oprah chose it twice as one of her favorite things."

Full text: Paris men's wear caught fire during a week of zillion-dollar spectacles, skinny fits and Jay-Z's surprise appearance at Pharrell Williams's debut for Louis Vuitton.
Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it's King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you're hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.
The week just past was emphatically one of fashion as an S.E.O. experiment, test field for an ever-evolving global ecology, increasingly monocultural, of luxury goods. Yes, there were talented indies. There were great masters from outside the mainstream, most notably Rei Kawakubo. There were some seasoned and celebrated, although not sufficiently recognized, talents like Grace Wales Bonner. There were survivors like Kim Jones at Dior Homme and lots of gifted comers showing men's and women's wear and, well, everything in between.
Take, for example, Marine Serre, who served up her most commercial riff to date on upcycled yarn waste and deadstock, here rendered as armor for warriors of the urban night (as well as molls in trash drag.) Let's hear a round of applause for an evening dress made from a granny afghan. Try rocking that one at the Met Gala, Lil Nas X.
Consider Rick Owens, showing in full doom-mode outdoors on the river-facing plaza of the Palais de Tokyo as if he had not seen a weather report. The predicted thunderstorms never arrived, and yet Mr. Owens showered guests anyway with drifts of gunpowder and wreaths of sulfurous fog from fireworks mounted on scaffolds and blasted into the Parisian sky.
The show was titled "Lido," after Mr. Owens's seaside getaway in Venice, yet it had more than a whiff of Burning Man. An observer would be hard-pressed to find clear connections between the soft littoral landscape of the Venetian lagoon and Mr. Owens's sternly constricting offerings: peaked shoulders like the budding wings of dark angels; high-waisted trousers with long hems trailing like the uncoiled wraps of a mummy's shroud; high-top versions of therapeutic leg braces and Brutalist "concrete sandals" -- perhaps the thing for one terminal dip into the Adriatic.
There were also studies in cool elegance, as at Dries Van Noten. Like the celebrated geyser, this designer can be counted on to deliver, sometimes with bursts from the creative core, occasionally with desultory puffs. This occasion registered as something in between.
That is, he provided uncontroversial gabardine trousers worn under trench coat skirts, twin sets for men, knit velvets, mousseline shirts teasing flashes of nipple and, most notably, sequined shorts. We have seen versions of this before from other designers. Yet such is the fickleness of fashion that suddenly they seemed eminently wearable.
Part of that is the Paris effect. Next to Tokyo among great world capitals, this city has the greatest capacity to frame the outlandish. Against its backdrop the clusters of Rei Kawakubo devotees strolling along the fashion rialto that is the Rue St.-Honoré -- in trousers with hoop-belled hems or deconstructed frock coats or other outlandish garb -- seem like welcome legations from distant galaxies.
Janet Flanner, the brilliant Paris correspondent for The New Yorker, once remarked that Picasso, even as a genius, had more gifts than he could deploy. Possibly the same could be said of Ms. Kawakubo who, like Picasso in his 80s, shows little sign of slackening pace.
"In order to find a new world, we have to go beyond reality," Ms. Kawakubo said in a gnomic note accompanying her Comme des Garçons collections. Of course, you could argue that the opposite is equally the case.
For the current collection, Ms. Kawakubo showed collared black frock coats in which waistbands were the hems of inverted shorts; double layered jackets; upside-down trousers; jungle prints; and Gary Card headbands embedded with what looked like flotsam. Oh, and there were the Oxford shoes right out of Meret Oppenheim. Were the wearers coming or going in properly bench-made, if Surrealist, Oxfords featuring two shoes per foot, either layered or headed in different directions?
Where Ms. Kawakubo is coolly cerebral Mike Amiri wears sincerity on his sleeve. When he took a bow at the end of his show with his family, it was hard to resist enthusiasm for this self-made Californian designer who, showing for several seasons in Paris, has urged his loyal consumers to ride along with him as he follows taste shifts away from streetwear toward soft tailoring, leaving behind the perennially juvenile cult of the sneakerheads.
Officially, Mr. Amiri's inspiration was a chill Los Angeles style. What it more closely resembled -- shirts and long shorts in leather woven like bistro chairs, silly flower embellishments, shorts-and-shirts like cabana sets -- was attire for rich Miamians. If you accept that geography is commercial destiny, next stop on the fashion caravan is South Florida.
In a packed schedule that proved the runway show is in no peril of disappearing, there were some shows that fell flat, like showroom appointments passing themselves off as something else. (Yes, you, Officine Générale.) There were bombastic statements like Kim Jones's anniversary collection at Dior Homme (he has survived there five years, a lifetime in the luxury goods trade), replete with fine boxy tailoring that almost made you imagine his next stop may be Chanel.
And there were moments of pure theater and elevated design. The best of these was produced by Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and staged inside the 18th-century stableyard of the elite Garde Républicaine -- France's version of the Royal Horse Guards.
Mr. Anderson often seems like the rare thought leader in the industry, a designer connected to culture in ways that have little to do with the trashy slipstream of social media. The fountains that were the centerpiece of his show were the work of the American sculptor Lynda Benglis, great bronze extrusions that suggested organic eruptions or frozen waves. They nicely counterbalanced the severity of Mr. Anderson's designs, which included trousers with waists so snug and high they turned the upper torso into a bust, boxy gray sweaters like Colorforms shapes and fully sequined shirt and trouser separates.
They called to mind the glittering '60s, specifically Andy Warhol's foil-covered Silver Factory, which, by coincidence, is being evoked by a show at the Gagosian Gallery on the Place Vendôme. "It was the perfect time to think silver," Warhol later wrote of the period and of his storied studio. Silver was both the future and the past, he noted. Astronauts wore it. Hollywood actresses from the Golden Age were photographed in it. Most important, mirrors are backed with silver. "Silver was narcissism," Warhol said. Can anyone doubt that he was, as usual, prophesying the next Age of Narcissism, that of TikTok and Instagram?
Given that, the commercial logic of Louis Vuitton's new chief executive Pietro Beccari's hiring Pharrell Williams to design its men's wear collection seems as irresistible as a bulldozer.
Let the naysayers cluck about Mr. Williams's design offerings, in some sense lost amid a zillion-dollar spectacle during an evening in which Vuitton colonized central Paris, taking over the storied Pont Neuf; painting it in the pattern of its trademark Damier print; and importing the Voices of Fire gospel choir from Virginia, Mr. Williams's home state, to sing a rousing composition of his titled "Joy (Unspeakable)" that tapped into Black spirituality as a promotion vehicle for unabashed materialism. ("If you want it, you can have it!" they belted out. "If you need it, you can have it!")
In a consolidated luxury goods sphere, where three groups (LVMH, Kering and Richemont) control nearly the entire ecosystem, market capture amounts to the one true religion. Designers are its missionaries, and on Tuesday evening, Mr. Williams seemed exactly like the person to take us all to church on the way to the bank.
The clothes, to the surprise of no one familiar with Mr. Williams's feel good music, were solidly commercial ("Every single thing will sell," as one retailer said.) Much of it was rendered in a pixilated Damouflage pattern that owed a debt to an earlier experiment by Mr. Williams's friend Nigo at Kenzo; lug-soled versions of the mid-calf rain boot Kanye West has been flogging for some time; Damier denim trench coats, suits, biker and varsity jackets; Mary-Jane shoes; and the all important Keepall, Alma, Neverfull and Speedy bags that, let's face it, are what Louis Vuitton shows are really all about.

PARIS — Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it’s King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you’re hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.

A Breezy History of Personal Branding: [Review]

Full text: In a breezy new history of personal branding, Tara Isabella Burton comes face to face with Oscar Wilde, Frederick Douglass, Kim Kardashian and more.
SELF-MADE: Creating Our Identities from da Vinci to the Kardashians, by Tara Isabella Burton
The Kardashians have sold so much to America -- shapewear, cosmetics, beverage upon beverage -- why not throw ideas onto the pile?
That highly contoured family pulls up like a caboose at the end of Tara Isabella Burton's "Self-Made," a fast-moving train of a book that visits a series of individuals in western history who have changed in ways major and minor the way people represent and think of themselves.
Burton calls Kim "the apex of the nihilistic, aristocratic tradition" that includes the Regency dandy Beau Brummell, an early practitioner of what's come to be known, in its modern online incarnation, as the "get ready with me," or GRWM, routine. "Admirers thronged" to Brummell's house, she recounts, to see an hourslong grooming process that included "exfoliation with a coarse-hair brush, followed by a bath of milk," and spitting in a special silver bowl. (And you thought Dior's $ 40 lip oil was excessive.)
A novelist with a doctorate in theology from Oxford who has written widely on travel and religion, including for The New York Times, Burton is a confident conductor on this, an express voyage over several centuries, glossing an international lingo of self-determination: "sprezzatura" and "bon ton" and "Übermensch."
Her argument is that in an increasingly secularized society -- what's recently been termed "dechurching" -- human beings have assumed godlike power and responsibility, at least over their own bodies and identities. "We are creators of ourselves, of our lives, of the world around us," she observes. "We take on the divine role of constructing and shaping reality." Just look at us floating around in the heaven and hell of cyberspace: feeling omniscient with our powerful search engines, gathering "followers."
"Self-Made" begins not with Leonardo da Vinci, as advertised in the book's subtitle, but the somewhat more obscure German artist Albrecht Dürer, a pioneer in the field of self-portraiture who rendered himself in the image of Jesus Christ and splashed his initials, which felicitously echoed "Anno Domini," wherever he could. The reader can immediately see a throughline to Kim Kardashian, author of "Selfish"; her ex-husband Kanye West, with his declaration "I Am a God" on the album "Yeezus"; and their variously monogrammed product lines, but there will be a number of other stops before getting there.
One is chez Oscar Wilde, an early influencer who, Burton reminds us, started a rage for wearing carnations dyed green, possibly to drum up publicity for his play "Lady Windermere's Fan," but perhaps for no reason at all. Here was someone who "held that artistic creation, rather than grubby moneymaking, was the key to human superiority," she writes, "and that artistic creation of oneself was the highest calling of all."
Another briefly noted trailblazer, on the other side of the Atlantic, is Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist born enslaved who spoke in the National Market Hall of Philadelphia about the "self-made man" and his special commitment to "Work! WORK!! WORK!!! WORK!!!!" (An incantation these days rarely uttered without arch inflection.)
In Burton's telling, individual identity, ever trying to define itself against the crowd, has moved forward in sometimes awkward lock step with technology. Thomas Edison gave the press glimpses of his light bulb before it was ready for prime time ("He may have harnessed electricity, but he had also harnessed another invisible power: celebrity.") Television and tape recordings transformed Warhol-era personal presentation.
And only a few decades later, here we are all nonchalantly carrying around smartphones in front of our faces. If TV's arrival in living rooms was "thrilling" but "destabilizing," as Burton notes, iPhones have thrown us completely off balance, like new limbs.
Reading "Self-Made" can feel a little like wandering through a favorite museum with a new docent speaking into your padded headset: lots of "hmm!" moments but few surprises. Women don't really show up, except as robots, until the rise of the "It Girl" in Hollywood, a subject thoroughly explicated last year in a biography of her creator, Elinor Glyn. Another of Burton's chosen figures, the maverick Whole Earth catalog editor Stewart Brand, he of the oft-memed mission statement "we are as gods and might as well get good at it," has also just been the subject of a big biography.
But one can feel, and share, her delight poking into some of the past's more cobwebbed corners. The futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti once put glue on a theater audience's seats? Prime Minister William Pitt (The Younger) imposed a tax on hair powder in London? I could have read tens of pages more on the Extropians, one of whom suggested at a 1994 conference that it would eventually be possible "to upload their entire consciousness to a computer."
Burton packs a lot of material into a small space to support an ambitious idea, and it would be interesting to see what she would do with more focus. "Self-Made" seems designed for a distracted generation: more of a tour than a tour de force.

Full text: Tailoring, bling and Louis Vuitton, oh my.
The fact that the N.B.A. draft occurred smack in the middle of the Paris men's wear shows was something of a cosmically appropriate coincidence.
After all, the draft has increasingly become one of our most watched runways, the heart of the convergence between fashion and sport that has spawned the tunnel walk and social media accounts that chronicle players' wardrobes -- and leads to front row seats at shows like Louis Vuitton, recently attended by LeBron James, and Rick Owens, where Kyle Kuzma showed up. And it is only getting more important.
ESPN has added a one-hour "N.B.A. Draft Red Carpet Special" just as E! does for the Oscars and the Met Gala, including a 360 degree cam kind of like the E! Glambot, the better to capture the looks in the round, as well as a reporter asking the attendees, "What are you wearing?"
Yes, the question isn't just for women any more.
Perhaps because most of the athletes aren't used to answering, they didn't respond with a "what" -- they didn't name their brand -- but a "why." Why they chose the look they chose. Which in turn reflects why this all matters.
As Mitchell Jackson, the author of the forthcoming "Fly: The Big Book of Basketball Fashion," a coffee-table book that elevates the subject to the same decorative status as a Dior or Gucci monograph, said: "N.B.A. draft fashion is its own subject now, not an afterthought but part of the big show. It was always something the players cared about, but with more media coverage of the draft, with the advent of social media and the tunnel, it's an important part, dare I say essential part, of player's star power."
It's the players' first chance to create the brand of them and offer it up for public consumption. As a result, everything is tailored. Not just literally, but conceptually.
Starting with Victor Wembanyama, the No. 1 overall pick and widely touted "generational talent" from France, who wore a forest green suit from Louis Vuitton with a kimono-like jacket that wrapped at the waist and a matching forest green shirt, a large stone dangling from his neck. Vuitton is, of course, the world's dominant luxury brand, one synonymous with French savoir-faire and one that recently hired a Black American -- Pharrell Williams -- as its men's wear designer, all values (inclusivity, cross-border diplomacy, success) that line up with what Mr. Wembanyama promises to represent.
As for the color, he said he liked it because it made him think of outer space (he's reaching for the stars), while the stone around his neck, less blingy than some of the other ice sported by his soon-to-be competitors, was an element said to help achieve goals.
His only competition in the high-fashion stakes came from Kobe Bufkin (picked 15th, by the Atlanta Hawks), in a cream tweed double-breasted suit sans shirt, a choice that revealed a highly tuned trend antenna. It implicitly associated him with other celebrity proponents of the suit-without-shirt look, like Timothée Chalamet (who popularized the trend when he went shirtless to the 2022 Oscars). Little wonder LeagueFits announced that "Atlanta will be competing for a leaguefits championship, confirmed."
Notably restrained was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 pick, in a three-piece plaid number, and Amen and Ausar Thompson, identical twins chosen fourth and fifth, who wore matching double-breasted suits by the tailor Waraire Boswell. One was white, and one was navy. "They went for subtlety," Mr. Jackson said, a sign of just how much draft fashion has shifted from the straightforward "look at me" to "think about me" or "invest in me."
Pointedly, the looks were part of a collaboration with Amex, and Mr. Boswell also designed a limited-edition jacket inspired by the Thompson suits that will be available only to Amex cardholders. Why not start the influencing as soon as possible?
On the other end of the spectrum were Scoot Henderson (picked third) and Gradey Dick (picked 13th), who were the most bedazzled athletes of the night. Even then, though, their bling wasn't just bling for bling's sake. It was bling with reason.
Mr. Henderson's suit, by Indochino (a label that has something of a lock on draft-day dressing, this year working with nine athletes), was covered in more than 600 gemstones meant to represent his family tree, incorporating the birthstones of his parents and siblings.
"I wanted to be very thoughtful about how my draft-day look represents both my journey so far and what's next," Mr. Henderson, who also wore a customized bedazzled grill, said in a news release. "This suit is a visual representation of what got me here."
This is the next iteration of the personal-story-in-a-lining approach that has become familiar among many players, who paper the inside of their jackets with photographs and memorabilia printed onto silk. See, for example, Taylor Hendricks (picked ninth), whose sugar-pink suit concealed a whole biography.
As for Mr. Dick, he wore a turtleneck and zoot suit jacket, both covered in red sequins. The look got him compared to Zoolander and Siegfried and Roy on social media but was a nod, he said, to Dorothy's ruby slippers and his own journey from Kansas to the presumably magical world of the Toronto Raptors (a team whose color also happens to be red). Not to mention the suggestion that he has courage and heart, too.
As a choice, the sequins were mocked and praised in equal measure, but either way they were impossible to ignore. In the attention economy, that's a win.

The Couple's Wedding Outfits? Definitely Not Dior.: [Society Desk]

Full text: A shared passion for acrobatics, costumes and bicycles led Ryan Murray and Juanita Cardenas to a wedding ceremony held in midair.
For circus performers, it takes a lot to stand out at a festival. But when Ryan Shinji Murray heard about how Juanita Cardenas arrived at the Montreal Complètement Cirque festival in 2015, he was intrigued.
"I heard that a couple people had ridden their bikes from Brooklyn to Montreal and I thought, I need to hang out with these people," recalled Mr. Murray, 35, a performer who had been touring then as an acrobat with Cirque du Soleil.
Mr. Murray, who is to perform in Cirque du Soleil's "Festa," next month in Andorra, had dropped out of New York University in 2007 to pursue gymnastics and acrobatics, ultimately landing at the global circus company.
Juanita Cardenas, 38, a multidisciplinary artist and performer from Bogotá, Colombia, was among the crew that had biked to the circus festival from New York. Mx. Cardenas, who uses a gender-neutral courtesy title and she/her pronouns, graduated from the Cooper Union in 2008 with a degree in art, and then studied circus arts in Buenos Aires.
While living in New York, she had previously crossed paths with Mr. Murray while performing at venues like the Muse and House of Yes -- but the two knew each other only casually.
However, something clicked when they connected in Montreal. One night, after eating the famous poutine at La Banquise, Mr. Murray unexpectedly kissed Mx. Cardenas.
"It was a nice surprise," she said. "Because in regular life, he's a very shy and polite, sweet being." They enjoyed several more passionate days together in Montreal, but neither expected their romance to lead anywhere.
"I didn't think he wanted a girlfriend on tour," Mx. Cardenas said. "That's not fun."
Since Mr. Murray's touring duties as an acrobat in Cirque du Soleil took him around the globe, the two gradually fell out of touch. Then, just before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, their touring schedules overlapped in Australia.
Mx. Cardenas was in a relationship with someone else at the time, but she and Mr. Murray were still thrilled to reconnect. "It was special but not flirty," she recalled.
Eventually, Mr. Murray, who grew up in Silver Spring, Md., returned to his home in the Washington metropolitan area, and Mx. Cardenas returned to Brooklyn. But the two kept in close contact in the months that followed.
"We supported each other a lot during some dark and scary times," he said, referring to both the Covid lockdown and Mx. Cardenas's breakup with her boyfriend.

After a year of intense long-distance communication and the rollout of the Covid vaccines, Mx. Cardenas convinced Mr. Murray to visit her in Brooklyn. In May 2021, he rode his bicycle for 19 hours straight from Washington to Mx. Cardenas's apartment in Bed-Stuy, where he took a shower and immediately fell asleep.
"Then, we woke up together, and it was wonderful," Mx. Cardenas said.
Mr. Murray agreed. "After a year and a half of not touching another person -- who was not family -- it was pretty crazy," he said.
There was no formal proposal, but a mutual decision to marry that followed many long and deep conversations about their future together.
The two were married on June 4 in an afternoon ceremony at the Slipper Room, a performing arts theater on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. Their friend James Habacker, a Universal Life Church minister who owns the venue, led the ceremony. When the couple first told Mr. Habacker that they wanted to rent his club, he offered his officiant duties as a bonus.
Around 100 guests attended the ceremony, including burlesque stars from New York like Julie Atlas Muz, Mat Fraser, Dirty Martini and Bambi the Mermaid.
The Slipper Room routinely hosts whimsical and bold burlesque and circus performances. So, Mx. Cardenas's and Mr. Murray's theatrical wedding was a natural fit. "We built it like a show that you would see at the Slipper Room -- but with us as the featured acts," Mr. Murray said.
The ceremony began with Mr. Murray building a stack of chairs, while singing "Love on Top" by Beyoncé. The next act, performed by the couple, featured costumes designed by Mx. Cardenas. She wore a floral dress, and he was outfitted to look like a rotisserie chicken. "It was about nourishment and lust," Mx. Cardenas explained.
After the couple recited their vows in matching costumes shaped like giant hands (also made by the bride), they were hoisted into the air via an aerial hoop to exchange their rings.
"That was the one thing we didn't do a dress rehearsal for," said Mr. Murray, adding that their hand costumes weren't ready in time for a run-through. Luckily, the guest list included many aerialists and acrobats who helped them get safely situated.
For their final act, the couple donned custom handmade Western-style outfits, and Mr. Murray performed lasso tricks that ended with the two of them tied in a knot. Shortly after, the wedding party and guests had to clear out to accommodate another show. An impromptu after-party at Arlene's Grocery, a live music venue, went late into the night.
Amid the theatrics, the couple had forgotten to order a marriage license. So Mr. Habacker ended up signing the marriage license the following Wednesday, on June 7, between previews of the couple's latest collaboration, "Day of the Dead Live!" which will open Oct. 19 at Brooklyn Art Haus. The show's pianist, Llewellyn Sanchez-Werner, served as the witness.
The couple spent their wedding night at the Sixty LES Hotel in New York, and they are now planning a honeymoon traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Genoa, Italy. Naturally, they will be riding their bicycles.

So Many Ways to Tell His Stories: [Style Desk]

Full text: About two months ago, Eli Russell Linnetz moved into a house built in the mid-1980s by the actor Dennis Hopper. Mr. Linnetz had spent the last few years as a kind of Venice Beach Goldilocks, moving until he found a studio that felt just right.
For the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate -- we'll start with fashion designer, for simplicity's sake -- this was what finally felt right: a metal fortress with a roof curved to resemble the crest of a wave. Hard and looming on the outside, airy and exposed on the inside.
On a video call, Mr. Linnetz climbed a floating staircase beneath an impossibly high wood-beamed ceiling, pointing out original features like an angular glass bathtub and "the room where Dennis Hopper died." The scope was too much for our screens. Walking across the property, toward a small white house where he now lives, Mr. Linnetz discovered gardenias blooming in the yard.
One of his earliest renovation decisions was to tear up the studio's floors and install plywood from the time it was built. This choice was characteristically meticulous and nostalgic. Mr. Linnetz tends to fixate on small details in the service of telling a good story.
Before his first-ever runway show in May of last year, in which he introduced a collection made in collaboration with Dior, he explained: "I want the zipper, the buttons, the beads, the color to be in perfect harmony. You can have really expensive beautiful glass beads, but if they're not sewn on properly, they don't tell the story you want to tell."
If Mr. Linnetz sounds like one of those filmmakers bent on making sure every prop on their set is authentic and era-accurate, it's because he's also that. A director. And a screenwriter, a photographer, a stage designer and a music producer, who first began dabbling in the fashion industry in 2018. That dabble spiraled into a full-fledged brand, ERL, part of a family of brands supported by Comme des Garçons and its retail arm, Dover Street Market. Last year, ERL was named a winner of the prestigious Karl Lagerfeld Prize for young designers. The line is now carried in more than 220 stores.
For his next act, Mr. Linnetz will take one of fashion's most exclusive stages as guest designer of the Pitti Uomo men's wear fair. The title has been held by many of fashion's greats: Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Dries Van Noten in the 1990s; Virgil Abloh, Telfar Clemens and Grace Wales Bonner in more recent years. His runway show is scheduled for June 15 in Florence, Italy.
Yet Mr. Linnetz, to put it bluntly, would almost rather be working on his screenplay at home in Venice, Calif. "The show is interrupting my filmmaking," he said.
Once, on a visit to New York in 2021, I asked Mr. Linnetz what about fashion was exciting to him, considering his other occupations.
"It's literally not," he said that November. "I don't know how I ended up here."
As a child, he often sketched dresses, he conceded, and later made a prom dress for a friend, then helped pay for his tuition at the University of Southern California by sewing costumes for the opera program. But otherwise, Mr. Linnetz said, "I have almost no connection to fashion, other than it is the medium that's directly in front of me as a way to express the world around me."
That world is surfer chic with Americana influences: vintage-inspired graphic tees, swollen skate shoes, patchwork flared jeans, bright gradated knits, several variations on a hoodie.
"I almost feel like the Manchurian Candidate," he said. "Like someone calls me every morning to say, 'You will design today,' and my brain turns off, and I'm almost hypnotized."
A year and a half later, he still describes fashion the same way, as if it's a compulsion or illness beyond his control: "It's always with you. Can it just go away?"
But he says it with a grin.
Behind the Music
At first, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, the influential creative director, didn't know what to make of Mr. Linnetz, when he asked for a meeting in Paris in 2016.
"You meet people from L.A. who are kind of out of the fashion system" -- and here she acknowledged a slight personal bias -- "and they all seem to do many, many, many different things. And, most of the time, many, many, many different things very badly. They're designers who don't design, they're actors who don't act, they're editors who don't edit."
So when she met the 20-something Mr. Linnetz, who said he had already directed a Kanye West video, produced music and worked for the playwright David Mamet, "I was just like, 'OK, here we go,"' Ms. Newhouse said.
Except, she learned, Mr. Linnetz had done those things, and a bit more, and not badly at all.
He was a child actor in Los Angeles -- with Disney credits including the 2000 animated film "The Emperor's New Groove" -- until his bar mitzvah, when he decided to quit acting to "focus on being Jewish," he said. At his temple, he met Mr. Mamet, who invited him to the set of his TV show "The Unit."
On the day of that visit, there happened to be a costume contest, Mr. Linnetz, then 15, recalled. He made Mr. Mamet a judge's robe from light-blocking fabric and a wig from cotton balls. "He was like, 'That's so odd, but come back tomorrow,"' Mr. Linnetz said.
When he wasn't in school, he was assisting Mr. Mamet, including on Broadway. One of his tasks was printing out emails sent to Mr. Mamet, who would write his replies on a typewriter.
At U.S.C., he majored in screenwriting, minored in opera and joined a fraternity. (He had always been interested in hypermasculine rituals; in high school, he wrestled.) He made a short film during his senior year starring Sawyer Spielberg, set in 1960s El Paso. But after graduation, the filmmaking didn't take off. He turned instead to 3-D animation. A friend who worked with Kanye West (now known as Ye) showed him Mr. Linnetz's art; Mr. Linnetz, who had met Ye a few years earlier, was brought in to work on cover-art concepts for "The Life of Pablo."
The relationship escalated. Among several other things, Mr. Linnetz can claim responsibility as "creative director of fabrication" for the 12 nude celebrity sculptures in Ye's "Famous" video -- the one with Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby and at least two U.S. presidents sleeping together in a colossal bed.
In 2017, when Kim Kardashian returned to Instagram after she was robbed in Paris, her first posts were Polaroids shot by Mr. Linnetz, who encouraged her not to look at the camera: "So much before the robbery was her looking to the camera -- the selfies. I was like, 'Let's do something where people are observing you so you're not asking anything from them, and they can make their own decisions about you."'
Working with the couple made him realize how art and photography could influence culture. But Mr. Linnetz also wanted to break out on his own. Opportunities arose to work with other performers, like Lady Gaga for the visual direction and stage design of her alien-robot-rock opera residency in Las Vegas.
By the time he asked Ms. Newhouse to meet, Mr. Linnetz wasn't pitching a specific project -- he simply wanted to work with her. She took a liking to him.
"He was adorable," Ms. Newhouse said of Mr. Linnetz, who can seem both impish and like an old soul in the span of one conversation. "I just felt he had something."
She asked him to direct an advertisement in 2017 for Comme des Garçons's Andy Warhol fragrance. The next year, he met the brand's president, Adrian Joffe. Just as his creative relationship with Ye grew quickly, so did this one. Mr. Linnetz was "kind of brilliant," with "a rare confidence," Mr. Joffe said in an email.
Almost as a dare -- "baiting him," Mr. Joffe said -- he asked Mr. Linnetz to make something for the opening of Dover Street Market Los Angeles. "He'd never made clothing before," Mr. Joffe said. The resulting pastel corduroy shirts ended up selling out in a week, he said. "He's just good."
Mr. Joffe offered Mr. Linnetz his own label under Dover Street Market Paris's brand development program.
At the time, Mr. Linnetz saw the opportunity as a way to escape the last few harried years of living adjacent to mega fame. (In the much-memed words of Lady Gaga: "no sleep, bus, club, another club, another club.")
"I created ERL to get away from all this music industry celebrity stuff," said Mr. Linnetz, who was looking for "something more meditative."
For ERL, which released its first full collection in 2020, he would shoot all the campaigns himself. He would work almost entirely by himself. He would live quietly; he doesn't drink or do drugs, he said, or enjoy going to parties or even leaving Venice, where he is happily isolated from the fashion world at large, with a newly adopted dog named Einstein.
He sees the irony in this thinking now: "It's weird to go and create something super-personal and then have everyone want to be a part of it."
California Couture
"Have you seen the movie 'Escape From L.A.'?" Mr. Linnetz asked in May of last year. He described a scene from the campy 1996 disaster film in which Kurt Russell and Peter Fonda surf on a tsunami wave while trying to chase down Steve Buscemi in a Cadillac.
The scene was his inspiration for the Dior ERL show set in Venice. The runway emerged from the beach with two large waves on either side, half-enclosing the audience, threatening to wash away all the fashion people.
"It's this moody, blue, grungy menace," Mr. Linnetz said, meant to spiritually complement the clothes, which were alternately electric and metallic in color, with loose silhouettes and shiny, swaggering accents. "It's a weird, twisted, colorful Californication of Dior. A lot of the logos say 'California Couture."'
Kim Jones, the artistic director of Dior Men, invited Mr. Linnetz to co-design the line out of a desire to support young talent. "We have a lot of collections a year," he said -- at least four -- and working with another designer can help "take you out of the bubble that you sometimes get stuck in."
He found Mr. Linnetz's initial approach to Dior's archives novel: The young designer decided to focus on the year 1990, when Gianfranco Ferré, then the artistic director, was leaning into opulence. Mr. Linnetz chose 1990 only because it was the year he was born.
"He reminded me of when I had my label when I was younger," Mr. Jones said. "I saw a lot of how I work in him -- very fast, decisive, clear."
His first solo runway show, for Pitti Uomo, will be more extravagant, Mr. Linnetz said. He will be introducing Eli Russell, a new line of tailoring and evening wear -- sweeping suits in rich textures, baggy and baroque, with even more shiny metallics, to be worn by surfer-models flown in to Florence from Southern California.
"The final result is somewhere between impractical and practical, comfortable and intolerable," Mr. Linnetz said. "This first iteration really feels like dress up. But some of the suits are, like, $ 15,000 to $ 20,000, so it's expensive dress up."
"I put a lot of importance on this one show because I don't know how many I'll ever do," he continued. He had no intention to do another after the Dior collaboration. And he feels torn, now, between thinking "this is kind of silly" -- just wanting to work on the third draft of that screenplay, an "exploration of American male friendship" about two friends starting college in the 1970s -- and perhaps going too big in Italy.
"If you do something bigger, you're suddenly confronted with the ridiculousness of everyone's desperate desire to go viral or have a crazy moment," said the man who once put Kid Cudi in a wedding dress and veil.
At the same time, while modeling a sequined top hat he made for the show, he expressed an intention to create a "barrage that leaves people utterly speechless." Mr. Linnetz can't help but contradict himself -- or maybe it's just that he contains multitudes. Is he the next "big star in the fashion world," as Mr. Jones predicted, or someone who only came to fashion accidentally, whose imagination and ambition to tell stories stretches far beyond the medium of clothing?
"Every 10 minutes, I'm like, 'Why did I do this?"' Mr. Linnetz said of his upcoming show. "Oh well, I guess someone has to do it."

About two months ago, Eli Russell Linnetz moved into a house built in the mid-1980s by actor Dennis Hopper. Linnetz had spent the last few years as a kind of Venice Beach Goldilocks, moving until he found a studio that felt just right.
For the 32-year-old multi-hyphenate — we’ll start with fashion designer, for simplicity’s sake — this was what finally felt right: a metal fortress with a roof curved to resemble the crest of a wave. Hard and looming on the outside, airy and exposed on the inside.
On a video call, Linnetz climbed a floating staircase beneath an impossibly high wood-beamed ceiling, pointing out original features like an angular glass bathtub and “the room where Dennis Hopper died.” The scope was too much for our screens. Walking across the property, toward a small white house where he now lives, Linnetz discovered gardenias blooming in the yard.
One of his earliest renovation decisions was to tear up the studio’s floors and install plywood from the time it was built. This choice was characteristically meticulous and nostalgic. Linnetz tends to fixate on small details in the service of telling a good story.
Before his first runway show in May 2022, in which he introduced a collection made in collaboration with Dior, he explained: “I want the zipper, the buttons, the beads, the color to be in perfect harmony. You can have really expensive beautiful glass beads, but if they’re not sewn on properly, they don’t tell the story you want to tell.”
If Linnetz sounds like one of those filmmakers bent on making sure every prop on their set is authentic and era-accurate, it’s because he’s also that. A director. And a screenwriter, a photographer, a stage designer and a music producer, who first began dabbling in the fashion industry in 2018. That dabble spiraled into a full-fledged brand, ERL, part of a family of brands supported by Comme des Garçons and its retail arm, Dover Street Market. Last year, ERL was named a winner of the prestigious Karl Lagerfeld Prize for young designers. The line is now carried in more than 220 stores.
For his next act, Linnetz will take one of fashion’s most exclusive stages as guest designer of the Pitti Uomo menswear fair. The title has been held by many of fashion’s greats: Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Dries Van Noten in the 1990s; Virgil Abloh, Telfar Clemens and Grace Wales Bonner in more recent years. His runway show is scheduled for Thursday in Florence, Italy.
Yet Linnetz, to put it bluntly, would almost rather be working on his screenplay at home in Venice, California. “The show is interrupting my filmmaking,” he said.
Once, on a visit to New York in 2021, I asked Linnetz what about fashion was exciting to him, considering his other occupations.
“It’s literally not,” he said that November. “I don’t know how I ended up here.”
As a child, he often sketched dresses, he conceded, and later made a prom dress for a friend, then helped pay for his tuition at the University of Southern California by sewing costumes for the opera program. But otherwise, Linnetz said, “I have almost no connection to fashion, other than it is the medium that’s directly in front of me as a way to express the world around me.”
That world is surfer chic with Americana influences: vintage-inspired graphic tees, swollen skate shoes, patchwork flared jeans, bright gradated knits, several variations on a hoodie.
“I almost feel like the Manchurian Candidate,” he said. “Like someone calls me every morning to say, ‘You will design today,’ and my brain turns off, and I’m almost hypnotized.”
A year and a half later, he still describes fashion the same way, as if it’s a compulsion or illness beyond his control: “It’s always with you. Can it just go away?”
But he says it with a grin.
Behind the Music
At first, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, an influential creative director, didn’t know what to make of Linnetz, when he asked for a meeting in Paris in 2016.
“You meet people from LA who are kind of out of the fashion system” — and here she acknowledged a slight personal bias — “and they all seem to do many, many, many different things. And, most of the time, many, many, many different things very badly. They’re designers who don’t design, they’re actors who don’t act, they’re editors who don’t edit.”
So when she met the 20-something Linnetz, who said he had already directed a Kanye West video, produced music and worked for playwright David Mamet, “I was just like, ‘OK, here we go,’” Newhouse said.
Except, she learned, Linnetz had done those things, and a bit more, and not badly at all.
He was a child actor in Los Angeles — with Disney credits including the 2000 animated film “The Emperor’s New Groove” — until his bar mitzvah, when he decided to quit acting to “focus on being Jewish,” he said. At his temple, he met Mamet, who invited him to the set of his TV show “The Unit.”
On the day of that visit, there happened to be a costume contest, Linnetz, then 15, recalled. He made Mamet a judge’s robe from light-blocking fabric and a wig from cotton balls. “He was like, ‘That’s so odd, but come back tomorrow,’” Linnetz said.
When he wasn’t in school, he was assisting Mamet, including on Broadway. One of his tasks was printing out emails sent to Mamet, who would write his replies on a typewriter.
At USC, he majored in screenwriting, minored in opera and joined a fraternity. (He had always been interested in hypermasculine rituals; in high school, he wrestled.) He made a short film during his senior year starring Sawyer Spielberg, set in 1960s El Paso. But after graduation, the filmmaking didn’t take off. He turned instead to 3D animation. A friend who worked with West (now known as Ye) showed him Linnetz’s art; Linnetz, who had met Ye a few years earlier, was brought in to work on cover art concepts for “The Life of Pablo.”
The relationship escalated. Among several other things, Linnetz can claim responsibility as “creative director of fabrication” for the 12 nude celebrity sculptures in Ye’s “Famous” video — the one with Taylor Swift, Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby and at least two U.S. presidents sleeping together in a colossal bed.
In 2017, when Kim Kardashian returned to Instagram after she was robbed in Paris, her first posts were Polaroids shot by Linnetz, who encouraged her not to look at the camera: “So much before the robbery was her looking to the camera — the selfies. I was like, ‘Let’s do something where people are observing you so you’re not asking anything from them, and they can make their own decisions about you.’”
Working with the couple made him realize how art and photography could influence culture. But Linnetz also wanted to break out on his own. Opportunities arose to work with other performers, like Lady Gaga for the visual direction and stage design of her alien-robot-rock opera residency in Las Vegas.
By the time he asked Newhouse to meet, Linnetz wasn’t pitching a specific project — he simply wanted to work with her. She took a liking to him.
“He was adorable,” Newhouse said of Linnetz, who can seem both impish and like an old soul in the span of one conversation. “I just felt he had something.”
She asked him to direct an advertisement in 2017 for Comme des Garçons’ Andy Warhol fragrance. The next year, he met the brand’s president, Adrian Joffe. Just as his creative relationship with Ye grew quickly, so did this one. Linnetz was “kind of brilliant,” with “a rare confidence,” Joffe said in an email.
Almost as a dare — “baiting him,” Joffe said — he asked Linnetz to make something for the opening of Dover Street Market Los Angeles. “He’d never made clothing before,” Joffe said. The resulting pastel corduroy shirts ended up selling out in a week, he said. “He’s just good.”
Joffe offered Linnetz his own label under Dover Street Market Paris’ brand development program.
At the time, Linnetz saw the opportunity as a way to escape the last few harried years of living adjacent to mega fame. (In the much-memed words of Lady Gaga: “no sleep, bus, club, another club, another club.”)
“I created ERL to get away from all this music industry celebrity stuff,” said Linnetz, who was looking for “something more meditative.”
For ERL, which released its first full collection in 2020, he would shoot all the campaigns himself. He would work almost entirely by himself. He would live quietly; he doesn’t drink or do drugs, he said, or enjoy going to parties or even leaving Venice, where he is happily isolated from the fashion world at large, with a newly adopted dog named Einstein.
He sees the irony in this thinking now: “It’s weird to go and create something superpersonal and then have everyone want to be a part of it.”
California Couture
“Have you seen the movie ‘Escape From L.A.’?” Linnetz asked in May 2022. He described a scene from the campy 1996 disaster film in which Kurt Russell and Peter Fonda surf on a tsunami wave while trying to chase down Steve Buscemi in a Cadillac.
The scene was his inspiration for the Dior ERL show set in Venice. The runway emerged from the beach with two large waves on either side, half-enclosing the audience, threatening to wash away all the fashion people.
“It’s this moody, blue, grungy menace,” Linnetz said, meant to spiritually complement the clothes, which were alternately electric and metallic in color, with loose silhouettes and shiny, swaggering accents. “It’s a weird, twisted, colorful Californication of Dior. A lot of the logos say ‘California Couture.’”
Kim Jones, the artistic director of Dior Men, invited Linnetz to co-design the line out of a desire to support young talent. “We have a lot of collections a year,” he said — at least four — and working with another designer can help “take you out of the bubble that you sometimes get stuck in.”
He found Linnetz’s initial approach to Dior’s archives novel: The young designer decided to focus on the year 1990, when Gianfranco Ferré, then the artistic director, was leaning into opulence. Linnetz chose 1990 only because it was the year he was born.
“He reminded me of when I had my label when I was younger,” Jones said. “I saw a lot of how I work in him — very fast, decisive, clear.”
His first solo runway show, for Pitti Uomo, will be more extravagant, Linnetz said. He will be introducing Eli Russell, a new line of tailoring and eveningwear — sweeping suits in rich textures, baggy and baroque, with even more shiny metallics, to be worn by surfer-models flown in to Florence from Southern California.
“The final result is somewhere between impractical and practical, comfortable and intolerable,” Linnetz said. “This first iteration really feels like dress up. But some of the suits are, like, $15,000 to $20,000, so it’s expensive dress up.
“I put a lot of importance on this one show because I don’t know how many I’ll ever do,” he continued. He had no intention to do another after the Dior collaboration. And he feels torn, now, between thinking “this is kind of silly” — just wanting to work on the third draft of that screenplay, an “exploration of American male friendship” about two friends starting college in the 1970s — and perhaps going too big in Italy.
“If you do something bigger, you’re suddenly confronted with the ridiculousness of everyone’s desperate desire to go viral or have a crazy moment,” said the man who once put Kid Cudi in a wedding dress and veil.
At the same time, while modeling a sequined top hat he made for the show, he expressed an intention to create a “barrage that leaves people utterly speechless.” Linnetz can’t help but contradict himself — or maybe it’s just that he contains multitudes. Is he the next “big star in the fashion world,” as Jones predicted, or someone who only came to fashion accidentally, whose imagination and ambition to tell stories stretches far beyond the medium of clothing?
“Every 10 minutes, I’m like, ‘Why did I do this?’” Linnetz said of his upcoming show. “Oh well, I guess someone has to do it.”

These Put the 'Show' in 'Fashion Show': [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chanel in Los Angeles, Dior in Mexico, Gucci in Seoul. Clothes are just a tiny part of the content.
In 1964, John Cheever published a short story called "The Swimmer" in which a seemingly happy suburbanite endeavors to swim his way home across New York's Westchester County, by going from one backyard pool to the next in an odyssey that reveals the truth of his world.
It's a scenario that sprang to mind during the last cruise (or resort) season, a monthlong series of extravaganzas in far-flung destinations that came to an end last week. It was not hard to imagine fashionistas hieing their way from show to show to show before finally returning home.
They could have started in Los Angeles with Chanel on May 9, moved on to Seoul with Gucci, on to Mexico City for Dior, then to northern Italy for Louis Vuitton (which had confusingly held a separate pre-fall show in Seoul just a few weeks before) and Alberta Ferretti, ending in Rio de Janeiro on June 1 with Carolina Herrera. Many of them may have been treated to their trips by the brands themselves (The New York Times does not accept press trips, so yours truly watches the shows on the computer), caravanning around the globe as if the pandemic was a speck in the rearview mirror.
In other words, despite all the lip service paid in recent seasons to reducing the excesses of fashion, this was one of the most mileage-intensive, blowout seasons on record, one that widened the gulf between the mega-brands that can orchestrate such spectacles and the rest of the industry.
Each brand, it seemed, was trying to one-up the others in offering "experiences" complete with dinners and famous guests dressed to the nines, selfie-ing away in extraordinary places: Jaden Smith, Eileen Gu and Emma Stone at Isola Bella, Italy, the Borromeo family's private island (Vuitton); Naomi Watts, Alicia Keys and Riley Keough at the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso, once the school where Frida Kahlo studied and met Diego Rivera and now a museum (Dior); Kristen Stewart, G-Dragon and Sofia Richie at the Paramount Studios lot (Chanel).
Rarely has it been so clear that when it comes to fashion, there is now so much more at stake than just clothes.
It's About Content, Baby
The sheer fact that the press notes for Gucci's fashion fantasia in the 14th-century Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul contained not just a description of the "dialogue between the house's own heritage and the electrifying South Korean impact that influences it today" but also a 36-page document detailing the celebrities and "KOLs" (key opinion leaders) in attendance along with their Instagram, Twitter and TikTok followings, pretty much said it all.
The collection itself, a wetsuits-meets-the-bourgeoisie hybrid of neoprene, logos, suiting and chiffon created by an anonymous team because Gucci's new designer, Sabato De Sarno had not yet arrived, was significantly less striking than the idea that more than 350 million IG followers were granted secondary access to the experience through the postings of the lucky few actually in attendance.
In other words, the show allowed the brand to have its exclusivity -- to flex its power, ability to access a historic site that had never before hosted a fashion show and taste -- and advertise it widely too.
Not to mention court a market that is increasingly important, as K-pop takes over the world and China proves increasingly complicated politically. What better way to show respect, after all, than to go to the source?
That's also partly why Wes Gordon decided to take his first-ever Carolina Herrera cruise show, a bouquet of polka dots, juicy florals and cha-cha frills, to Brazil, in a nod to both the brand's Latin roots as well as the country's voracious appetite for beauty and fragrance.
Also Cultural Cross-pollination
Of course, the destination show also brings other benefits -- like inspiration. Designers have to produce so many collections, so often, that coming up with new ideas every season is pretty much a Sisyphean task. One advantage, then, of the traveling collection is that it comes with a built-in set of potential new ingredients based on paying "homage" to the culture and geography where a brand lands. This is both a necessary show of appreciation in the era of cultural appropriation, though one that can seem more expedient than long-lasting and authentic, and thematically useful.
Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior, in particular, had made a virtue of the trend, positioning her cruise shows as platforms to showcase the work of local artisans and using her power to argue, at least for a season, that skills that have often been dismissed as "craft" deserve the same respect as couture. As a result, she has created a specific identity and reason for being for the Dior cruise collections that no other brand has quite managed.
This season was no different, with six different expert weavers and artisanal groups invited to contribute their work to classic Dior shapes like the Bar jacket; lacy petticoat shirtdresses; and filigree gowns (and to sit in the front row at the show). For a grand finale, designed by the Mexican artist and activist Elina Chauvet, there was a set of 20 white dresses -- muslin toiles, taken from the brand's archives -- embroidered in blood red with hearts and words meant to represent the violence visited on women, their fragility and strength. It was jarring but also unexpectedly effective.
Another kind of conceptual liberation was on view in Nicolas Ghesquière's Louis Vuitton show, which was weird in the best possible way: a bizarro amalgamation of sea creature silhouettes, sci-fi royalty and romance sparked perhaps by the island site but not limited by it. It made for a persuasive argument for getting designers, literally, out of their comfort zone. Free the imagination!
And Haute Merch
Not that it always works. For Virginie Viard of Chanel, a journey to Los Angeles led to what seemed like thoughts of roller-skating on the Venice boardwalk, "Barbie" (Margot Robbie was in attendance), aerobics and related clichés, including palm trees, playsuits and bubblelicious bouclé so saccharine it made the jaw clench. Ms. Viard can lean casually into the soignée -- see one shimmery, simple tank top with a wisp of a black skirt -- when she isn't trying so blindingly hard to be hip, but this was one case when going further afield meant going astray.
Blink in surprise, however, at a particularly lurid aqua warm-up suit and simply cast your eyes somewhere else: to the bright lights and snack carts and movie stars and later a performance by Snoop Dogg. The show around the show was so fabulous, the fact that so much of the collection was more souvenir kitsch than chic was washed away in the rush of fame and fun.
And that, in the end, is the crux of this particular fashion phenomenon. That's the memory dangled, and designed, for purchase. Like any piece of concert merch, these collections tap into the atavistic urge to own a sign that you were there.
Or there-ish.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- I think about Jackie Kennedy several times a day.
I have no choice.
Tour groups come by my house in Georgetown to see John Kennedy's bachelor pad, where he was living when he met Jacqueline Bouvier at a dinner party.
I eavesdropped at the window once and heard a tour guide spin the romantic yarn about how the handsome senator met the beautiful debutante and they decided to live happily ever after. Somewhere else. "Jackie told Jack he needed to get out of this dump," the guide said. "By the time he was elected president, they were living in a beautiful house down the block, which we'll go see now."
As a tonic to the coarseness of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, I have been escaping to the cultured world of Jacqueline Bouvier in the period when Jack was diffidently courting her. (Never a Heathcliff type, Jack sometimes treated her, as Jackie once told Gore Vidal, as though she were a campaign asset, like Rhode Island.)
Carl Sferrazza Anthony's new biography, "Camera Girl," offers a lovely snapshot of Jackie's single years in D.C., working at The Washington Times-Herald.
In 1951, Jackie, who had just graduated from George Washington University with a degree in French literature, joined the paper as a gofer, answering the phone and fetching coffee. Her wealthy stepfather was friends with Arthur Krock, the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. Krock called Frank Waldrop, the executive editor of the Washington Times-Herald, and asked "Are you still hiring little girls?" because he knew a "round-eyed, clever" one.
Waldrop would recount the story many times after Jackie became an icon. When she came to meet him, he bluntly asked her, "Do you really want to go into journalism, or do you want to hang around here until you get married?" Jackie, who fantasized about being a famous writer, replied, "No, sir, I want to make a career."
He emphasized that his paper was not a waiting room for aspiring brides. "I'd seen her type," he would later say. "Little society girls with dreams of writing the great American novel, who drop it the minute they find the great American husband."
As Anthony recounts, Jackie was so charming, witty and eager that eventually Waldrop gave her the "Inquiring Photographer" column, which none of the men wanted. Paying $ 25 a week, it was a six-days-a-week column where she would ask people a question and snap their pictures with a bulky Graflex camera. She drove a black Mercury convertible with a red interior that she "stole" from her dashing dad, Black Jack Bouvier. She called it Zelda -- because, like Zelda Fitzgerald, "she was an unreliable beauty."
Jackie was guarded -- "simultaneously overt and covert," as Anthony put it. It was hard for her to approach strangers. Sunglasses and a big camera were her shields.
She had moxie. At the door of the Washington Senators' locker room, she asked players about their hitting slump. Then they snapped their losing streak, and Jackie was hailed as a good-luck mascot.
J.F.K. once called her fey, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "displaying magical, fairylike, or unearthly qualities," as if you'd had breakfast with a leprechaun.
The format suited her. She could display that whimsical side and even draw cartoons for the column. Waldrop gave her a byline and renamed the column "Inquiring Camera Girl." John Husted, her fiancé for three months in 1952, dismissed it as "an insipid little job," but Jackie would later say she "loved every minute."
She won over gruff male colleagues who had been skeptical of her finishing school ways. One reporter was so impressed, he offered to take her to an execution. She relished provocative questions: "Would you rather have men respect or whistle at you?" "What would you talk about if you had a date with Marilyn Monroe?"
She asked truck drivers, shouting to them when they stopped for a red light, "What do you think of Dior's spring fashion line?" At times, Anthony said, questions reflected anxieties about Jack: "The Irish author, Sean O'Faolain, claims that the Irish are deficient in the art of love. Do you agree?"
She did not hesitate to ask esoteric questions -- "In 'The Doctor's Dilemma,' George Bernard Shaw asks if it's better to save the life of a great artist who is a scoundrel, or a commonplace, honest family man. What do you think?" And she did not talk down to working-class subjects, recalling that she sought out "salty" characters.
That's probably how she found my larger-than-life dad, who was a D.C. police detective in charge of Senate security.
One night he came home and told the family that The Herald's Inquiring Camera Girl had approached him in the Capitol but he had been called to his office and couldn't answer her question.
Her name, he said, was Jacqueline Bouvier.

Full text: The film festival, which took place over almost two weeks, brought lots of fashion to the French Riviera.
There has been a lot of head-turning fashion on the French Riviera lately. Though some of it was spotted on guests at the Monaco Grand Prix (hello Bad Bunny in torso-hugging Jean Paul Gaultier), much of it came from the Cannes Film Festival, which ended on Saturday.
As one might expect from a pack of A-list celebrities attending a star-studded festival in a particularly glamorous location, there were lots of gowns and tuxedos. But in contrast to the Oscars or other awards ceremonies, there were many daytime events at Cannes, which gave many festival attendees repeated chances to dress up and take style risks -- some of which were more successful than others.
There were a lot of outfits that caught our attention during the almost two-week festival, including Jennifer Lawrence's red Dior gown and flip-flops (most comfortable!); Naomi Campbell's Valentino dress and flowing pink feathered cape (most ethereal!); and the nearly identical tan linen blazers that David Zaslav, a media executive, and Graydon Carter, an editor, wore as co-hosts of a party for the Warner Bros. movie studio (most coordinated!).
But the 20 looks on this list stood out more than most. Some were unexpected, while others were flawless. All, importantly, drew strong opinions.
Helen Mirren: Most Blue Crush!
To match her cornflower-blue Del Core gown (and her nails), the actress wore blue streaks in her wavy silver hair, the colors of which recalled a frothing ocean.
Elle Fanning: Most Antique Silverware!
The actress's metallic Paco Rabanne dress was suspended by what looked suspiciously like a piece of cutlery and had a skirt that looked as though it could cut someone who came too close.
Fan Bingbing: Most Scenic!
Printed on the actress's Christopher Bu gown was a design featuring a roaring tiger in a bamboo forest that extended onto the dress's train.
Viola Davis: Most Volume!
A towering Afro and a colossal ostrich-feather stole punched up the actress's otherwise simple Valentino dress.
Troye Sivan: Most Negative Space!
The singer's ensemble of Valentino shorts, shoulder-baring shirt and tie advanced a new definition of business casual.
Ramata-Toulaye Sy: Most Power-Glam!
Amid the many penguin suits at Cannes, the director's wide-leg multicolor Chanel pantsuit was a sartorial unicorn.
Natalie Portman: Most Jackie O.!
In oversized cat-eye sunglasses and a belted Dior mini dress (and matching jacket), the actress brought a dose of the former first lady's style to La Croisette.
José Condessa, Jason Fernández and Manu Ríos: Most Triple Threat!
It seemed impossible that the trio of actors in "Strange Way of Life," a queer Western directed by Pedro Almodóvar, did not plan their three peek-a-boo Saint Laurent looks in advance.
Lily Gladstone: Most in Bloom!
An understated hairstyle toned down the drama of the actress's floral Valentino cape dress and three-tiered earrings by Jamie Okuma, a Native American designer.
Dua Lipa: Most Accesorized!
The singer paired her sleek, one-shoulder Celine dress with accessories that included jewelry, tattoos and her reported boyfriend, the filmmaker Romain Gavras.
Rawdah Mohamed: Most Smoldering!
The model set the carpet ablaze in a Robert Wun gown covered in what appeared to be burn marks. Over her head was a tattered veil that matched the distressed dress.
Lily-Rose Depp: Most Dressing-Her-Age!
Or almost her age: The 24-year-old actress's sequined Chanel mini dress is from 1994, making it a few years older than she.
Alton Mason: Most Snatched!
Look behind the model's gloved hands, and you will notice the hourglass silhouette of his double-breasted Balenciaga suit jacket, which was tapered sharply at the waist.
Scarlett Johansson: Most Trompe l'Oeil!
With a contrasting white top and straps, the actress's pink Prada sheath dress gave the illusion of an exposed bra.
Jennie Kim: Most 'I Do!'
The Blackpink member was a vision in white -- specifically, a Chanel bridal gown made (slightly) less sweet by black tulle poking out from the bodice.
Orlando Bloom: Most Painterly!
The green and blue streaks down the actor's pale Paul Smith suit were a risk -- as were the chunky soles on his matching shoes.
Ilona Chernobai: Most On Message!
As the Ukrainian influencer ascended the festival's red-carpeted stairs wearing a blue-and-yellow gown, the colors of the Ukrainian flag, she popped balloons filled with a red liquid on her head. Those who witnessed her fashion statement included security personnel, who escorted her off the carpet soon after.
Marion Cotillard: Most Coachella!
Her twee Chanel sweater set and pink bleached jorts were textbook festival style -- music festival style, that is.

For Photographer's 100th, a Display of 220 Prints: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At Gagosian, Marian Anderson, Marilyn Monroe, Dovima and a cast of showstoppers.
Seductive and detail-oriented, Richard Avedon could have been a successful director -- and in fact, he was. From his beginnings in fashion to his development as a portraitist, his photography consisted of staged performances where he enthralled sitters with his charm.
Since his death in 2004, Avedon has hardly been forgotten. (Three of his gigantic "Murals" are currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Now, "Avedon 100," an exhibition at Gagosian gallery in Chelsea marking the centenary of his birth, approaches his legacy -- and his stagecraft -- with a grab-bag randomness. Testifying to his appeal, an assortment of colleagues, friends, critics and celebrities -- including Raf Simons, Wynton Marsalis and the photographers Rineke Dijkstra and Jeff Wall -- each chose a favorite photograph for these gallery walls (220 prints in all).
In a bravura installation designed by Stefan Beckman, the pictures are organized thematically and theatrically. A wall-size mural of Allen Ginsberg with his conventional middle-class relatives faces off against one of Andy Warhol and habitués of the Factory -- two luminaries of vanguard culture posing with very different families. Sometimes, only the informed will get the connection, as in juxtaposed portraits of the photographer Robert Frank and the artist June Leaf, who were husband and wife.
Subtle, too, is the placement of a group portrait from 1963 of the generals of the Daughters of the American Revolution alongside a formally dazzling portrait of Marian Anderson, who because of her race had been barred a generation earlier by the DAR from singing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.
Avedon had a lifelong commitment to the civil rights struggle, enriched by a close friendship with James Baldwin that dated back to their high school days. (His 1945 portrait of Baldwin is the earliest photo in the exhibition.) In 1963, he was photographing for the book, "Nothing Personal," that he co-authored with Baldwin; and along with the DAR portrait -- which is artfully composed around the women's banded sashes but a bit predictable in displaying their air of privileged condescension -- he photographed civil rights workers, who, also predictably, look resolute and stalwart. A stronger jolt is delivered by a close-up of the 106-year-old William Casby, born enslaved. With his unforgettable face, as stark as a mask, Casby exudes the look of fortitude and resilience that the photographer was after.
Avedon devalued his most original body of work -- the on-location scenes in the 1940s and 50s displaying Parisian dresses -- and demanded to be judged as an artist solely for his portraits.
"Portraiture is performance," he wrote, candidly describing his creative process. "The point is that you can't get at the thing itself, the real nature of the sitter, by stripping away the surface. " He added, "All that you can do is to manipulate that surface -- gesture, costume, expression -- radically and correctly."
The challenge is to bring to the surface something that is not boringly superficial. Avedon's photographs are rarely boring, but they are almost always superficial. You feel you are watching people perform for him. In the fashion photos, that's delightful. Sunny Harnett in a Grès gown leaning over a roulette wheel, young men swiveling their heads as a model in the New Look of Dior crosses the Place de la Concorde, Dovima standing in evening dress between two elephants -- these could be scenes in a movie. Only occasionally do they hint at something deeper, such as when Avedon included the chains on the legs of the elephants at the Cirque d'Hiver, perhaps an oblique commentary on women bound by fashion's demands. Unfortunately, that fertile period is underrepresented; there are too many run-of-the-mill, technically polished fashion photographs from later in Avedon's career.
The exhibition opens with multiple images of Marilyn Monroe, cavorting for his camera in 1957 and montaged in a 1994 print. Monroe is a star performer, overshadowing similar montages Avedon made of Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford, who lacked their predecessor's halogen incandescence. After putting on a show, Monroe sat exhausted in the studio, and Avedon (with her tacit consent) took a final picture, the "sad Marilyn" portrait that is one of his best known. Because of her untimely death five years later, this picture is regarded as a more authentic self-expression. But is it? Or is it merely physical fatigue?
Avedon preferred to photograph people he did not know, hoping to establish in a photographic session "an intimacy with no past and no future," comparable to "a sexual encounter with a stranger in a darkened room," he told an interviewer (cited in Philip Gefter's biography, "What Becomes a Legend Most"). He wanted something exciting but shallow. And that is what he got.
The worst instance of this approach -- given its own room in the exhibition -- is his project of 1979-84, "In the American West," an ill-advised attempt to rival the achievement of his friend, Diane Arbus, who died in 1971. While Arbus envied Avedon's commercial success and the polish of his prints, Avedon wished more gnawingly for the recognition that the cultural establishment accorded her artistry. But in choosing to portray in unforgiving detail an array of Westerners living on the margins and staring at the camera -- oil field workers, drifters, a rattlesnake skinner -- Avedon imitated Arbus's style but could not replicate her probing psychological intelligence.
His most profound portraits are not of picked-up strangers, but of someone he had known all his life: his father, Jacob Israel Avedon. Jacob browbeat his son as a boy. Once a quasi-filial relationship was re-established years later, it crackled with tension. The son continued to feel deprived of his father's love and respect.
With some difficulty, Avedon persuaded Jacob to sit for him, beginning in 1969 and continuing up to the elderly man's death from cancer in 1973. At the start of the suite of seven images here, Jacob is in a suit and tie. By the end he is in a hospital gown. What distinguishes these photographs from virtually every other one in the exhibition is that Jacob is completely resistant to the famous Avedon charm. He regards his son with suspicion, defiance, anguish, ruefulness and fear. He knows that he is being used. With misgivings, he is permitting that manipulation. He is not acting. He is engaging in a painful interaction with a son who has never been quite the one he wanted. And both men know that now it is too late.
Weighted with a disturbing gravity, these are Avedon's greatest portraits. They get at a human truth he usually avoided.

Slava Zaitsev, 85, Dies; A Soviet-Era Couturier Who Dressed the Elite: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He gave color, sparkle and opulence to a generation raised in drab Soviet gray and designed for pop stars, Olympic athletes, politicians and ballerinas.
Slava Zaitsev, an effervescent and enduring Soviet-era fashion designer, once called the "Red Dior" by the Western press, whose over-the-top theatrical creations and persona made him a go-to couturier at home, died on April 30 in Shchyolkovo, Russia. He was 85.
His longtime friend Tatiana Sorokko, a Russian-born model and journalist, said his death, in a hospital, was caused by internal bleeding that resulted from an ulcer.
Mr. Zaitsev died just two days before Valentin Yudashkin, a pupil of his who was also known for his sumptuous creations, and who found greater success in the West than he did, died of cancer at 59.
Mr. Zaitsev gave color, sparkle and opulence to a generation raised in drab Soviet gray, the uniform of the proletariat, by combining Western bling with nods to traditional Russian folk costumes and nostalgic references to Pasternak and Tolstoy. He was the first designer, in pre-perestroika days, to be allowed to put his name on his work, which he first did in 1982.
He would go on to design for pop stars, politicians, ballerinas and Olympic athletes. He designed uniforms for Aeroflot, the Russian airline, and for Moscow's traffic police, whom he dressed in crisp navy blue with light-reflecting stripes.
He loved pomp and spectacle -- for a time in the 1980s his fashion business was known as the Theater of Fashion -- and he oversaw sold-out weekly shows like a circus maestro, dancing down the runway dressed in bright silks and waving his hands in the air.
"Don't be afraid to look plump," he told the audience at one show, The New York Times reported in 1986. "Russia has always been associated with plump women who embody kindheartedness, hospitality and good food."
For most Russians during the Gorbachev years, fashion would remain a spectator sport. In 1986, when the average monthly wage was about 190 rubles, a Zaitsev blouse cost 300 rubles, or $ 400 (about $ 1,100 in today's dollars). But admittance to Theater of Fashion shows, which were open to the public, was just a few rubles.
Still, nothing seemed like overkill after decades of hardship, said Karina Dobrotvorskaya, a former president of Condé Nast Russia, which suspended operations there in March 2022. And, she said, because for much of his life Mr. Zaitsev was isolated from the West, his flamboyant clothes were not exactly practical.
When he showed his work at the Waldorf Astoria in 1988, during his first visit to New York, he learned that his billowing wool skirts and coats were out of sync with American taste and behaviors: too warm for the climate and too voluminous for a modern working woman who was dashing in and out of subways and taxis.
"The Soviet Union's first fashion show flopped," Vogue declared. "Nice thought for détente; the clothes didn't do much for women."
Yet the stylish and urbane Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and perhaps the most effective ambassador for his reforms, wore Mr. Zaitsev's more restrained outfits to great effect as she toured Russia and abroad in the middle to late 1980s. And she was not the only politician to turn to Mr. Zaitsev.
In 1996, when the ultranationalist firebrand Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky waged a failed campaign for the presidency, he dressed exclusively in splashy custom-made Zaitsev suits that seemed to fit his bombast, favoring in particular a crimson tunic with gold buttons (the designer was reported to have voted for the incumbent, Boris Yeltsin). And in 2003, when Lyudmila Putin, then the wife of President Vladimir V. Putin, met Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, she sported a wide-brimmed Zaitsev hat.
"It's not that he was the greatest designer," said Alessandra Stanley, co-editor of the online weekly magazine Air Mail and a former foreign correspondent for The New York Times who was based in Moscow from 1994 to 1998. "It's the fact that he could do it at all, the fact that Russians could have their own name designer. He was like the Bolshoi, something they could look to with pride and affection even if it was a little out of date."
In 1994, Ms. Stanley, writing in The Times about Russia's search for a coherent national identity in the post-Gorbachev era, described the nostalgic vision Mr. Zaitsev presented in a showing of his winter collection that year. Models were dressed like Tolstoy heroines, in ringlets, bonnets and billowing coats, and they pirouetted down the runway to music by Tchaikovsky.
"Most of us never knew such a culture existed," Mr. Zaitsev told Ms. Stanley. "We were only shown movies about the construction of channels and the conquest of Siberia."
His show, he added, was like "a dream, something that reassures Russia that a time will come when we can return to something we had in the past, but in a new version."
Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Zaitsev was born on March 2, 1938, in Ivanovo, a gritty city of textile mills northeast of Moscow. His mother, Maria Ivanovna Kokurina, was a laundress and house cleaner, and his father, Mikhail Yakovlevich Zaitsev, was an entertainer and a poet before he was drafted into the Soviet Army during World War II.
Upon his return, Mikhail Zaitsev was sent to one of the many camps set up by Stalin for "traitors to the Motherland, spies and terrorists," as prisoners of war were described, and as the son of a "traitor to the Motherland," Slava was not permitted to attend the better schools and universities. He attended a local technical school and graduated from Moscow State Textile University in 1962.
His first work was designing uniforms for laborers, but he was soon branching out. A collection of minidresses printed with patterns drawn from traditional folk costumes earned him a rebuke from the authorities but excited a delegation of visiting fashion designers, including Pierre Cardin. It was a risky move, those minis, a salvo against the official policy at the time, which declared that "an imitation of Western fashions, harmless at first sight, may lead to a real spiritual bankruptcy and moral degradation."
When in the mid-1960s a Paris newspaper called Mr. Zaitsev "the Red Dior," the authorities were once again not amused. They banned him from traveling to the West for two decades, declaring that "we do not have one Dior in this fashion house; we have 60."
Still, he prevailed, and in 1982 he was given permission to affix his name to his work, a first for a Russian designer. Yet for years, shortages of textiles and dyes -- as well as shoulder pads, linings and buttons -- often curtailed his more fanciful visions, as did a garment industry designed for mass production. And for years, he fit his work on a dressmaker's dummy dating from World War II.
For his first show under his own name, he recalled in a BBC radio interview in 2018, he designed a women's collection made from men's underpants. It was all he could find, he said, and he had them dyed in bright colors by the workshops of the Bolshoi.
"So the models went out wearing nothing but underwear, but no one even noticed that," he said. "The collection was beautiful, full of color. My models were dancing. It was great."
Mr. Zaitsev is survived by his son, Yegor, and two granddaughters. His marriage to Marina Gotesman ended in divorce.
After Mr. Zaitsev's death, President Putin issued a statement of condolence to the designer's friends and family that was posted on the Kremlin's website, according to Tass, the Russian news agency. The statement credited Mr. Zaitsev with turning the domestic fashion industry "into fine art."
"Through his unique and original works," Mr. Putin said, "Vyacheslav Zaitsev created a festive atmosphere, bringing joy and the gift of beauty to the people."
In an interview, Ms. Sorokko said that the festivity of Mr. Zaitsev's designs would especially be missed amid the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine. "With his passing," she said, "it seems the only form of fashion that will remain in Russia for quite some time is military uniforms."

Full text: A costume designer for Netflix's new "Bridgerton" spinoff describes creating clothing for a Black royal, and looking to the House of Windsor for real-life inspiration.
In the opening monologue of "Queen Charlotte," Netflix's new "Bridgerton" prequel, the title character imagines being impaled by her whalebone corset.
"If I move too much, I might be sliced and stabbed to death by my undergarments," Charlotte, played by India Amarteifio, tells her brother with a scowl.
The series's characters are constricted by their circumstances and their costuming alike, said Lyn Elizabeth Paolo, who designed costumes for "Queen Charlotte." Minutes into the first episode, for instance, Charlotte is cinched into a gown encrusted with sapphires and squeezed into a marriage to King George III of Britain. The show, created by Shonda Rhimes, weaves the pair's eventual love story together with threads on race and mental health.
The six episodes of "Queen Charlotte" required more than a thousand costumes inspired by the Georgian and Regency periods, Ms. Paolo said, including an estimated 500 crowns. Ms. Paolo and her fellow costume designer, Laura Frecon, combined "gobs of research" with more modern inspiration from Dior and Alexander McQueen. "We're having a little fun with history," she said.
In an interview that took place days after the coronation of King Charles III, Ms. Paolo discussed the process of creating costumes for fictionalized versions of a coronation and a royal wedding. She also weighed in on her favorite looks from the real-life coronation. Her remarks have been lightly edited and condensed.
How did you tell the story of Queen Charlotte's character development through her costumes?
I wanted to see why Golda Rosheuvel's character on "Bridgerton" dresses the way she does. There was a Met Ball about 10 years ago based on the work of the designer Charles James, who I'm obsessed with. I said to Shonda, "I'd like this to feel as if young Charlotte is going to that Met Ball." Charlotte's costumes become more ornate as time goes on because she is embodying the whole of the royal family. Hence, her wigs keep getting taller, and her costumes get wider and more ornate.
Queen Charlotte's elaborate wigs, and the depiction of her hair as a Black monarch, have been praised since the first season of "Bridgerton." Tell me about the decision for young Charlotte to wear her natural hair.
The original sketches that we did for Queen Charlotte, before any of the casting process was done, had her with big, natural, curly hair. I had shown those images to Nic Collins, the hair and makeup designer, when we first started. She's so talented, and she's such a purist about period. She had said, "Do you think we can do this?" So she and Shonda spoke and decided to do it. As the disclaimer at the front of the show says, it's based on history, but we're not going to stick to the aesthetic 100 percent.
Which costumes were inspired by real-life royals?
Charlotte's British wedding gown evoked Queen Elizabeth II's original coronation dress, which I saw at Kensington Palace. There was a lot of iconography on that particular gown that related to the Commonwealth: thistle, a leek for Wales, Tudor roses. That same iconography is on George's jacket and waistcoat for the wedding.
Which details of the coronation scene were the most important to get right?
The crowns are exact copies, except they obviously do not have real jewels. But not unlike the real coronation, it wasn't all about the monarch. If you look to the side, you see all of the barons and baronets in their robes of state, which we created even though they're just lining the stage. It was a massive amount of work for the costume team, but I think it pays off because you get the sense that it's a bigger image than just George and Charlotte: It's the whole country watching this.
Did you watch the real-life coronation?
I'm English, so I absolutely watched. I love the pomp and ceremony of it all.
Which looks stood out to you?
I loved Kate's reimagined flower crown. I know a lot of people were really upset that she didn't wear the crown jewels, but I thought having she and her daughter together was quite delightful. This summer, at every festival in England, everyone's going to be wearing that. It's going to start a new cottage industry.
The "Bridgerton" franchise is also, let's say, appreciated for its sex scenes. How do you dress characters for those?
I always make sure that actors know they're protected by the costume department. If an actor doesn't feel comfortable with showing their front or their back, that changes how a gown opens. But the good thing about this period is that there are so many layers. The dress can come off, but then you've still got the shirt on, and you've still got the petticoat, and the undershirt. It's kind of wonderful in a way because we never got down to, sort of, naked naked. The response has been really positive. I have a lot of people write to me and say, "I want lingerie like that!"

Spending On Luxury Up in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The end of pandemic-era restrictions has unleashed a luxury spending rebound in China. Which Western brands are coming out on top?
This time last year, Shanghai -- China's capital of fashion and luxury -- was in the throes of a ruthlessly enforced Covid lockdown. The city's glittering high-end malls and avenues lined with flagship stores stood practically empty.
Today it is a different story. Huge crowds on a recent weekend flocked to top retail destinations on or near Nanjing Road, the hub of glamour in China ever since the country's first large department stores began to open there in 1917.
"I splurge more extravagantly," Sunny Zhang, 24, said as she waited in line to enter the Chanel store at Plaza 66 mall, where the corridors are lined with shops selling some of the world's most expensive apparel. Ms. Zhang, who works for a consulting firm, used to buy six handbags a year. Now, she purchases up to five handbags a month.
"I change my handbag every day," Ms Zhang added. "I felt that everything was meaningless during the Shanghai lockdown, so we should enjoy the present moment in time."
Many Western fashion and luxury brands have been reaping the benefits of this renewed consumer mind-set. Last month, LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group by sales, and the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Company and Dior, posted a 17 percent increase in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier. Fashion and leather goods -- the French company's biggest division -- were up 18 percent, driven in large part by the rebound in China.
Last week, LVMH shares soared to a record high, making it the first European company to surpass $ 500 billion in market value. Its French rival Hermès said sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 23 percent in the first quarter, "driven by a very good Chinese New Year."
And Brunello Cucinelli, purveyor of $ 4,000 blazers and the "quiet luxury" trend, posted a 56 percent surge in first-quarter sales. Luca Lisandroni, the Italian brand's co-chief executive, called 2023 "a golden year" for the China market.
Luxury spending in China is bouncing back even faster than the country's overall economy. Retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver soared 37.4 percent in March from a year earlier, more than three times as fast as the rebound in overall retail sales, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. It was by far the biggest March on record for jewelry sales in China; indeed, March was the industry's second-highest sales month ever outside the gift-giving season before Chinese New Year.
"We expect China to be the luxury industry's key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea," Edouard Aubin, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said on a call last week.
He added that big brands "at the top of the pricing pyramid" with status-symbol value like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton were outperforming rivals. Those include Gucci and Burberry, both brands that have recently had a change of designer at their helm.
"Much of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more," Mr. Aubin said, noting that he expected a resurgence in middle-class spending to kick in later this year.
This desire for big-name luxury in China isn't new. For more than a decade, the country, with 1.4 billion consumers, powered the Western luxury market, contributing as much as a third of market revenue. Two-thirds of that spending took place outside mainland China, as Chinese tourists flocked to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere to avoid their country's steep import tariffs and consumption taxes.
But then came 2020, the worst year on record for the industry, as China closed its borders in response to the pandemic. Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.
In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. The onlookers did not have to wait long: Annie Yi, the famous Taiwanese singer, walked out of the store accompanied by a young woman who carried a white Dior bag big enough to hold a flat-panel television.
Zoe Zhou, who was at the Dior store looking for a handbag owned by a member of the K-pop band Blackpink, said she had seen a frenzy to buy luxury goods in her home city, Nanjing, with people lining up outside of stores at downtown malls.
"Now that restrictions have been lifted, there are a lot of people buying handbags," said Ms. Zhou, who was disappointed that the bag she wanted was sold out. "You can also go abroad. The price difference between domestic and foreign countries is quite large."
Many luxury brands have raised prices in recent months, notably in China. But traveling outside China remains far more difficult than it was before the pandemic.
Airfares are higher, with a significantly reduced overseas flight schedule. As part of a national security campaign, the Chinese government has made it harder to obtain or renew passports.
As domestic destinations like the duty-free tropical island of Hainan continue to gain popularity, and retail hot spots like Chengdu and Hangzhou continue to emerge, the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically is expected to continue. Social media posts about stock shortages and long lines have also become common.
"The domestic recovery may be well underway, but international travel is still far from pre-Covid levels, nor do we think Chinese tourists will be returning at the volumes they once did to Europe any time soon," said Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Short-haul destinations like Hong Kong, Macau and possibly Japan, given the weak Japanese yen, may see the return of Chinese spending sooner, he added.
Not everyone has been coming out on top. Muted quarterly results last week from Kering, the home of Gucci and Balenciaga, reminded investors that a rising tide in China won't necessarily lift all brands. The Paris-based group's revenue grew 1 percent in the first three months of 2023, hampered by a slowdown in its U.S. and wholesale business, the dwindling popularity of Gucci and continuing fallout from a controversial advertising campaign published by Balenciaga at the end of last year.
According to Antoine Belge, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, "Strong brands with serious brand desirability are getting stronger."
"Being bigger helps," he added.
The same goes for luxury markets. Claudia D'Arpizio, a senior partner at the consultancy Bain, estimated that the population of middle- and high-income consumers in mainland China will double to 500 million by 2030. By then, she predicted, the country will account for around 40 percent of global luxury purchases.
"While African and Southeast Asian countries might be emerging luxury markets," Ms. D'Arpizio said, "the sheer size of the China luxury market makes it unique and of great strategic importance."

Annual 93,000-Mile, 20-Country Relay Race That Fans Don't See: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- By late Sunday night in Baku, a few hours after Sergio Pérez of Red Bull had won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, much of the equipment necessary to stage a Formula 1 race had been methodically packed, wrapped and hoisted onto pallets, ready to fly halfway across the world.
Chartered cargo planes did the heavy lifting from there, hauling disassembled 1,700-pound racecars -- and almost anything else imaginable -- to Miami International Airport, where, by Monday, the shipment had been offloaded onto trucks and delivered to the pop-up racetrack around Hard Rock Stadium, which will host the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
Getting from the starting grid to the finish line is not, it turns out, the only high-stakes race against the clock in Formula 1.
For the top tier of international open-wheel racing, putting on premier competitions on back-to-back weekends is a complicated logistical symphony. Behind the scenes, 1,400 tons of stuff travels by air, sea and land from track to track, and continent to continent, for 23 races in 20 countries, a perpetual cycle of packing, unpacking and repacking that this year will cover more than 93,000 miles. The lights' flicking off at the start of each race are contingent on everything, somehow, arriving on time, every time.
It is not just the cars that need to be taken apart and put back together just so. It is entire garages, plus the technical gear and hospitality amenities -- even the weather instruments -- that make up essentially a modest city's worth of necessities large and small that need to be packed up. Tires, fuel, generators. Helmets and baseball hats. Broadcast equipment. Cutlery. On rare occasions, plants.
"In some cases, we bring the ovens and dishwashers," said Simon Price, the trackside manager for the shipping giant DHL, which has been moving cargo for Formula 1 for decades and been its official logistics provider since 2004.
Planes transport the most important -- read: most expensive -- cargo from one race to the next, Price said. The planes flying in from Baku this week stopped to refuel either in Casablanca, Morocco, or Luxembourg before their arrival in Miami. (Yes, everything must clear customs. A lot of paperwork is involved.) The last plane touched down Tuesday afternoon.
This week, the teams were lucky, said Christian Polhammer, the senior logistics coordinator for F1: Miami's time zone was eight hours behind.
"That eight hours make a big difference," he said. "If you go the other way, you lose eight hours."
Ships lug sets of bulkier items to nonconsecutive races. The first vessel with Miami race containers arrived at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in mid-April. By Wednesday, unpacked boxes lay neatly in front of each team's garages: "Sea shipment to Miami, Montreal, Austin, Las Vegas," read a label outside Red Bull's quarters.
Locally sourced and labeled forklifts -- Ferrari 1, Ferrari 6 -- motored to and from garages, beeping warnings as they came and went. Crews in team uniforms unwrapped cases of rims. Outside the Red Bull garage, two men inserted sensors into huge Pirelli tires.
The garages themselves, where the racecars were being reassembled by crew members blaring music, were off limits to outsiders, for competitive reasons. Practice laps were only a few days away. But no one seemed frazzled. They do this almost every week.
Last year, bad weather and vessel congestion delayed a ship in Singapore that had been headed to the Australian Grand Prix, Price said. With the clock ticking down to practices and qualifying, DHL diverted three planes and urgently sent employees to Singapore to unpack the sea freight containers and hustle the cargo into airfreight ones. Everything made it to Melbourne.
But people like Polhammer and Price cannot focus on just a single race at a time. Interviewed in Miami, they were already thinking about upcoming competitions, especially the one later this month in Monaco, where the narrow streets, Price noted with concern, "aren't built for trucks."
The Las Vegas Grand Prix, scheduled to debut in November, will present an altogether different challenge, Polhammer said. As soon as it ends, everything will have to be packed up and flown to Abu Dhabi, which is 11 hours ahead. It will help that the Vegas race will be on a Saturday night rather than the traditional Sunday slot, he added.
But he can worry about that later, after the long hauls to Britain, Belgium and Brazil.
With this year's season running from March to November and requiring travel across five continents, people like Polhammer and Price spend most of their time on planes and in hotel rooms. Price, who lives in England and began his career as a Formula 1 truck driver, estimated he gets about two days a month at home. Polhammer, who lives in Austria and has worked for F1 for 16 years, said that last year he spent more than 260 nights on the road.
"I admire and take my hat off to anyone that holds down a family and a relationship with this job," Price said.
It is difficult to explain to people outside the logistics business what they do. "They're all like, 'What a glamorous lifestyle!"' Polhammer said. "We are definitely not part of that."
No other sport compares in terms of moving so much volume over such long distances in short periods of times, he added.
"F1 -- its deadlines do not move," Price said. In normal commerce, he added, schedules can be adjusted. In Formula 1, "the green flag will go on Sunday no matter what."
Then the packing will begin again, even before the champagne is sprayed on the podium.
"It takes three to four days to set all this up," Price said, "and we pack it down in three to four hours."

A Red Carpet Sprinkled With Easter Eggs: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Karl Lagerfeld was famous for not holding back. So what would he have said about the looks worn in his (and his cat's) honor?
What would Karl have thought? Watching the stream of Lagerfeld-a-likes mount the steps of the Met Monday night in their black and white, it was hard not to wonder.
Yes, the evening's dress code dictated "in honor of Karl," the evening itself in honor of the opening of the Costume Institute exhibition dedicated to the designer's work. Yes, Mr. Lagerfeld had made himself into a caricature, with his uniform of black jeans, high white-collared shirt, black jacket, fingerless gloves, black silk cravats and black shades. And yes, the gala itself often feels like high-fashion cosplay, with guests trying to outdo one another in the attention-getting sweepstakes.
But Mr. Lagerfeld, who attended the party seven times and was a co-host once, in 2005 when the subject was Chanel, was also a man who had no truck with looking back, and who once announced, "I don't want to see all those old dresses" when asked about an earlier retrospective of his work. And this was a gala full of old dresses. (A positive change, for once, from all the one-offs of the past.)
Vintage was everywhere: a mint green Chanel from 1988 on Penélope Cruz, a co-host, and a white Chanel princess dress from 1992 on Dua Lipa, another co-host; a corseted 1993 Chanel on Margot Robbie and a pink and silver 2010 Chanel column dress on Naomi Campbell; even Nicole Kidman reprising the feathered Chanel she wore in a 2004 ad campaign for the brand. Also old Chloé: a remade violin dress, originally designed by Mr. Lagerfeld in 1983, on Olivia Wilde and a remade shower dress from the same collection, revived for Vanessa Kirby.
And Fendi, courtesy of Lila Moss Hack in 2018 couture -- "vintage" being a fungible term these days -- and Suki Waterhouse in a floral dress from the spring 2019 collection. (Watching the red carpet felt a bit like a treasure hunt through fashion history: Guess the season!) That's recycling for ya.
What was striking was how good all of it looked. In some ways, dedicating the evening's dress code to Mr. Lagerfeld was an opportunity for a reset, an opening for attendees to eschew the temptation to the ridiculous and embrace a return to elegance.
The designer did, after all, believe in making an effort. (He once derided sweatpants as "a sign of defeat.") And a lot of guests did. In comparison to recent galas such as "Camp" and "Heavenly Bodies," the kitsch element was notably understated.
There were some obvious exceptions, of course, most notably the Choupette avatars: Jared Leto, in full white Birman costume (he later changed into a black suit and cape); Doja Cat in a pearl-and-feathered Oscar de la Renta cat gown and facial prosthetics; Lil Nas X in pearl-covered silver body art and G-string.
But compared with the plethora of calmer bouclés -- even the striptease by Janelle Monáe in an enormous Thom Browne tweed coat on a pyramid-shaped superstructure that was peeled off by a set of helpers to reveal a sequined bikini, and Anne Hathaway's safety-pinned Versace-does-tweed -- they looked a little desperate. (To be fair, Mr. Lagerfeld, who once built a supermarket in the Grand Palais, appreciated a viral statement as much as anyone and probably would have been amused.)
Even Kim Kardashian, in ropes of Schiaparelli pearls at her neck and waist atop a flesh-toned corset, seemed out of place, as if she was trying too hard. This despite the fact that the pearls were a clear reference to Mr. Lagerfeld's Chanel, and his fashion-changing facility with a brand signature, and showed up again and again in more toned-down looks on other guests. See, for example, Lizzo's black pearl-strung Chanel and the ropes of nacre around Taika Waititi's gray silk Prabal Gurung tuxedo coat.
Indeed, the carpet was full of not-so-hidden Lagerfeld references, like the high collar of Julia Garner's white satin Gucci halter-neck gown and Cardi B's black patent leather camellia-festooned frock from Chen Peng Studio, which came with its own shirt and tie. Not to mention the gloves, shades and tie pin worn by Ke Huy Quan in Dior Men; the white trompe l'oeil shirt and tie of Stephanie Hsu's sequined Valentino gown; and the "Choupette blue" of James Corden's Brioni tux (so-named by Mr. Lagerfeld in honor of his cat's eyes).
Then there was the quilted handbag carried by Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, with "Karl Who?" scrawled on the side. It was a nod to a tote bag once carried by the designer, who had a relatively healthy sense of humor about his own absurdity. Mr. Lagerfeld probably would have appreciated the stair-sweeping cape Mr. Rousteing designed for Jeremy Pope with an enormous Lagerfeld likeness at the hem. He did, after all, put his face on a T-shirt for H&M for their collaboration. He liked the idea of being an apparition.
Still, of all the Lagerfeld gestures on view, perhaps none was more genuinely Lagerfeldian than Rihanna's arrival just after 10 p.m., a point in the evening when some guests were already leaving the party. In her camellia-covered Valentino cocoon and white baby-bump-embracing gown, she swept in on the arm of ASAP Rocky, who was himself wearing Gucci jeans and kilt à la an outfit worn by Mr. Lagerfeld for a runway bow at a 2004 Chanel show. Mr. Lagerfeld was, of course, perennially late for everything. Often by hours.
He, of all people, would have applauded the entrance.

Full text: As I enter the job market, I am reconsidering the white sneaker. I love the universality of my white Converse and Air Force 1's, but is it time to ditch their deceptively high-maintenance nature in favor of something more official? If I wear sneakers, will people take me seriously?
Sophie, Washington, D.C. It's a good question. During a recent episode of "Succession," Shiv Roy dismisses her estranged husband Tom by dismissing the shiny white sneakers he chose to wear to a deal-making off-site, saying: "This is why people don't take you seriously."
It made for striking TV. But in the real world, is she right?
Consider the fact that Bryce Young recently took his place on the N.F.L. draft stage as the No. 1 pick in a pink Dior suit and white kicks and looked all the cooler for them. Or that the filmmaker Chloé Zhao wore Hermès white sneakers with her gown when she won an Oscar in 2021. Once you start thinking about white sneakers, you start seeing them everywhere. Which suggests that the right move is not to abandon them but to consider, perhaps, exactly what they mean to you.
British Esquire called the white sneaker "the blank canvas upon which any modern look can be built." Harper's Bazaar crowed, "The best white sneakers can do it all."
The fact is, more than 100 years after Keds introduced its white sneaker, almost 90 years since Chuck Taylor popularized the style with Converse and more than half a century since Stan Smith changed the game, white sneakers remain the Platonic ideal of a shoe: eternal, versatile, comfortable. They suggest walking on clouds. They are normcore to the max.
But because they go with pretty much everything -- maxi-dresses and minidresses, suits, khakis and blazers -- how you wear them matters.
As part of a daily uniform, they serve as a generic punctuation mark, a subconscious suggestion of both practicality (easy to wear) and attention to detail (if you keep them clean). As a counterpoint to a more serious outfit, they offer a bit of energy and bounce. Paired with a floaty dress, they add a bit of power and oomph. Material matters: Leather is more formal; canvas more casual. The appeal is in the contrast -- and the key is the state of the shoe.
Because all of this is predicated on the assumption and necessity of maintenance. Just as leather shoes need polish, white sneakers need bleach. As with any kind of footwear, scuffs and worn-out soles can reflect the idea you are worn out, too. White sneakers demand care, just like any wardrobe basic. They may be a no-brainer to start with, but then they demand a certain psychological investment. That's the riddle and promise -- the art -- of the shoe.

A Clotheshorse Has a Very Full Stable: [Review]

Full text: Laura Horton's poignant comic monologue at 59E59 Theaters, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, delivers a sympathetic portrayal of a sample-sale hoarder.
Clothes can send Sophie into a rhapsody like nothing else does. Ever since she was a child, trawling thrift shops for secondhand style, her purchases have felt like victories.
In those early years, some of the thrill came from finding name brands that would help her fit in better with the kids at school. But she has always had an eye for fashion, no matter how impractical.
By the time she is a young adult, an aspiring writer living in London and stalking sample sales, the dresses and sweaters and shoes that she lugs home to her room in bulging bags have little to do with wearability. Does she need five ball gowns? Nope. But shopping is how Sophie soothes her increasingly anxious mind.
Laura Horton's poignant comic monologue "Breathless," part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, finds Sophie at a breaking point. Played by Madeleine MacMahon, who gives her a nervous likability, Sophie would seem to have arrived at a joyous time in life. In her late 30s, she has a thoughtful, interesting new girlfriend, Jo, whom Sophie can envision as a long-term partner. Yet at the end of every date, she fabricates reasons Jo can't come into her apartment.
"There's all the time in the world to see my place," Sophie says, except there isn't, because Jo is weary of being kept at a distance. Too mortified to confess that her apartment is stuffed with clothes -- a dangerous, suffocating, hoarder quantity of clothes -- Sophie gets dumped. She has, essentially, chosen Vivienne Westwood (Ah, that checkered dress!) and Stella McCartney (Oh, those silk-screened pants!) over a woman who's into her.
Stephanie Kempson's production for Theater Royal Plymouth smartly lets us imagine Sophie's labyrinth of apparel, her towers of shoes. The set and props are minimal: a couple of clothing racks hung with empty garment bags; a single shopping bag from Alexander McQueen. Throughout, Sophie wears the same casual outfit: loose overalls with sneakers. (Set and costumes are by Kempson, Horton and MacMahon.)
The play takes vivid hold through MacMahon's performance, which includes a small gallery of supporting characters. Among them are Sophie's sweet, gruff father and her unflappably loving mother, whose warmth is as enveloping as a hug.
There is also a journalist friend who (spoiler) promises Sophie anonymity in a story about hoarding, then splashes her name and photo all over a national newspaper. The betrayal hits so hard in performance that I wanted to implore the fictional Sophie not to believe her friend, as she does, that it's all his editors' fault.
A program note says that the play is based on Horton's "own experiences of hoarding disorder," and quotes her as saying that she was "heavily influenced by 'Sex and the City' growing up." It seems only right, then, that "Breathless" is onstage in a part of Manhattan -- about midway between a Dior boutique and Bloomingdale's -- where luxury beckons, and the price is steep.
Breathless

Maria Grazia Chiuri Fashion Designer And Zadie Xa Interdisciplinary Artist: [TStyle]

Full text: Maria Grazia Chiuri: My love for art is very personal. When I see something that strikes me, I try to meet the person who made it. I may not have a degree in art history, but I love going to exhibitions. And when I choose artists to collaborate with, I rely on my instincts. Too often, women, especially of my generation, don't have the courage to follow their gut. That's always a big mistake.
I first saw Zadie's work at the 2019 Venice Biennale [where Xa staged "Grandmother Mago," a performance that included ancestral drumming, dance, traditional Korean-inspired costumes and orca masks]. I was struck by her use of textiles and by the spiritual aspect of her fictional narratives. When I learned that she was doing a show at London's Whitechapel Gallery ["Zadie Xa: House Gods, Animal Guides and Five Ways 2 Forgiveness," a 2022 exhibition of sculptures and paintings], I wanted Dior to support it.
I'm interested in feminist art because it makes me think about my own work. Through art, which touches on topics that extend further than fashion, I can reflect more clearly on what I do. And yet genius is still considered a male trait. That's why we create sisterhood.
On the Cover
Zadie Xa: Fashion runs parallel to the art world, but it's always seemed shinier and sexier and a little scary. I don't make art with mass-market appeal, so it was surprising when Maria Grazia contacted me. I understood her immediately as another cultural worker -- she listens in a way that lots of people in positions of power don't.
She put herself behind my exhibition. To say, as a creative director, "We're going to support this public exhibition that has nothing to do with us just because we want to," knowing that the brand drives a certain level of attention -- it was an incredibly generous decision.
In art school, they tell you to network. I was always like, "What are you talking about?" Now, though, I look at other artists who've supported me -- all the success I've had is because of them. All the opportunities I've been given were because of curator friends or other artists recommending my work. It's almost overwhelming to think about.
Interviews have been edited and condensed.

The New Tiffany, Unboxed With a Splash: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For nearly four years, the Tiffany & Company flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street was shrouded in scaffolding while it underwent a full-bore renovation. In the days before the reopening, set for April 28, a Tiffany executive vice president, Alexandre Arnault, and the company's chief executive, Anthony Ledru, monitored final preparations as they whispered to each other in French.
Display cases glittered with Tiffany pieces -- heart tag bracelets, Elsa Peretti Bone cuffs and Paloma Picasso necklaces. Digital screens encircling the room showed an animation of a diamond-encrusted bird fluttering across the New York City skyline.
"We asked ourselves lots of questions going into this," Mr. Ledru, 50, said. "Are we going to change the feel? Do we respect tradition? We decided to do both."
He gestured toward the digitized bird, noting that it was based on a design by the noted Tiffany jewelry artist Jean Schlumberger.
"There's that tension: modernity and heritage," he said.
A lot has changed at Tiffany since the makeover began. Namely, the company's ownership. In 2021, after fraught negotiations, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Tiffany for about $ 16 billion. The sale was one of the largest deals ever in the luxury world, as well as LVMH's most significant American brand acquisition to date.
In effect, the jewelry emporium became the property of Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old founder, chairman and largest shareholder of LVMH, who recently dethroned Elon Musk as the world's richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Over three decades, he has built a kingdom of more than 75 brands, including Dior, Celine, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.
As construction workers toiled away on the ground floor last week, one of Mr. Arnault's five children, Alexandre Arnault, 30, stood near the spot where "Equals Pi," a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, would go. The painting, which features a shade of blue similar to Tiffany's signature color, appeared prominently in Tiffany's 2021 "About Love" ad campaign starring Jay-Z and Beyoncé.
"When people enter from Fifth Avenue, they will see the Basquiat," said Alexandre Arnault, who wore a Dior suit and Loro Piana sneakers. "It's an important part of the Tiffany brand now."
Tall and lanky, Mr. Arnault, who is responsible for much of Tiffany's creative vision, was one of the architects of the "About Love" campaign. The use of the Basquiat spurred a bit of controversy when a former Basquiat assistant insisted that the artist hadn't intended any homage to the brand.
But that didn't matter much from a marketing perspective: The Tiffany name was in the news for days, signaling that it no longer belonged solely to the era when Holly Golightly (portrayed by Audrey Hepburn) admired the vitrines of its flagship in the 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The new Tiffany, the LVMH Tiffany, was showing itself as a brand that could also be disruptive and viral.
Amid speculation about which of the Arnault children will succeed the LVMH founder, Alexandre Arnault was tasked with the job of overseeing the renovation of the Tiffany store, which the company calls the Landmark. Before moving from Paris to New York two years ago to immerse himself in the project, he reinvigorated the luggage company Rimowa, another LVMH brand, through collaborations with Virgil Abloh and Supreme.
Mr. Ledru, the Tiffany chief executive, who was born in the Brittany area of France and raised in Lille, is a luxury industry veteran who has worked for Louis Vuitton, Harry Winston and Cartier. When a droplet of blood appeared on his chin that afternoon, the result of a shaving cut, a publicist hurried to fetch him a napkin.
"This is not just another flagship," Mr. Ledru said. "For us, the Landmark is now the lighthouse of the brand."
The reboot left the building's facade untouched, and the Atlas statue clock still sits above its entrance, but it spared little else. The Landmark unabashedly represents LVMH's desire to imprint its DNA onto the company founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young.
The Tiffany flagship opened on Fifth Avenue in 1940. When the gut renovation began in 2019, the store moved into the former Niketown site next door. The Landmark was designed by the architect Peter Marino, and its 10 floors are replete with works by artists like Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince and Rashid Johnson. Flashy accouterments include a Daniel Boulud restaurant, the Blue Box Cafe, which serves a "Breakfast at Tiffany" meal, and an Audrey Hepburn experience room that features a replica of her black Givenchy dress from the movie's opening scene. (LVMH acquired Givenchy in 1988.)
"People relate a lot to her when it comes to Tiffany," Mr. Arnault said. "So we wanted to make a homage to her."
While giving a tour of the building to a reporter, the two executives walked up an undulating mirror-lined staircase inspired by Ms. Peretti's designs. The third floor specialized in wedding and engagement rings, the fourth in gold and diamonds, the fifth in silver and the sixth in home goods and accessories. The seventh floor included a Patek Philippe department and a jewelry workshop.
Mr. Ledru described the nuances that went into designing each floor, while Mr. Arnault strayed from the press tour, inspecting side rooms and taking photos with his phone.
Earlier, the two executives had sat for a more formal interview on a green couch in a book-lined room. Conservative and tight-lipped in its approach to public relations, LVMH would not disclose the Landmark's construction cost. A publicist, who sat in on the interview, said beforehand that inquiries about the LVMH succession were off-limits. Nonetheless, Mr. Arnault and Mr. Ledru fielded a few hot-seat questions.
At age 30, was Mr. Arnault feeling any heat to deliver on his mission for the family?
"Am I sweating?" he said. "No. Because I'm surrounded by the best professionals we could have."
On the eve of the Landmark's opening, were they concerned about talk that a recession may be on its way?
"There's ups and downs, but the one thing about the U.S. is that it comes back strong," Mr. Ledru said. "New York is much stronger now than it was last year and the year before. I don't want to be overly confident, but we're happy to finally open our doors.
Mr. Arnault added: "We're releasing our Q1 numbers for LVMH tomorrow. I encourage you to have a look."
(The day after the interview, LVMH reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter sales, surpassing analyst expectations. In response, French workers protesting against pension changes stormed LVMH's Paris headquarters, calling for the rich to contribute more financing to the state pension.)
If they weren't nervous about the economy, were they worried about anything else?
"I'm anxious for the first holiday season," Mr. Arnault said. "It's such an important part of American culture. This is the first one back at the original Tiffany's corner."
"We were a lot more anxious a year ago, when we were receiving phone calls from Mr. Arnault asking, 'When do you open?"' Mr. Ledru said.
After the two men finished their tour of the Landmark, they stepped onto the building's eighth floor deck. They stood in the fresh spring breeze as they took in the view of Fifth Avenue.
"Pas mal, non?" Mr. Ledru said. ("Not bad, no?")
While construction workers hammered away behind them, hurrying to add the final touches on a glass-walled event space, Mr. Arnault took note of several other LVMH properties within his sight: There was Louis Vuitton just across the street, Bulgari opposite it and Dior down the way.
He smiled.
"I can spy on them," Mr. Arnault said. "I can make sure they're working from here."

Put a Crimp in It: The Marcel Wave Returns: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rihanna, Halle Berry and Zendaya are just a few of the high wattage stars to have revisited the Marcel wave.
As a girl in Albany, Ga., in the early 2000s, Jessica Cruel liked to while away her Saturdays people-watching, sharing gossip and having her hair styled at her local salon. "You would go in at 10 and wouldn't leave until 5," said Ms. Cruel, the editor in chief of Allure magazine.
Time was no object for the salon's many regulars who hoped to achieve the undulant "do" known as the Marcel wave, an artfully constructed, high-polish style that has surfaced time and again since Josephine Baker popularized it in the early 1920s.
Widely adopted by Black women, the look was resurrected in the 1990s by a constellation of hip-hop stars, Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown notable among them. Now the Marcel has reared its glossy head once more -- a look that, while labor-intensive, seems on the cusp of mainstreaming.
"I've been noticing that there has been a resurgence of that traditional mousse, comb-and-clip style," Ms. Cruel said, ascribing its return in part to an unabated fascination with '90s trends and, not less, its renewed popularity on the runways and red carpets. The style, invented in the 1870s by the Parisian Francois Marcel Grateau, who achieved it with hot curling tongs, can be the crowning touch on bias-cut dresses reminiscent of the '20s and '30s. It can simultaneously take an edge off some of the more aggressively tailored looks on the runways this year.
Interpretations vary from highly lacquered, head-hugging waves to looser versions that fan out at the chin or tumble toward the shoulders, the wave sometimes accented with kiss curls at the hairline. Marcel waves are generally serpentine in form and created with a heat iron. But the term is sometimes used interchangeably with finger waves, which usually refers to a softer, looser wave that can be molded by hand and set with a heat lamp or diffuser.
Zendaya, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and Alexa Demie of "Euphoria" have all embraced finger waves, showing them off on the red carpet. Halle Berry wore a softly cascading version at the Oscars last month, and Demi Lovato worked a short, wet-look Marcel at the pre-Grammy gala in February.
The Marcel's elaborate formality can be part of the draw. "When you see it, you know there is a technique to it," said the hair stylist Guido Palau, who has revisited Marcel waves more than once in recent years. "It's like when you see a beautiful embroidered dress. You know that this is a craft, that talent and time were put into it."
When Mr. Palau gave the Jazz Age look a Gothic twist on Marc Jacobs's runway in 2016 -- Lady Gaga memorably paraded it -- he had to train his team to master its intricacies. Late last month Mr. Palau returned to Marcelling for the 2023 Dior pre-fall show in Mumbai, India.
The look can seem subversive, he said, projecting an audacious femininity. It is a rule-breaker, flying in the face of the unfussy bed head and other low-maintenance styles that have dominated beauty culture of late.
The renewed popularity of Marcel waves reflects a notable aesthetic shift. "The era of insouciance has passed," said Fabrice Gili, the creative director at the Frédéric Fekkai salon. "People are thinking beyond conventional beauty and trying to project a bit of a stronger look."
And now, after lockdowns, they are returning to salons. "We were so D.I.Y. for a while," said Stephanie Bong, the editorial director of Behind the Chair, a trade publication for salon professionals. "But we are exiting the fun, beachy wave era and putting the heating iron back into stylist's hands. The 'done' look is cool again."
The style is most easily created on short wavy hair, but it can be adapted to varying textures, densities and lengths. "It can give a relatively lived-in look or project a sleek, old Hollywood glamour," Ms. Bong said.
Adriano Cattide, the creative director at the Drawing Room, a popular salon in SoHo, is more cautious. "Medium to fine textured hair certainly can work, but short, naturally wavy hair definitely helps," he said. "When the hair is too thick, the style becomes harder to pull off." Mr. Cattide may work with an iron to give fine, straight hair a bouncy base before attempting the more rigid waves that are a bit like raffia to the touch.
Clients at the Drawing Room tend to request waves spontaneously. "They may just tell us, 'I'm going out tonight, and I want to do something fun and fresh,"' said Tyler Hearn, the manager of the salon. The look is a hit with adventurous patrons of varying races and ethnicities.
Few are as brashly confident as SF Roth, a 23-year-old artist who stopped in last week hoping to add a little novelty to her "wolf" cut, a contemporary hybrid of the shag and mullet. There, she placed herself in Mr. Cattide's hands. "You have to commit," she said. "This is not a casual thing."
Ms. Roth has the kind of wavy, fine-to-medium hair that lends itself to stiffly lacquered waves fitted like a cap to her head. She expressed no qualms when Mr. Cattide told her that he planned to go with something edgy or, as he put it, "very clean and structured on top, messier in back."
He started with a deep side part, brushing industrial strength gel outward from the roots, then pinching the hair with his fingers to create S-curves, teasing them in alternating directions with a rattail comb. He finished the look with tendrils snaking along Ms. Roth's temples and cheeks, each an attenuated variation on the classic kiss curl.
"He is sculpting," Ms. Roth said, appraising her reflection as the work progressed. "I feel like a sea creature."
She thought she might show off the "do" at dinner with friends that evening, wearing it with a long black skirt and cropped white tank top -- "a mix of elegance and street punk," she said. It was by no means a look she planned to reserve for a special occasions.
"I like its energy," she said. "Event or no event, if I am feeling this, I'll wear it."

NEW YORK — For nearly four years, the Tiffany & Co. flagship store on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 57th Street was shrouded in scaffolding while it underwent a full-bore renovation. In the days before the reopening, set for April 28, a Tiffany executive vice president, Alexandre Arnault, and the company’s CEO, Anthony Ledru, monitored final preparations as they whispered to each other in French.
Display cases glittered with Tiffany pieces — heart tag bracelets, Elsa Peretti bone cuffs and Paloma Picasso necklaces. Digital screens encircling the room showed an animation of a diamond-encrusted bird fluttering across the New York City skyline.
“We asked ourselves lots of questions going into this,” Ledru, 50, said. “Are we going to change the feel? Do we respect tradition? We decided to do both.”
He gestured toward the digitized bird, noting that it was based on a design by noted Tiffany jewelry artist Jean Schlumberger.
“There’s that tension: modernity and heritage,” he said.
A lot has changed at Tiffany since the makeover began. Namely, the company’s ownership. In 2021, after fraught negotiations, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Tiffany for about $16 billion. The sale was one of the largest deals ever in the luxury world, as well as LVMH’s most significant American brand acquisition to date.
In effect, the jewelry emporium became the property of Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old founder, chair and largest shareholder of LVMH, who recently dethroned Elon Musk as the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Over three decades, he has built a kingdom of more than 75 brands, including Dior, Celine, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.
As construction workers toiled away on the ground floor last week, one of Arnault’s five children, Alexandre Arnault, 30, stood near the spot where “Equals Pi,” a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, would go. The painting, which features a shade of blue similar to Tiffany’s signature color, appeared prominently in Tiffany’s 2021 “About Love” ad campaign starring Jay-Z and Beyoncé.
“When people enter from Fifth Avenue, they will see the Basquiat,” said Alexandre Arnault, who wore a Dior suit and Loro Piana sneakers. “It’s an important part of the Tiffany brand now.”
Tall and lanky, Arnault, who is responsible for much of Tiffany’s creative vision, was one of the architects of the “About Love” campaign. The use of the Basquiat spurred a bit of controversy when a former Basquiat assistant insisted that the artist hadn’t intended any homage to the brand.
But that didn’t matter much from a marketing perspective: The Tiffany name was in the news for days, signaling that it no longer belonged solely to the era when Holly Golightly (portrayed by Audrey Hepburn) admired the vitrines of its flagship in the 1961 film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” The new Tiffany, the LVMH Tiffany, was showing itself as a brand that could also be disruptive and viral.
Amid speculation about which of the Arnault children will succeed the LVMH founder, Alexandre Arnault was tasked with the job of overseeing the renovation of the Tiffany store, which the company calls the Landmark. Before moving from Paris to New York two years ago to immerse himself in the project, he reinvigorated the luggage company Rimowa, another LVMH brand, through collaborations with Virgil Abloh and Supreme.
Ledru, the Tiffany CEO, who was born in the Brittany area of France and raised in Lille, France, is a luxury industry veteran who has worked for ​​Louis Vuitton, Harry Winston and Cartier. When a droplet of blood appeared on his chin that afternoon, the result of a shaving cut, a publicist hurried to fetch him a napkin.
“This is not just another flagship,” Ledru said. “For us, the Landmark is now the lighthouse of the brand.”
The reboot left the building’s facade untouched, and the Atlas statue clock still sits above its entrance, but it spared little else. The Landmark unabashedly represents LVMH’s desire to imprint its DNA onto the company, which was founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young.
The Tiffany flagship opened on Fifth Avenue in 1940. When the gut renovation began in 2019, the store moved into the former Niketown site next door. The Landmark was designed by architect Peter Marino, and its 10 floors are replete with works by artists such as Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, ​Richard Prince and Rashid Johnson. Flashy accouterments include a Daniel Boulud restaurant, the Blue Box Cafe, which serves a “Breakfast at Tiffany” meal, and an Audrey Hepburn experience room that features a replica of her black Givenchy dress from the movie’s opening scene. (LVMH acquired Givenchy in 1988.)
“People relate a lot to her when it comes to Tiffany,” Arnault said. “So we wanted to make a homage to her.”
While giving a tour of the building to a reporter, the two executives walked up an undulating mirror-lined staircase inspired by Peretti’s designs. The third floor specialized in wedding and engagement rings, the fourth in gold and diamonds, the fifth in silver and the sixth in home accessories. The seventh floor included a Patek Philippe department and a jewelry workshop.
Ledru described the nuances that went into designing each floor, while Arnault strayed from the press tour, inspecting side rooms and taking photos with his phone.
Earlier, the two executives had sat for a more formal interview on a green couch in a book-lined room. Conservative and tight-lipped in its approach to public relations, LVMH would not disclose the Landmark’s construction cost. A publicist, who sat in on the interview, said beforehand that inquiries about the LVMH succession were off limits. Nonetheless, Arnault and Ledru fielded a few hot-seat questions.
At age 30, was Arnault feeling any heat to deliver on his mission for the family?
“Am I sweating?” he said. “No. Because I’m surrounded by the best professionals we could have.”
On the eve of the Landmark’s opening, were they concerned about talk that a recession may be on its way?
“There’s ups and downs, but the one thing about the U.S. is that it comes back strong,” Ledru said. “New York is much stronger now than it was last year and the year before. I don’t want to be overly confident, but we’re happy to finally open our doors.”
Arnault added: “We’re releasing our Q1 numbers for LVMH tomorrow. I encourage you to have a look.”
(The day after the interview, LVMH reported a 17% rise in first-quarter sales, surpassing analyst expectations. In response, French workers protesting against pension changes stormed LVMH’s Paris headquarters, calling for the rich to contribute more financing to the state pension.)
If they weren’t nervous about the economy, were they worried about anything else?
“I’m anxious for the first holiday season,” Arnault said. “It’s such an important part of American culture. This is the first one back at the original Tiffany’s corner.”
Ledru said he was a lot more anxious a year ago, when Arnault would call and ask, “When do you open?”
After the two men finished their tour of the Landmark, they stepped onto the building’s eighth-floor deck. They stood in the fresh spring breeze as they took in the view of Fifth Avenue.
“Pas mal, non?” Ledru said. (“Not bad, no?”)

17 Moments in Culture That Put Their Stamp On the Covid Era: [Sunday Review Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nine days after the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, "Tiger King" premiered. The outsize success of this Netflix docuseries about a zoo keeper nicknamed Joe Exotic, watched by over 34 million people in its first 10 days, had nothing expressly to do with Covid. But it had everything to do with the jarring change in our collective circumstances -- whether it was a need to escape our circumscribed lives or the longing, in our isolation, to do something, anything, together. It's been three years now. Covid is still with us, but it's different. In this time of relative calm, it's possible to see the pandemic as not just a crisis of public health but also a distinct cultural era with its own emerging canon. What unites these shows, movies, books and songs is not a common aesthetic or shared themes. What unites them is us -- the audience -- and the way we reacted to them: the surprising way they expanded our lives, assuaged our anxieties, lessened our isolation or just got us briefly out of our own heads. We asked an array of cultural critics to consider the following 17 artifacts, each of which captured something essential during Covid. These works reflected a tumultuous moment back at us, illuminating it and us, too. If you were putting together a time capsule to let people in 100 years know what living through this pandemic felt like, sure, you might include hand sanitizer and a surgical mask. But you must also include the theme song from "The White Lotus" and an episode of "Love Is Blind" and a group chat about Taylor Swift, as well as the unexpected online drawing lessons from a famous children's book author. As that author, Mo Willems, says in these pages of the pandemic: "Science will get us out of this, but art will get us through it." These are the cultural moments that got us through it.
The Intimate Masterpiece TAYLOR SWIFT'S 'FOLKLORE' If the first months of what we now casually refer to as "quarantine" were defined by fear and uncertainty, by July 2020 we'd entered the monotony era. In many states, movie theaters were still closed, concert venues hadn't reopened, and indoor gatherings were mostly verboten. That's when Taylor Swift's "Folklore" dropped -- the first of the three original albums she released from 2020 to 2023. Countless group chats praised its melodies and dissected its lyrics. Just when we craved closeness the most, Ms. Swift's vocals, recorded in her bedroom, felt unprecedentedly intimate. If her previous albums were made for pop maximalism, "Folklore" sounded so stripped down that you could literally hear her breathe. "Folklore" arrived like a gift that only a pop superstar could give us: an album we couldn't stop talking about at exactly the moment we needed something to obsess over together and help us mark the difference between days. -- ELAMIN ABDELMAHMOUD The Isolation Aphrodisiac 'LOVE IS BLIND' On Netflix's unscripted and addictive dating show "Love Is Blind," the singles seeking mates can't see one another -- they communicate solely from "pods" that are separated by opaque screens. So if you want to get a glimpse of the stranger you've convinced yourself is your true love, one of you must first propose marriage and the other must accept. The show premiered a month before Covid shutdowns, on Feb. 13, 2020. During a subsequent time so lonely that some people resorted to holding a birthday party for the dishwasher, living in pods and forming emotional bonds with people you've never met in person (and have maybe never even seen) suddenly felt totally normal and relatable. Perhaps marital commitment to a virtual stranger no longer seemed like such an insane price to pay for the chance to see another human face. -- TARA ARIANO The Paranoia Safe Space AMONG US While we were trapped at home, kids, gamers, streamers and at least two sitting congressional representatives chose to be trapped together in the depths of outer space. (The representatives were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, who played Among Us online to raise awareness about getting out the vote.) In this game, you work as a group trying to complete small tasks like connecting colored wires -- but a few of you are secretly assassins, charged with discreetly killing your crewmates while they try to indiscreetly ferret you out. Among Us offered the usual thrills of a party game but with the added pandemic enticement of controlled chaos as the outside world was spiraling. Players knew their assigned roles -- and also knew that any stresses from the whodunit would evaporate at the end of each gaming session. You could play the villain (or catch one), then log off, enjoying an escape valve that the real world wasn't offering. -- ROLLIN HU The Jokes That Wrecked Us BO BURNHAM'S 'INSIDE' Some of the most memorable cultural moments in the pandemic were comedy specials -- those exemplars of artificial intimacy, when it's just a comedian, a stage, a microphone, a crowd, a camera, and you at home, hopefully laughing. Jerrod Carmichael set a new standard for intimacies, as he revealed, in a Greenwich Village jazz club, both a despised first name (Rothaniel, also the name of the special) and a sexual orientation (gay) that he had kept hidden all his life. But only one special truly captured how living through the pandemic felt: "Inside," by Bo Burnham. As a comedian, Mr. Burnham has long plumbed the inauthenticity of public performance and the neediness of online life, which made him perhaps the perfect bard for a pandemic lockdown, should one ever occur. And one did, and he was. Shot and performed alone in his Los Angeles guest house over many months, with his increasingly scraggly Robinson Crusoe beard as a testament to his unraveling sanity, "Inside" traces a 90-minute journey from entertaining ditties like "FaceTime With My Mom (Tonight)" to ragged paeans of despair like "Welcome to the Internet." It appeared on Netflix in 2021 like a message in a bottle from a shipwrecked man, except when we got it, we were all shipwrecked, too. And by the end of it, we were wrecked in other ways: In "That Funny Feeling," a comedy song about active shooters, mass isolation and climate catastrophe, when Mr. Burnham sings, "That unapparent summer air in early fall / The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all," it's probably not the punchline we hoped for, but it's definitely the one we needed to hear. -- ADAM STERNBERGH The Eerily Prescient Novel LING MA'S 'SEVERANCE' In Ling Ma's apocalyptic novel "Severance," a virus called Shen Fever ravages the world, turning people into automatons trapped in repetitive loops of behavior, producing an unnerving, slow-motion apocalypse. The book earned critical praise upon its release in 2018, when a pandemic was just a literary device. A year and a half later, when the real world plunged into a real pandemic, "Severance" became one of the fictions of disaster -- along with "Station Eleven" and the film "Contagion" -- that anxious, bewildered audiences flocked to. The main character in Ms. Ma's novel, Candace Chen, is the last blogger standing in New York, and she experiences the apocalypse as something consumable and viewable online: For her, pixels act like a shield. In early 2020, many of us felt a lot like Candace, with a plague unfurling around the world while we sat tucked away at home behind our little screens. "Severance," so unsettling on first reading, became an unlikely balm -- offering the soothing experience of hunkering down with an alternate, controllable version of catastrophe, even as a real one raged outside. -- HILLARY KELLY The Protest Soundtrack POP SMOKE'S 'DIOR' Even before Covid, the sound of Pop Smoke -- the Brooklyn-based rapper, born Bashar Barakah, who was killed in February 2020 at age 20 -- had come to represent the creativity and confrontational nature of New York. For my money, "Dior," from his breakout 2019 mixtape "Meet the Woo," is the song that exemplified his mentality and his appeal. In the summer of 2020, "Dior" became something else, too -- an anthem for the combustible, furious season of protest that followed the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a song lawless and full of raw power. The opening exhortation to "roll another one" sounds like an order from a supreme commander or the voice of a polar bear raised in Canarsie. It hits like a call to action, even as Smoke's growl stops you dead in your tracks. There were other songs that echoed over the Black Lives Matter protests -- like "We Paid" by Lil Baby featuring 42 Dugg and the protest chorus "Alright" by Kendrick Lamar -- but "Dior" is the one that lingers. Just like Smoke's unmatchable voice and authoritative flow, the carry-over effects of that first pandemic summer -- too much policing, too few social services, injustice and tenuous mental health -- persist. So "Dior" sounds more essential than ever: a song you can play at a block party and at a protest where you're fighting for your right to live. -- JAYSON BUFORD The Flop That Was Reborn 'TENET' Christopher Nolan's "Tenet" -- a muscular, globetrotting, timeline-reversing epic featuring Russian oligarchs, a distressed damsel and lots of spy movie trappings -- was originally scheduled for release in July 2020, the heart of blockbuster season. Like Mr. Nolan's 2010 hit "Inception," it was supposed to be an arty moneymaker with a handsome cast of movie stars (including John David Washington and Robert Pattinson), a brand-name director and a relative guarantee that butts would land in seats. Then, as we know, the world happened. A mid-July release became a late July release, before finally being pushed into September. Major markets like New York and Los Angeles wouldn't play the movie indoors until 2021, which sent some hardcore fans searching for nearby drive-ins. Mr. Nolan -- famously a cheerleader for the purity of the theatrical experience -- had hoped his film would bring viewers back to theaters. (A video of Tom Cruise attending a screening while wearing a mask was meant to show them how.) But it far underperformed "Inception," leading some to declare it a flop. But was it? Instead of watching it on towering IMAX screens, millions of us watched (and puzzled over, thanks to its inscrutable plot) it on our relatively tiny Covid-bubble screens. Maybe that's why "Tenet" now feels like a pandemic fever dream. It's the biggest little movie of Mr. Nolan's career, a box office failure (that still made plenty of money) that feels like vapor, so yawning was the gap between the role it was meant to play in our lives and how it ultimately turned out. The film critic Keith Phipps most likely had it right when he said that "Tenet" was always destined to become a cult movie: both a victim and a beneficiary of the pandemic-upended release schedule. It was the blockbuster that went bust -- but then found an unlikely, completely appropriate second life. -- K. AUSTIN COLLINS The Daily Oasis of Sanity 'LUNCH DOODLES WITH MO WILLEMS' I think like many people in early March 2020, I couldn't or wouldn't comprehend the magnitude of an actual pandemic, so I didn't. I'd been traveling to Los Angeles, then I flew to D.C. for a big show where lots of kids would come and doodle while a jazz band improvised. But when I landed, I saw what was on the airport TV screens. That's when it hit me: We can't do this. So I canceled the show and flew home. I'd long been saying that I write about things that confuse me or scare me because if I'm confused or scared enough, I assume that it must be a universal emotion. On that plane, I knew I was afraid. So I thought, maybe other people were afraid, too. That gave me an idea. That was on Thursday, March 12. On Friday I called the Kennedy Center, where I was artist in residence, and pitched the idea of shooting a midday doodling session from my home studio. On Saturday, I wrote a few beat sheets, and my wife, Cher, and son, Trix, set up what we needed. On Sunday, we shot the first Lunch Doodle with a cellphone on a tripod on a table -- that was it. No lights. No microphone. We did it in one shot with no edits, then sent the video to the team at the Kennedy Center, who formatted it and announced on social media the video would drop on Monday at noon. As the week progressed, a pal got in touch to say, "You know what, let me send you a microphone." My mother-in-law reached out to say, "Let me send you a comb." The shows got tighter. It was, to be honest, stressful and isolating at the beginning. But within a couple of days, we started getting letters and drawings sent by kids. That felt good. The whole project gave our family agency, which is what we desperately needed in those early days. Thanks to the kids, our sense of being untethered in a stormy sea gave way to a sense of being connected to a community, which grew into a realization: Science was going to get us out of this pandemic. But art was going to get us through it. -- MO WILLEMS The 'Feel Good' Show 'TED LASSO' The Apple TV+ sitcom about an American college football coach brought to England to manage a Premier League football (i.e., soccer) team arrived with impeccable timing in August 2020. It has been held up innumerable times since as a widespread "balm," a feel-good show when we were most distinctly in need of good feelings. Ted's catchphrase, "I appreciate you," remains a sentence we could all benefit from uttering, and hearing, as often as possible. But just inches below the surface, "Ted Lasso" is also a show about isolation and loneliness and trying to build new forms of community -- and that feels just as emblematic of the past three years. Ted has left his wife and beloved son behind in Kansas, and the only person he knows in his new country is the assistant coach who came with him. He doesn't understand England. He doesn't understand soccer. He doesn't know how to navigate new social contexts. He doesn't even drink tea. And all of this unfolds for him against a backdrop of anxiety so profound that it results in occasional panic attacks. It's revealed in the second season that his father killed himself when Ted was a teenager -- in part, Ted believes, because as a boy he didn't say "I appreciate you" clearly or often enough. Isolation, new contexts, overwhelming changes, a backdrop of crippling anxiety -- does any of this sound familiar? Yes, "Ted Lasso" is a "feel-good" show. Like the best TV, however, it has sadness at its core. Ted may have helped many of us feel a little better during the pandemic. But he was struggling (and still is, with the third season now underway) right there along with us. --CHRISTOPHER ORR The Game That Twisted Time FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE When Square Enix revived its 1997 game Final Fantasy VII for a new cohort of players, the nostalgia for the original game's plot was hard-wired into it. Once again, you're an amnesiac ex-soldier hired to fight an omnipresent corporation. Once again, you're haunted by flashbacks and a mysterious brain fog. Yet the gamer's trip down memory lane takes a crucial detour as the final boss approaches -- and it becomes clear that he's aware of his defeat at the end of the original game, so he intends to bend the timeline to transform fate and evade his demise. Now allies, once doomed, survive; some battles, once won, are lost. What's really being remade in Remake is our own sense of chronology. As the story doubles back and flows upstream, our experience of the new game can't be separated from our recollections of the old one. How fitting that the game was released during a quarantine period that in limiting our physical space also compressed our sense of time. With our future murky and our present moment paused, we were left to steep in and obsess over past events, just like the game's protagonist. My biggest memory of Remake during quarantine wasn't playing it but watching my best friend, Ben, play it remotely over Twitch. Once the plot began to warp and turn on itself, its recursions and the hero's damaged memory seemed to mirror the experience of our own frozen, separated lives. How much time did the two of us spend together, alone, doing that? In recollection, I have no idea. -- FRANK GUAN The Uniform for Quarantine KIM KARDASHIAN'S SKIMS I admit it. I keep up with the Kardashians. So when Kim Kardashian told ambitious women to get your "ass up and work," I appreciated the irony. After all, the business that helped make her an advice-spouting billionaire is Skims -- a loungewear brand designed to be worn when you're not getting up to do anything at all. Skims began business near the end of 2019, selling shapewear to go under the clothes you wear out into the world, but by early 2020 Ms. Kardashian was pushing pajama sets that were perfect for staying at home. Sales quadrupled that year. "The pandemic hit and it was just selling out like crazy," she later told WWD. I was not exempt from its allure. In those early months of the pandemic, when I wasn't occupied with a fear of death, I spent my time pining for a tank top and shorts made of stretch bouclé yarn. Skims exemplified my longing to lounge, to take a breath -- but also my sadness that there seemed to be no reprieve from the hustle, even in a pandemic. Stuck at home, Ms. Kardashian reminded us, we were nonetheless expected to always be on, clad in designer loungewear we would need to keep grinding to afford. An ad from May 2020 shows Ms. Kardashian and her sister Khloe on the phone (read: socially distancing) and wearing clay masks. "What are you doing?" Kim asks. "Nothing, just lounging and wearing a mask," Khloe says. "I think that's the thing to do these days." They both laugh, lying around in their Skims, hard at work. -- JENNIFER WILSON The Schadenfreude Getaway 'THE WHITE LOTUS' "The White Lotus," Mike White's show about the idle wealthy and the people paid to pamper them, arrived like the "Fantasy Island" update we richly deserved. It offered twin pandemic satisfactions: an escape to a top-tier luxury resort and the chance to watch the slow torture of the kind of people who could afford that escape in real life. The show's premise was born of pandemic privations: Its first season, filmed at an otherwise shuttered Hawaiian resort, was conceived as a one-off workaround for Covid-related restrictions. But it struck such a nerve that it got a second season, this time in Sicily, with Mr. White once again combining the instincts of a high-end travel magazine editor and a sadistic satirist. "The White Lotus" was a necessary panacea, and a cleanse -- a round-trip ticket to a curdled world where social distancing referred to class, not germs. -- MARK HARRIS The Chance to Save the World PANDEMIC: THE GAME We cured the last disease before midmorning snack. My younger daughter, 6 years old, played the required yellow cards and her sister, 9, flipped over the corresponding token. I'm not sure I had ever before experienced such joy in my life. Playing the board game Pandemic in the early months of the actual pandemic occasioned such catharsis. Bounded by the dimensions of the board -- 23 inches by 16 inches -- the newfound danger in everyday things was temporarily suspended. Pandemic is a cooperative, tabletop game for two to four players, ages 8 and up. As part of a team of researchers, doctors and logistics experts, you work to eradicate four unnamed diseases before they take over the world. The game's creator, Matt Leacock, conceived it in the years after the 2003 SARS outbreak and before H1N1 in 2009 as "something that made your heart beat and got people working together." It's a game about losing control -- and gaining it back through collective effort. According to my Amazon order history, I purchased Pandemic on Sept. 8, 2019. I had hoped it would expand my daughters' gameplaying menu beyond Go Fish and Old Maid, but when I ripped off the cellophane and thumbed through the eight-page instruction manual, I figured it was just too involved. Then during the third week of lockdown, with my kids Zooming for school, my older daughter pulled Pandemic out of our game chest. I could think of lots of reasons not to play. Wouldn't it shatter the semblance of normality that my wife and I, like so many parents around the world, had fought to preserve for our children? Wasn't it trivializing all the suffering, all the death? "Dad, it's just a game!" my younger daughter said when I asked her if it would be too scary to play. So we played, and played again the next day, and again until it became a near-daily ritual. The instructions note that the typical game lasts 45 minutes, but ours would sometimes stretch well past an hour, as we moved around the board eradicating disease cubes along the vertexes connecting São Paulo with Lagos, Sydney with Los Angeles. Admittedly, we hacked things to serve our therapeutic purposes, choosing our roles rather than relying on the luck of the draw. My older daughter was nearly always the medic, swooping into cities and turning back the disease by her mere presence. My younger daughter, the scientist, would always find the cure. And I, the dispatcher (the least heroic role), helped both of them move more freely across the board. The analogy to parenting in the pandemic was inescapable: Weren't we all trying to get our children safely through while empowering them to find what freedom they could in the newly narrowed bands of their existence? Over the next year, our play went from once a day to once a week to once a month, then it stopped. But the game did its work. For my daughters and me, Pandemic expanded the expressive range of "pandemic," shading its meaning with hope, with comfort and with love. -- ADAM BRADLEY

Full text: I have spent the past few decades collecting what I consider to be a stylish wardrobe -- much of which is black. While I love black's versatility, I am starting to feel like I am in a rut, and would like to break out a bit. What can I do to change up my cherished uniform?
Sarah, New York City As someone who has likewise spent a lot of her life wearing black, I understand.
Black is one of those colors that contains within it multitudes. There's the black of Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. The black capris and T-shirt of Audrey Hepburn doing her weird modern dance in "Funny Face," and the long black Givenchy of Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The shredded, dancing-on-the-moors black of Stevie Nicks, and the black of Macbeth's witches.
There's the black that makes you think of the little black dress, which is always safe and elegant, and the black of the Beats, subversive and rebellious. There's sexy black and somber black and scary black. Also: mysterious black, because which one of the above are you? And: seductive black, because it allows you to choose among so many possible personas. Renoir called it "the queen of all colors." Dior called it "essential to a woman's wardrobe."
But, as with any defining choice, black can start to feel limiting; like a cliché or default, rather than a declaration of self. The problem is, when you have built your identity around one set of associations -- and have invested a fair amount of energy and your budget in it -- how do you expand your horizons without losing the core of your self or upending your wardrobe, neither of which are sustainable or practical?
Slowly. You'd be amazed how much small details make a difference.
Karla Welch, the stylist who works with Tracee Ellis Ross and Sarah Paulson and has a styling app, Wishi, says that a bright red lipstick or colored socks could make a difference. If magenta, the Pantone color of the year for 2023, seems like a step too far, add some T-shirts in basic shades like white. (As Coco Chanel said, "Black has it all. White, too. Their beauty is absolute. It is the perfect harmony.") But try camel, too, or even silver or jewel tones.
TikTok actually has a term for this: sandwich dressing. The idea being to pick a garment in what Ms. Welch calls "an accent color," and then (yes) sandwich it with black. For example, a T-shirt in blue under a black jacket with black pants. Or a beige skirt with a black top and black boots.
The net effect will still be mostly black -- it won't shock everyone who knows you -- but leavened with a bit of contrast. It's like inserting a tiny wedge in a wall that then expands over time to create a much larger space. And maybe a sense of possibility.

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France, the richest 10 percent hold nearly half of the country's wealth, and the growth of that share has outpaced that held by the rest of the population, according to the French statistics agency Insee. Wealth "remains very unevenly distributed among the population," the agency said.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Trend Pirouette: The Return of Ballet Flats: [Style Desk]

Full text: Six ideal pairs of one of the season's trendiest (but hardest to get right) shoes.
While there's no doubt that ballet flats are everywhere right now, the definition of what constitutes a ballet flat is somewhat elastic. Here are some helpful parameters to keep in mind when looking for a pair of your own:
They are roughly the shape of ballet slippers with a round toe. (This seems obvious, but there's a lot of room for error.) They can have a little heel but nothing higher than a half an inch. An open toe is a no. Straps are sometimes allowed, but anything too hefty or with a buckle turns a shoe into a Mary Jane. An elastic strap works (as on the extremely popular varieties from Miu Miu or, even better, the ones from the Row). And that's it.
Maybe you're not sure how to feel about the return of this trend. Maybe, like me, you went through a ballet-flat phase a couple of decades ago and thought you were done with them. Did you love the aggressively rounded toes? Did you, like Amy Winehouse, wear them so often they were the color of hot dog water? Did you often return from a day walking around in them only to wonder why flat shoes that seemed so practical were in fact deeply uncomfortable?
Do you want to try them again, but are not sure how?
The best advice, which you must try to heed, is to resist the siren song of dressing like a ballerina. I love leotards and tiny wrap sweaters as much as the next Balanchine devotee, but don't wear ballet flats with them. Ballet flats that look too much like pointe shoes or have attached ribbons come across as costume-y.
Anyone who was obsessed with "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" knows that shoes like this wear out easily. So while you may find secondhand eggplant-colored Dior ballet flats with a braid or chocolate brown suede Lilly Pulitzer ones with a champagne metallic trim, you will have to sort through a lot of really worn-out pairs.
When you find the right ballet flats for you, get a cobbler to put a slip resistant tread on the soles, which will give the shoes a longer life. While you're there, get a padded insole to make them a little easier to wear.
Chanel
It turns out ballet dancers do wear ballet flats. Jenelle Manzi, who dances with the New York City Ballet, said on Instagram that she "can't even look at" one popular brand, "mostly because I think about the poor bones in my feet, but I got the perfect pair of ballet flats in Paris last summer at Chanel."
If a ballerina endorsement doesn't move you, know that Chanel ballet flats look good with everything. Also, they have a cap toe, and sometimes the toe contrasts with the rest of the flat, like a black toe with a pastel tweed, or a navy toe with a blue-green leather body. This being Chanel, notorious for its low levels of stock, you have to go in person and see what is available in your size. If you find any crayon-style colors in a size 39 -- taxi yellow, bright blue -- call me immediately. ( $ 875)
Maison Margiela
Maison Margiela is known for its many variations of the split-toe tabi shoe. Its fans are devoted to the tabi boots, but I think the tabi ballet flat is the friendliest entry point into that world. My friend Kat pointed me to the satin ones. "They're the softest tabis (spiritually)," she texted. The colors are really incredible -- deep violet, dark sage green, chestnut brown -- and would look good with any kind of jeans, but even better with oversize tailored trousers and a loose oxford shirt. ( $ 345, from $ 690)
Khaite
Khaite makes ballet flats with studded with Swarovski crystals. The best are black satin with the crystals in a kind of harlequin pattern. The more elaborate and luxe the ballet flat, the better it looks dressed down. So wear these with track shorts in the summer and a white ribbed tank top and you'll be the coolest person at the grocery store. ( $ 980)
The Row
Ballet flats can look a little too preppy when worn with skirts and dresses. They need the structure and square toe of these satin ones from the Row. How good would the cranberry red pair look peeking out from under a long black dress at some kind of spring gala? The bonus is that this is the next most comfortable thing with the exception of socks to wear to a long party. ( $ 790)
Reike Nen
It's easy to take for granted the delicate bows of many ballet flats. They're just kind of there, looking perfect. This pair has an elongated toe box and a bow that hits the middle of the foot, instead of at the toe. "The Reikes are more substantial as a styling element," said Anna Gray, who owns Club Vintage in Manhattan, a South Street Seaport shop that sells this style. So even though they are as versatile as a black shoe should be, they are subtly more elegant. And slightly less innocent. And so are you! ( $ 280, from $ 350)
Mansur Gavriel
Mansur Gavriel makes ballet flats with a high vamp, which some people prefer to showing a lot of toe cleavage. They do all the basic colors (Repetto and Margaux and French Sole also have a range of great shades), but the most exciting version is made of raffia. With white linen pants? Or what about Pleats Please pants for a contrast of soft and natural meets futuristic? ( $ 395)

Seaweed Is Hot. Can It Thrive as Planet Warms?: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For centuries, it's been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: Those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.
Today, seaweed is suddenly a hot global commodity. It's attracting new money and new purpose in all kinds of new places because of its potential to help tame some of the hazards of the modern age, not least climate change.
In London, a start-up is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms, as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.
"Seaweed protagonists believe seaweed is a cure to everything, that seaweed is a magical panacea for climate problems," said David Koweek, chief scientist for Ocean Visions, a consortium of research organizations studying ocean-based interventions for the climate crisis. "Seaweed antagonists think seaweed is completely overhyped."
There's another problem. Seaweed is itself feeling the impact of climate change, particularly in Asia.
"The water is way too hot," said Sung-kil Shin, a third-generation seaweed farmer, as he pulled his boat into harbor one morning on Soando Island, just south of the South Korean mainland, where seaweed has long been foraged and farmed.
'Plastic' from seaweed
Pierre Paslier once made a living by designing plastic packages for cosmetics. It felt to him like "leasing out my brain to a big plastic polluter."
He wanted out. He wanted to create packaging that would come from nature and disappear into nature, quickly. With a friend from graduate school, Rodrigo García González, he created a company called NotPla, short for "not plastic."
From an East London warehouse, they designed an edible sachet of water, made of seaweed and other plant extracts: To drink the water you simply pop the sachet in your mouth. They designed another one that can hold ketchup and a third for cosmetics.
They also began making a seaweed-based coating for takeout cardboard boxes. Just Eat, a food delivery app in Britain, began using it for some of its orders, including at the European women's soccer finals in July at Wembley Stadium.
It's still niche. The seaweed coating, designed for home composting bins, is considerably more expensive than the plastic coating now used on most takeout boxes made of paper.
But Mr. Paslier is looking to the future. The European Union has a new law restricting single-use plastic. A global plastics treaty is under negotiation.
"Seaweed is not going to replace all plastic, but seaweed combined with other things can tackle single use plastic," he said. "We are barely scratching the surface."
Foragers from the past
In the gray light of dawn, Soon-ok Goh, a slight 71-year-old, swam soundlessly in the shallow waters of Gijang, on the southern coast of South Korea. Her feet were sheathed in yellow flippers, her thin, small frame in a wetsuit. She surfaced above water for a few seconds, took a long breath that sounded almost like a whistle in the quiet of the morning, then dived down again, yellow flippers upturned.
Ms. Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the 7th century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you're from.
For Alaska's Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it's been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 different species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that's believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul. "Seaweed helped people survive during famines," she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy arms race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessman in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land. Specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82 and 98 percent, according to several independent studies.
"The race is on, I suppose, to get the world's first commercial supply," Mr. Meller said. "The demand is off-the-roof scale."
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben and Jerry's is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis start-up.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there's another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry's ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Mr. Shin's boat pulls in with the morning's harvest.
Mr. Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Mr. Shin says, the water isn't as cold as Pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. "People want more seaweed these days," he said. "But there's no more seaweed."
Since 1968, the waters where Mr. Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That's why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
"It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care," said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. "We shouldn't expect seaweed to save us."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Everything Everywhere All at Once" may have been the big winner of the 95th Academy Awards, a vote by the industry for idiosyncrasy in the face of corporate moviemaking, but on the red -- whoops, sorry, champagne -- carpet, classicism ruled.
Its color may have changed, reportedly in an effort to inject some modernity into the arrivals/runway show portion of the evening (Oh, Jennifer Connelly, a Louis Vuitton ambassador, in Louis Vuitton? What a surprise!), but its ethos hasn't, that much.
Except ... except: Just as the triumph of "Everything" may offer a new way forward for filmmaking, a select few Oscar attendees eschewed predictability for some quirkier, more emotive choices, and in doing so added a touch of zest to the familiar old recipe. Rather than act as an advertising vehicle for a brand, they seemed more like co-conspirators, moving beyond the safety of promotion to expose some personal style. It's riskier (kind of like a movie about the multiverse featuring an everything bagel) but also more engaging to see.
There was Rihanna, for example, making her entrance fashionably late in a leather Alaia bra and long leather bandage skirt that opened and closed at the hips like some sort of super-glamorous armor, worn over a sheer body suit, the better to bare her pregnant belly. And that was just for openers. She changed into a Maison Margiela Art Deco-like silver beaded top and silver brocade pants to perform her nominated song "Lift Me Up," and then changed again, into a mint-green Bottega Veneta bias-cut silk skirt and matching stole, for afters: a play in pregnancy style in three acts and three brands where she -- and her stomach -- retained the starring role.
No one else swapped outfits with quite the same alacrity, but she wasn't the only one who brought some subversive attitude and private storytelling to the party.
Florence Pugh showed up in a Valentino strapless ocean of taffeta bedsheets with billowing sleeve-clouds attached to each elbow -- that parted in the center, like Moses, to reveal very abbreviated black bike shorts beneath, with a little pocket on the side for extra insouciance. (For anyone who remembers the Demi Moore self-designed bike short Oscar gown of 1989, this is the evolved version.)
Harry Shum Jr. got Adeam to custom-make him a white smoking jacket piped in midnight blue, wrapped in an obi-like belt to represent, he said -- after doing a little soft shoe shuffle -- "East meets West." Hong Chau, of "The Whale," asked Prada to add a mandarin collar to her shell pink gown to represent, she said, her roots. And Malala Yousafzai, an executive producer of the short film "Stranger at the Gate," in silver sequined Ralph Lauren with an integral hood/head scarf, demonstrated that high glamour and cultural values were not oppositional entities.
It was a reminder of the bigger context around these moments of shared pop culture escapism, which may also help explain the preponderance of white, by far the most popular color of the evening, and one that calls to mind fresh starts and peace, among other associations. (That's one way to read it anyway; "Navalny" did win for best documentary, and assorted attendees were wearing blue ribbons to stand #WithRefugees.) See Michelle Yeoh, whose precedent-setting best actress win will also make her swan-like Dior gown a part of Hollywood history, and, perhaps, usher in a new era. Also Mindy Kaling, in corseted Vera Wang, the boning exposed; Rooney Mara, wrapped in Alexander McQueen mist; Emily Blunt in a strapless Valentino column; and Paul Mescal in a Gucci white dinner jacket with extra-wide lapels.
In a show of true "I wore it first" power, Lady Gaga's Versace came straight from that brand's Los Angeles runway show the Thursday night before the Oscars, trumped in the statement-making stakes only by her expectation-defying and entirely nonbranded (nonbranded!) switcheroo into a washed-out black T-shirt and ripped jeans to perform. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman's one-armed sequined Armani had asymmetric oompf, and Elizabeth Olsen's backless Givenchy offered a little slithery fringe as a finale. As for Danai Gurira, her Jason Wu gown was understated elegance incarnate.
Then there were the princess gowns: acres of tulle modeled by Sofia Carson in white Giambattista Valli, Stephanie Hsu in Valentino, and Halle Bailey in sea-foam green Dolce & Gabbana. Such fairy-tale frippery is an undeniable red carpet cliché, but at least when it came to Ms. Bailey, the look was also a clever nod to her role as Ariel, a.k.a. the Little Mermaid, in the upcoming film; a bit of strategic movie-marketing magic and a fashion double entendre that took the dress to a whole different level. (Also, let's be grateful for small favors: A princess gown trumps the even more tired cliché of a mermaid gown every time. At least the wearer can walk.)
The move that deserves the most applause, both from a personal style and point-making perspective, however, is the embrace of vintage. Ms. Mara's McQueen hailed from a 2008 collection; Winnie Harlow stepped out in Armani circa 2005; Vanessa Hudgens wore old Chanel; and Cate Blanchett appeared in a Louis Vuitton top with jutting shoulders that had been unearthed from the archives, paired with a bias-cut sustainable silk skirt for a serious Joan Crawford vibe.
If the awards show circuit has become in part a piece of promotional fashion content, this was a potent reminder that the attention paid to what everyone wears can actually be used for a higher purpose than just promoting new stuff. Unlike the decision to swap the carpet's color, the reworn looks actually made the de facto catwalk seem relevant.

For centuries, it’s been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.

And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed-growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
What was mainly a relatively small Asian industry is now coveted by the West. Far beyond South Korea, new farms have cropped up in Maine, the Faeroe Islands, Australia, even the North Sea. Globally, seaweed production has grown by nearly 75% in the past decade. The focus is moving far beyond its traditional use in cuisine.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.

Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the seventh century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
Her grandmother taught her the trade, Goh said, which is known as haenyeo, or the “sea women.” She has been diving since she was 9 years old. “People who do this kind of work are disappearing,” she said. “When I’m done, no one will do it.” With demand rising, old practices are getting pushed into the past.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you’re from.
For Alaska’s Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it’s been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that’s believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul, South Korea. “Seaweed helped people survive during famines,” she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy Arms Race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessperson in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land — specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82% and 98%, according to several independent studies. Cattle burps are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
“The race is on, I suppose, to get the world’s first commercial supply,” Meller said. “The demand is off-the-roof scale.”
His company, named CH4, after methane’s chemical formula, is competing to bring asparagopsis to the mouths of cows. At least two other Australian startups, Sea Forest and Rumin8, are in the seaweed-for-cattle race. So are Symbrosia and Blue Ocean Barns, both in Hawaii.
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben & Jerry’s is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis startup.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there’s another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry’s ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate Pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Shin’s boat pulls in with the morning’s harvest.
Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Shin said, the water isn’t as cold as pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. “People want more seaweed these days,” he said. “But there’s no more seaweed.”
Since 1968, the waters where Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That’s why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
“It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care,” said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. “We shouldn’t expect seaweed to save us.”

Last year, their work transported audiences to Paris and to Graceland, to an underwater kingdom, to parallel dimensions with googly-eyed rocks and hot dog fingers — and to the decadent depths of 1920s Hollywood.
Throughout their careers, the five nominees for this year’s Oscar for costume design have dressed dozens of movie stars and entire armies of extras, collectively picking up eight Academy Awards along the way. So what happens when they turn their expert eyes inward and become the main characters for an evening?
“There’s a decision that we have to make: whether or not we go outside to a big fashion designer,” said Ruth E. Carter, speaking from Los Angeles a few days before the ceremony. “Or we say: We have the resources. We have the know-how. We have the ability to make beautiful fashions that we can actually adorn ourselves in and be comfortable in, and represent ourselves. So that’s what I’m doing. I’m representing myself.”
In 2019, Carter became the first Black designer to win the Oscar for costume design, taking home the award for “Black Panther.” This year, she is nominated for her work on the sequel, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Carter said she planned to wear two outfits Sunday night, and that one of her looks — a white-toned dress with beadwork — was a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, the star of “Black Panther” who died from cancer in 2020.
“If I were to be thematic about who I am on the red carpet, I feel like I’m somebody real that represents Afro-future because of who I am,” she said. To realize her vision, she enlisted cutters Tamara Cobus and Rory Cunningham. (In the film world, a cutter makes patterns and cuts, fits and constructs garments based on a costume designer’s sketches.)
Jenny Beavan — who won the Oscar last year, for “Cruella” — and Mary Zophres went a similar route with their Oscars outfits, working with industry friends and collaborators to bring their own visions to life, dressing themselves as they might dress a character.
For Beavan, that meant using her Oscars ensemble to pay homage to the title character of her film, “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,” and assuming an awards-season uniform of sorts. In the film, Mrs. Harris is a London house cleaner whose passion for a Dior dress takes her on a journey to Paris to buy a designer gown of her own. Beavan’s planned Oscars outfit, which she also wore to the BAFTAs and the Costume Designers Guild Awards, is “a homage to a cleaning lady” with a “nod to Dior,” she said, and was made by a friend, cutter Tim Perkins. It features a polka-dot pinafore and headband as well as a feather duster, which she “thought would be a fun accessory, to go around sort of dusting people down.”
Zophres, who is nominated for her work on “Babylon,” said that she planned to wear a dress of her own design, cut by José Bello. “This way, you’re never going to be wearing something that someone else is going to be on the carpet in,” Zophres said. She described her Oscars dress as a fuchsia pink, in a shade similar to that of a two-piece suit she wore to the nominees luncheon last month. “It’s a fun dress,” she said, adding that it was “danceable and energized.”
Shirley Kurata and Catherine Martin went in a different direction with their Oscars looks, ceding the reins to fashion designers.
In an email, Kurata said she planned to wear custom Rodarte. In studying Oscars looks through the years, she was especially drawn to a sequined Arnold Scaasi outfit that Barbra Streisand wore in 1969, and took that as inspiration for her own dress. Kurata added that her dress was hand-sewn and red, to nod to a “dominant color” in her film, “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
“It is also a color in the Chinese culture that symbolizes luck, joy and happiness, which also mirror the feelings I have about the movie and my Oscar look,” she wrote.
In an interview, Martin said that she and her husband, director Baz Luhrmann, would wear Prada on Sunday. Martin, who is nominated for her work on “Elvis,” said that she loved the feeling of, “on a special occasion, not having to make my own outfit.”
“That feels like a treat, not work,” she said.
“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve got more and more comfortable with being part of the celebration and being happy to be at the dance with everyone else and less self-conscious — less feeling like I’m a backstage person and should just be wearing a black pantsuit,” Martin said. She added that she planned to wear two looks for the evening: an embellished print dress for the ceremony and a sequined pajama for the after-party.
“My theory about costumes is they’re all clothes,” she said. “However fanciful or removed from reality an outfit is, even in a movie, it still needs to be clothes. I think that costumes are clothes and clothes are costumes, and in a sense we costume ourselves every day.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Season For Intimate Encounters: [Style Desk]

Full text: Dries Van Noten and Olivier Rousteing of Balmain get personal.
PARIS -- For so long (even, maybe especially, after the brief Covid hiatus) so much of fashion has been focused on being big -- big shows, big sets, big stars, big followings, big growth -- that to talk about intimacy, about being small, can seem new.
It's not, of course: The clothes we put on, which literally touch our skin, have always been among our most personally resonant belongings, repositories of individual history, even as they also make public statements. It's just that recently the public statements (or made-for-selfie statements) have been so overwhelming that they tended to drown out any other idea.
Yet there they were, both Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, a brand built on Kardashian and Jenner-size ambition and bombast, and Dries Van Noten, king of the emotive gesture, name-checking the preciously personal.
Intimacy with clothing is the emotional flip side of the popular term "wearable," which is fast going from being a synonym for boring to a laudable adjective suggestive of smart thinking about daily life. It started in New York with Proenza Schouler, continued in Milan at Prada and Bottega Veneta. So the fashion hamster wheel turns.
Maybe it has to do with the general horror at megalomania and global domination -- by companies or countries. Maybe it's social media fatigue. Maybe it has to do with an appreciation of the human, in the face of war. There's a lot of grimness so far in Paris fashion; a lot of black and gray on the runway, creating a sense of looming austerity. At Undercover, Jun Takahashi even included little skeletal hands on his suiting, like phantoms rising from the grave (also the lyrics, from The Specials' 1980 cover version of the 1949 song "Enjoy Yourself": "Enjoy yourself/It's later than you think," scripted on the backs of jackets).
Or maybe that's all over-egging it and it's just about self-justification. Maybe a better way of thinking about intimacy: the return is another way of talking about sustainability, which has otherwise unfortunately disappeared from the fashion conversation (possibly because the environmental impact of brands is being considered in actual practice, though by all reports not as effectively as needed). Still, it's increasingly clear there's a divide between those paying lip service to an idea and those actually thinking it through.
Or, in Mr. Van Noten's case, designing it through. His guiding principle being that clothes should be valued and loved until they are worn out -- and then repaired and loved some more. That they should not be disposable. That in not just the making, but the wearing, they contain volumes.
Designers tend to go on and on about the touch of the hand and the value of artisanal creation, and those have meaning, unquestionably. It's part of what you pay for when you buy high-end fashion. What they talk about less is what happens after, when the clothes become part of a life. Yet that may be the most priceless part of the experience, and that's what Mr. Van Noten was honoring.
"For me, it's really the opposite of wanting to show off with the garments," he said backstage in the gargantuan amphitheater where he held his show. "It's really things which for you personally are important." Or become personally important.
That meant a focus, above all, on fabrics: rich and plain, masculine and feminine, tough and fragile. A bit of silk, handwoven and hand-painted, patchworked onto the hem of a skirt and then laid under a scrim of chiffon, worn with a gray jacket. Some gold leaf, painted to resemble a corset onto the waist of a camel wool coat. A pinstripe bustier, stitched in gleaming thread and worn with an easy pantsuit, the jacket fraying at the edges. It was make do and mend, the British wartime mantra, dashed with a bit of 1930s drama and raised to the nth degree. Klimtian luxe meets wabi-sabi. Redolent with imagination about how such pieces might be worn.
That's what was missing from the Balmain collection, despite Mr. Rousteing's stated determination to pull back from his megashows.
This time he swapped the stadium of his previous show, which had also involved an appearance by Cher and 7,000 guests (a.k.a., his Balmain army), for 220 guests and a living room setup with low white couches snaking their way around a room. And this time he was talking backstage about a return to original Balmain principles, back in 1945. "I think we are going through a moment in fashion where people need to remember what fashion is about," he said. "It's about quality, it's about timelessness. It's not about hype." That for him, the show and its approach were the start of "a new chapter," the "new me." A focus on craft.
Sounds good. Except that Mr. Rousteing seemed to translate craft as a lot of structure and more than a bit of bling. Just because it comes in a 1950s silhouette (also a theme at Dior), and to the tune of Frank Sinatra crooning a very on-the-nose "My Way," doesn't change the actual effect. Think a quilted, silver shoulder-framing jacket, plunging to the clavicle in front and gleaming with sequins, over cigarette pants. Sweetheart necklines, peplums and full skirts dotted with gobstopper pearls. More pearls -- pearls galore. A tea dress entirely encrusted in rhinestones. Turned out it was the space, not the clothes, that got small.
On Instagram, it was probably fabulous. Close-up, it was blinding.

Full text: Emily's not in Paris this season, that's for sure.
PARIS -- Emily's not in Paris any more. Her Disneyfied, funfair version of French style, the kind that created its own mini culture war, has been banished by the names -- Dior, Saint Laurent --- that once defined the term.
You want that mythic thing known as French chic; that chimera that answers the Quixotian quest of How To Dress? Fine, here it is in great, sometimes bombastic, style. After all, it's part of the soul of the nation. Cherchez la femme.
At Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri did, riding a time slip back to the postwar 1950s to Edith Piaf and Juliette Gréco and Catherine Dior, a sister of Christian and a resistance fighter-turned-florist. Patsies none of them. But this is not the 1950s of Hollywood cliché; not happy housewives or bullet bras or even the very structured New Look of Dior himself. We're in a different world now.
In case you missed it, there was a hint in the cavernous show space in the Tuileries, undulating overhead, courtesy of the bulbous, many-tentacled soft sculpture in flowers, beads and fabric by the Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos, twinkling with its own phosphorescence, vaguely suggestive of an alien life form or the female reproductive system or the multiverse (or all of the above).
This is the darker, tougher '50s; the '50s "destructured" -- Ms. Chuiri's words, at a preview. Think destroy, but for the boning and corsetry that once constrained and shaped the body, so that what is left is the suggestion of a shape with none of its corresponding limitations.
In a collection done almost entirely in black and white, Ms. Chiuri crumpled and crushed her way forward. Button-up shirts with the sleeves rolled up were worn with midi-skirts (full, pleated, pencil), all of them woven with Inox, a metallic thread that allows the material to be crinkled at will, so it looked as if it had just been pulled out of the memory bank. Peacoats had a bit of a fillip at the back; jackets, just a bit of Poirot-like padding; gingham and leopard and Watteau florals, a faded kind of glory.
Above all, it looked easy -- to wear, to understand -- which is not the same thing as uncomplicated. The belts that went with almost every outfit, a little black grosgrain ribbon with "Christian Dior" in white at the back, had been made on a 19th-century loom reworked so the logo could be woven into the fabric, rather than embroidered on. But then, casual perfection is part of the point (though it could have been made even more succinctly in 35 looks instead of the 96). It's what elevates the basic from the banal. See one spectacular leather skirt speckled with an entire garden of three-dimensional leather blooms.
At the end, amid a bunch of strapless César awards dresses embedded with jet beads that sparkled under the spotlights like fairy lights, came a T-shirt woven with the words "Je ne regrette rien" ("I regret nothing") under a crinkled skirt suit spotted with tiny rhinestones. Wear that, Emily.
Or take Saint Laurent, where the designer Anthony Vaccarello went back, not to the '50s but to the '80s era of power dressing extraordinaire. In a black box under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, he recreated the ballroom of the InterContinental hotel where Mr. Saint Laurent used to hold his couture shows, complete with grandiose gold chandeliers and a raised runway carpeted in moire, and then offered up an ode to ... shoulder pads.
To the woman as inverted triangle, with those battering-ram-size shoulders in a variety of jackets -- pinstripe, Prince of Wales, aviator, velvet -- narrowing down to pencil skirts narrowing down to the needle-sharp stiletto points, all worn with sunglasses at night.
Because, you know, he can.
Like Ms. Chiuri Mr. Vaccarello works with a very limited sartorial vocabulary, the better to distill his idea of the perfect line: jacket after jacket over a tank top that plunges into a deep U; some skinny sweatpant leggings; and a whole lot of scarves, sometimes tied into a pussy bow at the throat and then floating behind like a train, sometimes swathed all around the torso and caught up on one shoulder with a hunk of gold hardware.
As a look, the silhouette is a fashion equivalent of the power pose, though also a cliché, albeit one erring on the side of Robert Palmer fantasy rather than frivolity; one that treats the subject (women) like an object in a photograph. After all, it's hard to be a real power player if you are reduced to tottering along on tenterhooks because your heels are too high and your skirt is too tight and you are worried about your breasts falling out of your top.
On the other hand, the cashmere sweat-leggings (sweggings?) paired with a blanket-size piece of velvet or chiffon draped around the torso and trailing to the side, offered an alluringly modern way to get dressed up. You could imagine them draped languidly over a sofa at Raspoutine as the sun rose. They just exuded that certain -- well, je ne sais quoi.

Louis Vuitton Turns to Pharrell Williams: [Style Desk]

Full text: The rapper and music producer will succeed Virgil Abloh and "lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter," the brand said in a statement.
The fashion and entertainment industries, which have long been intertwined, converged even further on Tuesday when Louis Vuitton named Pharrell Williams, the American rapper and producer, as its new creative director for men's wear.
The French luxury brand announced on Instagram that it had hired Mr. Williams about 16 months after the sudden death of its previous men's wear designer, Virgil Abloh, in 2021. Mr. Williams, the brand said in a statement, "is a visionary whose creative universes expand from music to art, and to fashion -- establishing himself as a cultural global icon."
Other names floated as successors to Mr. Abloh have included the British designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose, as well as the American designers Telfar Clemens and Colm Dillane, better known as KidSuper, who last month was announced as Louis Vuitton's first ever men's wear guest designer, a sign many took to mean that he had been tapped to follow Mr. Abloh.
But it was ultimately Mr. Williams, 49, who landed what is considered one of the most high-profile creative director roles in men's fashion. His appointment was the first major move by Louis Vuitton's new chief executive, Pietro Beccari, who joined the brand from Dior last month.
Mr. Williams, who was the first male ambassador for Chanel, has worked off and on with Louis Vuitton since 2004. More recently, he entered into a collaboration with the jeweler Tiffany & Company, which with Louis Vuitton is part of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. During the January men's wear shows in Paris, Mr. Williams was seldom without his pair of diamond-studded Tiffany & Company sunglasses, which he also wore to the Grammys. His first collection for Louis Vuitton will be shown in June at Men's Fashion Week in Paris.
"I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new men's artistic director," Mr. Beccari said in the brand's statement on Instagram. "His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter."
Mr. Williams's return to Louis Vuitton is also a return to men's wear design. Earlier this century, he created influential streetwear brands like Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream in partnership with the Japanese designer Nigo (who is now the artistic director at Kenzo, which is also owned by LVMH).
Still, Mr. Williams's appointment to the pinnacle of high-end ready-to-wear underscores an apparent trend among luxury goods makers: to put their futures in the hands of multi-hyphenate celebrities, not designers by profession. Other high-profile entertainers to be embraced by luxury fashion in recent years include Rihanna, whose Fenty clothing line in partnership with LVMH shuttered in 2021, and the troubled rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, who became a fixture at fashion weeks around the world.
Spectacle is now a given at runway shows: The recent Louis Vuitton men's wear event in Paris, for instance, featured astonishingly expensive sets, a front row studded with stars from the worlds of K-Pop, Hollywood and hip-hop, and a supercharged performance by the Spanish singer Rosalía, who sang from atop a souped-up car.
Louis Vuitton, which was founded in 1854, is the cornerstone of the fortune amassed by LVMH's founder and chief executive Bernard Arnault, who was recently ranked the world's richest person. While men's wear constitutes a relatively modest percentage of overall revenue for the brand, it remains a source of optimism as the fastest growing sector in a luxury goods industry that continues to struggle against headwinds induced by the global pandemic and the loss of markets in both China and Russia.

Full text: WHO DOES THAT BITCH THINK SHE IS? Doris Fish and the Rise of Drag, by Craig Seligman
From wee-hours cabaret to prime-time reality TV to fiercely contended children's story hour at the local library, the American drag queen's journey has been a long and bumpy one.
For Doris Fish, alter ego of Philip Clargo Mills, it began not in America but Manly Vale, an apt-sounding suburb of Sydney, Australia, and ended in AIDS-ravaged San Francisco, 1991 -- with resurrection, one source maintains, as a ghost composed variously of golden sparks and Evian water.
I had not known of Fish before reading the journalist Craig Seligman's minutely observed new biography of him (though some friends used the female pronoun, "he never wanted to be a woman -- he never even wanted to seem like a woman," the author writes). I finished it persuaded this was a life well worth examining, if only because his peers are so often celebrated, or excoriated, in aggregate.
Most of Fish's performances are unrecoverable, but those that can be scratched up are indelible. Best known, in a limited way, is probably "Vegas in Space," a posthumously released and deeply weird 1991 sci-fi comedy about male earthlings who undergo sex-change operations so they can travel to a female-only planet (something about recovering stolen jewels...).
Promoting the movie during its production period on a Pittsburgh morning show in 1986, Fish gamely endures being treated like a talking zoo animal by the gawking hosts and awkwardly grinning housewives. There's also a choppy video out there of his swan song, "This Is My Life," fervidly performed in a caftan and satin gloves at the benefit from which the book takes its name. He was months from death.
Born in 1952, Philip was a middle child of six in a tolerant Catholic family that permitted a marijuana plant on the premises. He played a high-kicking chorus girl under a priest's tutelage at his all-boy school's year-end musical with more enthusiasm than most of his classmates. Remarkably indifferent to the prospect of arrest or social censure, he joined a local troupe called Sylvia and the Synthetics whose outré antics had me scrawling exclamation points in the margins.
One female impersonator's considerable male member was tucked through his legs to simulate a tail. Another pinned back her hair with swastikas. Another bit into a dripping sheep's heart to punctuate a lovelorn ballad, blood dripping onto her ball gown like one of the less tasteful Valentine's Day bitmojis. There were flash mobs of Marilyn Monroe impersonators and teetering pyramids of performers on quaaludes. "Everything was permitted," Seligman writes dryly, "including ineptitude."
After working for the Florence Broadhurst wallpaper factory, from which he filched metallic powders for his cosmetics, Philip/Doris moved to San Francisco, money sewn into his pockets by his loving mother, Mildred, and found his true calling. Mostly this was what was then called prostitution, though in Fish's hands it seems more like a kind of sexual nursing. He specialized in relations with those society often rejected, the obese or infirm. (There was a green-card marriage to a lesbian, one of the few survivors of his circle who declined to be interviewed here.)
He acted as "comedy model" for a greeting-card company called West Graphic, portraits that Seligman compares to the work of Cindy Sherman. He wrote a popular column for The San Francisco Sentinel, then an essential gay weekly. And he performed in a group called Sluts a-Go-Go, emulating faded stars of the '30s and '40s while occasionally brushing up against rising ones (Robin Williams, Lynda Carter). The Sluts and their associates were equal-opportunity offenders, doing racial as well as gender impressions, spewing double entendre and sometimes seeming to positively assault their audiences with sensory overload, exaggerated glamour and flagrant disregard for safety codes.
Though revolutionary in his in-your-faceness, Fish was not particularly political; the sincerity such activity requires was anathema. One of the more intriguing aspects of his foreshortened life was an attitude described here as Romantic Cruelism: a pose of complete indifference or dark humor even in the face of tragedy.
Fish displays it when his parents divorce; when a younger sister dies after a mysterious illness; and when one Synthetic, who had been a childhood friend, perishes in a fire: "Burnt to a cinder in a room full of exotic drag. All they found was a tooth," as Spurt!, a local punk zine, callously memorialized. "The young don't know what to do with endings," Seligman writes, and there were so many more to come.
"Who Does That Bitch Think She Is?" revisits and draws from a 1986 profile of Fish that Seligman wrote for skittish editors at Image magazine, a weekend section of The San Francisco Examiner. Aside from overuse of the words "notoriety" and "notorious," it is confidently written, wistful and quite personal; Seligman's now-husband, Silvana Nova, was part of Fish's scene.
The author of a previous book comparing Pauline Kael and Susan Sontag, Seligman diverts here and there to Sontag's "Notes on 'Camp,"' but spends most of his time simply retracing Fish's footsteps. At times these seem akin to the old Hans Christian Andersen version of "The Little Mermaid," whose heroine is granted the power to walk out of the water, but only with the pain of swords going through her. (In one parade, Fish's elaborate costume included fiberglass "legs" that drew blood from his own, covering the stains with black tights.)
Seligman's own stance is mostly one of wary wonderment, that drag queens have gone from "totally beyond the pale" to mainstream acknowledgment, "from feared freak into object of fascination," from the shaky spotlight to -- however contentiously -- the kindergarten rug. He piles a lot of historical weight on Fish's shoulders, but his subject carries it like Joan Crawford in a padded Adrian frock.

Paco Rabanne, Mystical Couturier of the Space Age, Is Dead at 88: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He burst onto the French fashion scene in 1966 and, with dresses made from metal, plastic and paper, changed the definition of couture.
Paco Rabanne, the Spanish designer whose futuristic creations gave shape to the dreams of the space age and redefined couture, died on Friday in Portsall, France. He was 88.
His death was confirmed by Puig, the luxury group that owns the brand. No cause was given.
"Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic," Jose Manuel Albesa, the president of the beauty and fashion division at Puig, said in a statement. "Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women to clamor for dresses made of plastic and metal?"
Mr. Rabanne's career was a moon shot unto itself. He burst onto the French fashion scene in 1966 with a collection called "Manifesto: 12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials" and chain-link minidresses composed of hundreds of plastic and metal disks. Three years later he introduced his first perfume, called Calandre (the name means "car grill"), which became the basis of a fragrance empire.
He costumed Jane Fonda in the 1968 sci-fi film "Barbarella," eschewed needles and thread for pliers (he once said that "sewing is slavery") and made chain mail into a fabric. Experimentation and scent were the twin pillars on which his brand was built. They made his name resonate far beyond the salons of Avenue Montaigne and would go on to influence the work and business plans of generations of designers.
In ranging wide over new frontiers in fashion, Mr. Rabanne also explored some equally far-out beliefs. He believed he had seen God three times, been visited by aliens and had numerous previous lives, including one in which he was a prostitute during the reign of Louis XV and one in which he murdered Tutankhamen. He predicted that the Russian space station Mir would fall on Paris. The New York Times once described him as "futurist, couturier, mystic, madman, Dadaist, sculptor, architect, astrologer, perfumer, artist and prophet."
Salvador Dalí simply called him the second genius of Spain.
In 1997, Mr. Rabanne published a book entitled "Journey: From One Life to Another." But, in fact, his own life was an epic unto itself.
Francisco Rabaneda y Cuervo was born on Feb. 18, 1934, in Pasajes, near San Sebastián, Spain; he later adopted Paco Rabanne because it was 11 letters long, which he thought was a felicitous number. His father was a colonel who was executed during the Spanish Civil War, and in 1939 his mother, the head of tailoring for the designer Cristóbal Balenciaga, fled with her young son to France.
Mr. Rabanne studied architecture at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, but was attracted to fashion because it was less restrictive. He paid for his studies by designing jewelry and buttons for couturiers like Christian Dior and selling sketches to Charles Jourdan.
It was his embrace of unconventional materials, however, that would make his name, and his perfumes that would finance it.
His couture debut in 1966, complete with hair by Vidal Sassoon, shocked the French fashion world. "They were shivering in terror!" Mr. Rabanne told The Times. "It was difficult for them because they saw clothes that they couldn't understand."
Still, his clothes struck a chord with American fashion editors as well as celebrities, and they were soon being worn by Françoise Hardy, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin.
He continued to innovate, creating a collection of paper dresses held together by multicolored Scotch tape in 1967, the year The Times credited him with establishing "a new kind of awesome chic." He later included Velcro, aluminum and fiberglass in his work. Coco Chanel dismissed him as "a metal worker," but, he explained, "I wanted to turn women into modern warriors."
His clothes represented the possibility of escaping gravity, in all meanings of the word. As he told The Times, "Man hasn't changed his uniform for 100 years." But, he said, "Women have been freed."
His imaginative approach attracted the attention of filmmakers, and he was enlisted as a costume designer for movies, including Jean-Luc Godard's "Two or Three Things I Know About Her" and William Klein's "Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?"
It also caught the eye of Puig, which helped Mr. Rabanne introduce his first scent, Calandre. Like his fashion, Calandre was a combination of disparate elements that were not supposed to work together but, in his hands, did.
It was followed four years later by Paco Rabanne Pour Homme, which gave rise to a veritable flood of scents, including Metal, La Nuit, Sport and XS. In 1981, he introduced home furnishings; in 1983, a ready-to-wear line for men; in 1990, women's ready-to-wear. At one point he had signed 140 licenses.
Mr. Rabanne retired in 1999, though Puig continued to release new fragrances under his brand, most famously 1 Million, which he had helped create. The company temporarily put the ready-to-wear line on hiatus, only to revive it in 2011 under the creative direction of Manish Arora, followed by Lydia Maurer and then by Julien Dossena, the current designer, who took over in 2014.
Information on his survivors was not immediately available.
The author of a number of books about his paranormal beliefs, including "Has the Countdown Begun? Through Darkness to Enlightenment" (1994) and "The Dawn of the Golden Age: A Spiritual Design for Living" (1999), Mr. Rabanne was made an officer of the Legion of Honor in 2010. The London Museum of Design named his 1969 Skyline chain-link bag one of "50 Bags that changed the world."
"I know that I will always have a place in the history of fashion," Mr. Rabanne once said. "I am in all of the dictionaries because I introduced new materials to the world of fashion. To have created the first dresses in metal, paper, molded plastic -- that is my legacy."

Full text: PARIS -- With temperatures in the city below or near freezing last week, the scenes outside the men's wear shows, which finished on Sunday, offered lessons in the art of dressing warmly.
Balaclavas covered lots of heads, and many bodies were draped in long overcoats. The most exciting coats offered glimpses of their wearers' personality through patches, patterns or prints, like the brown, blue and red checks covering a certain Comme des Garçons overcoat spotted more than once. And pink, which was in abundance on the streets in Milan, reappeared in Paris, though in softer, less saturated tones that suggested it could be as versatile as navy, beige or any other neutral.

Discord in Couture's Wild Kingdom: [Style Desk]

Full text: Fake fur at Schiaparelli, a menagerie at Chanel and an ode to Josephine Baker at Dior.
PARIS -- Ten a.m. on a frigid Monday morning, the first day of the couture shows, and Kylie Jenner was strutting through the marble halls of the Petit Palais trying to find her seat for Schiaparelli, shoehorned into spiky stilettos and a black velvet one-arm gown, a full-size tawny lion's head jutting from the side. It was as if Aslan had taken a break from Narnia and stuck his muzzle through a time-space continuum under her armpit. Or maybe it was Take Your Stuffed Toy to Work Day?
Nope: It was a dress so hot off the runway it hadn't even appeared on the runway yet -- though it was about to, along with a strapless faux-fur sheath with a snow leopard head jutting from the bust, its mouth open in mid-roar, and a big, hairy black silk and wool coat with a wolf's snout emerging from the shoulder.
Painstakingly sculpted from resin, painted by hand in the couture atelier, the faux animal heads were supposed to represent the vices of Dante's "Inferno" -- lust, pride, avarice -- according to the Schiaparelli designer Daniel Roseberry. He used the poem as something of a metaphor for his own experience with the pressure to create the new; to make everyone sit up in wonder.
To carve out a space in the attention economy. If social media and the red carpet are the fire of fame, Mr. Roseberry said, couture has become fashion's "gasoline": pour it on top and the conflagration gets ever hotter. It is "culture-making," he said. Or outrage stirring. These days, the two ideas can seem one and the same (file them under "provocation").
So the fake animal heads collided with real animal rights and Jenner/Kardashian mores, and for a time the explosion swallowed the digisphere whole. Were the looks promoting big game hunting, even though they didn't come from nature, or were they celebrating the beauty of the wild, as PETA declared, and facilitating "an anti-trophy-hunting dialogue"? Were they actually a metaphor for going after the rich -- hunting them, eating them, selling to them -- or were they a gimmick gone wrong?
Objectively, they were kind of silly, and the whole hoo-ha verged on the surreal (which makes sense for Schiaparelli, a house rooted in surrealism). But in their viral ubiquity, they also set the tone for the week, and the shows that unspooled thereafter.
Not just because Chanel also had an animal theme, courtesy of the artist Xavier Veilhan, who created a giant movable plywood bestiary for the set, in reference to Coco's favored menagerie. But because the drive to capture not just hearts and minds but eyeballs may explain the designer Virginie Viard's otherwise puzzling addition of circus-master bow ties and top hats to her flirty bouclé skirt suits; narrow, floor-sweeping coats; and drop-waist chiffon and feather frocks.
Also the upscaling of Giambattista Valli's rose-colored taffeta and tulle creations, which resembled nothing so much as sugar plum fairies on steroids. Maybe even Giorgio Armani's 77 iterations of harlequins.
Once upon a time the couture was a closed world -- that teeny tiny segment of fashion designed to showcase the art of the handmade, ruled by arcane requirements and priced so high it was accessible only by the very few: the apocryphal 200 global clients who were willing to pay the equivalent of an entry-level annual salary (and up) for a dress most of the world would never see. The price justified by artistry, know-how and the idea that what couture designers did trickled down into the wardrobes of everyone else.
Prepandemic, the party line was that couture was a social media-safe space, because it demanded the intimacy of personal experience. Now, however, powered by the gaze of the global crowd, it has begun to morph into something else. Darwin would understand.
Sure, there are still those who delight in the subtlety of a garment so mysteriously constructed it reeks of ineffable ease: the gold fil coupé Bar jackets and straight skirts Maria Grazia Chiuri offered up at Dior that somehow managed to retain their exacting shape with no interior boning; her crushed velvet bathrobe coats, gleaming with plush insouciance. In a preview, Ms. Chiuri said she had been inspired by the story of the former Dior client Josephine Baker, and her set was wrapped in paintings by the American artist Mickalene Thomas of 13 barrier-breaking women of color. It could have been heavy-handed, but instead the collection just riffed on a 1920s line, a smidgen of Jazz Age decadence woven into the cloth, the result sitting lightly on the body.
Such understatement has a power of its own, even in a moment of boldface names in pursuit of the visibly fabulous.
But it is the desire to be, said Jordan Roth, the theater impresario, collector and occasional model, "a singular piece of art on legs," that makes couture -- especially in January, as awards season gets underway -- the ultimate celebrity dress-hunting ground (and the ultimate place to hunt celebrities; see the crowds outside the show venues, which resemble nothing so much as crowds outside concert venues, shrieking and waving their smartphones). A popular game has become guess who will wear what to the Oscars/BAFTAs/Césars. Everyone can play.
At Dior, odds are the cowled sleeveless gowns fully embroidered in gleaming gold and silver thread, the jewel-tone velvets channeling a siren draped languidly over a piano, will be coming soon to a red carpet near you. Ditto Chanel's filigree white lace number with a bit of gold embroidery gleaming at the throat.
As for what the best actress nominee Michelle Yeoh, front row at Armani Privé, might choose from among all the diamonds and ruffs sprinkled over a collection that ranged from court jester to Picasso via trousers flapping an extra fabric fin at the side, caviar-bead cropped jackets and shimmering sequined gowns, there were some less -- well -- tricky, options.
But the danger in the current game of one-upmanship is that the clothes sometimes tip into the ridiculous. At Schiaparelli, Ms. Jenner (who also sat front row at Maison Margiela, where John Galliano delivered his patented brand of upcycled mayhem by mashing together tulle, tartan, fishnets, Mickey Mouse and Pendleton outerwear) and her lion head managed to overshadow not only Doja Cat, who arrived covered in 30,000 ruby crystals like some sort of émigré from an Avatar-themed Met Gala, but also the fact that there were parts of the collection that verged on the sublime.
The opening look's jacket, for example, made from hundreds of encrusted sequins tracing a perfume-bottle silhouette, over simple black pants. A pinstripe trouser suit that played with proportions so that jutting shoulders created the illusion of a Mr. Pearl-size waist, but without the rearranged organs. Breast plates made from abalone, precious stones and lemonwood marquetry that soared upward toward the throat and stretched the very definition of material.
Once all the smoke from the wild kingdom controversy had cleared, they were a reminder that sometimes, when you pour gasoline on a fire, you risk getting burned.

PARIS -- How is fashion made? Who makes fashion? Adolf Loos put these questions to his readers some time ago -- in 1898, to be exact. In his architecture, the Viennese modernist paired rigorous simplicity with luxe materials and never sniffed at fashionableness, let alone beauty as a value.
It would be nuts to suggest we live in a time as inclined to high-minded aesthetic ideals as that of 19th-century Vienna. Yet we pursue fashion more relentlessly than ever and need beauty more than ever as nature is supplanted by machines. Thus beauty was the yardstick by which to measure a run of men's wear shows here characterized, above all, by its pursuit.
Whatever the runway specifics, designers, as if by secret compact, set their sights on conjuring it this season and none with more assurance than Anthony Vaccarello, who mounted a Saint Laurent show that was theatrical, elegant, blithely unconcerned with lines of gender demarcation and one that neatly answered Loos's question.
From the moment the first model glided onto the stage beneath the rotunda of the Bourse de Commerce -- Pinault Collection, fitted out for the evening with a circular channel-quilted banquette on which guests sat sipping Champagne, there was little question about what fashion may be.
It is attenuated vampire boys in skinny, floor-sweeping coats of velvet or leather and with immense starched bows flaring around their tiny skulls. It is funnel-neck sweaters that envelop half of the wearer's face or cowl-neck silk shirts banded at the waist with cummerbunds wrapped like obis. It is smoking jackets and hooded cloaks and block heels of patent leather that mirrored the models' vinyl-slick hairdos.
Mostly it is atmospheres reminiscent of decadent nights in the upholstered crypt that was Yves Saint Laurent's art-filled Left Bank duplex.
Behavior now is certainly no less decadent than in the '70s heyday of Saint Laurent and his louche cohort. One distinction is that those druggie escapades were intimate and not internet crowdsourced. No one dropped a pin on the orgy. And those in the room, as Mr. Vaccarello is well aware, took care to look every bit as glamorous and sexy in clothes as without them.
The day after the show, Betty Catroux, the Saint Laurent muse, was encountered crossing an avenue near the Hotel des Invalides. "I've just seen the most beautiful thing," said Ms. Catroux, still striking and blond and rail-thin at 78. "The Saint Laurent show. Did you see it? All those tall young dead boys looking just like me."
Paris is a city that has somehow always given people license. Grace Wales Bonner intimated as much after her show, held at the Hotel d'Evreux on the Place Vendôme, luxury's epicenter. In preparing the collection, Ms. Wales Bonner warped the space-time continuum to "constellate" a Paris in which the writer James Baldwin, the showgirl-spy Josephine Baker and the cultivated and epicene Maharaja and Maharani of Indore all overlapped. (Only the Indores were anachronisms; Baker and Baldwin could easily have been in Paris simultaneously.)
When Ms. Wales Bonner talks about introducing an "Afro-Atlantic spirit" to European luxury and about elevating "Black male style," it is sometimes hard to think she does not, in fact, mean the opposite. It is European luxury that could use a jolt of Black male style, in all its variety and dispersion. As usual, Ms. Wales Bonner offered considered and precisely tailored garments in this, her first coed show, notably men's suiting created in collaboration with the Savile Row stalwarts Anderson & Sheppard.
Adding cowrie shells, Berber babouches and obscure intellectual allusions to the mix felt somehow forced. (One collegiate jacket had the words "Sorbonne 56" embroidered on it, a reference to the First Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Paris, where Baldwin famously asserted that there is no unitary Black identity.) As models processed through the various rooms, the musician Hermon Mehari blew notes on a trumpet that only added to the uncomfortable sense of constraint. One of these days, Ms. Wales Bonner may decide to let loose. Kick over the ballroom chairs. Tear down the walls of the gilded salons.
Music always plays a big part in these fashion productions, and Matthew M. Williams at Givenchy opened his show with deceivingly slow stoner sounds by Bakar that stood in stark contrast to an initial grouping of precise black hit man suits tailored by his couture atelier. As more urgent beats kicked in, Mr. Williams ratcheted up the pace and the emotion, sending out a welter of looks layered with elements of workwear, streetwear, normcore and grunge.
Often enough beautiful can be used as a derisory adjective in this context. Yet that's a fine way to describe a Givenchy collection assembled with a spirit that was so stealthy it was almost guerrilla. Stuff designed for the luxury goods market was taken apart and reassembled. Trousers were devised without side seams. A jumpsuit was left open to the waist and draped in back like skirting. Tatty selvage edges and ratted hems belied a level of elevated craft and contributed to the most coherent statement yet by a designer who has more in common with the perfectionist who founded the house than he may let on.
Did the thousands of screaming fans outside this week's shows have any idea that an actual Hubert de Givenchy, let alone Cristóbal Balenciaga or Christian Dior, ever existed? Most were waiting for glimpses of Burna Boy or member of a K-pop group.
Kim Jones knows, though, and at Dior Homme he is fastidious to the point of fixation about keeping alive a dialogue with the house's heritage and, beyond that, our collective cultural past.
Still, do we go to runway shows to hear actors reciting T.S. Eliot's doomy World War I poem "The Waste Land?" We do not. Yet there, projected on screens in a darkened pavilion erected on the Place de la Concorde, were the actors Robert Pattinson and Gwendoline Christie, blown up to colossal size and laying it on thick in a reading of Eliot's poem. It would seem this is Mr. Jones's way of adding gravitas to his place in a lineage that includes not only a design deity like Dior himself but also Yves Saint Laurent.
Mr. Jones has such a surplus of design smarts he doesn't need CliffsNotes references to give heft to presentations that stand on the merits of their own mastery. Few other designers can as confidently take a fisherman's Aran sweater and open the sleeves so they ride on the outside of a wearer's arms; or riff on suit jackets and oilskin raincoats turned into tunics; or add trailing wisps of transparent fabric to suiting or buoyancy batons to the front of a vest. Certainly few designers have done more to turn skirts into an obligatory element of a masculine uniform. And skirts on men were so present on Paris streets this week that they are less a trend than a fact of life.
As at Cannes, where critics are bombarded with new cinematic productions, fashion week sometimes offers up a visual meal richer than any human can reasonably digest. It isn't fair, then, to unravel a spectacle as intellectually knotty as Jonathan Anderson's for Loewe in a few lines. Yet, since that's what space permits, let's just say that by making clothes in wrinkled bookbinder's vellum, beaten copper or pewter, deploying hatter's tricks to pouf out the hems of coats so the wearer resembles a topiary yew, the designer took us into realms previously unseen. He also made a concerning detour to the perimeter of Perv-land when he sent his skinny, hairy, vulnerable looking boy-men parading around in white cotton underpants.
In sharp contrast to all that, Rick Owens's show of relatively modest ("Victorian," he said) cloaks, skirts, straitjacket parkas, paneled shearlings and down-padded jackets was chaste and corrective. Sometimes when viewing one of Mr. Owens's shows, it helps to strip away the Goth styling and "Mad Max" effects. (Isn't it time to retire the fog machine and the spooky contact lenses?) Subtract the gimmicks and what you are left with is uncontroversial clothes that go a long way toward explaining Mr. Owens's booming commercial success.
And that balance is tough to maintain now when you set out to make fashion. On the one hand, there are houses like Louis Vuitton doubling down on social media content with celebrity-studded guest lists and everything including the kitchen-sink onstage. At Vuitton, the Spanish superstar Rosalía sang and rapped from atop a vintage yellow automobile. The paparazzi went crazy for the latest K-pop stars. And the Brooklyn-born designer Colm Dillane, a.k.a. KidSuper, spun up scrappy energy and his trademark cartoon imagery for designs meant to drive logo freaks to the brand's accessories.
Meantime, heritage houses like Hermès rehearse their heritage in an endless loop of tasteful French savoir-faire. (Clutching pearls, Vogue.com noted that the collection featured a "devastatingly gorgeous black cardigan in lamb shearling.")
Even in fashion, too-muchness is a problem. The wonder is not that so many designers go overboard but that so few adhere to the KISS principle. This precept, formalized if not officially developed by the United States Navy in the '60s, held that, in designing systems, simplicity is always the best means to an end.
"Keep it simple, stupid!" is not the worst approach to designing clothes.
And, in fact, among the more memorable shows this week were those that did. At Pierre Mahéo's Officine Générale presentation, the designer riffed at length, in just blue and gray, on a strain of pared down chic people associate with a Paris that, realistically, vanished when Serge Gainsbourg's five-pack a day Gitanes habit sent him to an early grave. Why not revive it, Mr. Mahéo suggested, with clothes for real people of all ages who'd appreciate a chic uniform to be refreshed now and then and worn till the end?
When the models strode out for the finale of the Officine Générale show at the Palais de Tokyo, you immediately hankered to see armies of such types in what used to pass for real life -- pre-Instagram. And when Bianca Saunders presented a collection inspired by her Anglo-Caribbean upbringing in London, shown on a turquoise painted living room set with a corner bar and an easy chair and with an audio background of clips from the Jamaican comedian Oliver Samuels's television show, you could readily imagine those tailored jackets, those dimpled pullover tuxedo coats, those ribbed knit leisure sets worn out on club night in Brixton or Trenchtown.
Rather than straining to force new narratives, the Paris appearance of Emily Adams Bode Aujla brought us another chapter in an ongoing tale forged from the designer's core belief in autobiography. Here the inspiration was Ms. Bode Aujla's maternal family and her mother's summer sojourns working for an aged grande dame on Cape Cod. Fancifully evoking the funky sartorial folkways of a mostly bygone WASP world, she paired Icelandic sweaters with embroidered trousers, plaid pants with shearling vests, tie-dye pullovers with tweed jackets and added spangles everywhere, like a giddy kid pulling granny's frocks from a trunk.
Like Mr. Mahéo and Ms. Saunders, Ms. Bode Aujla found her grounding in the familiar. No mood boards required. Just use what you know.

At the Golden Globes, a Night of Statement-Making: [Style Desk]

Full text: The awards show returned, and so did major dressing up.
So the Golden Globes returned, two years after disappearing from our screens, first because of a pandemic-induced lockdown and then because of scandal -- financial, ethical and racial. And with their disappearance went the first major red carpet of that phenomenon otherwise known as the Extended Awards Season Fashion Show.
Before the event, speculation was rife: Would stars actually show up for the tarnished Hollywood Foreign Press Association? And if they did, would they seek to play down their connection with the evening's awards by dressing down? Would they stay away from eye-catching ensembles, in favor of the forgettably banal and the bland?
As if. Globes night turned out to be a night of statement-making, onstage and on the red carpet. Not so much of the marketing or branding kind, but rather of the personal kind. And it was the more interesting for it.
Jerrod Carmichael, the host, set the tone with an opening monologue that addressed the Globes' historical lack of diversity without pulling any punches and went on from there -- with a matching set of six (count 'em) outfit changes that included two skinny black velvet suits (the first by Armani); a symphony of pinks; one white tuxedo with a sheer turtleneck and pearl necklace; and a Bode beaded tunic. It may be a record for number of award show looks worn by a single host. If some fashion brand doesn't sign him up immediately, it'll be the biggest surprise of the night.
Still, go big or go home seemed to be the general theme. Rihanna, making her first major post-baby event appearance, swaddled herself in a black velvet Schiaparelli bustier dress and an enormous shoulder-swallowing sculpted velvet stole, plus velvet opera gloves and Cartier diamonds.
Angela Bassett played a silver superhero in Pamela Rolland sequins. Laverne Cox channeled Marilyn Monroe in a blond bob and vintage Galliano gown. And Jessica Chastain got caught in a gossamer beaded Oscar de la Renta spiderweb -- with a matching mask. She was one of the few attendees to nod to the continued reality of Covid.
Royalty was a trend, represented in a plethora of red (Lily James in a bandeau top from which was suspended acres of swagged Versace skirting and Billy Porter in a cardinal velvet Christian Siriano coatdress with a sweeping train) and purple (Selena Gomez in Valentino and Sheryl Lee Ralph in glimmering Aliétte). This was probably not surprising given the recently unavoidable nature of the subject thanks to Prince Harry's memoir.
Also pink, courtesy of Seth Rogen in salmon Dior Men and Margot Robbie in powder puff Chanel. (Rumors of her separation from the brand appear to be highly exaggerated.) And overblown rosettes on lapels, as represented by Eddie Redmayne's chocolate Valentino, Diego Calva's forest green Gucci and Emma D'Arcy's oversize Acne Studios satin tux, skirt and trousers, chosen because, they said, "nothing says nonbinary like wearing both a skirt and trousers."
There was a lot of speaking-in-clothes going on. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, in draped sapphire Balmain, told E! that her dress was "giving water butterfly." Michelle Williams, in cascading tiers of Gucci ruffles, looked like sea coral, wafting in the waves. And Jenny Slate, in leaf green Rodarte with a bloom at the throat, said she wanted to look "like a woman who's about to turn into a magical plant." Why not? It's the beginning of the year. Anything could happen.
Donald Glover said he was going for comfort, and the chance to get "mildly drunk," with his white silk YSL pajama-and-robe set under his tux, possibly the perfect combination of working-from-home dressing meets black tie. You can go from the ballroom to the bedroom in one easy step.
Indeed, it was but one of a variety of contemporary twists on ye olde tux, as modeled most successfully by Jean Smart in an elegant, sharp-shouldered tuxedo dress with an actual twist at the waist, and Hannah Einbinder in a strapless black Carolina Herrera tea dress with a white bow at the bodice.
She looked as if she could move, as did Letitia Wright, in a simple Prada trompe l'oeil silk column dress, deliberately crumpled and splotched with a rough-cut slash at the leg that was an ode of sorts to the elegance of imperfection. Like the night itself, it was a reminder that when it comes to our flaws, it's how you deal with them that matters.

Trying To Escape A Royal Catch-22: [Review]

Full text: At once emotional and embittered, the royal memoir is mired in a paradox: drawing endless attention in an effort to renounce fame.
SPARE, by Prince Harry
Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex and Man About Montecito, isn't one for book learning, he reminds readers of his new memoir, "Spare." And yet its pages are dappled with literary references, from John Steinbeck ("He kept it tight," the prince writes admiringly of "Of Mice and Men"); to William Faulkner, whose line from "Requiem for a Nun" about the past never being dead, nor even past, he discovers on BrainyQuote.com; to Wordsworth and other poets. Shakespeare's "Hamlet," though, hit a little too close to home. "Lonely prince, obsessed with dead parent, watches remaining parent fall in love with dead parent's usurper...?" Harry writes. "No, thank you."
He prefers to sink into TV comedies like "Family Guy," where he admires Stewie, the unnervingly mature baby, and "Friends," where he identifies with the tortured Chandler Bing. Reading "Spare," though, one kind of wants to snatch the remote control from his hands and press into them a copy of Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." Not because of Harry's military endeavors (unlike Yossarian, he seems to have felt sane only in active combat) but because of the seemingly inescapable paradox of his situation.
In the prince's full-throated renunciation of fame and royalty with all its punishing invasions of privacy, he has only become more famous, if not more regal, trading his proximity to the throne for the No. 1 spot on cushioned chairs opposite Oprah and Anderson Cooper. With "Harry & Meghan," the gauzy Netflix series preceding this book, he and the Duchess now might well be overexposed. (Maybe this is part of the grand plan, to drive away inquiring minds by boring them to bits?)
My interest in the English royal family tends to dwindle after the era of previous renouncers like Edward and Wallis and the dynamically dysfunctional Princess Margaret, who "could kill a houseplant with one scowl," Harry writes. They weren't close; Margaret once gave him a cheap pen wrapped with a rubber fish for Christmas. I devoured early episodes of "The Crown" but Season 5, with its focus on Charles and Diana's marital troubles, left me delicately yawning.
Still, I expected to enjoy "Spare," given that it was written with the help of the talented author J.R. Moehringer, whose own memoir, "The Tender Bar," I adored before it was even a glimmer in Ben Affleck's eye, and who helped the tennis star Andre Agassi's autobiography, "Open," transcend the locker room. And I did. In parts.
"Spare" -- its title as minimalist as Agassi's; its cover a similar full-frontal stare -- is a thing of many parts, of shreds and patches, of bitter gibes (particularly at Harry's older brother, William, the "heir" to his "spare," whom he calls "Willy") and sustained existential crisis. Its basic three-act structure of childhood, Army service and wedded bliss is as subdivided as a California lot into shorter episodes and paragraphs, many only one sentence long.
Harry's distinctly English voice (he doesn't like kilts, for example, because of "that worrisome knife in your sock and that breeze up your arse") at times does weird battle with the staccato patois of a tough-talking private eye doing voice-over in a film noir. Describing his "Gan-Gan" at Balmoral: "She wore blue, I recall, all blue ... Blue was her favorite color." Then, like a gun moll, the Queen Mother orders a martini.
If there's a murder Harry is trying to solve, it's of course that of his own mother, Princess Diana, whose death in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in 1997, under chase by paparazzi, is the defining tragedy of his life, and thus of this book. To her younger son, only 12 at the time, the click of cameras wielded by paps, as he derisively calls them, came to sound "like a gun cocking or a blade being notched open." (From the looks of "Harry & Meghan," which has plenty of sanctioned shots of the couple's courtship and toddlers, he is fighting back by hand with his own iPhone.) Diana defended herself against the constant onslaught of photographers by lobbing water balloons and, more sinisterly, by hiding in the trunks of getaway cars, a trick Harry eventually picked up. "It felt like being in a coffin," he writes. "I didn't care."
Mired in a "red mist" of grief and anger, the prince self-medicates at first with candy and then, as the hated tabloids report with varying degrees of accuracy, alcohol, weed, cocaine, mushrooms and ayahuasca. (More mildly he tries magnesium supplements, and I'm not sure anyone needs to know that this loosened his bowels at a friend's wedding.)
Along with Harry's deployment to Afghanistan -- where, he observes, "you can't kill people if you think of them as people" -- he escapes repeatedly to Africa, whose lions seem less threatening than the journalistic predators at home. In one of the book's cringier moments, he writes that Willy, who calls him Harold though his given name is Henry, stamps his foot over choosing the continent as a cause. "Africa was his thing," Harry explains, mimicking his brother's petulant tone. "I let you have veterans, why can't you let me have African elephants and rhinos?"
Cattily he notes Willy's "alarming baldness, more advanced than my own," while dinging the Princess of Wales for being slow to share her lip gloss. Candidly he shows the then-Prince Charles doing headstands in his boxer shorts and his family's charade of an annual performance review: the Court Circular.
Like its author, "Spare" is all over the map -- emotionally as well as physically. He does not, in other words, keep it tight. Harry is frank and funny when his penis gets frostbitten after a trip to the North Pole -- "my South Pole was on the fritz" -- leaving him a "eunuch" just before William marries Kate Middleton. In an odd feat of projection, he gives the groom an ermine thong at the reception, then applies to his own nether regions the Elizabeth Arden cream that his mother used as lip gloss -- "'weird' doesn't really do the feeling justice" -- and worries that "my todger would be all over the front pages" before finding a discreet dermatologist.
Therapy, in which he claims William refuses to participate, and a whiff of First by Van Cleef & Arpels, help Harry learn to cry, unlocking a stream of repressed recollections of Diana, and that's when even the most hardened reader might herself weep. Charles's own scent, Dior's Eau Sauvage, and his marriage to Camilla, leave him relatively cold.
And yet when his father advises of the unrelenting and often racist press coverage of Harry's union to Meghan -- "Don't read it, darling boy" -- it's difficult not to agree. The prince claims to have a spotty memory -- "a defense mechanism, most likely" -- but doesn't appear to have forgotten a single line ever printed about him and his wife, and the last section of his tell-all degenerates into a tiresome back-and-forth about who's leaking what and why. Maybe a little more Faulkner and less Fleet Street would be helpful here?
Still bitter over the late author Hilary Mantel, unnamed here, comparing the royal family to pandas -- "uniquely barbarous" and dehumanizing, he writes, while admitting "we did live in a zoo" -- Harry then turns right around and calls three courtiers the Bee, the Fly and the Wasp. He seems both driven mad by "the buzz," as the royals' inexhaustible chronicler Tina Brown would call it, and constitutionally unable to stop drumming it up.

Danone Sued Over Its Plastic Use Under a Landmark Law: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Environmental groups are relying on a law in France requiring large companies to address their environmental footprint.
PARIS -- Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.
The groups accuse Danone -- one of the world's top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study -- of "failing to live up to its duties" under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so.
"Danone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue," Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Danone said the company "strongly" refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to "reduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials."
The lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production.
But Monday's announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.
Adam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France's statute as toothless because of its vague requirements.
But, he added, "the teeth are in the lawsuits."
By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.
Throughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world's airplanes combined.
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million -- and is expected to almost triple by 2060.
Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic -- about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report.
The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution.
An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone's shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics.
Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.
"We're not going to recycle our way out of this," Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said.
He added that plastics were too critical to Danone's business model for "voluntary mechanisms" to be effective. "We need the power of law," he said.
To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity.
Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility.
The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive.
There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee.
However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies' use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment.
In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.
"It's often about streamlining existing practices," said Pauline Barraud de Lagerie, a sociologist at University Paris Dauphine who published a book on corporate responsibility. She added that by suing companies, "N.G.O.s are trying to somehow bring back an obligation of result."
So far, around 15 legal cases based on the French law have been reported. Half of them have gone to court and are still awaiting judgment, which could take years.
"We're making up for the government's lack of political will," said Sandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a group involved in four legal cases, pointing to what she described as a law lacking teeth.
The environmental groups said in their statement that Danone's 2021 vigilance plan "is completely silent on plastics." They are calling for judges in a Paris civil court to force the company to release a new plan within six months that would include a phaseout of plastics. Should the company fail to meet that deadline, they are demanding damages of 100,000 euros ( $ 108,000) per day of delay.
In September, the groups had issued formal notices to eight other major food companies accusing them of inadequate due diligence plans. ClientEarth said it had received satisfactory responses from companies such as the grocery chain Carrefour and Nestlé, which promised to step up their efforts, but not from Danone.
The lawsuit is part of a wider trend of climate litigation that has gained momentum in recent years, expanding the climate fight beyond traditional demonstrations and civil disobedience initiatives.
The number of climate change lawsuits globally has more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, from about 900 to more than 2,000 ongoing or concluded cases, according to data from the Grantham Research Institute and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Catherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations.
Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws "designed to protect investors and companies" in order to press them to better address environmental issues.
"Now, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment," he said. "That's a step change."
