Full text: A working intercom isn't just a convenience when visitors or food deliveries arrive -- it's a legal requirement in most buildings.
Q: I live on the sixth floor of a 54-unit co-op building in the West Village. Five years ago, during renovations in the apartment below mine, a wall was removed and I lost my connection to the building's intercom system. It has never been restored. The building's architect is supposed to review and approve all renovations, but apparently didn't catch this problem. I have notified building management several times, to no avail. The regular doormen are aware of the problem and call my cellphone if necessary, but when others are on duty, I miss deliveries and visitors. What should I do?
A: A working intercom isn't just a convenience when visitors or food deliveries arrive -- it's a legal requirement. Under the state's multiple dwelling law, buildings built or converted after 1968 with eight or more units must have a two-way voice intercom system linking the front door to each apartment. The city's housing maintenance code also requires a functioning intercom.
"As a result, the co-op has a legal obligation to repair or replace the intercom," said Nancy Kourland, a partner who handles real estate litigation with Lasser Law Group, based in Manhattan.
Moreover, Ms. Kourland said, courts have found that intercoms are an essential service and that failing to maintain them is a breach of the warranty of habitability under state law because it affects the habitability and security of an apartment.
You can consult your proprietary lease to be sure, but it's very unlikely that repairs to the intercom system as you describe would be the responsibility of a shareholder. Write a letter to the co-op board notifying them that you haven't had a working intercom since 2019, and that it needs to be repaired immediately. You can add that if it isn't repaired, you will take further action.
If the board is not responsive, you can seek a repair by making a complaint to 311, or by starting an HP proceeding in housing court.
You can withhold your maintenance fees until a repair is made, based upon the proprietary lease. If the co-op brings a legal action against you for nonpayment, the broken intercom could be a defense in court, said Andrew I. Bart, a senior litigation counsel who specializes in co-ops and condos at Kagan Lubic Lepper Finkelstein & Gold, LLP.
If the problem was caused by your neighbor's renovations, your neighbor may be responsible for the repair, depending on the lease terms or the alteration agreement that was signed when the work was performed, said Andrew Freedland, a partner in the real estate department at Herrick. If your neighbor is found responsible, they may then have a claim against their contractor, Mr. Freedland said.

Hardy Bedbugs Have Moved In. Can I Break My Apartment's Lease?: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Breaking your lease comes with obvious risks, but they could be worth taking. On the other hand, you could help solve the infestation.
Q: I've been unable to live in my rent-stabilized apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, because of a bedbug infestation. The landlord hired an exterminator, who has come three times, but the bedbugs are still there. The exterminator said they might be resistant to the chemical spray. My lease isn't up until September, and I want out of it, though I have a roommate. My landlord has refused, unless I get someone to take over the lease, but I can't do that while it's still infested. This experience has been mentally and financially debilitating. Is there a way out of the lease?
A: You can decide to leave and break your lease, in which case your landlord would be legally required to try to re-rent the apartment. But you would be responsible for the outstanding rent in the meantime -- that is, unless a housing court ruled that this infestation was intolerable enough for you to break the lease without penalty, said David A. Kaminsky, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan.
If you leave and your roommate is included on the lease, your landlord could sue you and the roommate to recover the funds. If your roommate pays, they could in turn sue you for the funds, said Ami Shah, deputy director of the citywide housing practice at Legal Services NYC, which provides legal services for low-income New Yorkers.
Rather than breaking the lease, you could try to negotiate an early exit. If you're successful, get an agreement in writing so you have proof that the landlord approved it. If you move out without an agreement and the landlord sues, you could use the bedbug issue as a defense. Just be sure to retain evidence of the infestation, such as photos and videos, as well as receipts for any costs that you incur related to it.
But a rent-stabilized apartment is valuable, so you might reconsider your desire to leave. You could continue to work with the landlord on a rent abatement, as you have been unable to inhabit this apartment. If the landlord refuses, that's when you bring a case in housing court asking for repairs, known as an HP proceeding, Ms. Shah said. A court can order the landlord to remedy the conditions, and a rent abatement can be part of a settlement agreement.
Your landlord has been cooperative with efforts to rid your apartment of bedbugs, so perhaps you can try an alternate treatment.
"It's hard to see what strain of bedbugs are resistant to what chemical," said Luis Balseca, owner of All Out Bed Bug Exterminators in New York City. For this reason, Mr. Balseca uses a fungal treatment called Aprehend, which he has found to be more effective than chemical sprays on all strains of bedbugs.

TSMC's Revenues Flat
But Beat Expectations
The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and the market's expectations.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.
Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T $ 625.5 billion ( $ 20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $ 19.93 billion a year earlier. That beat TSMC's previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of $ 18.8 billion to $ 19.6 billion.
For December alone, TSMC reported that revenue fell 8.4 percent from a year earlier. It was also down 14.4 percent compared with the previous month.

Germany's SAP to Pay
$ 222 Million Over Bribery
The German software company SAP agreed to pay about $ 222 million to resolve two investigations into bribery schemes in seven countries, U.S. authorities said.
The Justice Department said SAP had entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement to resolve criminal charges that it conspired to bribe government officials in Indonesia and South Africa in order to win business.
SAP also reached a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to address similar alleged bribery schemes in Azerbaijan, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, as well as Indonesia and South Africa.
The company "has accepted responsibility for corrupt practices that hurt honest businesses engaging in global commerce," the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Jessica Aber, said in a statement.
SAP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. REUTERS

Xerox to Lay Off 15% of Its Staff At the Top of '24: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The move is the printer maker's latest as it tries to shift more toward its business services offerings.
Xerox said on Wednesday that it was cutting 15 percent of its work force as part of a restructuring, the company's latest effort to shift focus to its business-services offerings and away from its iconic photocopiers.
In a news release, the company said it would reduce its global staff, which included roughly 23,000 employees in 2022, and name a new leadership team. The layoffs are expected to take place in the first quarter of 2024.
The company's shares fell more than 12 percent after the layoff news was announced. Its share price had been steadily rising over the past year, in part because Xerox had saved billions of dollars after starting a cost-cutting program in 2018. It reported a roughly 6 percent drop in revenue in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the previous year.
Xerox was founded in 1906 as the Haloid Company. After being known primarily for manufacturing photocopy machines throughout the 20th century -- so much so that to "Xerox" became a verb -- and facing pressure from Japanese competitors like Canon, it transitioned to focusing more on financial services, like insurance and real estate.
That strategy ultimately backfired, and the company sold off those divisions in the 1990s. In recent years, Xerox has struggled to adjust to the digital age as demand for ink and print documents crumbled.
The transition would happen in fits and starts, with a series of moves that didn't deliver profits.
Under the leadership of Ursula Burns, Xerox's former chief executive, the company sought to beef up its business services by helping clients streamline the flow of documents in human resources and health care and handling payment systems. In 2010 it acquired Affiliated Computer Services, which runs the computer payment services for E-ZPass highway tolls, for $ 6.4 billion.
But Xerox sold off its information technology outsourcing business for more than $ 1 billion in 2014, and competition from China in the production of cartridge-clone makers hurt its profits. The company also sought to make inroads in 3-D printing, but it sold off that business unit, too, in August 2023.
In 2018, the company announced that it was merging with Fujifilm, the Japanese conglomerate. That merger was called off less than three months later after activist shareholders, most prominently Carl Icahn, protested the move as undervaluing Xerox. In 2019, Xerox sought to acquire HP, but that deal was also called off after HP rejected it, citing concerns over Xerox's financial health.

Using Middlemen, Russia Evades Sanctions on Imported Technology: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, engineers at Convex, a Russian telecommunications company, needed to find American equipment to transmit data to the country's feared intelligence service. But no gear was flowing in after Western nations imposed sweeping new trade limits on Russia.
Convex's employees soon found a solution.
While Cisco, a U.S. tech provider, had halted sales to Russia on March 3, 2022, Convex's engineers easily obtained the Cisco gear they needed through an obscure Russian e-commerce site called Nag, which had gotten around international trade restrictions by buying the American equipment through a web of suppliers in China.
Convex engineers then visited the offices of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., in Yekaterinburg to install the gear that would help categorize and send data to the authorities. "Coordinate with the F.S.B. the placement of the Cisco Catalyst WS-C4948E switch," a Convex engineer wrote on March 23, 2022, according to a company communications log obtained by The New York Times.
In the 22 months since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has largely continued getting the technology it needs to keep its economy running. After export restrictions and corporate bans initially led to trade disruptions, Russian suppliers found loopholes and cultivated workarounds. Almost no piece of commercial hardware -- including basic telecom equipment, surveillance gear, microchips for advanced computing and weapons systems, and drones -- has been too hard to get.
Russian authorities and companies have united to take advantage of cracks in the global response. They have tapped webs of intermediaries, including middlemen in China, and disguised their activity through shell companies, according to leaked Russian government emails, trade documents and records of online conversations between Russian engineers obtained by The Times.
They have also turned to countries that have staked out neutral positions in the conflict, such as Morocco and Turkey, and used their ports to receive goods from global tech manufacturing centers that are then placed on other ships headed toward Russia, a process known as transshipment. The prohibited tech products were then made available to buy from well-known suppliers and on easy-to-use e-commerce sites like Nag.
Flexibility has been paramount. In weekly emails, Russian trade officials shared tips on which ports would transfer goods, who would trade in rubles and where Russian-flagged ships could be repaired, the documents show. If one supplier stopped selling, they found another. If a shipping route was cut off, new ones took up the slack.
The documents offer a rare glimpse of a race in which Russian traders have reliably stayed one step ahead of U.S.-led efforts to cut them off. Their success shows how difficult it is to stop the global movement of commercial technology, raising questions about the effectiveness of Western trade restrictions and whether tech giants should better control the destinations of their products -- and if it is even possible to do so.
Cisco declined to comment. Convex did not respond to requests for comment.
Understaffed government investigators in the United States and Europe cannot keep pace with the often shadowy flow of goods, said Elina Ribakova, an economist who has studied sanctions evasion at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a U.S. think tank. Major tech companies, she added, must do more to cut off supplies to Russia.
"It's an endless Whac-a-Mole game," she said. "There should be alarm, particularly among the policymakers, that we have announced a lot of sanctions and may believe they are working but in reality they are not."
A Beautiful Friendship
As sanctions against Russia took effect last year, ProSoft, a Moscow-based electronics provider, experienced the fallout.
Officials at the company, which sells biometric surveillance equipment and tech for heavy industry and critical infrastructure, emailed the Russian government trade mission in Morocco for help, according to a message reviewed by The Times.
"Just a week ago, it was not difficult to ship them to us from American and European suppliers," a ProSoft executive wrote, referring to now-banned tech. Now "we run the risk of starting to reduce production (there are small reserves in the warehouse)."
A spreadsheet attached to the message listed hundreds of American, European and Japanese microchips and sensors that ProSoft needed.
At the time, Russia's economy was absorbing the initial effects of trade restrictions. The ruble tumbled, inflation and interest rates soared, Russian banks were cut off from large swaths of the global financial system and oligarchs sat helpless as their yachts were seized.
But the pain did not last as President Vladimir V. Putin remade Russia's economy. Russian officials and executives swiftly teamed up to find workarounds. Political loyalists profited as Western companies fled.
In Morocco, Russia's trade office, which looks after the country's economic interests overseas, also helped Russian companies regain their footing. After ProSoft reached out for help, trade officials jumped into action.
"We're in constant contact with the general director" of Morocco's state-run port of Tanger Med, one Russian official wrote in an April 2022 email. "In the event of ships entering under the Russian flag, there will be no problems with maintenance."
A spokeswoman for Tanger Med, which hugs the Strait of Gibraltar, said the port leased space to shipping companies and had "no information nor responsibility" about vessels moving through the complex. The port, which handles more than eight million containers annually connecting to 180 international ports, was "not aware" of shipped goods calling at Russian ports before or after being at Tanger Med, or maintenance of Russian ships being performed, she added.
By November 2022, Russian trade officials in Morocco were bragging that their "direct support" had turned the African country into an electronics transshipment hub. Goods from Taiwan, China and other manufacturing centers were offloaded at Tanger Med and then placed on other ships headed to Russia.
"Given the long-term nature of the cooperation with the Moroccan partner, the volume of supplies could amount to about $ 10 million per year," the trade officials wrote about their work for ProSoft.
ProSoft also maintained supplies of Western tech with the help of an obscure scrap metal company registered in Casablanca, Morocco. After the war began, the company, Invent Maroc, set up a new website and routed restricted technology through Morocco to Russia, including microchips from Texas Instruments, Intel and NXP, according to trade data. In 2022, the United States had limited the export of semiconductors made with American equipment or intellectual property to Russia.
Invent Maroc, run by a man named Alexander Trinz, had no prior history of international exports. Yet it sourced electronics from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Japan and Mexico, according to trade records.
In a call this month, Mr. Trinz said he had supplied technology to Russia in the past, but not since the war. "Before, we worked with Russia, but in this moment we can't," he said.
An analysis of ProSoft's offerings found nearly 300 products for sale that contain Intel chips, as well as components made by Nvidia and an A.I. optimized computer chip designed by Google. Although it is unclear how the imports were ultimately used, American chips have been found on Russian missiles and drones, according to weapons experts.
Nvidia, Intel and Google declined to comment. Texas Instruments said it opposed "the illicit diversion of our products to Russia." ProSoft, NXP and Russia's trade representative to Morocco did not respond to requests for comment.
In October 2022, Russian trade officials said they had established 20 operators at the Tanger Med port to "promptly carry out" the logistics of getting cargo loaded onto "feeder" vessels ultimately bound for Russia, according to a weekly shipping report. Another report noted that ports in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, had accepted payment in rubles.
"The sanctions restrictions have been successfully overcome," one government report said of a Turkish trade route this March.
Click and Buy
On little-known Russian e-commerce sites like Nag, OCS Distribution, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom, complex technologies made by major American and European telecom manufacturers, such as Cisco, HP, Juniper, Ericsson and Nokia, are listed for sale.
Many of these sites freely sold Western technology for decades, but overhauled their supply chains because of the war. Since then, the platforms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in technology from China, according to trade records.
China and Hong Kong supplied 85 percent of semiconductors imported to Russia from March 2022 to September 2023, up from 27 percent before the conflict, according to the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit that studies Russian trade routes.
Nag, which sells hardware to regional telecoms and surveillance contractors, is one major platform. Through intermediaries, it has bought roughly $ 100 million in restricted American tech since the war began, according to trade data. In total, it imported $ 150 million in hardware from China this year, the data show. Communications gear, which has ostensibly been prohibited from reaching Russia, is readily available on its site, filtered by price, product type and quantity.
Nag employees have talked about logistical challenges that international sanctions have caused, according to internal communications. In May 2022, a Nag employee wrote to a Russian customer that "the old transit system has ended," delaying delivery of $ 20,000 of Juniper equipment. A month later, Nag followed up to say that the problem had been resolved and that the gear would arrive in the coming months.
Tech for building online surveillance and censorship was also available. Russian telecom operators are required by law to provide communications data about customers to the security services, meaning they must buy specialized equipment that sends the information to government agents. On Nag message boards, now accessible only from within Russia, engineers posted technical tips for making the systems work to F.S.B. specs.
Ericsson, Juniper, Nokia and IBM said any imports into Russia were done without their consent. OCS Distribution said that it "does not sell products in violation of international sanctions and restrictions" and that any such tech listed on its website for purchase was there because it was in the midst of an overhaul. HP, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom did not respond to requests for comment.
A network of Nag-operated companies and brands in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates has also helped obscure shipments of sanctioned technology. In total, Nag brought in almost $ 10 million in Cisco equipment and about $ 1 million in Nokia and Intel products to Russia over the past year.
At the F.S.B. offices in Yekaterinburg, the Cisco gear that Convex engineers installed sat alongside routers made by Juniper, according to Convex's records. Less than a year later, the availability of Western tech was so abundant that Convex's engineers could shop around.
In a conversation on Convex's internal messaging system this year, engineers focused on a new supplier that they had "spotted." Operating under the name sale-server.ru, the supplier had plenty of restricted name-brand technology from HP, IBM and others. More important, the price was right.
"Cheaper than Nag," one Convex employee wrote.

Full text: In designing warehouse-size data centers that behaved like a single computer, he changed the fabric of the internet.
When Google arrived in the late 1990s, hundreds of thousands of people were instantly captivated by its knack for taking them wherever they wanted to go on the internet. Developed by the company's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the algorithm that drove the site seemed to work like magic.
But as the internet search engine expanded its reach to billions of people over the next decade, it was driven by another major technological advance that was less discussed, though no less important: the redesign of Google's giant computer data centers.
Led by a Brazilian named Luiz Barroso, a small team of engineers rebuilt the warehouse-size centers so that they behaved like a single machine -- a technological shift that would change the way the entire internet was built, allowing any site to reach billions of people almost instantly and much more consistently.
Dr. Barroso, who changed the fabric of the internet, died on Sept. 16 at 59. His wife, Catherine Warner, said the cause was cardiac arrest. His death was not widely reported at the time.
Before the rise of Google, internet companies stuffed their data centers with increasingly powerful and expensive computer servers, as they struggled to reach more and more people. Each server delivered the website to a relatively small group of people. And if the server died, those people were out of luck.
But Google took a different tack. Working alongside Urs Hölzle, the company's first vice president of engineering, Dr. Barroso realized that the best way to distribute a wildly popular website like Google was to break it into tiny pieces and spread them evenly across an array of servers. Rather than each server delivering the site to a small group of people, the entire data center delivered the site to its entire audience.
"Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of internet service performance," he and Dr. Hölzle wrote in their seminal textbook, "The Datacenter as a Computer."
"In other words, we must treat the data center itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer."
The computer could deliver a website far more efficiently. And if one machine inside the data center died, the others could pick up the slack. Widespread outages became a rarity, especially as Dr. Barroso and his team expanded these ideas across multiple data centers. Eventually, Google's entire global network of data centers behaved as a single machine.
Luiz André Barroso was born on June 30, 1964, in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Fernando Luiz Barroso, was a surgeon. His mother, Maria Cecilia Bomfim Vellozo, was a professor of marketing.
After earning a bachelor's and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Pontifícia Universidade Católica in Rio de Janeiro, he enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, studying computer engineering. By the mid-1990s, he was working as a researcher in a San Francisco Bay Area lab operated by the Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the computer giants of the day.
There, he helped create multi-core computer chips -- microprocessors made of many chips working in tandem. A more efficient way of running computer software, such chips are now a vital part of almost any new computer.
But by the late 1990s, DEC was in decline. It made big, expensive computer servers using microprocessors based on the RISC architecture -- a dying method of building computer chips -- at a time when businesses were moving to lower-cost machines equipped with rival processors from chipmakers like Intel.
In 1998, DEC was acquired by computer maker Compaq. Four years later, Compaq merged with HP. And the leading engineers from DEC's two research labs -- Western Research Lab in Palo Alto, Calif., and the Systems Research Center two blocks away -- soon moved to Google. Dr. Barroso was among them.
These engineers were among the most talented in the field. They included software specialists like Jeff Dean, who is now among those leading Google's A.I. lab, as well as hardware experts like Dr. Barroso. Together, they designed and built the underlying infrastructure that allowed Google to reach a global audience.
At first, Dr. Barroso worked on software. But as Dr. Hölzle realized that Google would also need to build its own hardware, he tapped Dr. Barroso to lead the effort. Over the next decade, as it pursued his warehouse-size computer, Google built its own servers, data storage equipment and networking hardware.
"Luiz was good at realizing what he did not yet know, and then acting on it," Dr. Hölzle said in an interview. "He was good at seeing what he needed to do in the future."
For years, this work was among Google's most closely guarded secrets. The company saw it as a competitive advantage. But by the 2010s, companies like Amazon and Facebook were following the example set by Dr. Barroso and his team. Soon, the world's leading computer makers were building and selling the same kind of low-cost hardware, allowing any internet company to build an online empire the way Google had.
In 2020, in honor of his data center work, Dr. Barroso received the Eckert-Mauchly Award, named for John Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly, who built one of the world's first computers in the 1940s. In March 2022, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother and three siblings.
Like many prominent engineers, Dr. Barroso was also a musician. He played his guitar nearly every day, both at home and at work, and he carried the instrument with him on every vacation, no matter how remote the destination. This year, he released an album called "Before Bossa," playing and singing alongside the Brazilian jazz musicians Zeca Assumpção and Sergio Reze.
Dr. Hölzle said that Dr. Barroso's music had been a vital part of his work at Google.
Inside the company, there are constant battles over what the future will look like, and Dr. Barroso could navigate these battles, Dr. Hölzle said, thanks to an endearing personality and his guitar.
"He used his guitar as a tool," he said. "It was a way of getting people to relax and look at their disagreements less as a battle and more as a meeting of humans."

Wall Street Rises to Highest Level Since the Start of August: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street rose again Monday to begin a holiday-shortened week and reached its highest level in more than three months.
The S&P 500 gained 33.36 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,547.38, coming off its third straight winning week. The Dow Jones industrial average added 203.76, or 0.6 percent, to 33,151.04, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 159.05, or 1.1 percent, to 14,284.53.
Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the market higher, and it rose 2.1 percent after saying it is bringing on Sam Altman for a new venture following his sudden dismissal as C.E.O. of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Microsoft said it will also continue its partnership with OpenAI, as fervor around artificial intelligence technology and the huge profits it is expected to create continue to dominate Wall Street.
Stocks broadly drifted higher through the day before they took a turn upward in the afternoon when yields fell in the bond market following an auction of Treasurys. Easing Treasury yields have been the main reason for a strong rally for stocks in recent weeks.
This upcoming week is relatively light on reports that could sway the hopes on Wall Street that have underpinned that drop in Treasury yields.
Wall Street is becoming more convinced that inflation is cooling enough for the Federal Reserve to finally be done with its market-crunching hikes to interest rates. Not only that, traders are moving up their expectations for when the Fed could actually begin cutting interest rates.
Despite Fed officials saying they may keep rates high for a while to ensure high inflation is definitively beaten, traders are thinking the first cut to rates could happen by early summer or maybe even by March. Cuts to rates tend to act like steroids for financial markets and offer oxygen across the financial system.
The Thanksgiving holiday means the U.S. government will release its weekly update on jobless claims on Wednesday instead of the usual Thursday. Other than that, the release of the minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting on Tuesday and preliminary reports on U.S. business activity on Friday are among the highlights.
That could make Nvidia's upcoming profit report on Tuesday the week's highest-profile event.
Nvidia carries huge sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes because it has swelled to become the fifth-most valuable U.S. stock. Much of that rise has been because of excitement around A.I., and Nvidia's report could offer clues on how much all the talk about A.I. is translating into actual sales.
Analysts expect Nvidia to say its earnings per more than quintupled from a year earlier and that its revenue soared to nearly $ 16.2 billion from less than $ 6 billion.
Nvidia has been one of the seven Big Tech stocks that have accounted for a disproportionate amount of the S&P 500's gains this year. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks have returned 73 percent so far this year, versus just 6 percent for the other 493 companies, according to Goldman Sachs strategists.
While forecasts continue for them to deliver stronger growth, the strategists led by David Kostin warn "the risk/reward profile is not especially compelling given elevated expectations."
Nvidia rose 2.3 percent before its report. Best Buy, Deere, HP and Lowe's will also be giving their latest quarterly updates this week.
On the losing end of Wall Street Monday was Kohl's. The retailer fell 2.7 percent after it said that Dave Alves left as its president and chief operating officer, less than nine months after naming him to the post.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were easing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, dipped to 4.42 percent from 4.44 percent late Friday.
The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, slipped to 4.89 percent from 4.90 percent late Friday.

You Paid $1,000 for an iPhone, but Apple Still Controls It

SAN FRANCISCO — For a decade, it was easy to get help repairing an iPhone. Cracked screens could be replaced in minutes, and broken cameras could be exchanged without a hitch.
But since 2017, iPhone repairs have been a minefield. New batteries can trigger warning messages, replacement screens can disable a phone’s brightness settings, and substitute selfie cameras can malfunction.
The breakdowns are an outgrowth of Apple’s practice of writing software that gives it control over iPhones even after someone has bought one. Unlike cars, which can be repaired with generic parts by auto shops and do-it-yourself mechanics, new iPhones are coded to recognize the serial numbers for original components and may malfunction if the parts are changed.
This year, seven iPhone parts can trigger issues during repairs, up from three in 2017, when the company introduced a facial recognition system to unlock the device, according to iFixit, a company that analyzes iPhone components and sells parts for do-it-yourself repairs. The rate at which parts can cause breakdowns has been rising about 20% a year since 2016, when only one repair caused a problem.
In a series of tests, iFixit determines which parts cause issues when swapped between working iPhones of the same model. The results reveal that the number of malfunctions has increased with later iPhone generations.
The software phenomenon, which is known as parts pairing, has encouraged Apple customers to turn to its stores or authorized repair centers, which charge higher prices for parts and labor. In recent years, only approved parts and sanctioned repairs have avoided the problems. Replacing a shattered screen typically costs nearly $300, about $100 more than work done by an independent shop using a third-party screen.
To put it another way: The cost of replacing a cracked screen on a year-old iPhone 14 is nearly equivalent to the phone’s value, which Apple appraises at $430 in trade-in credit.
Apple’s grip on the repairs creates an incentive for customers to spend up to $200 on device insurance, known as AppleCare, which provides free battery replacements and screen repairs. Apple collects an estimated $9 billion annually for the service.
It has also spurred questions about Apple’s commitment to sustainability, with independent repair advocates saying the company could more effectively meet its goals of reducing carbon emissions by lowering repair costs to encourage people to maintain devices rather than buy new ones.
An Apple spokesperson said the company supported a customer’s right to repair a device and had created a self-service repair program to help. “We have been innovating to offer our customers the best choice and options when their product needs service,” he said.
State lawmakers from New York to California have responded with laws that aim to make repairs easier. The Biden administration has encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to advance rules that would stop smartphone makers from restricting independent repairs. But most of the regulations don’t include explicit restrictions on parts pairing.
Using software to control repairs has become commonplace across electronics, appliances and heavy machinery as faster chips and cheaper memory turn everyday products into miniature computers. HP has used a similar practice to encourage people to buy its ink cartridges over lower-priced alternatives. Tesla has incorporated it into many cars. And John Deere has put it in farm equipment, disabling machines that aren’t fixed by company repair workers.
Apple and other companies have defended the practice by saying it protects customers’ safety and the company’s brand. Shoddy parts, like a faulty face scanner, could compromise the phone’s security, and if an independent shop messes up a repair, the customer often blames Apple instead of the shop, the company has said. The practice also allows Apple to create a record of parts in the device, which can be helpful to buyers of secondhand phones.
But the increase of pairing parts with software has animated a movement that wants to make repairs cheaper and easier. Proponents, which include iFixit, say it would be better for the environment and customers’ wallets to extend the life of devices. They have urged lawmakers to simplify repairs, asking: “Who owns the device after it’s been purchased? The customer or the manufacturer?”
“You basically have to ask permission before doing a repair,” said Nathan Proctor, who has lobbied states for repair legislation on behalf of U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit largely funded by small donors.
When Apple expanded its software limits in 2017, it upended repair businesses. Shakeel Taiyab said iPhone repairs at his independent shop in south San Francisco had decreased about 15% this year. Some customers with issues like cracked screens keep using the phones because they find repairing or replacing it unaffordable.
Free Geek, a nonprofit based in Portland, Oregon, that donates repaired computers and smartphones to underprivileged people, decided that Apple’s software made iPhones too difficult to service, said Amber Brink, Free Geek’s director of technology.
Last year, Free Geek received thousands of donated iPhones but repurposed only 280, Brink said. “It’s a headache,” she added.
Consumers who opt against paying top dollar for an Apple-authorized repair may suffer the consequences. In February, after Gio Grimaldi, a 15-year-old in New Hampshire, shattered the screen of his iPhone SE on a snowboarding trip, he took it to a nearby repair shop.
He said the closest Apple Store was 90 minutes away and had quoted $130 for replacing the screen — 40% higher than the independent store. When he took the phone home, it worked fine but was lacking True Tone, a software feature that adjusts the screen’s brightness and color to match the ambient lighting.
“That’s just plain stupid,” he said. “I always love Apple as a company, but they’re really stuck up about third-party repairs.”
Over the past year, New York, Minnesota and California passed bills requiring that electronics manufacturers provide parts, tools and manuals to third parties.
After years of lobbying against such rules, Apple signed on to support California’s law and honor it across the United States. It has also encouraged the federal government to adopt similar rules, said Brian Naumann, the head of Apple’s repair service efforts, who spoke about the right to repairs during a White House event last month.
“Apple has taken significant steps to expand options for consumers to repair their devices, which we know is good for consumers’ budgets and good for the environment,” Naumann said.
But the California legislation failed to directly address Apple’s practice of using software to control the repair process. In Oregon, state Sen. Janeen Sollman, a Democrat representing an area outside Portland, is part of a group of lawmakers aiming to pass a state law that would prohibit Apple and others from having restrictions on repairs.
As the Oregon legislation has progressed, Apple has encouraged lawmakers to scale it back. Apple paid for a half dozen legislators to visit its Silicon Valley headquarters this year, and tried to impress on them how important security and safety were to repairs, Sollman said.
She left California unpersuaded. “I said, ‘You’re making it more accessible, but it’s not a true right to repair if you have ultimate control,’” Sollman said.

SAN FRANCISCO — For a decade, it was easy to get help repairing an iPhone. Cracked screens could be replaced in minutes, and broken cameras could be exchanged without a hitch.
But since 2017, iPhone repairs have been a minefield. New batteries can trigger warning messages, replacement screens can disable a phone’s brightness settings, and substitute selfie cameras can malfunction.
The breakdowns are an outgrowth of Apple’s practice of writing software that gives it control over iPhones even after someone has bought one. Unlike cars, which can be repaired with generic parts by auto shops and do-it-yourself mechanics, new iPhones are coded to recognize the serial numbers for original components and may malfunction if the parts are changed.
This year, seven iPhone parts can trigger issues during repairs, up from three in 2017, when the company introduced a facial recognition system to unlock the device, according to iFixit, a company that analyzes iPhone components and sells parts for do-it-yourself repairs. The rate at which parts can cause breakdowns has been rising about 20% a year since 2016, when only one repair caused a problem.
In a series of tests, iFixit determines which parts cause issues when swapped between working iPhones of the same model. The results reveal that the number of malfunctions has increased with later iPhone generations.
The software phenomenon, which is known as parts pairing, has encouraged Apple customers to turn to its stores or authorized repair centers, which charge higher prices for parts and labor. In recent years, only approved parts and sanctioned repairs have avoided the problems. Replacing a shattered screen typically costs nearly $300, about $100 more than work done by an independent shop using a third-party screen.
To put it another way: The cost of replacing a cracked screen on a year-old iPhone 14 is nearly equivalent to the phone’s value, which Apple appraises at $430 in trade-in credit.
Apple’s grip on the repairs creates an incentive for customers to spend up to $200 on device insurance, known as AppleCare, which provides free battery replacements and screen repairs. Apple collects an estimated $9 billion annually for the service.
It has also spurred questions about Apple’s commitment to sustainability, with independent repair advocates saying the company could more effectively meet its goals of reducing carbon emissions by lowering repair costs to encourage people to maintain devices rather than buy new ones.
An Apple spokesperson said the company supported a customer’s right to repair a device and had created a self-service repair program to help. “We have been innovating to offer our customers the best choice and options when their product needs service,” he said.
State lawmakers from New York to California have responded with laws that aim to make repairs easier. The Biden administration has encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to advance rules that would stop smartphone makers from restricting independent repairs. But most of the regulations don’t include explicit restrictions on parts pairing.
Using software to control repairs has become commonplace across electronics, appliances and heavy machinery as faster chips and cheaper memory turn everyday products into miniature computers. HP has used a similar practice to encourage people to buy its ink cartridges over lower-priced alternatives. Tesla has incorporated it into many cars. And John Deere has put it in farm equipment, disabling machines that aren’t fixed by company repair workers.
Apple and other companies have defended the practice by saying it protects customers’ safety and the company’s brand. Shoddy parts, like a faulty face scanner, could compromise the phone’s security, and if an independent shop messes up a repair, the customer often blames Apple instead of the shop, the company has said. The practice also allows Apple to create a record of parts in the device, which can be helpful to buyers of secondhand phones.
But the increase of pairing parts with software has animated a movement that wants to make repairs cheaper and easier. Proponents, which include iFixit, say it would be better for the environment and customers’ wallets to extend the life of devices. They have urged lawmakers to simplify repairs, asking: “Who owns the device after it’s been purchased? The customer or the manufacturer?”
“You basically have to ask permission before doing a repair,” said Nathan Proctor, who has lobbied states for repair legislation on behalf of U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit largely funded by small donors.
When Apple expanded its software limits in 2017, it upended repair businesses. Shakeel Taiyab said iPhone repairs at his independent shop in south San Francisco had decreased about 15% this year. Some customers with issues like cracked screens keep using the phones because they find repairing or replacing it unaffordable.
Free Geek, a nonprofit based in Portland, Oregon, that donates repaired computers and smartphones to underprivileged people, decided that Apple’s software made iPhones too difficult to service, said Amber Brink, Free Geek’s director of technology.
Last year, Free Geek received thousands of donated iPhones but repurposed only 280, Brink said. “It’s a headache,” she added.
Consumers who opt against paying top dollar for an Apple-authorized repair may suffer the consequences. In February, after Gio Grimaldi, a 15-year-old in New Hampshire, shattered the screen of his iPhone SE on a snowboarding trip, he took it to a nearby repair shop.
He said the closest Apple Store was 90 minutes away and had quoted $130 for replacing the screen — 40% higher than the independent store. When he took the phone home, it worked fine but was lacking True Tone, a software feature that adjusts the screen’s brightness and color to match the ambient lighting.
“That’s just plain stupid,” he said. “I always love Apple as a company, but they’re really stuck up about third-party repairs.”
Over the past year, New York, Minnesota and California passed bills requiring that electronics manufacturers provide parts, tools and manuals to third parties.
After years of lobbying against such rules, Apple signed on to support California’s law and honor it across the United States. It has also encouraged the federal government to adopt similar rules, said Brian Naumann, the head of Apple’s repair service efforts, who spoke about the right to repairs during a White House event last month.
“Apple has taken significant steps to expand options for consumers to repair their devices, which we know is good for consumers’ budgets and good for the environment,” Naumann said.
But the California legislation failed to directly address Apple’s practice of using software to control the repair process. In Oregon, state Sen. Janeen Sollman, a Democrat representing an area outside Portland, is part of a group of lawmakers aiming to pass a state law that would prohibit Apple and others from having restrictions on repairs.
As the Oregon legislation has progressed, Apple has encouraged lawmakers to scale it back. Apple paid for a half dozen legislators to visit its Silicon Valley headquarters this year, and tried to impress on them how important security and safety were to repairs, Sollman said.
She left California unpersuaded. “I said, ‘You’re making it more accessible, but it’s not a true right to repair if you have ultimate control,’” Sollman said.

Full text: Sometimes landlords must be reminded that they are accountable to the city, not just to their tenants.
Q: I have been dealing with an infestation of mice for three months, and I'm at my wit's end. I'm 70 years old and have lived in my rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan for 35 years. I've discovered mounds of mouse feces behind my sofa, under radiators and in the kitchen. I demanded that the stove be replaced, which it was, but another mouse died somewhere in the new oven and management is refusing to replace that oven. They sent an exterminator to put down poison boxes, and someone else came to close up holes, to no avail. I've called 311 and three housing inspectors have been here. I have also consulted a lawyer, but realized I can't afford one. I am sickened from inhaling mouse feces, and I think my landlord would be happy if I left so they could have the apartment back.
A: The infestation you describe can indeed be hazardous to your health, but you don't have to put up with it.
"All landlords must follow the law and make sure apartments aren't overrun by pests because New Yorkers deserve a healthy, safe place to call home," said Natasha Kersey, deputy press secretary for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
City laws protect tenants from living with insects, mice and rats, because these vermin can spoil your food, damage your home and make asthma and allergies worse.
You have exhausted the first two steps, which are reaching out to the landlord and calling 311 to make a complaint. If the landlord fails to correct a violation by the date issued by the housing inspector, you can file what's called an HP proceeding in the housing court in your borough. Agencies in every borough provide free legal assistance for tenants who qualify, though many tenants represent themselves for proceedings in which they are seeking repairs. To strengthen your case, save photos, videos and documentation of your correspondence with your landlord and superintendent.
Ami Shah, deputy director of Legal Services NYC's citywide housing practice, which provides free legal help to low-income New Yorkers, said that housing court proceedings are helpful in resolving these kinds of situations. That's because a judge issues deadlines for the landlord to act, the repairs are monitored, and the landlord faces fines if the issue is not fixed. If the landlord does not comply, you can pursue civil penalties.
Housing court helps remind landlords that they are accountable to the city, not just to you.
"They have to fix it," Ms. Shah said.

Remote Class Exacerbated Inequalities, Report Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Heavy reliance on online remote learning during the pandemic drew attention away from more equitable ways of teaching children at home, a UNESCO report says.
In early 2020, as the coronavirus spread, schools around the world abruptly halted in-person education. To many governments and parents, moving classes online seemed the obvious stopgap solution.
In the United States, school districts scrambled to secure digital devices for students. Almost overnight, videoconferencing software like Zoom became the main platform teachers used to deliver real-time instruction to students at home.
Now a report from UNESCO, the United Nations' educational and cultural organization, says that overreliance on remote learning technology during the pandemic led to "staggering" education inequality around the world. It was, according to a 655-page report that UNESCO released on Wednesday, a worldwide "ed-tech tragedy."
The report, from UNESCO's Future of Education division, is likely to add fuel to the debate over how governments and local school districts handled pandemic restrictions, and whether it would have been better for some countries to reopen schools for in-person instruction sooner.
The UNESCO researchers argued in the report that "unprecedented" dependence on technology -- intended to ensure that children could continue their schooling -- worsened disparities and learning loss for hundreds of millions of students around the world, including in Kenya, Brazil, Britain and the United States.
The promotion of remote online learning as the primary solution for pandemic schooling also hindered public discussion of more equitable, lower-tech alternatives, such as regularly providing schoolwork packets for every student, delivering school lessons by radio or television -- and reopening schools sooner for in-person classes, the researchers said.
"Available evidence strongly indicates that the bright spots of the ed-tech experiences during the pandemic, while important and deserving of attention, were vastly eclipsed by failure," the UNESCO report said.
The UNESCO researchers recommended that education officials prioritize in-person instruction with teachers, not online platforms, as the primary driver of student learning. And they encouraged schools to ensure that emerging technologies like A.I. chatbots concretely benefitted students before introducing them for educational use.
Education and industry experts welcomed the report, saying more research on the effects of pandemic learning was needed.
"The report's conclusion -- that societies must be vigilant about the ways digital tools are reshaping education -- is incredibly important," said Paul Lekas, the head of global public policy for the Software & Information Industry Association, a group whose members include Amazon, Apple and Google. "There are lots of lessons that can be learned from how digital education occurred during the pandemic and ways in which to lessen the digital divide."
Jean-Claude Brizard, the chief executive of Digital Promise, a nonprofit education group that has received funding from Google, HP and Verizon, acknowledged that "technology is not a cure-all." But he also said that while school systems were largely unprepared for the pandemic, online education tools helped foster "more individualized, enhanced learning experiences as schools shifted to virtual classrooms."
Education International, an umbrella organization for about 380 teachers' unions and 32 million teachers worldwide, said the UNESCO report underlined the importance of in-person, face-to-face teaching.
"The report tells us definitively what we already know to be true, a place called school matters," said Haldis Holst, the group's deputy general secretary. "Education is not transactional nor is it simply content delivery. It is relational. It is social. It is human at its core."
Here are some of the main findings in the report:
The promise of education technology was overstated.
For more than a decade, Silicon Valley tech giants as well as industry-financed nonprofit groups and think tanks have promoted computers, apps and internet access in public schools as innovations that would quickly democratize and modernize student learning.
Many promised that such digital tools would allow schoolchildren to more easily pursue their interests, learn at their own pace and receive instant automated feedback on their work from learning analytics algorithms.
The report's findings challenge the view that digital technologies are synonymous with educational equality and progress.
The report said that when coronavirus cases began spiking in early 2020, the overselling of ed-tech tools helped make remote online learning seem like the most appealing and effective solution for pandemic schooling even as more equitable, lower-tech options were available.
Remote online learning worsened education disparities.
UNESCO researchers found the shift to remote online learning tended to provide substantial advantages to children in wealthier households while disadvantaging those in lower-income families.
By May 2020, the report said, 60 percent of national remote learning programs "relied exclusively" on internet-connected platforms. But nearly half a billion young people -- about half the primary and secondary students worldwide -- targeted by those remote learning programs lacked internet connections at home, the report said, excluding them from participating.
According to data and surveys cited in the report, one-third of kindergarten through 12th-grade students in the United States "were cut off from education" in 2020 because of inadequate internet connections or hardware. In 2021 in Pakistan, 30 percent of households said they were aware of remote learning programs while fewer than half of this group had the technology needed to participate.
Learning was hindered and altered.
Student learning outcomes stalled or "declined dramatically" when schools deployed ed tech as a replacement for in-person instruction, the UNESCO researchers said, even when children had access to digital devices and internet connections.
The report also said students learning online spent considerably less time on formal educational tasks -- and more time on monotonous digital tasks. It described a daily learning routine "less of discovery and exploration than traversing file-sharing systems, moving through automated learning content, checking for updates on corporate platforms and enduring long video calls."
Remote online learning also limited or curtailed student opportunities for socialization and nonacademic activities, the report said, causing many students to become disengaged or drop out of school.
The report warned that the shift to remote learning also gave a handful of tech platforms -- like Google and Zoom -- extraordinary influence in schools. These digital systems often imposed private business values and agendas, the report added, that were at odds with the "humanistic" values of public schooling.
Regulation and guardrails are needed.
To prevent a repeat scenario, the researchers recommended that schools prioritize the best interests of schoolchildren as the central criteria for deploying ed tech.
In practical terms, the researchers called for more regulation and guardrails around online learning tools. They also suggested that districts give teachers more say over which digital tools schools adopt and how they are used.

Markets Chip Away at August's Losses: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/markets-chip-away-at-augusts-losses/docview/2858832117/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks ended modestly higher Wednesday, extending Wall Street's recent winning streak to its fourth day and chipping away more of the market's losses this month.
After a choppy day of trading, the S&P 500 closed 0.4 percent higher. The benchmark index remains down 1.6 percent for August, with one trading day left in the month. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent.
Technology stocks led the market's gains. Apple rose 1.9 percent and Palo Alto Networks rose 1.7 percent. HP was on the losing end with a 6.6 percent slump after cutting its profit forecast for the year.
Investors' focus this week remains a broad mix of data they hope will paint a clearer picture of where the economy is headed and whether the Federal Reserve has enough reason to hold off on further interest rate hikes.
A survey of private-sector employers in the U.S. showed that hiring cooled more than expected by economists. The report reinforces the latest government data on job openings from Tuesday, which also showed that hiring is cooling somewhat.
The U.S. downgraded its economic growth estimate for the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.1 percent from 2.4 percent. Economists had forecast that the gross domestic product assessment would remain unchanged though it still marks a slight increase from growth of 2 percent during the first quarter.
Treasury yields fell following the latest economic reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.11 percent from about 4.15 percent just before the latest G.D.P. report. It stood at 4.12 percent late Tuesday.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.88 percent from 4.90 percent before the latest G.D.P. release. It stood at 4.89 percent late Tuesday.
"Right now, what's bad is good," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "It feels like this week, anyway, we're fully back into bad economic news is good for the market."
The latest round of economic updates are signaling that the Fed may be able to pause hiking its main interest rate, which it has pushed to its highest level since 2001 in an effort to tame inflation. The central bank held rates steady at its last meeting and investors expect the same at its upcoming meeting in September.
Wall Street is also hoping that economic data this week shows that the Fed's goal of a "soft landing" is possible. The central bank's goal has been to raise interest rates enough to tame inflation without crashing the economy into a recession. A strong job market and consumer spending has helped thwart a recession, and analysts are divided on whether one will occur with any severity.
On Thursday, the government will release its latest update on inflation with the July report on personal consumption and expenditures, or P.C.E. That's the Fed's preferred measure for inflation, and it has been cooling for months. P.C.E. eased to 3 percent in June and was as a high as 7 percent a year ago.
On Friday, the government's monthly employment report for August will cap a heavy week of updates about hiring and jobs.
"If you have modest growth and modest inflation, and that's what we're moving toward, stocks will have a bumpy road in the interim, but that's a good environment for stocks," Mr. Wren said.
Market jitters over the possibility that interest rates end up staying higher for longer led to a pullback for stocks this month. Even so, the S&P 500, which soared 19.5 percent through July, remains about 17.6 percent higher for the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up nearly 34 percent.
The S&P 500 rose 17.24 points to 4,514.87, the Dow added 37.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 34,890.24, and the Nasdaq gained 75.55 points to 14,019.31.

It's Kind of Like a 'Little Theater' on the Patio: [Real Estate Desk]

Author: Roach, Margaret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They may not be the showiest thing on the patio, but these miniature landscapes inevitably take center stage: "It's about being in Lilliputian land."
If you can make space for a miniature rock garden -- one of tiny plants growing within the confines of a faux-stone trough -- the promise of an outsize payoff awaits.
Inside the walls of a trough you can simulate the conditions required to grow choice species that would sulk in most in-ground beds: certain colorful, sculptural succulents, as well as alpines from the harsh, exposed environment above the tree line.
And then there's what Lori Chips, of Oliver Nurseries, in Fairfield, Conn., calls "the little theater" factor.
Trough gardens attract an audience, you see.
Ms. Chips tells the story of a designer and customer she had known for years who had never planted a trough, despite his extensive garden-making experience. He bought a cylindrical one made of hypertufa -- a cement-and-peat mixture that simulates the look of stone -- and a miniature creeping thyme to put in it. A modest start, to be sure.
On a return visit to the nursery, where Ms. Chips has worked for 27 years, he recounted his trough debut. He had set the vessel on his patio, where there were larger containers of showier plants, but it was the little trough that got the most attention from visitors.
"Every person who walked in would say, 'What is that?"' he reported. "Because it was featured in a trough."
At Oliver Nurseries, the alpines and plants that favor trough-like conditions are a small part of the vast offerings, as they have been since the nursery opened nearly 60 years ago. These diminutive stars can be seen spilling out of pockets in a 35-foot-long rock retaining wall, in the gravel bed above it and, of course, in troughs and more troughs.
Selling tiny plants may not be the mainstay of the business, "but it's one cachet cow," Ms. Chips joked. The nursery, in a bucolic setting that feels like an old garden, attracts a clientele that includes beginning gardeners and connoisseurs who come for the carefully curated selection and the depth of staff expertise.
It's no surprise that rock-garden plants are an indelible element of the Oliver DNA: Early on, the nursery's founder, John Oliver, hired Eleanor Spingarn, who is credited with starting the Connecticut chapter of the North American Rock Garden Society. Ms. Spingarn built and planted the rock wall in the 1970s.
The showy dry-laid wall, studded with flowering perennials and succulents of distinctive geometry, was restored and replanted this year, one of various projects tackled by the nursery's new owners, Jed Duguid and Will Hibbs, who bought the retail and landscaping business last year. The two were longtime employees of the previous owner, Mr. Duguid said, and aim to continue the nursery's traditions.
"We try to be a plantsman's nursery," he said. "And to have some more unique things throughout that would be difficult to find elsewhere."
Including Ms. Chips, and her infectious love of alpines.
Trough-Garden Basics
Ms. Chips has helped keep the alpine-and-trough tradition going strong at the nursery, and in 2018, her passion yielded a book, "Hypertufa Containers: Creating and Planting an Alpine Trough Garden." It details every aspect of the process, beginning with how to blend Portland cement, peat moss and fiber mesh (a poly-fiber reinforcing material) to mold the troughs.
Inspired by old stone sinks and farmyard water troughs of another era, these containers have walls that are thicker than those of a basic flower pot. They're also weather resistant.
But "not weatherproof," Ms. Chips stressed.
That is particularly true if the troughs are left to winter in a very exposed spot, she added, "like up on a deck, where the cold wind blows beneath them all winter," increasing freeze-thaw stressors.
Even for those who buy a premade container, some tips in the book -- the same advice she gives customers seeking help with container design or care -- stand out as essential for success.
First: It may be tempting to turn a shallow concrete birdbath into a trough, but think again. While plants of alpine heritage may look compact aboveground, like tight cushions or mats, their roots need room to run.
Up in the mountains, they cling to "pockets in shifting scree, where gravel and rocks form barely the idea of soil," Ms. Chips said. "The roots of the plants have evolved to go a yard wide and deep, where they find the coolness and the drainage."
A trough that has at least six inches of inside depth is recommended; one with 10 is better. Put a piece of window screening in the bottom to limit drainage-hole clogs.
The planting medium that Ms. Chips uses starts with a peat-based commercial potting soil, like Pro-Mix's HP or BX formulas. If the brand of available potting soil doesn't contain perlite, she lightens it with some, so that perlite is as much as a quarter of the blend. Next, she adds quarter-inch-diameter pea gravel (also about a quarter of the total volume of the potting medium she's mixing up). The gravel has multiple benefits, resulting in fewer plant losses, especially over the winter, because the plants stay put better.
"Freezing and thawing is mitigated, because there's some stone in there," Ms. Chips said. "I think the roots get tangled around little pebbles, like an anchor."
A layer of gravel is applied on top after planting -- and not just for aesthetics. "It also helps keep the roots cool," she said, "and weights the plants down."
When you're planting a wall garden, she said, even more gravel goes into the mix -- as much as three-quarters gravel to one-quarter purchased weed- and pathogen-free soil.
Customers with existing walls often ask the nursery staff about planting them. The staff's advice: Free-standing stone walls make better homes for chipmunks than for plants. An unmortared retaining wall, however, is fair game.
Planting during a wall's construction yields the best results. But here's a trick to try with an existing wall: Lift a few capstones (preferably those that have settled a bit lower than the rest) to make planting pockets for cascading plants. Line the uncovered spot with some of that soil mix. Then place the plants inside, with their roots gently teased apart and their crowns flush with the wall face. Cover with a bit more mix, then replace the capstone and gently water the area.
Picking the Plants
The spring bloomers in that wall at Oliver Nurseries include purple-flowered Dalmatian bellflower (Campanula portenschlagiana) and the chain-like golden flowers of Chiastophyllum oppositifolium. Like other perennials that often find their way into troughs -- pinks (Dianthus), for instance, and thrift (Armeria) -- they are attention grabbers.
But remember: Those blooms don't last long.
"No alpines are going to bloom all season," Ms. Chips said. "So you need to fall in love with each plant for its texture and habit."
Hardiness is another consideration. Any plant growing outdoors year-round in a container -- trough or otherwise -- should be at least a zone hardier than the local one, because its roots won't have the earth's insulation. And even if certain species are technically hardy enough, they may be extra vulnerable to winter wet. That includes most plants with silvery leaves or a fuzzy surface.
When customers seek design help, Ms. Chips offers this basic advice: "I'll say, 'Include a hardy shrub, two other flowering plants, or a drooler or mound."'
A "drooler"?
Yes, you heard that right: She's talking about the tiniest thymes, like the variety Elfin, or madwort (Alyssum wulfenianum), and some of the ground-cover sedums. They soften the rim of a trough and spill over, as if liquid onto solid. With the low-growing sedums, seek those that don't bloom early -- or a lot.
As for the "mound," one possibility is a rosette-shaped succulent, like Sempervivum, Rosularia or Jovibarba. But when you're shopping for those, steer away from a pot filled by a single rosette. "Don't buy one pot with one giant artichoke in it, I tell customers -- you will lose everything," she said.
Such succulents are monocarpic, meaning they die after flowering. Instead, buy a pot with various sizes of a particular succulent in it, and encourage them to colonize in your trough by periodically popping some babies off the mother plant and tucking them in nearby.
Conifers are another element frequently used in troughs and other rock gardens, including gravel gardens and crevice gardens. These diminutive trees add year-round structure.
Ms. Chips recommends varieties that are not just dwarf (slow growing), but true miniatures (meaning they never get very big), like Jean's Dilly white spruce (Picea glauca). Other favorites: a distinctive mugo pine (Pinus mugo Slowmound) and Chinese juniper (Juniperus chinensis Shimpaku).
Miniature irises are another possibility. They do better in troughs than in the ground, Ms. Chips said. But to her eye, they don't work well in a trough that includes a conifer, unless it's a big container. Otherwise, the two will fight for the honor of being the upright, architectural element of the show.
"Having both will throw the aesthetic off," she said.
The visual goal, she reminded us: "It's about being in Lilliputian land -- about making your trough believable, a miniature landscape."

Walk in Highland Park Honors Victims One Year After Parade Tragedy: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Residents of the Chicago suburb marched down Central Avenue as they do every Fourth of July. But this was no parade.
There were no marching bands this year. No floats. No church groups tossing snacks to spectators. No American flags lining the sidewalks.
Instead, there were prayers. There were tears. And there was a somber stroll down Central Avenue, a collective effort to take back a parade route that was stolen in a storm of bullets.
Over generations in Highland Park, Ill., a quaint parade through downtown became synonymous with the Fourth of July.
But in less than a minute last Independence Day, a gunman firing from a rooftop killed seven people, wounded dozens and sent families scrambling for cover, leaving water bottles and red-white-and-blue lawn chairs scattered on the ground.
As the first anniversary of the massacre approached, city leaders faced a seemingly impossible set of demands: Honor the people who died. Reclaim the parade's path through downtown. Give people space to celebrate the country's birthday. And support residents of the Chicago suburb still carrying devastating wounds, mental and physical, from last year.
"When there are mass shootings in this country, a day or two later, people move on," Mayor Nancy Rotering said. "But those communities that are directly impacted are carrying this pain and this trauma forevermore."
Among the hundreds who gathered on the lawn of City Hall for a remembrance ceremony on Tuesday were residents who last July 4 were in the line of fire. Jeffrey Briel, who described taking cover with his young grandchildren not far from the gunman, said reminders of the shooting were everywhere -- in pock marks in the downtown square left by bullets, in a temporary memorial that now sits beside City Hall. Highland Park was still grieving, he said.
"I want 2024 to be back to having a parade," said Mr. Briel, who like many was wearing a hat that said "HP Strong." "So maybe this is a way of starting the healing process a little bit."
A year ago, the Rev. Hernan Cuevas was just a few days into his tenure as pastor of a Roman Catholic parish in Highland Park when the parade took place. Mr. Cuevas had rounded up congregants for the church float and bought granola bars to hand out to people along the route. Then he heard what sounded like fireworks.
He said it was not until he saw "a wave of people walking toward us, running, crying" that "we thought, 'These are not fireworks. This is for real."'
They fled a couple of blocks to the church, where a mix of members and other paradegoers, some with blood on their clothes, waited for hours while the authorities searched for the gunman. They prayed the rosary. They looked nervously at the news on their phones.
Mr. Cuevas said his congregants had processed the trauma from that day differently, and had different ideas about how to observe this Fourth of July. Some wanted to return to normal. Some wanted space to grieve. Others left town for the holiday, seeking distance from the pain.
"It brings back again some of the memories," Mr. Cuevas said of the anniversary. "It triggers some of the emotions of loss and fear."
On Tuesday, many residents voiced grief and trauma infused with a sense of anger that the accused gunman, a local resident who had previously drawn the attention of the authorities, was still able to buy and use a high-powered gun, according to prosecutors. The accused, Robert E. Crimo III, faces 117 criminal charges, including murder, and has pleaded not guilty.
Long before the massacre, Highland Park, an affluent and politically liberal lakefront city of about 30,000 people, was a center of a national push for stricter gun laws. The city passed a municipal ban on certain high-powered rifles that led to a legal fight.
After the killings last year, local officials pushed the Democrats in control of state government in Illinois to tighten the state's gun laws, which were already among the country's most restrictive. In January, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a law banning the sale of many high-powered rifles, which gun rights supporters have challenged in court. Mayor Rotering, a Democrat, has called for a national ban on such weapons.
"Somebody with a legally obtained weapon can choose to end a broad swath of a community's life," she said. "That to me is a human rights violation."
Many residents wore shirts on Tuesday morning calling for stricter gun laws, and some held a demonstration in Highland Park in the afternoon.
Last year, Dani Cohn, a Highland Park native, was sitting in a lawn chair outside a pancake house with family members, including Jacquelyn Sundheim, when the gunfire started.
Though Ms. Cohn escaped physical injury, Ms. Sundheim, who was known as Jacki and who coordinated events at a local synagogue, was killed. Ms. Cohn recalled performing CPR and grabbing supplies from an ambulance in an attempt to save her life.
Ms. Cohn said it was important for her to be at the commemorations on Tuesday and to attend the protest calling for stricter gun laws, which her sibling, Lexi, organized.
"I am just kind of meeting myself where I'm at," Dani Cohn said. "I don't want to remember the Fourth of July as just being this tragedy. I want to remember and take action. Do something."
As July 4 approached this year, city officials decided it was too soon to hold a parade again, but also important to gather. In addition to somber morning events, the city scheduled a drone show and a concert for the evening, giving residents a chance to celebrate the holiday without the noise of fireworks, which still sets many residents on edge.
Ghida Neukirch, the city manager, said residents of Highland Park did not want their city to be defined by the tragedy. But in planning for the holiday, officials had to take stock of the trauma people still carry, especially in large crowds.
"I was at my daughter's graduation," Ms. Neukirch said, "and I'm thinking about, how will I escape here? And how can I protect my family if a shooter starts shooting among this crowd?"
For some who lost loved ones, the shooting profoundly reshaped how they thought about Highland Park. As children, Jon and Peter Straus sometimes attended the parade with their father, Stephen Straus. He was among those killed last July 4.
The elder Mr. Straus, who at age 88 still commuted by train to his job as a financial adviser in downtown Chicago, was a familiar face in Highland Park, where he took long walks around town.
"We were with him the night before he died, and he told me he was going to the parade, and it didn't surprise me," Jon Straus said in a recent interview. "He just liked to be out and about. He liked to be where the action was."
The Straus family is one of several who have sued a gun manufacturer over the shooting, claiming that irresponsible marketing of the high-powered rifle used that day helped lead to the tragedy. The violence also changed the brothers' relationship with their hometown. A few weeks ago, the family sold their childhood home.

Native Plants Go Wild at the Office As Companies Shift Their Priorities: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At its former headquarters in eastern Pennsylvania, Air Products had a neatly manicured lawn and boxwood hedges. But when the industrial gases company moved to nearby Allentown recently and erected a new office building, it tried something different.
Rather than plant grass that would need constant watering, mowing and fertilizing, it turned to native plants that pretty much took care of themselves. Today, shoulder-high grasses wave in the wind and attract wildlife.
"One plant had yellow finches all around it," said Patrick J. Garay, vice president of strategic projects at Air Products.
Forget the fuss. Corporate landscapes are going natural these days.
The shift -- mirroring what's happening at public parks, on university campuses and in homeowners' backyards -- is being driven by a growing awareness of the environmental costs of installing and maintaining lawns, clipped hedges and tidy flower borders. New laws ban the use of water for "useless" grass in drought-prone areas, and company sustainability programs encompass the land the buildings sit on. Apps calculate the carbon footprint of landscapes in much the same way that buildings are monitored for greenhouse gas emissions.
"There's a lot more science and ecological rigor behind planting design," said Michael Grove, the chair of landscape architecture, civil engineering and ecology at Sasaki, a design firm that has been involved in developing two carbon-tracking apps.
The pushback against conventional landscaping might surprise those who assume that all green plants must be equally good for the planet.
But as manicured lawns give way to meadows and borders of annuals are replaced by wild and woolly native plants, a looser, some might say messier, aesthetic is taking hold. Call it the horticultural equivalent of bedhead.
The new wave of landscape design is reacting to the image of a corporate campus from the mid-20th century. Buildings often sit in velvety emerald carpets that contribute to the more than 40 million acres of lawn in America. Can the public get used to the new look?
"It requires a significant mind-set shift," said José Almiñana, a principal at Andropogon, the landscape architecture firm that designed Air Products' site.
Kentucky bluegrass, a common lawn grass, draws carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But propagating the same grass species everywhere comes at the expense of native plants that are in tune with the local climate and provide food and habitat for endangered birds, bees and butterflies. And then there's the environmental cost of keeping lawns lush -- the endless watering, weed killing, mowing and blowing.
Landscape equipment emits nearly 27 million tons of pollutants a year, according to estimates. One gas-powered leaf blower used for an hour generates the same amount of emissions as a car driving 1,100 miles.
As the climate crisis has grown increasingly dire, many companies have turned to their landscapes to help them hit sustainability targets and vaunt their environmental bona fides.
"The building reaches a private audience, but the landscape is visible to the public," said Barbara Deutsch, chief executive of Landscape Architecture Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
At Ford Motor's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., lawn is everywhere. But after the company released a campus master plan that proposed more "natural environments," it decided to rethink the 20 acres of grass at an arboretum. The lawn under and around the trees sometimes had to be mowed "multiple times a week," said Christopher Small, Ford's design manager for global campus master planning and architecture.
Working with the landscape architecture firm OJB, Ford expanded the arboretum site and regraded it to include ponds to capture and filter storm water. The company planted prairie grasses and wildflowers and threaded walking paths through the foot-high meadow that now needs mowing only twice a year.
"Fifteen years ago when we proposed something like that, we would get a lot of strange looks," James Burnett, president of OJB, said. "It's a much easier sell now."
In a 2021 survey of more than 500 members of the American Society of Landscape Architects, a professional organization, three-quarters said they had more clients requesting design solutions to address climate change than they did the previous year.
State and local regulations are also promoting change.
Storm water management requirements have spurred the creation of vegetated ditches known as bioswales to reduce runoff when it rains. A new Nevada law will prohibit using water from the Colorado River, which has been shrinking from decades of overuse and drought worsened by climate change, to irrigate "nonfunctional, or "useless," grass. Property owners who replace nonnative grass, shrubs and trees with desert plants can get rebates on their water bills.
Los Angeles has enrolled 298 commercial, industrial and institutional customers in its own rebate program since 2015, with companies getting $ 5 per square foot to swap out turf for California poppies and other drought-tolerant and native plants, said Terrence McCarthy, manager of the city's water resources policy. Companies that made the switch no longer have to run sprinklers all the time, reducing their water bills, he added.
The U.S. Green Building Council, which administers the LEED certification for sustainable buildings, has a comparable program, SITES, for landscapes that promote biodiversity, conserve resources and protect ecosystems. Of the 317 projects enrolled in the program, 11 percent are commercial, Danielle Pieranunzi, the program's director, said. "It's not just designing for aesthetics," she added.
Hewlett-Packard received a SITES certification for its Boise, Idaho, campus after working with the landscape architecture firm Stack Rock Group to replace turf grass with a native seed mix that reduced water use and mowing -- cutting landscaping costs nearly 50 percent and emissions 90 percent. One thing that increased: honey production for the campus beekeeping club, presumably because the pollinating insects had a buffet to feast on. HP then spent $ 404,000 overhauling its campus in Corvallis, Ore., earning SITES certification for that property, too.
These new landscapes may not instantly be carefree, however. Until the natives spread, invasive plants may need to be weeded out. And establishing a meadow is not necessarily cheaper than putting in lawn and flower borders.
But the environmental gains can be significant. Meadows benefit pollinators and enrich soil, according to new research. Some landscapes are being designed to be "climate positive," drawing from the atmosphere more carbon than what was emitted in their installation and maintenance.
Pamela Conrad, a landscape architect, developed a carbon-tracking app that provided guidance for ways site planners could sock away more carbon. So far, 787 projects have been put through their paces on the app, with last year's projects reducing their carbon footprint 12 percent, Ms. Conrad said.
"If you add paving, your number score goes down and it will take 50 years to offset your carbon footprint," she said. "If you add trees, it will only take 10 years."
Even companies embracing ecological approaches still often want some lawn for throwing a Frisbee or working outdoors. But many are keeping lawns to a minimum, using native grasses or simply mowing less.
The reaction to the shaggier look appears to be mixed. In places where property owners observe "No Mow May" -- leaving mowers idle until June -- irate neighbors have come over with their own machines. One Maryland couple fought their homeowner association over their decision to grow sunflowers and phlox instead of grass. (Their battle ended up changing state law.)
"There's a perception that if it looks a little wild, it looks like it's not taken care of," said Chris Guillard, a principal at the landscape architecture firm CMG.
At its new Allentown site, Air Products encountered "questions about what we had done," Mr. Garay said, especially when the meadows had just been planted and "looked like a weed field."
Air Products explained its new approach in a company newsletter and posted signs around its property. Mr. Garay spoke at a community meeting about how meadows could benefit the environment.
"Once people hear the why, you can see them nodding their heads," he said. "People are beginning to understand that these little impacts add up."

Full text: Google's Photo App Still Can't Find Gorillas. And Neither Can Apple's.
When Google released its stand-alone Photos app in May 2015, people were wowed by what it could do: analyze images to label the people, places and things in them, an astounding consumer offering at the time. But a couple of months after the release, a software developer, Jacky Alciné, discovered that Google had labeled photos of him and a friend, who are both Black, as "gorillas," a term that is particularly offensive because it echoes centuries of racist tropes.
In the ensuing controversy, Google prevented its software from categorizing anything in Photos as gorillas, and it vowed to fix the problem. Eight years later, with significant advances in artificial intelligence, we tested whether Google had resolved the issue, and we looked at comparable tools from its competitors: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.


There was one member of the primate family that Google and Apple were able to recognize -- lemurs, the permanently startled-looking, long-tailed animals that share opposable thumbs with humans, but are more distantly related than are apes.
Google's and Apple's tools were clearly the most sophisticated when it came to image analysis.
Yet Google, whose Android software underpins most of the world's smartphones, has made the decision to turn off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of making an offensive mistake and labeling a person as an animal. And Apple, with technology that performed similarly to Google's in our test, appeared to disable the ability to look for monkeys and apes as well.
Consumers may not need to frequently perform such a search -- though in 2019, an iPhone user complained on Apple's customer support forum that the software "can't find monkeys in photos on my device." But the issue raises larger questions about other unfixed, or unfixable, flaws lurking in services that rely on computer vision -- a technology that interprets visual images -- as well as other products powered by A.I.
Mr. Alciné was dismayed to learn that Google has still not fully solved the problem and said society puts too much trust in technology.
"I'm going to forever have no faith in this A.I.," he said.
Computer vision products are now used for tasks as mundane as sending an alert when there is a package on the doorstep, and as weighty as navigating cars and finding perpetrators in law enforcement investigations.
Errors can reflect racist attitudes among those encoding the data. In the gorilla incident, two former Google employees who worked on this technology said the problem was that the company had not put enough photos of Black people in the image collection that it used to train its A.I. system. As a result, the technology was not familiar enough with darker-skinned people and confused them for gorillas.
As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in our lives, it is eliciting fears of unintended consequences. Although computer vision products and A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT are different, both depend on underlying reams of data that train the software, and both can misfire because of flaws in the data or biases incorporated into their code.
Microsoft recently limited users' ability to interact with a chatbot built into its search engine, Bing, after it instigated inappropriate conversations.
Microsoft's decision, like Google's choice to prevent its algorithm from identifying gorillas altogether, illustrates a common industry approach -- to wall off technology features that malfunction rather than fixing them.
"Solving these issues is important," said Vicente Ordóñez, a professor at Rice University who studies computer vision. "How can we trust this software for other scenarios?"
Michael Marconi, a Google spokesman, said Google had prevented its photo app from labeling anything as a monkey or ape because it decided the benefit "does not outweigh the risk of harm."
Apple declined to comment on users' inability to search for most primates on its app.
Representatives from Amazon and Microsoft said the companies were always seeking to improve their products.
Bad Vision
When Google was developing its photo app, which was released eight years ago, it collected a large amount of images to train the A.I. system to identify people, animals and objects.
Its significant oversight -- that there were not enough photos of Black people in its training data -- caused the app to later malfunction, two former Google employees said. The company failed to uncover the "gorilla" problem back then because it had not asked enough employees to test the feature before its public debut, the former employees said.
Google profusely apologized for the gorillas incident, but it was one of a number of episodes in the wider tech industry that have led to accusations of bias.
Other products that have been criticized include HP's facial-tracking webcams, which could not detect some people with dark skin, and the Apple Watch, which, according to a lawsuit, failed to accurately read blood oxygen levels across skin colors. The lapses suggested that tech products were not being designed for people with darker skin. (Apple pointed to a paper from 2022 that detailed its efforts to test its blood oxygen app on a "wide range of skin types and tones.")
Years after the Google Photos error, the company encountered a similar problem with its Nest home-security camera during internal testing, according to a person familiar with the incident who worked at Google at the time. The Nest camera, which used A.I. to determine whether someone on a property was familiar or unfamiliar, mistook some Black people for animals. Google rushed to fix the problem before users had access to the product, the person said.
However, Nest customers continue to complain on the company's forums about other flaws. In 2021, a customer received alerts that his mother was ringing the doorbell but found his mother-in-law instead on the other side of the door. When users complained that the system was mixing up faces they had marked as "familiar," a customer support representative in the forum advised them to delete all of their labels and start over.
Mr. Marconi, the Google spokesman, said that "our goal is to prevent these types of mistakes from ever happening." He added that the company had improved its technology "by partnering with experts and diversifying our image datasets."
In 2019, Google tried to improve a facial-recognition feature for Android smartphones by increasing the number of people with dark skin in its data set. But the contractors whom Google had hired to collect facial scans reportedly resorted to a troubling tactic to compensate for that dearth of diverse data: They targeted homeless people and students. Google executives called the incident "very disturbing" at the time.
The Fix?
While Google worked behind the scenes to improve the technology, it never allowed users to judge those efforts.
Margaret Mitchell, a researcher and co-founder of Google's Ethical AI group, joined the company after the gorilla incident and collaborated with the Photos team. She said in a recent interview that she was a proponent of Google's decision to remove "the gorillas label, at least for a while."
"You have to think about how often someone needs to label a gorilla versus perpetuating harmful stereotypes," Dr. Mitchell said. "The benefits don't outweigh the potential harms of doing it wrong."
Dr. Ordóñez, the professor, speculated that Google and Apple could now be capable of distinguishing primates from humans, but that they didn't want to enable the feature given the possible reputational risk if it misfired again.
Google has since released a more powerful image analysis product, Google Lens, a tool to search the web with photos rather than text. Wired discovered in 2018 that the tool was also unable to identify a gorilla.
These systems are never foolproof, said Dr. Mitchell, who is no longer working at Google. Because billions of people use Google's services, even rare glitches that happen to only one person out of a billion users will surface.
"It only takes one mistake to have massive social ramifications," she said, referring to it as "the poisoned needle in a haystack."

My Apartment Is Infested With Bugs. How Do I Make My Landlord Fix It?: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: There are numerous ways you can pressure a landlord to take action. Sometimes it takes using all of them to get a result.
Q: I am a senior who has lived quietly in my rent-stabilized Brooklyn apartment for 22 years. For the past three years, my home has been infested with biting gnats. I have disposed of infested possessions -- furniture, rugs, clothing, bedding -- but the insects continue to bite me throughout the night. My complaints to management have gone unanswered. I paid an exterminator $ 200, to no avail. Another exterminator said my landlord had to make the request, not me. After I called 311, a city inspector visited my apartment and contacted the landlord, who reported that the problem was resolved. I challenged that, but the case was closed anyway. I opened a new complaint and have yet to get an inspection. What can I do?
A: You should not have to live with vermin, including insects. It is your landlord's responsibility to resolve this problem. So escalate the pressure.
Keep calling 311, and call often. It's possible your latest request was routed to the wrong city agency (this should be handled by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development), or you missed a call from an inspector.
"There is no harm in filing multiple complaints," said William Fowler, an HPD spokesman. "All of that helps build a paper trail and increases pressure on the owner to resolve the issue."
Since the insects are biting you in your sleep, request an inspection for bedbugs as well, as it's possible you have more than one infestation and you may need more than one type of inspection.
While your 311 calls work their way through the system, you can file what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court. This will bring your complaint before a judge, who can order the landlord to correct the problem. You don't need a lawyer to file a housing court case.
"Now the landlord has to stand in front a judge," said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants. "It's very unlikely that they claim the problem has been resolved if they haven't done it. Then they'd be committing perjury; they could be held in contempt."
Call your community board and your local City Council member's office, and ask them to advocate for you. On June 6, HPD is hosting a training program on Zoom where residents can learn how to deal with pests and vermin. You can sign up for it online. It might provide some useful information.

Full text: When two designers created their own country retreat, they knew they wanted the opposite of what most of their clients ask for: Something tiny.
As the founders of Haver & Skolnick Architects, an upscale firm based in Roxbury, Conn., Charles M. Haver and Stewart R. Skolnick spend most of their days designing expansive country estates. But when it came time to design their own getaway, they wanted the exact opposite.
"We wanted something very small, with privacy and an ocean view," said Mr. Haver, 64.
Specifically, they wanted a home that was just big enough for the two of them and their German shorthaired pointer, Keeper, after discovering that maintaining a 1790s house in Connecticut was a full-time job.
"In Roxbury, we have about 3,500 square feet in our home, and our offices are in an antique barn that's an additional 3,500 square feet," said Mr. Skolnick, 68. "So you have two guys rambling around in 7,000 square feet."
Looking to build a weekend house near the ocean, the couple bought two adjacent lots totaling 3.1 acres on Fishers Island, in Southold, N.Y., for $ 500,000 in 2012.
Deciding what to build there took them nearly a decade. "We went through probably 100 different schemes," Mr. Skolnick said. "It was really good, though, because with each scheme we fleshed out what was really important to us without worrying about the check marks from a real estate point of view."
A house with a single bedroom and a single full bathroom, they determined, would suit them just fine -- although it might not be ideal for resale. Their builder, HP Broom Housewright, began construction on the 1,200-square-foot house, tower-like house in September 2020.
The first floor contains just one bedroom, one bathroom and a laundry room. The second floor feels surprisingly expansive, with a 20-foot hip-roof ceiling and water views on three sides. But it contains only a living room, a small galley kitchen and a powder room.
"The real thrust of the design was to capture the views," Mr. Skolnick said. "We're looking at the Atlantic Ocean, but we also see Fishers Island Sound off to one side, and we're surrounded by ponds."
To keep maintenance to a minimum, they chose exterior materials that would weather over time, including Alaskan yellow cedar shingles, bronze railings and aluminum-clad windows in a charcoal gray. "The only paint that's required to maintain the exterior is on the front door and the mudroom door" in the walkout basement, Mr. Skolnick said.
Inside, they installed light oak floors and doors, a beamed ceiling on the first floor and nickel-gap paneling on the second floor. For furniture and lighting, they combined finds from auctions and antiques shops, an activity Mr. Haver excels at, as he is also an antiques dealer.
"In Roxbury, we live with Americana antiques, so in this house we wanted to mix it up a little," Mr. Skolnick said. "Most of the antiques are European, and we really liked the idea of contrasting antique furnishings with modern abstract art." The living room furnishings, for instance, include a 19th-century French fruitwood chest and an 18th-century walnut armoire along with colorful contemporary paintings by Denise Driscoll and Michael Hedges.
To open up the views, the landscape around the house required plenty of work, too. The site was part of a 1920s development by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., a son of the Central Park designer, but it had become so overgrown with dense brush and invasive vines that it was difficult to see much of anything.
Mr. Haver and Mr. Skolnick worked with Jeff Edwards, of Race Rock Garden Co., to return it to an open landscape inspired by Mr. Olmsted's vision. They cleared out the invasive plants to make way for a grassy meadow that spills from the house toward the ocean with meandering walking paths, and they pruned and preserved the cherry, hickory and oak trees.
Next to the house, they installed a garden of smooth rocks like those found on the island's beaches. It sprouts with easy-to-care-for decorative grasses, lavender and caryopteris.
The house was completed in March 2022, at a cost of $ 1,500 a square foot. And there is no room for guests, which was the intention.
"We have lots of guest rooms in Connecticut, and they're welcome to come there," Mr. Haver said.
"Or they can come for lunch," Mr. Skolnick added.
Their Fishers Island house -- named Pointer Perch, after their dog -- offers a private place for quiet downtime. Although that doesn't always happen.
"We love the house, but what hasn't worked out is the relaxing part," Mr. Skolnick said. "We spend every weekend on the land doing various projects -- pruning, clearing, planting -- and we love that. But at the end of each day, we're absolutely exhausted."

Full text: CRIMINAL JUSTICE
U.K. Tech Entrepreneur Is Extradited to the U.S.
Mike Lynch, co-founder of U.K. software firm Autonomy, has been extradited to the United States to face criminal charges in a near decade-long legal battle and fall from grace for a man once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates.
Mr. Lynch, 57, faces 17 charges over Hewlett-Packard's $ 11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, the company he grew into Britain's leading tech company, before it spectacularly unraveled after the transaction in 2011.
Appearing in court on Thursday, Mr. Lynch, who could face 20 years in prison, was ordered by a judge to pay a $ 100 million bond, hand over his passport and to be placed under 24 hour guard to secure his release.
Once lauded by academics, scientists and politicians for setting up a software giant from his groundbreaking research at Cambridge University, he has spent the last decade fighting lawsuits related to the HP takeover.
The charges Mr. Lynch faces in the U.S. are for wire and securities fraud. REUTERS
LABOR
German Railway Union Plans 50-Hour Walk Out
A labor union representing more than 200,000 German railway workers said on Friday that it was going ahead with a planned strike next week after its demands for better pay were rejected by employers.
The EVG union said its members will walk out for 50 hours from late Sunday until late Tuesday. The rail company Deutsche Bahn has canceled all long-distance travel during that period and warned that most regional trains also won't run.
The strike will likely be one of the biggest in recent years, following a previous large-scale walkout in April. But union co-leader Cosima Ingenschay said that a strike could still be averted at the last minute if employers put forward another offer.
EVG went into the current round of pay negotiations seeking a raise of 12 percent for its members, or at least 650 euros more each month. It also wants the minimum wage of 12 euros an hour to be ensured through basic pay rather than with bonuses, as is currently the case for some 2,700 workers.
The strike will affect dozens of rail companies as well as freight traffic. ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAX INCENTIVES
Nevada Bill Would Bring Film Production to Vegas
A bipartisan group of Nevada lawmakers introduced a bill on Thursday that would give massive tax credits aimed at bringing film production to southern Nevada, including a $ 1 billion Sony expansion. It's the latest attempt at diversifying southern Nevada's gaming and tourism-reliant economy, which was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
The $ 190 million in annual tax credits for 20 years would be the largest proposed tax incentive package in recent state history.
The legislation would involve the state entering an agreement with private developers who would pay for two film production sites.
"It creates a whole new industry in Nevada," the bill's sponsor, State Sen. Roberta Lange of Las Vegas, a Democrat, said in an interview Thursday. "I think it helps build and diversify our economy, which is something we've talked about in Nevada for as long as I've lived here." ASSOCIATED PRESS

Bit by bit, floor by floor, the building that once rose 22 stories over Penn Station is shrinking before the city's very eyes. The black netting draped over its ever-diminishing brick is like a magician's handkerchief; once removed, it will reveal -- nothing.
Behold: The Great Disappearing Act of the Hotel Pennsylvania.
This isn't -- or wasn't -- just any building. This was once the largest hotel on earth, with 2,200 rooms, shops, restaurants, its own newspaper, and a telephone number immortalized by the bandleader Glenn Miller with a 1940 song "Pennsylvania 6-5000," for which the complete original lyrics are:
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand
Pennsylvania Six Five Oh Oh Oh
That's it.
The hotel figured prominently in Big Band-era lore and counted among its many millions of guests the consequential (Fidel Castro) and the canine (the Westminster Kennel Club). It offered an accessible urbanity, a kind of cosmopolitanism for the common folk. When a young soldier aged by combat returned home at the close of World War II, for example, he made good on a vow to spend his first night stateside at the hotel with the phone number he knew by heart.
But the Hotel Pennsylvania never quite had the cachet of the Plaza or the Waldorf Astoria. It came to depend on traveling salespeople, conventions devoted to dentistry or footwear, and tourists seeking affordable accommodations. In recent years, perhaps the most charitable review was: conveniently located.
In 2008, a hard pass by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission effectively sentenced the hotel to the same fate as the building it was designed to complement: the majestic Pennsylvania Station, the egregious razing of which in 1963 led to the creation of a city agency charged with protecting buildings of historic and cultural significance: the Landmarks Preservation Commission, of course.
For two decades, the building's owner, the real-estate behemoth Vornado Realty Trust, dithered about its plans (We're knocking it down. No, we're renovating! We're knocking it down.) before moving ahead with demolition. A supertall office tower might replace it, or maybe a casino.
Some preservationists considered the hotel to be pedestrian and not worth saving. "Even if you're a hard-core preservationist, your energies might be better spent elsewhere," the city editor of New York magazine wrote in 2021.
Others disagreed, including Michael Devonshire, a preservation architect, a longtime member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and son of a certain soldier, James Devonshire, who found comfort once at the Hotel Pennsylvania. "I cannot think of a building more worthy of designation as a landmark," he said. "Are you kidding me?"
"At our hearings we adjudicate whether a mailbox installed in a designated neighborhood in Queens is appropriate to an historic district," Mr. Devonshire said of the commission. "Meanwhile, this incredibly important hotel is about to be turned to mulch. It's insane."
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand.
Built by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for an astonishing $ 10 million -- the equivalent to $ 173 million today -- the hotel, which opened in 1919, was envisioned by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White to be in concert with two of its other creations: Pennsylvania Station, across Seventh Avenue, and the General Post Office, on Eighth. Visitors passed through a four-story portico -- its six monumental columns echoing the station's colonnade across the avenue -- to enter a thrumming city within a city, with Turkish baths, swimming pools, a barbershop and a library featuring 4,000 volumes. Sixty women operated the telephone exchange.
Among the hotel's signature features were its Servidors, full-length, two-way cabinet doors that allowed items like shined shoes and pressed clothes to be left for guests without disturbing them. The supposed advancement, designed to "eliminate contact with servants," neither aged well nor benefited tip-dependent staffers.
The hotel thrived through the 1920s, '30s and '40s, with more than 300 unannounced check-ins a day, many from the train station, and a nonstop blur of galas and conventions. The American Dahlia Society. The National Greenskeepers Association. The Daughters of the Imperial Order of the British Empire. The War Relief Fund of the Federation of French Veterans of the Great War.
There were fatal leaps from windows, grifters scamming suckers, proposals accepted and vows broken, possibly all in the same night. Here, a couple of mugs fresh from Sing Sing prison broke into a room to steal cash and jewelry. Here, Prohibition agents stopped a man lugging a travel bag that all but rattled with bottles of Scotch intended for some parched conventioneers. Here, a guest entrusted a young actress of fresh acquaintance with $ 17,000, only to have both ingénue and dough disappear, to no one's surprise but his own.
Then there was the time an unregistered guest scampered past the registration desk to leap from table to table, upending the hotel lobby's desired atmosphere of orderly calm. A bystander finally grabbed the acrobatic interloper -- a monkey, from who knows where -- and the two shared a cab to the nearest police station.
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand.
The hotel's fame grew through the 1930s with musical broadcasts from the cozy Madhattan Room on the lower level and, later, the Café Rouge on the first floor -- where, the NBC announcer used to say, "the young at heart come from far and near."
Glenn Miller. Benny Goodman. Artie Shaw. Les Brown and His Band of Renown, featuring a young Doris Day taking a war-weary nation on a sentimental journey.
The postwar years were less kind to the hotel, as fewer overnighters arrived by train and more people chose watching television over frequenting nightclubs. There were repeated changes in ownership and name: the Hotel Statler, the Statler Hilton, the New York Statler, on and on, before eventually returning to the Hotel Pennsylvania.
The atmosphere changed as well; a weariness, even a weirdness, set in. Among the odder moments came when a government bacteriologist named Frank Olson plunged to his death from the 10th floor in 1953. It was later revealed that he had been slipped LSD as part of an illegal mind-control program overseen by the C.I.A. Seventy years later, the circumstances remain murky.
As the years passed, the struggling hotel did what it could. In the late 1980s, the Barbizon school of modeling moved in. In the mid-1990s, a Sports Authority megastore took over most of the mezzanine. A closeout retail store set up residence in what had been the Café Rouge, and the once-grand ballroom became a television studio for such fare as "Maury" and "The People's Court."
The dinners and conventions, at least, never stopped. Gem-and-mineral shows, bridge tournaments, city auctions, dog shows. A national shoe fair. A chess match between grandmasters. The annual meeting of the First District Dental Society of New York.
By 1999, Vornado -- a company with more expertise in real estate than in hospitality -- was the sole owner of the Hotel Pennsylvania. Fans of the old hotel began to fear an end to their sentimental journey.
For one thing, the hotel's reputation had plummeted into its subbasement, with mocking public complaints about peeling wallpaper, worn furniture and bedbugs. For another, Vornado had been acquiring property around Penn Station with an eye toward transforming the area one day into a business, retail and entertainment mecca.
One evening in the fall of 2007, in the Long Island town of Deer Park, a father came across some news on his desktop computer, and he called out to his 13-year-old son: Hey, Steven. Remember that hotel you like so much? The one across from Penn Station? They're going to knock it down.
That moment is seared in the memory of Steven Lepore, now 28. He felt a swirl of sadness, anger and urgency. "All hell broke loose in my brain," he recalled.
Resolved to act, the teenager found and joined the Save the Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation, a small group led by a computer specialist named Gregory Jones. The foundation was working to block any demolition by asking the Landmarks Preservation Commission to consider the hotel for landmark status.
In assessing the merits of a building as a potential landmark, the commission studies its architectural, historical and cultural significance, as well as the level of integrity of the original design. In its estimation, the Hotel Pennsylvania, which had undergone significant changes over the years, fell short.
The hopes of the hotel's would-be protectors briefly soared when the fallout from the recession of the late 2000s nudged Vornado to reconsider demolition. In 2013, its chairman, Steven Roth, told investors that the company would invest heavily in the building "and try to make it into a really profitable, really good hotel for our purposes."
"We won," Mr. Lepore remembers thinking. The save-the-hotel foundation was rechristened the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society, which soon sent Vornado a detailed proposal for restoring the hotel to its former glory.
"Of course, there was no response," Mr. Lepore said.
Perhaps because Vornado had already begun to change its mind. By 2015, Mr. Roth was telling investors that demolition was still an option; by 2016, he was complaining about the oversupply of hotels, hinting about a massive redevelopment plan and calling the hotel a "parking lot."
All the while, the hotel was trumpeting interior renovations, celebrating its ties to the Westminster dog pageant, offering discounted rooms and renting space for pet fashion shows and other events. In truth, it was a brick-and-mortar place holder.
In early 2020, the coronavirus pandemic forced the Hotel Pennsylvania to close, which proved to be convenient to its owners. In announcing the inevitable a year later, Mr. Roth described the hotel as "decades past its glory and sell-by date."
The Landmarks Preservation Commission seemed to agree. A commission spokeswoman said last month that the agency "has reviewed Hotel Pennsylvania numerous times over the last 20 years and determined each time that the property does not rise to the level of architectural significance necessary as a potential landmark."
By this point, the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society was just Mr. Lepore. The reality that the 22-story building was about to be removed from the cityscape didn't hit him until he walked into the closed hotel for a liquidation sale. As he pored over leftovers of hospitality, looking for relics worth purchasing for posterity, a deep sadness came over him. He felt like a failed caretaker.
"In my head I was saying, 'Sorry, I did everything I could,"' he recalled. "'I'm sorry you're going to be erased from the world.'
"I said my goodbyes."
Some community organizations focused on the hotel's imminent demise to protest a multibillion-dollar plan by New York State -- with Vornado as a central player -- to redevelop the Penn Station area, mostly with high-rise office towers. But by the time demolition began at the end of 2021, there was not much left to say.
David Holowka, an architect who leads walking tours of the neighborhood's at-risk buildings, said that the hotel could have been repurposed and its history celebrated, as other cities have done with older structures. Instead, he said, New York "is just throwing its architectural heritage out the window."
Roberta Brandes Gratz, an author and former landmarks commission member who specializes in urbanism, agreed. She said that a tear-down, bottom-line aesthetic prevails in the city, with leaders uninterested in how old buildings might be reimagined.
"If anyone thinks that another office tower is more useful than a creatively repurposed hotel as big and beautiful as the Pennsylvania, I don't know what to say," Ms. Gratz said.
Pennsylvania Six Five Thousand.
The Hotel Pennsylvania continues to evaporate in the midst of distracted Midtown; at the moment, just 10 of its 22 stories remain. Trucks rattling with emptiness disappear into its West 32nd Street side, then emerge from its West 33rd Street side laden with chunks of a New York place that once mattered.
But scattered here and there are remnants that summon echoes of clattering cutlery and lobby chatter, haunting clarinet solos and the velvety, reassuring voice of Doris Day.
Vornado has saved a few items, including a bronze letter box and some decorative elements from the Café Rouge area. The company said that they will be featured in a future exhibit.
Mr. Lepore bought a few things at the liquidation sale, including a couple of old Servidors for $ 50 apiece. He added the memorabilia to his Hotel Pennsylvania collection in Deer Park, where he lives with his parents. Matchbooks. Coffee pots. Silverware with the HP monogram. An old receipt book recording the settled bills of guests long since checked out.
The Servidors are massive and must be kept in a storage unit, but many other items are in the china closet, to the chagrin of Mr. Lepore's mother, Virginia. "Just last week she said it," he recalled. "'What are you going to do with all this?"'
Well, Mr. Lepore intends to have his own place sometime soon. And while he has no intentions of building a shrine to the hotel -- "That sounds obsessive" -- he does hope to incorporate the artifacts so that "everything will be used and out in the open."
Then there is Michael Fusco, 69, retiree, nature photographer and Big Band aficionado. He often wears fedoras.
When demolition started, Mr. Fusco began lingering outside the building, taking long-lens photographs and chatting with construction workers. One day he explained the Big Band connections to the building they were tearing down, and asked if would it be possible to get a small piece of the terra-cotta arches that used to adorn the Café Rouge.
"I meant something I could put in my pocket," Mr. Fusco said.
Instead, the workers presented him with two terra-cotta chunks so large and heavy that he had to make two trips by Uber to transport them to his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. One leans against a chair; the other, against a coffee table. They weigh so much -- 50 pounds? 75? -- that he has trouble picking them up.
Every Sunday morning, Mr. Fusco passes the building on his way to serve as an usher at the Latin High Mass at the Church of the Holy Innocents on West 37th Street. "I'm the guy doing the collections on the right side," he said.
He knows that the demolition site is quiet on Sundays. He knows where a three-inch opening exists between two chain-linked doors. And he knows how to summon recordings of old broadcasts from the Café Rouge with a few taps on his phone.
You might see him one of these Sunday mornings. A man in a fedora, thrusting his cellphone deep into the side of a doomed building, filling the dusty void with sweet Big Band swing. And the volume is turned way, way up.

Dell Joins Tech Peers
In Announcing Layoffs
Dell Technologies is cutting about 6,650 jobs, or 5 percent of its global work force, as it struggles with a slump in the personal computer market and braces for a potential recession.
The move on Monday aligns Dell with a raft of U.S. companies that have laid off thousands this year to ride out a demand downturn wrought by high inflation and rising interest rates.
Dell had already rolled out cost-cutting moves such as a hiring pause and limits on travel as it dealt with a postpandemic collapse in personal computer sales, which account more than half its revenue. However, those moves are "no longer enough," Jeff Clarke, co-chief operating officer, wrote in a memo to employees.
"What we know is market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future," Mr. Clarke said. Dell expects to book costs related to the layoffs in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in January.
Rival HP has also said it will cut up to 6,000 jobs. REUTERS

AMC Is Charging More
For the Best Movie Seats
Middle seats at many U.S. movie theaters just got more expensive.
AMC Theaters, the nation's largest movie theater chain, on Monday unveiled a new pricing scheme in which seat location determines how much your movie ticket costs. Seats in the middle of the auditorium will cost a dollar or two more, while seats in the front row will be slightly cheaper.
AMC said the pricing plan, dubbed "Sightline," has already been rolled out in some locations and, by the end of the year, will be in place at all domestic AMC theaters during showings after 4 p.m.
Seats classified as "standard sightline" will be at the regular price. If you want to pay less for the "value sightline" seats, you have to be a member of the chain's subscription service, AMC Stubs.
Trying to recover from the pandemic, movie theaters have increasingly looked at more variable pricing methods.
Last weekend, Paramount Pictures partnered with theater chains to offer reduced ticket prices for "80 for Brady." And last year, tickets at most theaters were $ 3 for "National Cinema Day."

FOOD PROCESSING
Unexpected Glut of Meat
Hits Tyson's Bottom Line
Tyson Foods took a "hit in the mouth" as larger-than-expected beef and pork supplies weakened demand for its chicken, executives said on Monday as the meatpacker missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit.
The company's primary markets -- beef, pork and chicken -- went the opposite direction from what executives had planned and they were left surprised by how much meat was available in the United States. Shares of Tyson, the largest U.S. meat company by sales, were down 4.6 percent, to $ 61.08, at the close on Monday.
Drought in the western United States drove ranchers to reduce cattle herds by sending more animals to slaughter, while the worst-ever U.S. outbreak of bird flu triggered export restrictions, resulting in more poultry available domestically, the company said.
"We got hit in the mouth in Q1 because of all the protein on the market," Tyson's C.E.O., Donnie King, told analysts on a call.
