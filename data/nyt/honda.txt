Abstract: None available.

Full text: Firefighters, many of them volunteers, have been confronting dozens of blazes amid high temperatures this month. The conditions have been linked to climate change.
Helicopters hauling buckets of water fly toward the mountains where fires burn, a thick haze periodically covers the sky, and residents have been ordered to wear masks and limit driving because of the poor air quality.
For a full week, firefighters have been battling fires in the mountains around Bogotá, Colombia's capital, as dozens of other blazes have burned across the country, in what officials say is the hottest January in three decades.
The president has declared a national disaster and asked for international help fighting the fires, which he says could reach beyond the Andes Mountains and erupt on the Pacific Coast and in the Amazon.
Colombia's fires this month are unusual in a country where people are more accustomed to torrential rain and mudslides than fire and ash. They have been attributed to high temperatures and drought exacerbated by the climate phenomenon known as El Niño.
Ricardo Lozano, a geologist and former environment minister of Colombia, said El Niño was a natural phenomenon that occurred cyclically, but that with climate change, "these events are more and more intense and more and more extreme."
This month brought record temperatures to Colombia, including 111 degrees Fahrenheit in Honda, a colonial town between the cities of Medellín and Bogotá. It has dried out forests, savannas and normally damp highlands known as páramos, turning parts of the country into a tinderbox.
As dozens of fires have burned, more than 100 square miles have been scorched, and with temperatures continuing to soar, officials say more fires are likely before the rainy season begins in April.
Fires have also broken out in neighboring Venezuela and Ecuador, including in an ecological preserve.
Across Colombia, firefighting crews made up in many places of volunteers say they are outmatched by fires fueled by the heat and winds.
"One of the hardest things is finishing a shift and turning back to look at the mountains only to see more hot spots," said Santiago Botello, a risk-management coordinator for Bogotá's volunteer firefighters. The volunteers, he said, make up about one-fourth of the roughly 600 firefighters who have been battling the fires in the mountains above the city of nearly eight million.
"It is physically exhausting," said Mr. Botello, adding, "Obviously it is not common to see something like this in Bogotá."
Three fires in the mountains that run along one side of Bogotá, known as the Cerros Orientales, sent plumes of smoke pouring over the city last week, grounding dozens of flights and leading to evacuations of some schools and buildings.
The mayor, Carlos Fernando Galán, declared Bogotá's fires officially under control late Sunday, though not totally extinguished, and on Monday, new fires were reported both in the city and in Sopó, a town on its outskirts.
Helicopters continued to hover over Bogotá. Some were Black Hawk helicopters donated by the United States in 2022 and renamed by Colombia's government "Guacamayas," or macaws, signaling their new role fighting fires, instead of just the decades-long drug war.
As the helicopters hauled water to hot spots, the hiking trails that usually draw tourists with their lush woods, mountain streams and panoramic views, remained closed.
Eduardo Campos, a biologist who runs a company offering hikes in the mountains, said a carpet of leaves left by nonnative species, including pines and eucalyptus, had dried out during El Niño and had fueled the flames.
The damage was extensive, Mr. Campos said. Poor farmers living in the mountains had been displaced; animals including birds, mammals and small snakes had been incinerated; and swaths of the forest had been decimated.
"It will take years for the forest to re-establish itself," he said.
Susana Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister, said on Friday that 95 percent of the fires across the country had been started by people rather than by natural causes like lightning -- either accidentally, while burning garbage or clearing the land for farming, or with criminal intent. As of this week, 26 people had been detained.
At least one person has been killed in the fires, a 74-year-old man in La Capilla, a small town about 70 miles northeast of Bogotá. The authorities said his body had been found in his home after a fire there was put out.
The fires have been particularly devastating to the páramos, which are home to rare plants called frailejones and are critical to supplying water to urban populations.
Hernán Morantes, an environmental lawyer and advocate for the Páramo of Santurbán, a natural preserve 300 miles northeast of Bogotá, said there had been fires in the area before, "but never in the magnitude of this one."
The Colombian government is asking people to report fires with the hashtag "El Niño is not a game."
In seeking international assistance, including from the United Nations, President Gustavo Petro said this weekend: "The emergency due to global warming, combined with the phenomenon of El Niño, has necessitated action on several fronts. One has to do with heat waves and human health. Another with the forest fires. Another with the stress on the water supply."
Brazil, Canada and Peru have promised to send aid to Colombia, the government said.
Mr. Petro said countries in the region needed to prepare to address what could be "a planetary emergency in the Amazonian rainforest."
In recent years, fires in Brazil have consumed vast sections of the rainforest.
Mr. Petro has made tackling climate change a centerpiece of his agenda, including reducing deforestation and weaning the country off exporting fossil fuels. While some in Colombia have applauded the president's emphasis on the link between this month's fires and climate change, others have criticized him for not taking concrete steps to prepare.
Mr. Morantes, the lawyer and advocate, said budget cuts to fire departments and a lack of planning had hobbled the country's ability to respond to the fires, a claim echoed by officials formerly involved in disaster relief.
"We should have already had all the instruments of international cooperation ready, airplanes, everything," he said. "The issue is the country is not ready. It is clearly not ready."
Responding to the claims, Colombia's environment ministry said in a statement Monday that it had been planning for El Niño for months, citing as an example the aerial response now underway.
The ministry said that more than $ 2 billion had been allocated for fire preparedness and response, and that a community network had been created for the purposes of prevention and communication.
"This situation is not a surprising streak of fires," the statement said. "It is the phenomenon of El Niño combined with the climate crisis that has lead to extremely dry conditions. To this, let's add the hand of man that, intentionally or accidentally, has caused the fires."

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Helicopters hauling buckets of water fly toward the mountains where fires burn, a thick haze periodically covers the sky, and residents have been ordered to wear masks and limit driving because of the poor air quality.
For a full week, firefighters have been battling fires in the mountains around Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, as dozens of other blazes have burned across the country, in what officials say is the hottest January in three decades.

Nuclear Destruction's Monstrous Legacy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Those movies, along with "The Boy and the Heron," are essentially in conversation about the moral weight of American and Japanese actions in World War II.
I wasn't expecting to cry as much as I did at "Godzilla Minus One." The strong word-of-mouth made it sound like an awesome spectacle with cool action courtesy of the scaly title creature. And while there were awe-inducing showdowns with the monster, the Toho International production, written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, is largely a meditation on sorrow and survival in the wake of World War II.
The specter of trauma has long hung over Godzilla, a creature unearthed from slumber by H-bomb testing in the 1954 original. But "Godzilla Minus One" (a black-and-white version is reaching theaters on Friday) further literalizes that as it tells the story of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who shirks his duties, surviving both the war and an initial encounter with the beast, only to return to the ruins of Tokyo haunted by what he witnessed. Godzilla poses a threat, but one that lives mostly in the background. Instead, this is a story about finding community in the wake of destruction and learning to value yourself in a society that deems you worthless.
As I watched, I couldn't help but think about how "Godzilla Minus One" exists in conversation with two other recent releases: Hayao Miyazaki's otherworldly exploration of grief, "The Boy and the Heron," and Christopher Nolan's biographical drama, "Oppenheimer." Both "Godzilla Minus One" and "The Boy and the Heron" at least partly answer the question that some audiences had after the release of "Oppenheimer," which documents the invention of the atomic bomb. Namely, where was the Japanese perspective in this story about the man whose invention caused so much pain for them?
Neither "Godzilla Minus One" nor "The Boy and the Heron" is explicitly about the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They both deal with life in Japan during and after World War II, using the fantastical to portray a people grappling with the lasting effects of a devastating conflict and their anger at those in power who were responsible. Together, the films also prove that literalism isn't always required in stories that impart messy truths about humanity.
Nolan's drama, which picked up 13 Oscar nominations on Tuesday, offers an intimate character study of the father of the atomic bomb, penetrating both his genius and his guilt after his weapon was used. However, the film deliberately avoids depicting the nuclear terror that unfolded in Japan. That was intentional, Nolan has said, as he wanted to document Oppenheimer's "experience subjectively." He told Variety: "Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did. I wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions."
In what is arguably the most distressing sequence in the film, we see the celebration at Los Alamos after the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy. He begins to envision the blast ripping through the crowd. He comes face to face with a young woman whose skin is peeling off. The cheers start to sound frantic and terrified. He imagines stepping into a charred corpse.
Both "The Boy and the Heron" and "Godzilla Minus One" (which each picked up an Oscar nomination as well) also feature characters with fiery visions of innocents in peril. "The Boy and the Heron" opens with a child, Mahito, running through the streets of Tokyo in a futile effort to save his mother from a fire sparked by an air raid. The image of her engulfed in flames, pleading to be rescued, is one Mahito will return to after his father, who manufactures warplanes, moves him to a mysterious country estate.
The new home is supposed to be a haven, but for Mahito it is a persistent reminder of what he lost: His father has married his aunt, a dead ringer for his mother; and a nagging gray heron is taunting him, promising a meeting with his lost parent. Mahito is soon sucked into an alternate universe where the ills of the human world are on full display but perverted into greater absurdity. (Think giant parakeets with a taste for human flesh.) The boy must ultimately make a choice about whether he should stay there, where he has the chance to reshape that universe as he pleases, or return to the broken place from which he came. He chooses the latter.
Like Mahito, Koichi, the hero of "Godzilla Minus One," is plagued by nightmares. In the opening sequence, he lands his plane on Odo Island in the final days of World War II. He says he is there for repairs, but his craft is fine. Rather, he has lied to avoid the certain death that awaits him as a kamikaze pilot. And then Godzilla appears, killing nearly everyone stationed at the base. Koichi returns to a demolished Tokyo blaming himself for not completing his suicide mission and not effectively battling the monster.
In Tokyo, he ends up finding a makeshift family with other orphans of the war, including Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a young woman who saved a baby after its parents died. But Koichi is reluctant to commit to them because of his own shame. In one sequence he wakes up from a nightmare in which he is faced with the fiery wreckage that Godzilla has wrought. He asks Noriko in terror, "This is Japan, right? I returned alive for sure, right?"
"Godzilla Minus One" is set even before the first "Godzilla" was released -- hence the title -- and Yamazaki said in an interview with The Verge that he wanted "audiences to gain an understanding of how Japanese survivors felt after WWII." There's some of that in Ishiro Honda's landmark original in which a woman says she "barely escaped the atomic bomb in Nagasaki and now this." But by setting the new film in the immediate aftermath of the war, Yamazaki aims to tap into a feeling of suffering that's even fresher.
The characters in "Godzilla Minus One" are betrayed twice -- by the Americans certainly, whose bomb tests on Bikini Atoll give Godzilla renewed power -- but also by Japan itself. As a kamikaze pilot, Koichi was told that his life was worth nothing and has carried that with him. In the rousing speech before the effort to defeat Godzilla begins, a former naval weapons developer leading the charge (Hidetaka Yoshioka) explains that their goal is to avoid death rather than seek it for glory.
"This country has treated life far too cheaply," he says, then enumerates the ways Japan has let its citizens die, via poorly armored tanks and fighter planes without ejection seats, for instance, and of course suicide missions. Then he continues, "That's why this time I take pride in a citizen-led effort that sacrifices no lives at all. This next battle is not one waged to the death but a battle to live for the future." It's an optimistic rallying cry that reverberates through the final act.
The other two films are far less hopeful. "Oppenheimer" ends with the title character's affirmation that he has started a chain reaction that could "destroy the entire world." Mahito of "The Boy and the Heron" leaves the dangerous but enchanting parallel universe with the knowledge that he might forget all that occurred inside it and ultimately make the same mistakes as his ancestors, warmongers who try to bend people to their will.
It's only in "Godzilla Minus One" that we get a true happy ending. Well, until a reminder that Godzilla isn't really vanquished. That tag, while technically a hint at sequels to come, is also a sign that just as the monster never truly goes away, neither does Koichi's torment. And just as "Oppenheimer" is an example of the West still wrestling with its responsibility for destruction during World War II, Japan is doing the same, but in its versions, the monsters are not all of the human variety.

100 Names, And Legacies, Lift Lahaina As It Rebuilds: [National Desk]

Full text: Authorities have identified the last known person to have died in the wildfire. Young and old, those lost won't be forgotten.
Terri Thomas was a beloved aunt who loved outdoor adventures. Po'omaika'i Estores-Losano, a musician and father, was trying to rebuild his life. Tony Takafua, 7 years old, had barely begun his.
Buddy Jantoc, a grandfather, was among the first to be identified. And Lydia Coloma, 70, was the last.
They were among the 100 known victims of the wildfire that tore through Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii on Aug. 8. The identification of Ms. Coloma on Friday brought to a quiet close the somber task by authorities of identifying individuals believed to have died in the blaze.
"Our hearts go out to the families, friends and community affected by this devastating event," Maui officials said in the news release announcing the identification of the 100th fatality.
Ms. Coloma was the ninth member of her family to have been identified as a fatal victim of the wildfire, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat.
The news came almost two months after the authorities had last identified a victim. And as of Friday, three people were still unaccounted for or missing after the fire, according to Maui officials.
More than two-thirds of the deceased were older than 60 years old. They included Alfredo Galinato, 79, who died trying to save his longtime family home, and Louise Abihai, the oldest at 97, who was one of several victims in the Hale Mahaolu Eono senior housing complex.
Three of the victims were under 18, including Justin Recolizado, 11, and 7-year-old Tony, the youngest.
Tony loved football and video games, and enjoyed riding electric bikes with his cousins. On Aug. 8, he was with his mother, Salote Tone, who adored her "Boobear."
The two of them tried to escape the fire along with her parents, Faaoso and Maluifonua Tone, in their Honda Civic, but they did not survive. Salote's brother Folau Tone was driving a Nissan truck through the flames with his four children. He has struggled with the weight of wondering why his car made it out but his sister's did not.
For Laurie Allen, the fight for survival lasted weeks. Ms. Allen, 65, loved snorkeling and kayaking and was known for showing compassion to homeless residents. She managed to escape the inferno on foot, though she suffered third-degree burns on more than 70 percent of her skin. Ms. Allen underwent a series of surgeries and skin grafts at a burn center in Honolulu. Seven weeks after the fire, she succumbed to her injuries.
"There are no words to express how deeply I will miss her," her husband, Perry Allen, told The Times in a text message after her death. Identifying the dead has been a colossal undertaking, involving DNA samples from family members and dental experts. At one point, officials had said that 115 people had died. At another, the toll was believed to be 97. In some cases, there were multiple sets of remains for one person. In others, remains turned out to be nonhuman.
All but two of the 100 were from Lahaina. George Hall III was from Kahului, another town on the island. And Theresa Cook was from California. She was staying at a hotel in Lahaina and was scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 9. The work of rebuilding Lahaina is underway. The fire burned through more than 2,000 buildings, leaving little more than cinder blocks, car husks and piles of ash behind. But crews have started clearing plots of land, with excavators digging down six inches to remove contaminated soil.
To locals, the memory of the 100 will always be part of the rebirth. In September, during a day of vigils for those lost in the fire, some 300 Maui residents gathered in the quad on the campus of the University of Hawaii, Maui College.
Spiritual leaders, or kahu, offered individual prayers during the hourlong ceremony. One, Kahu Kale Kaalekahi, told the crowd that everyone's grief "makes us all kin" and that it would be a unifying force in the island's recovery.
"It is in the brokenness that shapes us," he said.

Full text: Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren't ready for fully electric vehicles.
As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday's news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade.
Now, a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has led General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen to walk back ambitious targets for those vehicles. And sales of hybrids are robust, underscoring what may be the enduring reality check of 2023: Many Americans are hugely receptive to electrification, but they're not ready for a fully electric car.
"Consumers want the same experience they've had" with a combustion engine car, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. "And we are not there yet. Price is still the top barrier for most consumers."
Americans bought a record 1.2 million electric vehicles last year, a gain of about 46 percent and a 7.6 percent share of all new car sales, according to Cox. But hybrid sales rose even faster, up 65 percent to more than 1.2 million, lifting their market share to 8 percent from 5.5 percent, according to Edmunds. Throw in plug-in hybrids, and nearly one in 10 new cars pairs a gasoline engine with electric motors to save fuel and boost performance.
Analysts say stubbornly high electric car prices and worries about public charging are pushing some car shoppers to hybrids, including renters or urbanites who can't charge a battery-powered car at home. Hybrids deliver savings at the pump with no need to plug in for hours or plan trips around charging stops. Their batteries are much smaller and cost a lot less than the batteries in fully electric vehicles.
Buyers paid about $ 42,500 on average for hybrids in November, according to Edmunds, compared with $ 60,500 for electric vehicles and $ 47,500 for a conventional models. There is a smorgasbord of affordable hybrid models, many starting around $ 30,000 -- including a stylishly redesigned Prius that returns a model-record 57 miles per gallon. The electric vehicle market, by contrast, remains top-heavy with luxury offerings.
Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said mainstream consumers were fundamentally different from early adopters who flocked to electric vehicles with little encouragement or education from automakers.
"E.V.s continue to grow with spectacular numbers, but what's changing is that people buying them are not willing to pay a premium," Mr. Farley said in an interview. "Now we have to get costs under control and even -- surprise, surprise -- advertise."
Ford is trimming its planned production of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and increasing output of the more-affordable F-150 Hybrid by 20 percent. The automaker plans to quadruple overall hybrid production in hopes of selling 100,000 this year. They include the red-hot Maverick compact pickup, whose 37-m.p.g. hybrid version has exceeded Ford's most optimistic sales forecasts.
So why doesn't Ford make all Mavericks hybrids? Mr. Farley said the company remained committed to offering a full range of powertrains, including electrified trucks that can double as mobile generators to power equipment, homes or even the electrical grid. Securing battery supplies also takes a long time, Mr. Farley said, sometimes longer than building a new assembly line.
"We didn't know a $ 30,000 truck would be this popular," he said of the Maverick. "Ford has struggled to make money on small cars since the beginning of time."
The hybrid resurgence is mainly benefiting Toyota, Honda and Hyundai Motor, including its Kia sister brand.
Those automakers account for roughly 90 percent of U.S. hybrid sales, followed by Ford. All continue to invest in the technology even as G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers vow to pivot entirely to electric vehicles.
Honda outdid itself in 2023, nearly tripling hybrid sales to 294,000 units. Hybrid versions of the Honda Accord sedan and the CR-V sport utility vehicle now account for more than half those models' sales. That Accord combines luxury-level comfort, quality and amenities with up to 44 m.p.g. in overall driving, for $ 33,290 to start.
En route to record U.S. sales in 2023, Hyundai, Kia and their Genesis luxury brand together sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any automaker save Tesla. Yet Hyundai Motor remains bullish on hybrids, even after the Biden administration proposed regulations that would require two-thirds of new cars to be fully electric by 2032.
"Anyone who wants to survive in this business is making these electric investments," said Steve Center, chief operating officer at Kia America. That includes Hyundai, which has committed to investing $ 12 billion in factories in Alabama and Georgia.
But Mr. Center added that an electric vehicle might not serve the needs of a "cowboy in Montana with a pickup truck." Hybrids can help reduce emissions from those kinds of vehicles faster, he said.
Mr. Center offered a bold prediction: As combustion engine cars fade into obsolescence, all remaining gasoline models will adopt electrification in hybrid form. Gasoline cars won't be able to compete without it, as consumers and regulators alike demand better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
"Everything should be hybrid to start with, because everyone can drive a hybrid, everywhere," he said.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, seems to be treading that path. Within a few months, Toyota will offer nine hybrid-only models, including one from its Lexus luxury brand. The company sold more than 640,000 hybrids in America last year, 29 percent of its total U.S. sales; it sold about 15,000 fully electric vehicles.
David Christ, general manager of Toyota's North American division, said the automaker expects to crack 40 percent electrified sales in 2024. He echoed Mr. Center's view on the prospects for combustion engine cars.
"Over time, we're not opposed to going all-hybrid to make a faster step to a greener future," Mr. Christ said.
Toyota's faith in democratizing hybrid technology turned the company, once an environmental darling, into a whipping boy as it was widely accused of foot-dragging over electric vehicles. If Toyota is feeling vindicated, Mr. Christ won't admit it.
"A year ago, we were getting roasted in the media for not being an E.V. believer," he said. "We thought that was unfair, that we weren't in on electrification. We started it. We have eight million hybrids on the road today, and every one reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
But Mr. Christ added that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles was not yet ready for many millions of battery-powered cars, which is why sales of such vehicles have slowed.
"At the end of the day, the consumer drives this industry, not the manufacturer," he said.
Toyota will plant its biggest flag yet in June. The redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid. That may seem to be a major gamble for the nation's perennially best-selling sedan. Toyota sold about 290,000 Camrys last year, and just 35,000 were hybrids. If the new Camry can maintain its sales, Toyota will convert a few hundred thousand buyers to a roughly 50-m.p.g. hybrid in one swoop. If not, the Camry franchise will take a huge hit.
Yet Toyota isn't taking a shot in the dark. When Toyota switched the Sienna to an all-hybrid lineup for the 2021 model year, it immediately became America's best-selling minivan, up from fourth place.
But some auto experts said hybrids could do only so much.
Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said hybrids were a critical, affordable tool that allowed millions of drivers to use less gasoline but remained a transition technology. Long-term climate change goals still demand a shift to electric vehicles powered by a renewable energy grid, he said.
"In our comments to the E.P.A. and industry, it's 'Hey, put a hybrid on everything,"' Mr. Cooke said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. "But we still need stricter standards to ensure automakers face rules on what's technologically achievable."
Mr. Cooke noted that the fuel economy of the nation's fleet had held flat for years, in part because of the shift to pickups and S.U.V.s. Recent gains are entirely attributable to the rise of electric vehicles, with hybrids playing a negligible role.
Chris Harto, transportation and energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports, agreed with that assessment. "Hybrids buy some time, but E.V.s are where we need to go" to achieve climate goals, he said.
Yet Mr. Harto bemoans the popular narrative that pits hybrids and electric vehicles against each other.
"They're both taking market share from less efficient I.C.E. vehicles," Mr. Harto said, referring to internal combustion engines. "And there's a lot of market share to take."

U.S. Auto Sales Expected To Slow After Strong 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers sold more cars in 2023 than a year ago as supply chain chaos ended, but sales are now under pressure from higher interest rates.
After enjoying a strong rebound in sales in 2023, the auto industry appears headed for slower growth this year as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices for new cars and light trucks.
Edmunds, a market researcher, expects the industry to sell 15.7 million vehicles this year. That would amount to a modest increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, when sales jumped 12 percent.
"There's definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while," said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. "But given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Since the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have struggled with shortages of critical parts that have prevented them from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In 2023, the shortages, especially for computer chips, finally eased, allowing production to return to more normal levels.
But over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates, which has pushed up costs considerably for car buyers.
For years, many people took advantage of zero-percent loans to buy vehicles, even as prices climbed. But such deals, offered by automakers to move inventory, have nearly disappeared in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, new-vehicle sales with zero-percent financing accounted for just 2.3 percent of all sales, according to Edmunds.
Monthly payments are at near-record highs. In the fourth quarter, the average monthly payment on new cars was $ 739, up from $ 717 in the same period a year ago.
Several automakers were hoping that a rapid rise in sales of new electric vehicles would drive the industry to gains into 2024 and 2025, but those cars and trucks haven't taken off quite as quickly as many analysts and executives had hoped.
In 2023, sales of battery-powered models in the United States topped one million vehicles for the first time, and Cox Automotive, another research firm, expects sales to reach 1.5 million this year. But General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other manufacturers had been expecting an even faster ramp-up.
But consumers have balked at the high prices of many of the newest electric models. Many drivers are also reluctant to make the switch to battery power, because they are not sure they will be able to find enough places to quickly refuel. That has forced automakers to reset their plans.
G.M. had once forecast it would produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024 but now has given up that target, and it has delayed the production of some electric models.
Ford had been aiming to have enough factory capacity by the end of 2024 to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year, but it recently lowered production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning and its electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
On Wednesday, G.M. said that its sales of new vehicles in the United States jumped 14 percent last year. The company sold 2.6 million cars and light trucks in 2023, up from 2.3 million in 2022, when the chip shortage limited production.
G.M. sold about 76,000 electric vehicles, up from 39,000 in 2022. But most were Chevrolet Bolts, a model that the company recently stopped making. Only about 13,000 were vehicle based on newer battery technology that G.M. had been hoping would make its electric vehicles affordable to many more car buyers.
Sales for G.M. in the fourth quarter were relatively weak. They climbed just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier and were down 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023. The company said the sales of several important models were limited by a strike at some of its plants by the United Automobile Workers union.
Separately, Toyota Motor, the second largest seller of cars in the United States after G.M., said its 2023 sales rose 7 percent, to 2.2 million vehicles. The company's sales in the fourth quarter were 15.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago and about 5 percent higher than in the third quarter.
Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Ram and Jeep vehicles, said that it sold 1.5 million cars and trucks in 2023, about 1 percent less than the year before. The company plans to introduce eight new electric vehicles this year, and it aims to have battery-powered models account for half of its North American sales by the end of the decade.
Honda, Hyundai and Kia also on Wednesday reported strong U.S. sales for 2023 And on Tuesday, Tesla, which dominates the electric car business in the United States, said it sold 1.8 million cars worldwide last year, up 38 percent from 2022.
Ford is expected to report its sales total on Thursday.

Cale Yarborough, 84, Hall of Fame Driver With 83 NASCAR Wins and One Brawl: [Biography]

Full text: He won the Daytona 500 four times, but his fistfight with Bobby Allison at a televised race "put NASCAR on the nationwide map."
Cale Yarborough, who won three consecutive NASCAR Winston Cup Series championships and whose 83 victories tied him for sixth place on the winners' list, died on Sunday. He was 84.
He had been battling a rare genetic disorder, his family told The Associated Press.
At the peak of his success, Yarborough won nine races in 1976, nine in 1977 and 10 in 1978, capturing the points championship each time. His feat wasn't equaled until 2008, when Jimmie Johnson matched it. Yarborough was also the series championship runner-up in 1973 and 1974, and again in 1980.
He won the Daytona 500 four times (1968, 1977, 1983 and 1984), second only to Richard Petty's seven victories.
But for all his achievements, Yarborough was remembered especially for a race he didn't win, the Daytona 500 in February 1979, the first NASCAR event to be televised in its entirety to a national audience.
Yarborough and Donnie Allison, the brother of Bobby Allison, another of NASCAR's greatest names, thumped each other several times on the backstretch while vying for the lead. Both Yarborough and Donnie Allison lost control of their cars near the finish, went spinning off the track and wound up unhurt in a grassy area while Richard Petty zoomed to victory.
Moments later, Yarborough and Bobby Allison, who had been out of contention, engaged in a fistfight. The eastern United States had been hit by a Sunday snowstorm, leaving thousands without much to do but watch TV. Most of these viewers had presumably never seen a major stock-car race and tuned in to the CBS network out of curiosity.
The fight between two good old boys from down South -- Yarborough, a native of South Carolina, and Bobby Allison, from Alabama -- provided an entertaining few minutes for viewers who had only modest interest in the race itself.
That fight transformed NASCAR from a niche sport in the South to a national attraction.
"It put NASCAR on the nationwide map," Petty told The Tampa Bay Times in 2019. "People thought racing was a Southern sport deal, and they saw the rednecks come out there at the end. It was the perfect storm, the snowstorm, everybody watching, how the race ended."
Remembering his duel for the lead with Donnie Allison some 30 years later, Yarborough said: "I had the fastest car and had it set up to where I could slingshot him on the last lap. That may have been a mistake on my part. I should maybe have gone on and passed him, gone on and won the race handily. I was trying to make a show out of it. Unfortunately, it really came out to be a show. It was one of the best things ever happened in NASCAR."
Yarborough said that he reconciled with the Allisons the next day.
William Caleb Yarborough was born on March 27, 1939, in the tiny community of Sardis, S.C., near Timmonsville, the oldest of three sons of Julian Yarborough, a tobacco farmer, and his wife, Annie. His father was killed in a private airplane crash when Cale was 10 years old or so. A year or two later, Cale got his first taste of auto racing when he attended the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina. While a teenager, he lied about his age so he could race there.
Yarborough was a football star at Timmonsville High School and received an athletic scholarship to Clemson University, whose team was coached by Frank Howard, who would spend 30 years with the Tigers. But Yarborough told Howard that he had to delay his arrival on campus to race in a NASCAR event.
"He said: 'If you go back, pack your clothes, don't come back. You either go and race or play football,"' Yarborough quoted Howard as saying in a 2008 interview with The New York Times. "So I packed my clothes and left. Of course, he kept calling. I said: 'You told me to pack my clothes, and that's what I did. I'm going to make racing my career."'
"He says, 'Son, you'll starve to death,"' Yarborough recalled. But Yarborough never returned to Clemson.
He made his NASCAR debut in 1957, driving in the Southern 500 and finishing 42nd. His first victory came in 1965 at a 200-lap race in Valdosta, Ga. His last victory came at the Atlanta Journal 500 in 1988, his final season.
Yarborough had career winnings of slightly more than $ 5 million. While continuing to live in Sardis, where he had a farm, he owned a Honda dealership in Florence, S.C.
He was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1994.
"He would not quit," Junior Johnson, Yarborough's car owner during his championship seasons, once told the publication Autoweek. "I think if he was in a situation where he had to get out of a racecar because of his stamina, it would be the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to him."
Survivors include his wife, Betty Jo, and his daughters, Julie, Kelley and B.J.
Howard, the coach at Clemson, became a fan of Yarborough, who certainly did not "starve."
"I'll never forget that he was at Talladega when I won a race there," Yarborough once said. "He was in the winner's circle. He walked up to me and put his hands on my shoulder. He said, 'Boy, I ain't never been wrong many times in my life, but I want you to know I was wrong this time."'

Tighter Tax Credits May Hurt Electric Vehicle Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers’ anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have bought more than 1 million this year. Sales will rise another 32% in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared with 47% in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
“If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing,” said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars including Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesperson said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is “cautiously optimistic” that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tennessee, will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and SUVs have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40% of Hyundai’s electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesperson said, up from just 5% before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit “is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion,” Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $3,750, a Kia spokesperson said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least 7 kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $7,500 credit, a company spokesperson said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $63,000 in November from $68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
“The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices,” Roberts of CarGurus said. “You are going to see more mainstream vehicles.”

E.V. Jobs? China Has Them to Spare.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China misjudged the rapid expansion of its electric vehicle sector, leaving a shortfall of skilled technicians as young people shun manufacturing careers.
Xing Wei graduated from a vocational high school in northeastern China in 2003 and went to work as an electrician in an auto parts factory in the country's south. The only set of wheels he could afford was a black, three-speed bicycle.
He earned $ 1,150 a year and shared a sweltering dormitory room with three other workers. "There was air-conditioning, but because we had to pay the electricity ourselves, we basically didn't turn it on," Mr. Xing said.
Two decades later, Mr. Xing, 42, makes close to $ 60,000 a year. He works as a senior electrician installing industrial robots at electric car factories for Nio, a Chinese automaker. Last winter, he bought a $ 52,000 Nio ES6 sport utility vehicle.
China's electric vehicle market is the world's largest and fastest growing. A frenzy of construction and expansion of factories has made electricians and robotics specialists a hot commodity.
"If you want to recruit people with relevant experience, there are relatively few people in this industry," Mr. Xing said.
More than 1.5 million people now work at dozens of electric vehicle companies in China and their suppliers. The largest of them, BYD, has 570,000 workers, compared with 610,000 worldwide for Detroit's Big Three combined.
As parts of China's economy slow, Beijing needs to shift workers to sectors that are still growing fast, most notably electric vehicle manufacturing. But Beijing faces a shortfall in vocational training, as well as a surplus of young people with university degrees who aren't interested in factory work.
Most in demand are skilled technicians and engineers like Mr. Xing. Assembly line workers at automotive plants earn less than half his salary.
Beijing estimated in 2021 that the country had more than twice as many jobs for skilled technicians as the actual number of qualified workers.
A report issued last year by the Shanghai government found that the highest-paid 10 percent of senior factory technicians earned at least $ 51,000 a year. Workers with these skills change jobs frequently: Before moving to Hefei in central China two years ago to work for Nio, Mr. Xing set up a stamping line in nearby Ningbo for Zeekr, a division of Zhejiang Geely.
Fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities, Chinese automakers are building electric car factories faster than sales are rising, prompting a price war that has left most companies losing money. That has caused a shakeout in the industry. Nio, for example, announced in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees. None of the cuts were in manufacturing, Nio said.
"We are already very concerned about the shortage of hands," said Ji Huaqiang, Nio's vice president of manufacturing.
The seeds of the labor shortage were planted years ago when the Chinese government's economic planners failed to see the scale of the electric car boom and to train enough workers for it.
In 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology predicted that the electric car industry would need 1.2 million workers in 2025, and warned that China had only 170,000 people then with the necessary skills.
To be sure, more than two-fifths of the country's 11 million college graduates each year study topics related to science and engineering. That is double the proportion in the United States, which also has a shortfall of welders, electricians and other industrial workers.
But many of those college graduates aspire to work in white-collar jobs at internet companies and the civil service, not at factories.
For several decades, factories in China could count on a constant flow of farmers' sons and daughters who arrived in cities and would take practically any job, no matter how dull.
One of them was Mr. Xing. He was determined as a teenager to leave his hometown, Hongshi, near China's border with North Korea. He attended a vocational high school, where his teacher said he should look for work in southeastern China, near Hong Kong. As soon as he earned his high school diploma, he packed his bags.
In Guangzhou, he found a job at a factory that stamped out car body parts for a nearby Honda assembly plant. Whenever new equipment arrived, foreign experts connected it to laptops and made all the decisions on test runs. Mr. Xing understood little.
"I could only look at them like a dummy," he said.
It left a mark on him. He lived on free cafeteria meals at the factory and saved his pay, $ 100 a month, to buy a $ 1,195 IBM laptop. He studied automation on weekends through an adult education program.
The training would help set him up for a career in the electric vehicle sector. By 2019, he had bought a nearly 1,100-square-foot condo in an outlying suburb of Ningbo, 800 miles from Guangzhou. Today, his parents are living in the condo while Mr. Xing and his wife and their two sons pay $ 350 a month to rent a 1,300-square-foot apartment in Hefei.
The Chinese government has tried to train a generation of workers like Mr. Xing, with mixed results.
In 2014, Xi Jinping, China's top leader, exhorted government and Communist Party officials, as well as businesses, to "cultivate hundreds of millions of high-quality laborers and technical and skilled personnel."
But that goal has collided with the rising aspirations of Chinese parents who have shown less interest in sending their children to vocational high schools to learn the skills of an electrician, a machinist or another technician.
The number of teenagers entering vocational and technical high schools plummeted 25 percent between 2010 and 2021, the year with the most recent data. At the same time, the number of students attending academic high schools barely changed.
"Factory jobs are often associated with the 'three D's' -- dirty, dangerous and demeaning," said Minhua Ling, an associate professor specializing in China's vocational education system at the Geneva Graduate Institute. Younger Chinese "find it demeaning," she said. "Feeling like a machine is not meaningful to them."
About 60 percent of the Chinese population turning 18 enroll at a university. In 2000, it was 10 percent.
Companies in China have been slower than those in some countries, like Germany, to set up long-term apprentice programs to train future factory floor leaders.
"The demand rose so quickly that the education system was caught flat-footed, and it takes a few years to adequately prepare and train top-notch technicians," said Gerard A. Postiglione, an emeritus professor of higher education research at the University of Hong Kong.
A steepening decline in birthrates adds to the urgency of the challenge.
The number of young people turning 18 each year in China has dropped by more than 40 percent since the mid-1980s. Based on the number of babies born in the past few years, the number of 18-year-olds will halve in the coming years.
China, and particularly the electric car industry, is trying to use automation to address its shortage of willing hands.
According to the International Federation of Robotics, businesses in China installed more industrial robots in 2022 than the rest of the world combined. It exceeded its biggest manufacturing rivals, Japan, the United States, South Korea and Germany.
By 2027, Nio plans to replace half its managerial positions with artificial intelligence and a third of its factory workers with robots, said Mr. Ji, the company's vice president of manufacturing. One of Nio's factories makes 300,000 E.V. motors a year and has a mere 30 workers.
"All of these companies have a hard time to find blue-collar labor," said Zhou Linlin, the chief executive of Principle Capital, a Shanghai investment firm with stakes in numerous Chinese factories. "That's why all the companies are looking for automation and robotics solutions."
But robots can make up for only some of China's growing demand for factory technicians.
Volkswagen is hiring for a new research center near Nio, in Hefei, that will staff 3,000 engineers to develop electric cars, and it is preparing to build electric cars there.
That means even more demand for specialists like Mr. Xing, who already has trouble filling his own team of electricians. "We are also constantly recruiting," he said, "and we are not able to recruit suitable, relevant personnel."

Ford to Cut F-150 Lightning Production as E.V. Sales Slow: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ford and other automakers have had to readjust their electric vehicle production plans because sales have been weaker than they had expected.
Slower-than-expected growth in sales of electric vehicles has forced several automakers to scale back once-ambitious production plans. Ford Motor has become the latest company to join that pullback.
In a memo sent to suppliers, the company said that it now expected to produce an average of 1,600 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks per week in 2024, about half of the level it had previously hoped to achieve.
The reduced target reflects the substantial dimming of expectations for sales of battery-powered cars and trucks that automakers are now coming to grips with. Ford and its main rival, General Motors, had been racing to increase production of a variety of electric vehicles, but consumer enthusiasm has not kept pace with those plans over the last six months. Some would-be buyers have been put off by the high prices of many electric vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning, as well as the availability and reliability of charging stations.
G.M. once expected to produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024, but withdrew that goal in November, and is delaying some new electric models. Rivian, a younger automaker, has said it aims to make 52,000 electric vehicles by the end of this year, a third of the 150,000 a year it is hoping its Illinois factory will eventually produce.
Similarly, Ford had hoped to have the capacity to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year by the end of next year. As recently as September, Ford said it aimed to be able to make 150,000 electric F-150s a year -- a rate of about 3,000 vehicles a week. It has also lowered production plans for its electric sport utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
"Given the dynamic E.V. environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand," Ford's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said last month in a conference call with financial analysts.
News of Ford's memo to suppliers was earlier reported by Automotive News.
Even with the reduced target, Ford still expects 2024 production and sales of the Lightning to easily surpass 2023 levels, a spokeswoman said. In the first 11 months of this year, Ford sold more than 20,000 of the trucks, a rise of more than 50 percent from the same period in 2022. The company's sales of all electric models grew 16 percent, to more than 62,000 vehicles.
Spurred by Tesla and its rapid growth in sales and profits, traditional automakers have been spending tens of billions of dollars to develop an array of electric models and to tool up factories to produce them and their batteries.
But even Tesla has struggled with slower sales growth this year. That has forced the company to cut prices of its two most popular models several times, pushing down its profit margin significantly.
Other companies are pushing back plans for new models. Last month, G.M. said it would delay electric versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, and the Chevrolet Equinox sport-utility vehicle. Honda once planned to develop a small electric car with G.M. but nixed that effort this year.
Ford has four battery plants under construction in the United States, but recently said it would scale back the size of one of those, in Michigan.
Early on, automakers expected customers to flock to electric cars and trucks. At the end of 2021, Ford had accepted reservations for more than 200,000 F-150 Lightnings.
But strong early interest has not always resulted in booming sales. Cost is a big culprit. The price of batteries remains high, which has made some electric vehicles much more expensive than comparable gasoline-powered models at a time when consumers have been struggling with inflation.
When it introduced the Lightning, Ford said the truck would start at $ 40,000 but the company raised prices soon after, disappointing many people who reserved the truck. The pickup now starts at $ 50,000 and the top-of-the-line version starts at $ 92,000.
In addition it can also be hard to find enough places to charge electric cars and trucks in many parts of the country, unnerving some car buyers, especially people who do not have a garage or driveway where they can install a personal charger. Some drivers have also complained about long lines at public chargers or that some machines are broken or take too long to charge vehicles.
"We are going to respond to demand," Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said in a November conference call. "We are going to make sure we have the right products at the right time, but we're not overbuilding."

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Tiny Vehicles Lead Big Shift Away From Oil: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Big Oil faces a tiny foe on the streets of Asia and Africa. The noisy, noxious vehicles that run on two and three wheels, carrying billions of people daily, are quietly going electric -- in turn knocking down oil demand by one million barrels a day this year.
In Kenya and Rwanda, dozens of start-ups are vying to replace oil-guzzling motorcycle taxis with battery-powered ones. In India, more than half of all new three-wheeled vehicles sold and registered this year were battery-operated. Indonesia and Thailand are also encouraging electrification of motorcycle taxis.
China dominates the market. Its government began promoting electric vehicles decades ago in a bid to clean its smog-choked cities, which explains why a vast majority of the world's electric two-wheelers are in China.
The shift to electric mobility overall has reduced global oil demand by 1.8 million barrels every day, according to BloombergNEF, a research arm of Michael Bloomberg's financial data and media company. Two- and three-wheelers account for 60 percent of that reduction, or 1.08 million barrels.
Taken together, cars and smaller electric vehicles are projected to displace only 4 percent of total oil demand this year. Still, their growth is vital to the energy transition because transportation accounts for about 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Of all the changes the world is making to slow further warming, electric vehicle sales are the only category on track to meet climate goals, according to an exhaustive independent study.
Electric vehicles also solve the more immediate problem of air pollution, which the World Health Organization links to an estimated seven million premature deaths annually.
The big shift to tiny electric vehicles is underappreciated in the United States and Europe, where, despite the popularity of electric bicycles and scooters, the focus has been mainly on cars.
The global majority, though, doesn't roll on four wheels.
In Nairobi and Hanoi, motorcycles serve as taxis. In Mumbai, scooters can carry a family of four. In China, electric bicycles are how millions commute.
"Electric bikes are quieter, much more efficient and good for the environment," said Jesse Forrester, the founder of Mazi Mobility, which has 60 electric motorcycle taxis, known as boda-bodas, on the roads in Nairobi. "There's a quiet revolution now in Kenya driving this transformation for the future."
Mr. Forrester's firm is among several competing to establish an electric two-wheeler ecosystem, selling or assembling imported bikes, installing chargers and working with lenders to offer cheap credit.
Elsewhere, established motorcycle manufacturers are rolling out battery-powered models, including an electric scooter for under $ 1,800 by India-based Hero MotoCorp. Ride-sharing companies, like Ola, also based in India, are getting in on the business. And Honda recently said it was investing $ 3.4 billion with the aim of selling four million electric motorcycles a year by 2030.
The biggest obstacle to small electric vehicles is government policy. Countries like Mexico that subsidize oil rather than batteries have few electric two- and three-wheelers -- or as Karla Ramirez, a motorcycle dealer in Mexico City, put it, they are "a niche product."
'The Future of Transportation'
At a gas station on the side of a highway near Nairobi, a team from ARC Ride, one of the city's leading electric boda-boda start-ups, was putting up a shiny new cabinet that opens with a phone app.
Put a spent lithium battery into an empty locker, take out a fully charged one from another and you're good to go for at least 90 kilometers (56 miles) -- nearly enough for a full day's work for the motorcycle-taxi drivers.
ARC has installed 72 swap stations in Nairobi, and it has plans to set up over 25 more in the coming months, one for every couple of kilometers on the city's busiest routes.
"We are interested in a solution that's going to enable mass electric transport," said Felix Saro-Wiwa, head of sustainable growth at ARC Ride.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa has a history in this business. His grandfather, Ken Saro-Wiwa, was a human-rights activist who drew international attention to the social and environmental harms of oil production in his native Nigeria. He was executed in 1995 by a military government.
There are around 1,500 electric boda-bodas in circulation in Kenya, a tiny fraction of the estimated 1.3 million boda-bodas in the country.
Still, Kenya is at a critical juncture in its energy transition. Fuel prices skyrocketed when Russia invaded Ukraine, and again after the Kenyan government scrapped fossil fuel subsidies in September 2022. That has driven up the cost of living, precipitated widespread, sometimes violent, anti-government protests and provided an opening for proponents of electric mobility. Battery-run vehicles are cheaper to operate, though they are still about 5 percent more expensive to purchase than gasoline models.
Boda-boda sellers like Mazi and ARC have teamed up with creditors offering cheap loans, which is the only way most drivers in Kenya can afford an electric motorcycle. Uber is testing Nairobi as the first African city with electric two-wheeler options. Kenya's president, William Ruto, has set a target of 200,000 electric motorcycles across the country before 2025.
Many hurdles remain. Electricity is expensive. The government exempted electric motorcycle sellers from import duties -- but the policy needs approval every year, which makes it hard for companies to plan. There's a cumbersome bureaucracy to import parts. The depreciating Kenyan currency doesn't help.
Electric bikes from different start-ups run on incompatible batteries and operating systems, hindering widespread use. Mr. Saro-Wiwa, though, is bullish that when the dust settles, the shift away from oil and gas will take off. "This is what the future of transportation in Kenya looks like," he said.
A Price-Sensitive Market
Shankar Rai is on the cutting edge of India's electric vehicle transition.
A 45-year-old father of three, Mr. Rai drives a three-wheeled electric rickshaw nine hours a day, six days a week through Darbhanga, a mostly poor Indian city near Nepal. He makes roughly 1,000 rupees ( $ 12) a day, nearly half of which goes to a friend, who owns the rickshaw and charges it overnight. The rest goes to food and school fees.
"We are poor people so we manage to survive," Mr. Rai says.
He is part of a $ 1.2 billion push by the Indian government to make sure 30 percent of vehicles on the road are battery-powered by 2030.
Much of that government largess goes to auto dealers, which pass on the savings to buyers of rickshaws by lowering prices.
In Darbhanga, a new acid-battery rickshaw, like the one Mr. Rai drives, sells for around 175,000 rupees, or $ 2,100. That's half the price of a new rickshaw powered by natural gas. Charging the battery costs 20 rupees (25 cents), one-fourth of the price of filling a gas tank.
The rebates seem to be working. Reliance Industries, India's biggest company, is converting its three-wheeled cargo vehicles from gas to electric. Food delivery services are going electric as quickly as possible.
Chetan Maini, whose company Sun Mobility builds charging infrastructure, said business was growing fast. Battery prices are dropping, helping to push down the cost of electric two- and three-wheelers. "When the crossover point happens here," Mr. Maini predicted, "the effect is very quick, hockey-stick shaped, because it's more price-sensitive."
In Darbhanga, around 200 electric rickshaws are sold a month, according to Balaji Motors, a dealer. In two years, a sales manager estimates, electric rickshaws will dominate the streets.
By Indian standards, Darbhanga, with a population of 300,000 people, could be called a sleepy town. Quiet, though, it is not. Loudspeakers blast music from temples and advertising jingles from open-air shops. Horns honk; engines sputter.
In that soundscape, Mr. Rai's purring electric rickshaw is a relative rarity, one that delighted a recent passenger, a retired teacher named Satyen Vir Jha.
Mr. Jha, 65, chose the vehicle not just because it's quieter, but also because it offers a smoother ride that's easier on his bad back. "Other vehicles make my problem worse," he said, "but not this one."
For good measure, Mr. Jha wore a hernia band.
The driver, Mr. Rai, nodded in agreement. He drove a gas-powered rickshaw for 15 years before switching to the electric model this year.
Mr. Jha said he liked feeling that he was on the right side of history. "If all of the old vehicles on the road were replaced by these," he said, "we will have fewer accidents and less pollution."
Stuck in the Slow Lane
Balloons and reggaeton brought an all-day-party vibe to Karla Ramirez's motorcycle showroom in the posh Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City. Of the 30 motorcycles on offer, one electric model -- a gray-and-white bike called the Voltium Gravity -- was displayed prominently.
On a recent Friday, when a slight, serious-faced customer named José Antonio Palmares strolled in, Ms. Ramirez gamely guided him to the Voltium.
"It's a completely different concept," she said. "You don't use gasoline, and it doesn't pollute. And you can test ride it for free."
Mr. Palmares said he liked the bike "for the environment." But then doubt rolled in like a cloud: "I have a lot of hills in my neighborhood," he said, "so I need power and some weight."
Ms. Ramirez, a consummate saleswoman, led him to the model charging station, explaining that the battery could be swapped with a card swipe.
Mr. Palmares raised an eyebrow. "What if my battery goes dead in the middle of a ride?" he asked. He wanted to look at fossil fuel models.
Ms. Ramirez was accustomed to such misgivings. Of the roughly 55 vehicles that she sells on average every month, one is electric. It doesn't help that the cheapest electric model is pricier than conventional bikes. Only 1,000 out of 1.25 million motorcycles sold last year were powered by batteries, according to the Mexican Association of Motorcycle Manufacturers and Importers.
The Mexican government offers few electric vehicle incentives. "Our president," Ms. Ramirez grumbled, "loves petroleum too much."
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has blocked efforts to expand renewable energy and staked his country's future on fossil fuels, championing Petróleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil company. His government, like others in Latin America, focuses subsidies on conventional fuels, along with bus and subway rides.
Price is the biggest barrier for electric two-wheeler enthusiasts, including Ms. Ramirez, who rides a gasoline-powered motorcycle and is eyeing an electric one. "But I need to save up the money first," she said.

Full text: For 30 years she collaborated with the filmmaker Stan Brakhage, her husband, often appearing on camera. After they divorced, she lived off the grid and wrote about her life.
Jane Wodening, the longtime collaborator and wife of Stan Brakhage, the avant-garde filmmaker, who flourished as an author after their divorce, writing stories about her years living on the road and then alone in a mountain shack, died on Nov. 17 at her home in Denver. She was 87.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Crystal Brakhage.
Mr. Brakhage, who died in 2003, was among the most influential experimental filmmakers of the 20th century, though his work could be considered an acquired taste. He made hundreds of movies, most of them silent, that were deeply personal, sometimes elegiac and very beautiful, though they dispensed with any recognizable narrative, often veering into complete abstraction.
For three decades, starting in the 1960s, he and Ms. Wodening (pronounced WOE-den-ing) lived a spartan life in a century-old cabin in a ghost town in the Rocky Mountains called Lump Gulch, sharing it with their five children and many animals, including a donkey and a pigeon named Fanny.
It was this world that Mr. Brakhage captured in his idiosyncratic, inscrutable way, in what the film critic J. Hoberman, writing in The Village Voice, described as "home movies raised to the zillionth power -- silent and rhythmic, based on an invented language of percussive shifts in exposure or focus, multiple superimpositions, refracted light, and staccato camera moves."
Ms. Wodening was the star of many of them. He filmed her delivering their first child in a bathtub in "Window Water Baby Moving" (1959), a startlingly lovely work that is considered one of his masterpieces. "Wedlock House: An Intercourse" (1959) is a kind of short horror film, with flickering images of the couple having sex interspersed with flickering shots of them having an argument.
The work didn't sit well with feminists, who accused Mr. Brakhage of objectifying his wife. But Ms. Wodening didn't see herself that way.
"Jane was committed to the filmmaking and the artistic enterprise," said John Powers, who is an assistant professor of film and media studies at Washington University in St. Louis and working on a biography of Mr. Brakhage. "Stan felt he was in service to the muse," he added, in a phone interview, "and she considered herself a loyal supporter of that muse, and the muse needed help."
A lot of help. Ms. Wodening offered ideas, critiques and camera and sound assistance, along with running the day-to-day business that was "Stan Brakhage." He signed his work "By Brakhage," which he always said meant the two of them.
But Mr. Brakhage, never totally faithful, left Ms. Wodening for another woman, and in 1987 the couple divorced. The children had left home, the cabin was sold, as were the animals, and Ms. Wodening took off in a bright yellow Honda Civic kitted out so that she could live in it. (The back seat was removed, among other interventions.)
For three years she spent months at a time on the road, touring the country, camping in arroyos, mountain trails and friends' driveways, even working for a spell as a tour guide at an archaeological site near Barstow, Calif., in the Mojave Desert.
"Driveabout," a 2016 account of that time from Sockwood Press, one of the small presses that has published her work over the years, is charming, funny and often quite profound, like Thoreau but spiced with mild profanity and more drama, as Ms. Wodening faced perils as a single woman sleeping in truck stops, camping near sketchy characters and nursing an old friend through delirium tremens.
In this and other works, she came into her own. Her voice was as engaging and charming as her ex-husband's was abstruse and highfalutin. Steve Clay, a founder of Granary Books in New York City, a small publishing house that is devoted to poetry and art books and that has put out works by Ms. Wodening, recalled his expectation that the wife of Stan Brakhage would be more "formally experimental" in her writing. "Instead, it was sort of folksy and straightforward," he wrote in an email.
To film buffs, however, Ms. Wodening remained a mythic figure -- an "Enigmatic Character in Film History" as one radio program described her in a headline.
She was born Mary Jane Collom on Sept. 7, 1936, in Chicago, and grew up in Fraser, Colo., a small town in the Rockies about 70 miles northwest of Denver. Her parents, Harry and Margaret (Jack) Collom, were teachers at the local school, where Harry was also the principal.
Jane was a shy child who preferred the company of animals, especially dogs. (She wrote that she spoke canine sooner than proper English.) She worked in an animal hospital and enrolled at Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, thinking she would study to be a vet, before dropping out.
When she met Mr. Brakhage, "we were adolescent wrecks," she told an audience a few years ago at Los Angeles Filmforum, a showcase for experimental movies. They married in 1957; she was 21 and he was 24, and "it was quite a relief for both of us."
She recalled her first foray into his films, shortly after their marriage, when he declared: "You should take your clothes off, and we should make a film about having sex." She balked at first -- "I'm not that kind of girl!" -- but he said, "I'm an artist, and an artist has to have a nude." She thought about all the great nudes of history -- from Raphael to Duchamp -- and told herself, "'I have an opportunity to join a group of people I quite admire,' so I stripped and went to it."
For most of her adult life, she was Jane Brakhage. When she returned from her car travels, transformed, she changed her name. She settled on Wodening, meaning child of Woden, the Anglo-Saxon god; since her family lineage stretched back to the early Britons, it felt somehow appropriate, she said. And she bought property near Eldora, Colo., about 20 miles west of Boulder, a mountainous site where she lived in a Hobbit-like shack with no electricity or running water -- but thousands of books and a typewriter -- living a hermit's life for the better part of a decade.
It agreed with her.
When her family worried about communicating with her in an emergency, she became a ham radio operator, learning morse code to do so, and found community among other hammers, as they called themselves, who were mostly men and introverts like herself. Her call sign ended with the letters HPH, to which she gave the phonetics "Hermits Prefer Hills."
"To become a hermit and at the same time to become popular was not only paradoxical," she wrote in "Living Up There," her memoir of her years in the mountains, "it was a tremendous delight."
Ms. Wodening was the author of 14 books, including "Wolf Dictionary," about how wolves communicate with one another. She had a loyal following and small but steady sales.
Toward the end of her decade at Fourth of July Canyon, as her mountain home was known, she connected with another hammer, Carlos Seegmiller, a computer programmer. He lured her back to civilization (and helped her trade her typewriter for a computer). They lived together in Denver until his death in 2008.
In addition to her daughter, Crystal, Ms. Wodening is survived by her daughters Myrrena Schwegmann and Neowyn Bartek; her sons, Bearthm and Rarc Brakhage; 14 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
At her death, Ms. Wodening was working on a history of the world starting with the Big Bang.

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

The United Auto Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies — a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the UAW won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25% or more over 4 1/2 years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle startups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.

Broadcom Closes Deal for Cloud Firm VMware
Broadcom on Wednesday closed its $ 69 billion acquisition of the cloud-computing firm VMware after receiving regulatory approval in its last major market, China, and ending a monthslong saga.
The deal, one of the biggest globally when announced in May 2022, was the latest in the chief executive Hock Tan's efforts to increase the chipmaker's software business.
China's regulatory approval came through on Tuesday after ongoing tensions with the U.S. around tougher chip export control measures had stoked fears among some investors on the company's ability to close the deal before the Nov. 26 deadline.

Volkswagen Will Raise Salaries at Factory 11%
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would raise salaries 11 percent for production workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., weeks after the United Auto Workers union won major pay and benefit increases from the three Detroit automakers.
The company and other nonunion automakers in the U.S. have come under increased pressure to improve pay and benefits after the record contracts achieved by the U.A.W. in late October after thousands of its members went on a six-week targeted strike.
Honda and Toyota have raised wages for nonunion U.S. factory workers in recent weeks amid signs that the union is turning its attention to organizing the work force at foreign-owned and Tesla auto plants.
Hyundai Motor has also announced a 25 percent increase over the next four years for nonunion production workers in Alabama and Georgia. REUTERS

Higher Borrowing Costs Could Hinder Deere
Deere forecast 2024 profits below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, saying high borrowing costs and tighter budgets will likely dent demand for the farm equipment maker's agriculture and construction machinery.
Deere, a barometer for the global economy, predicted a downturn in agriculture and construction equipment sales across all of its regions for the fiscal year ahead, validating analysts' concern that demand may have peaked for big industrial companies.
The company now expects 2024 net income between $ 7.75 billion and $ 8.25 billion, far below the consensus for $ 9.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
The heavy equipment maker's net income for the quarter rose to $ 2.37 billion, or $ 8.26 per share.
Despite beating Wall Street profit estimates, the manufacturer's stock slump mirrors peers such as Caterpillar that also outperformed forecasts. REUTERS

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union hopes the agreements with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will help it make inroads at other companies.
Members of the United Automobile Workers union have given their backing to new contracts with the three big U.S. automakers, agreements that deliver hefty wage increases and other gains that had eluded the union for more than 20 years.
In the most closely contested vote, the tentative contract agreement at General Motors won the support of 55 percent of the nearly 36,000 members casting ballots, according to a tally from all the G.M. locals that the union posted on Thursday.
Tentative agreements with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Chrysler, appeared headed for approval by more decisive margins, nearly complete results there showed.
A spokesman for the union confirmed the accuracy of the tallies but declined to comment further.
The agreements are similar across the three automakers and raise the top wage for production workers 25 percent, to more than $ 40 over four and a half years, from $ 32. They were reached last month after a six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the companies -- a strategy spearheaded by the union's new president, Shawn Fain, who had vowed to take a more adversarial approach to negotiations than his predecessors.
The agreements appear to have quickly reverberated across the auto industry, with Toyota, Hyundai and Honda announcing significant wage increase at nonunion plants in the United States only days later.
"We call that the U.A.W. bump, and that stands for 'U Are Welcome,"' Mr. Fain said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee this week. "And we're very proud of that. And when these workers decide to organize and join the U.A.W., they're going to realize the full benefit of union membership and get what they're fully due."
The new contracts also included larger company contributions to workers' retirement plans and the right to strike over plant closures. All three automakers declined to comment on the ratification votes.
Mr. Fain said the union was seeking to capitalize on its momentum by waging muscular organizing campaigns at nonunion plants, and, in remarks submitted to the Senate committee, he added that thousands of workers were already contacting the union and signing union cards.
But even Mr. Fain's tough approach in the talks with the Big Three did not yield terms attractive enough to many union members. G.M. workers at several large plants voted against the tentative agreement by large margins.
In contrast, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters recently approved a new contract at United Parcel Service with 86 percent support, while a new contract between the Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios passed with 99 percent support.
Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, said Mr. Fain had achieved a major victory despite having taken office only a few months earlier with a goal of reorienting the union.
Dr. Givan said the union's approach of initially striking at one plant at each of the three automakers and ramping up over time had "really upended a lot of conventional wisdom" in the labor movement and had proved unusually successful at reversing some concessions that the union had accepted years earlier, like the suspension of a cost-of-living adjustment.
"This shows that if workers build enough power, they can win things back," she said.
U.A.W. members at Mack Truck also ratified a contract on Wednesday, after rejecting an initial agreement with the company.
Across the three automakers, skepticism toward the agreements arose in large part from veteran workers who felt that the proposed contracts did not go far enough to compensate them for years of concessions and weak wage growth, even given strong gains for newer workers. Wages for some newer workers will more than double over the next four years.
Huey Harris, a G.M. employee at a large truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., who has worked at the company for over 20 years, said the deal should have gone further in rewarding veteran workers, though he ultimately voted for it. "The traditional people didn't think they were offered enough in the contract," he said.
Several longtime employees of the Big Three automakers said that even after the large gains of the new contract, they would not be making more than when they started their careers.
Curtis March, who works at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, said he made about $ 18 an hour once he reached the top wage for production workers at the company in the early 1990s, equivalent to more than $ 40 today when adjusted for inflation. He will make about $ 36 in the first year of the new contract.
Mr. March said the deal was likely to pass at Ford because it placated more recent employees, who outnumber veterans like him. Workers at his plant approved the deal after voting against several previous contracts.
Despite the ultimate success, the path to ratifying the contracts has included some internal strains for Mr. Fain and the union. Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group that played a key role in electing Mr. Fain and six other members of the U.A.W. executive board to their positions, declined to formally recommend that union members approve the contract even after Mr. Fain urged the group to do so at a recent meeting, according to three people familiar with the meeting. Instead, Unite All Workers passed a resolution committing it to stay neutral during the ratification vote, though it stated that the group "celebrates the record gains made in this agreement."
Two of these people also said the union's General Motors department had been less communicative and less proactive in distributing information about the contract to local union officials and members than the Ford and Stellantis departments.
The union declined to comment on these developments.
Ratification could also bring political benefits to President Biden, who waded into the negotiations over the summer and fall, and who risked angering business leaders by increasingly siding with the union's members.
Administration officials were taken aback in August when Mr. Fain called for a 40 percent raise for autoworkers and a four-day workweek. Executives at the Big Three called the White House to ask if Mr. Fain was serious. A senior administration official said Biden aides had reassured them that the union wanted a deal, but acknowledged that the negotiations could go quite differently from the way the automakers were used to.
In mid-September, when Mr. Biden was in New York for meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he joined aides on a video call to make a decision that he and his team had been building toward for weeks: to join autoworkers on a picket line in Detroit. That decision infuriated executives, the administration official said, but the White House saw it as a victory for the president and for workers, by making a clear statement about where Mr. Biden stood in the negotiations.
Some autoworkers argued that the union had erred by failing to expand the strike, which eventually included about one-third of the companies' unionized workers in the United States, even more.
LaDonna Newman, another longtime Ford worker who opposed the contract because of its limited gains for veteran workers, said she believed the union could have won more at the bargaining table had it been willing to escalate further.
Still, she did not blame Mr. Fain for the outcome. "He walked into a burning building," Ms. Newman said. "I give him a lot of kudos for having the courage to go against the corporations."

Long-Timers Are Resisting G.M. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many longstanding General Motors workers have been voting against the tentative accord, which they feel insufficiently improves retirement benefits.
A United Automobile Workers union vote on a tentative contract agreement with General Motors that provides record wage increases has run into unexpectedly strong resistance from veteran workers.
Voting at most union locals has been completed and the final result, due as early as Thursday evening, will very likely be decided by a narrow margin. A majority of workers at several large plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the contract, though union members at a large sport utility plant in Arlington, Texas, voted in favor of it.
G.M., Ford Motor and Stellantis agreed to similar contracts with the union after U.A.W. members went on strike at select plants and warehouses. Workers walked off the job at the first three plants on Sept. 15 and stayed on strike for more than 40 days. It was the first time the union has struck all three automakers at the same time, though it did not shut down all of the factories of any company.
The agreement appears to be headed for ratification at Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles, by comfortable margins, according to running tallies the U.A.W. published online.
At G.M., many veteran workers have opposed the contract because they want the company to contribute more money to retirement plans and the cost of health care for retirees.
"I've heard from some traditional workers who said there wasn't enough in there for them," said David Green, director of the U.A.W. Region 2B, which includes Ohio, Indiana and a small part of Michigan. He voted for the contract.
David Miller, a 20-year G.M. veteran who works at a big truck assembly plant in Flint, Mich., said the absence of retiree health benefits was the reason he had voted no. "I'm not voting yes on any contract that doesn't have that in it because I don't need the health care when I'm 25 -- I'm 65," he said. "I'm at the mercy of Medicare."
General Motors declined to comment on the contract vote.
The tentative contract raises the top wage by 25 percent, from $ 32 to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. The increase is more than the combined wage increases the union has won over the past 22 years, according to U.A.W. officials.
Newer hires who are lower on the pay scale will see larger increases that take them to the new top wage. And workers who were recently hired will see their hourly pay double.
The agreement also provides for cost-of-living adjustments that will nudge wages higher if inflation persists as well as enhanced company contributions to pensions and retirement plans, more paid time off and the ability to strike if any plant is closed during the term of the contract.
To be ratified, the agreement must secure a simple majority. More than 46,000 U.A.W. workers work at G.M., although not all of them are likely to turn in ballots. More than 14,000 company employees took part in the targeted strikes.
As of Wednesday afternoon, an online vote tally that the union maintains showed that just over 54 percent of the votes were in favor of the contract, but that tally did not include numbers from some big plants.
If the tentative agreement is voted down, it will represent a big setback for the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, who was elected this year and promised to take a more aggressive approach in the contract talks in hopes of winning significant pay increases and reversing some of the concessions the union accepted in past contracts.
He appeared to deliver that in what was widely regarded as a record deal. President Biden, who joined striking workers on the picket line in September at a G.M. site in Belleville, Mich., hailed Mr. Fain's efforts. The president joined Mr. Fain last week at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis agreed to keep open after halting production this year.
"I don't think it diminishes Shawn Fain's luster that much because of a close ratification vote," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means expectations were high, and had he not delivered as much as he did, it wouldn't have passed."
After the contracts with the three Detroit automakers are ratified, Mr. Fain hopes to try to organize workers at nonunion plants in the South owned by Toyota, Honda and other foreign automakers, and the nonunion plants that Tesla operates in California and Texas.
Since the terms of the U.A.W. agreements were announced, some of those companies have increased wages of factory workers. Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates by 9 percent in January. Honda and Hyundai will lift wages 11 percent and 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
"Everybody at those companies should say, 'Thank you, U.A.W.,"' Mr. Wheaton said. "Those increases wouldn't have happened without the new U.A.W. contract."

After U.A.W.'s Agreement, More Carmakers Raise Pay
South Korean automaker Hyundai has joined Honda and Toyota in raising factory wages after the United Auto Workers reached new contract deals with Detroit automakers.
Hyundai said Monday it will raise factory worker pay 25 percent by 2028, matching the general wage increase won by the U.A.W. Toyota raised factory pay 9 percent to 10 percent starting in January, while Honda said it will increase wages 11 percent during the same period.
Labor experts say the increases are at least in part aimed at thwarting U.A.W. President Shawn Fain's strategy of trying to organize U.S. auto plants run by foreign automakers and Tesla. Mr. Fain said terrified auto executives at nonunion plants are raising wages, and he called Toyota's pay increase the U.A.W. bump.
"U.A.W., that stands for 'You Are Welcome,"' he said.

Emirates Plans to Buy
$ 52 Billion of Boeing Jets
Long-haul carrier Emirates opened the Dubai Air Show on Monday with a $ 52 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft, showing how aviation has bounced back after the groundings of the coronavirus pandemic, even as Israel's war with Hamas clouds regional security.
Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, followed up with an $ 11 billion order of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, the first wide-body aircraft in its fleet. Together, the sales marked a significant win for Virginia-based Boeing on the first day of the air show, as airlines appear poised for even more billion-dollar deals this year.
Emirates C.E.O. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said the carrier would purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s.
Emirates will also add five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30, Sheikh Saeed said.

Continental Plans to Cut Thousands of Workers
The German car parts manufacturer Continental said on Monday that it would cut thousands of jobs in its automotive division worldwide as part of a plan to save 400 million euros ( $ 428 million) a year from 2025.
The exact number of job cuts was not immediately clear, but it will amount to the "mid-four-digit range," the company said.
The news comes amid ongoing reports that Continental plans a restructuring and potential sell-offs, with its C.E.O., Nikolai Setzer, saying in September he was considering a change in ownership of the company's ContiTech division.
The works council of the automotive division urged the company in an internal statement seen by Reuters to rule out outright dismissals and use all possible measures to keep its work force on, from part-time retirement for older workers to retraining and reallocating staff.

Haaland Talks Up Clean-Power Gains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The administration said 15 clean energy projects were making solid progress and that it was on track to meet its goals for 2025.
The Biden administration announced on Monday progress on 15 large renewable energy projects, an apparent effort to project confidence in an industry that is facing steep challenges.
All of the developments are on federal lands in the West, including a geothermal lease sale across 12 counties in Northern Nevada, a new transmission line west of Phoenix, and the completed construction of more than 800 megawatts of solar power in Southern California.
"This administration is taking an all-hands-on-deck approach toward ambitious clean energy goals," said Deb Haaland, secretary of the Interior Department, which oversees public lands.
The administration wants to issue permits for 25 gigawatts of renewable energy on public lands by 2025, enough to power about five million homes. It's a target that could be surpassed if all the projects announced on Monday reach completion.
The announcements come at a time of setbacks for offshore wind farms. Orsted, a Danish developer, recently announced that it was scrapping two planned wind farms off the coast of New Jersey, citing problems with supply chains, global inflation and rising interest rates.
Avangrid, a subsidiary of a Spanish utility company, Iberdrola, terminated a long-term power purchase agreement for the Park City Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts. Over the summer, Avangrid pulled out of another project with Commonwealth Wind for an offshore farm south of Martha's Vineyard.
According to ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm, 24 percent of offshore wind capacity that has been contracted is now at risk. The cancellations threaten the administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
The troubles with renewable energy extend to electric vehicles. Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, acknowledged a "bumpy" transition as the company announced that it would not meet its target of building 100,000 electric vehicles in the second half of this year and another 400,000 in the first six months of 2024. Honda scrapped a $ 5 billion deal with General Motors to build an affordable electric vehicle. Ford Motor announced that it was delaying the start of production at one of its two electric vehicle battery plants in Kentucky.
Republicans who oppose a transition away from fossil fuels said the headwinds proved that clean energy is not economically viable.
"President Biden's green energy obsession is driving up the cost of living and undermining the American economy," Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said. "Even billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded loans aren't enough to make his green economic nightmare work."
Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, said the Inflation Reduction Act that President Biden signed last year to invest $ 370 billion in clean energy was not enough to overcome inflation and rising interest rates.
But John Larsen, a partner at Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan energy research firm, called economic challenges "a bump in the road" and noted there were bright spots.
A record number of 300,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the third quarter of 2023, about 8 percent of all vehicle sales. Manufacturers are projected to sell one million electric vehicles this year, another record, Mr. Larsen said.
Clean electricity installations also hit a record of nearly 6 gigawatts this year. That's up 13 percent from a year ago, he said. And a report that Rhodium did with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that $ 213 billion had been invested in clean energy manufacturing and deployment in the United States between mid-2022 and mid-2023, a 37 percent increase from the previous year.
"So far on net, 2023 is still looking promising," Mr. Larsen said. "If we're having the same conversation again in a year, that would be troubling."
The Interior Department's announcement highlighted two major solar projects that are now running: a 500-megawatt photovoltaic facility in Riverside County, Calif., that can power 146,000 homes and the nearby Arlington Solar Energy Center that is generating 364 megawatts to power 111,000 homes. Both projects include battery energy storage.
This week the Bureau of Land Management, the agency under the Interior Department that manages 245 million acres of public lands, is scheduled to issue a draft environmental review of a 500-kilovolt transmission project through Utah and Nevada that is slated to receive federal funding. The agency also plans to approve construction of another 500-kilovolt transmission line crossing public lands about 60 miles west of Phoenix. When completed, the line will deliver electricity from a 150-megawatt solar generation facility in Maricopa County, Ariz.
The Bureau of Land Management also is announcing a geothermal lease sale, offering 45 parcels totaling 135,067 acres in Nevada, inviting public comment for seven solar projects in Nevada that are expected to generate 5.3 gigawatts of electricity, and developing draft environmental reviews for a geothermal exploration project in Lyon County, Nev., as well as a 700-megawatt solar photovoltaic and battery energy storage system in Yuman, Ariz.
Ms. Haaland said that since 2021 the Biden administration has approved 46 clean energy projects including six solar farms, 10 geothermal facilities and 20 transmission lines on about 35,000 acres of federal lands. Together, those would produce electricity to power more than 3.5 million homes.

A Hot Spot's Stardust Still Flickers in Memories: [Style Desk]

Full text: One recent morning, in the bustle of Florence's ancient central market, Silvano Marchetto, a stout 76-year-old man with a mane of white hair, sat nursing a Negroni as he considered what he wanted to cook for dinner. The butchers and fishmongers who walked by threw respectful nods his way.
The silver bracelets on his wrists jangled as he polished off his drink. Shuffling past meat displays and fruit stands as he went deeper into the market, he grunted reminiscences about his old life in New York City, back when he ran a celebrity haven in Greenwich Village, Da Silvano.
"Lou Reed always said I served the best branzino."
"Rihanna loved my taglierini contadina."
"Anna Wintour's ex-husband used to love my rabbit."
Mr. Marchetto liked the look of some fresh porcini, so he resolved to cook monkfish with mushrooms. His next stop was a vegetable stall. Its operator, Elena Popa, gave him a look.
"Are you famous or something?" she asked in Italian.
"I ran a restaurant in New York called Da Silvano," he said. "Closed now."
"Why?"
"Because. The rent. My knees. Divorce."
"If it was successful, couldn't someone have just kept running it for you?" she asked.
"Someone else run Da Silvano?" he said. "Absolutely not!"
In certain New York circles, Da Silvano needs no introduction, and neither does Mr. Marchetto, who for four decades ran his trattoria as one of the city's reigning downtown canteens for the art, fashion, film and media crowds.
That reign ended when he closed Da Silvano with little warning in 2016. Then Mr. Marchetto vanished from public view.
This summer, when I started making calls in an effort to track him down, some of the tips I heard were outlandish: He was on the run in the South of France; he'd opened a beach pizzeria in Cyprus; he was operating a tiny, one-man trattoria in rural Italy; a Vogue photographer I spoke with had heard he was dead; and the designer Isaac Mizrahi, a onetime regular, said he had "no idea what happened to him."
"Da Silvano now represents a lost era of downtown New York, and he was its rustic host," Mr. Mizrahi said. "I'm still mourning it, and I still glance at its old address whenever I go up Sixth Avenue and think, 'Where did he go?"'
Mr. Marchetto opened the restaurant in 1975 with the idea of serving New Yorkers the rustic cuisine he had grown up with in Tuscany. Italian fine dining in the city was then typified by spaghetti and meatballs served with Chianti from straw-covered bottles, so his preparations of liver crostini and tripe stew proved revelatory.
"I was just cooking what I knew to cook," he said as he drove from the market back to his villa in the Tuscan hills. "Early on, I even served birds off-menu. I bought robins at a pet shop on Thompson Street and served them roasted with bacon."
The art dealers Leo Castelli and Mary Boone were starting their galleries in SoHo around the same time that Da Silvano opened, and they soon made it their hangout. "Castelli used to go crazy for my polenta," Mr. Marchetto said. Gradually, the patio tables beneath the yellow awning became prime seating for those who wanted to be seen. Paparazzi posted up to document Sarah Jessica Parker eating steamed artichokes and Jay-Z and Beyoncé on one of their first public dates.
The crowd came to include Calvin Klein, Yoko Ono, Lindsay Lohan, Joan Didion, Harvey Weinstein, Madonna, Salman Rushdie, Uma Thurman, Stephanie Seymour, Susan Sontag, Graydon Carter and Larry Gagosian. While Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were engaged in 1997, they left notes in Da Silvano's guest book: "Thank you for letting us smoke," she wrote. "And smoke and smoke," he added.
Da Silvano also provided endless fodder for The New York Post, which covered the trattoria as if it were the White House. A typical 2013 item from its Page Six column reported that the art dealer Tony Shafrazi shouted at Peter Brant and Owen Wilson, while Wilson ate a dandelion and heirloom tomato salad, because they hadn't been returning his calls. In 2014, while Rose McGowan was having a meal, a man emerged from a subway grate and tossed a smoke bomb at Bar Pitti, the Italian restaurant next door. The tabloid speculated that the incident was connected to the feud between the trattorias.
"Page Six covered us so much people asked if I owned The New York Post," Mr. Marchetto said. "But it was good for Da Silvano, whatever they wrote."
Mr. Marchetto became a downtown celebrity in his own right, and a cartoon logo of him wearing sunglasses was branded onto Da Silvano's espresso cups and olive oil bottles.
He lived a block away with his wife, Marisa Acocella, a New Yorker cartoonist and graphic novelist, and he went home for midday naps. He parked his Ferraris ornamentally outside the restaurant. He wore scarves, yellow pants and Hawaiian shirts. He hired young Italian waiters who flirted with the models and actresses.
But as blogs and social media began to rival Page Six as a source of celebrity gossip, his restaurant lost some of its luster. And as smartphones ushered in an era in which a celebrity's nightlife indiscretions could be documented, the machismo-fueled party at Da Silvano began to look a little dated. In 2013, a rival Italian restaurant, Carbone, opened nearby to praise from critics, who welcomed the swing back to red-sauce recipes, and became a haunt for Drake, Jennifer Lopez and multiple Kardashians.
Around the same time, Mr. Marchetto's life turned tumultuous. A manager at his garage filed a sexual harassment suit, claiming that Mr. Marchetto had grabbed his genitals after dropping off one of his Ferraris; waiters filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming that he had withheld wages. Mr. Marchetto denied the allegations, and both cases were settled out of court. In 2016, after 12 years of marriage, his wife filed for divorce, leading to a contentious trial.
Mr. Marchetto abruptly closed Da Silvano on the night of Dec. 20, 2016. His explanation was straightforward: The rent had spiked to $ 42,500 a month. "A fortune, I couldn't handle it," he told The New York Times that week. "Everybody is sad; it's been 41 years and 51 days exactly since I opened, but I don't care."
Celebrities mourned its closing. A few stayed in touch.
"I visited him in Florence because I was playing a show, and he was living outside the city with his olive trees," Patti Smith said. "I think Silvano's heart was broken when he had to close his restaurant, so he needed to leave New York. When I saw him, he looked like he was finding happiness out there."
When I finally reached Mr. Marchetto in Italy by phone, he hastily explained that he hadn't received my numerous messages because he does "not really check email," and instructed me to meet him outside Florence's train station in three days.
That afternoon, he drove me to a hilltop hotel, Villa San Michele. A doorman, Paolo Greco, greeted Mr. Marchetto and announced him to a young hostess, saying: "Do you know who this is? He's a myth. Back in New York, he knew them all: the angels and the scoundrels."
In the courtyard, Mr. Marchetto savored a vermentino and described his life now: "I let the days go by. I have a drink for lunch. I go home and nap. Then I go out again. I'll sit in a piazza for hours. I grow figs and bottle olive oil from my trees."
Do you look back?
"Once in a blue moon. I miss the action, but I never feel sorry for myself."
Any gossip?
"Donald Trump came in once. Wanted spaghetti and meatballs. I said, 'We don't do that here.' He said, 'But that's what I eat.' So we made it for him."
Do you remember your last night of service?
"I bought two kilos of caviar and handed it to people," he said. "I told them, 'Tonight is our last evening.' They looked at me like I was joking, but I was crying inside."
Coldplay blared as we drove to his hillside villa near Bagno a Ripoli. While he took a nap, I perused the relics of his old life: a framed letter from Barack and Michelle Obama wishing him a happy 70th birthday; some Da Silvano business cards; a portrait of him from the 1970s in Greenwich Village in which he has flowing dark hair and is riding a Honda motorcycle.
That evening, at a restaurant on a lonely piazza, he was joined by an old friend, Aldo Antonacci. Over Sangiovese, they reminisced about how heads would turn when Monica Bellucci walked into Da Silvano, and Mr. Antonacci said he still dreamed about the fiori di zucca.
For dessert, Mr. Marchetto ordered Gorgonzola. Then he leaned forward to tell Mr. Antonacci: "Did you hear about my restaurant in Cyprus? It was un casino."
The Italian term un casino means a disaster.
The precise details of the recent reboot of Da Silvano on the island of Cyprus are somewhat opaque, because the restaurant is now closed and its existence was barely publicized. But for a moment Mr. Marchetto got back into the game this summer, opening a beachy version of his trattoria in Ayia Napa, a resort town known for its nightlife.
For four months, Da Silvano Cyprus served British and Swedish tourists and young women who stopped in for Instagram selfies before going clubbing. The cartoon logo of Mr. Marchetto appeared in a sign above the entrance and was branded onto menus and place mats. The restaurant offered Da Silvano hits like spaghetti puttanesca.
According to Mr. Marchetto, the restaurant came into being after a longtime former Da Silvano regular, Stephen Conte, a radiologist from New Jersey who vacations in Cyprus, pitched him the idea.
"He said he could make me good money if I lent my name, so I figured why not," Mr. Marchetto said. "So I went to Cyprus to teach them how to make osso buco and my signature pastas. I noticed problems, like it was hard finding good ingredients and cooks, but I was just excited to get back into a restaurant."
By midsummer, Da Silvano Cyprus was struggling. There were kitchen staffing troubles, and the restaurant started selling mostly pizza.
"We tried doing something this summer, it didn't work out, but it was an honor working alongside Silvano," Mr. Conte said. "I plan to try opening again next season."
"It's not easy running a restaurant," Mr. Marchetto said. "The experience reminded me I should follow what I'm good at more. If someone asked me to open a place tomorrow, now I probably would."
After the next day's afternoon nap, Mr. Marchetto poured himself a Montepulciano and started preparing the monkfish with porcini. As the glow of a sunset crept into his villa, he chopped the mushrooms and skinned the fish, setting aside its head for a stew. He swatted away a fly as he tossed the porcini into a sizzling pan filled with the monkfish fillets, grape tomatoes and shallots.
As we ate at his kitchen counter, he took out his phone and pulled up a video posted to Da Silvano's Facebook page in 2013. It showed Rihanna, wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap during a busy night at the restaurant.
"Hello Mr. Silvano, it's your favorite customer, Rihanna, wishing you a happy 38th anniversary," she said. "You've been here since 1975. That's a big deal to be here in New York City at the same spot. This place is legendary. I love coming here. And I will always come here as long as you are here."
He smiled as the clip finished. Then he poured himself another glass of wine and stepped outside to take in the silence of the Tuscan night.

Autoworkers Score Big Victories In New Contracts Ending Strikes: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tentative accords at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis are the most generous in decades, raising costs as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.
A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has resulted in tentative contract agreements that would give workers their biggest pay raises in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
On Monday, General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a deal that mirrored agreements the union had reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which still require ratification by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a G.M. facility in Michigan last month.
"They have reached a historic agreement," Mr. Biden said Monday after speaking with Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president. The deals, the president said, "reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago."
The strike stretched longer than White House officials would have liked, but was resolved before causing significant shortages of new cars and trucks that might have frustrated voters already angry about inflation.
"The near-term impact of this strike will be relatively minor," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online auto sales site.
But Mr. Brauer warned that, in the long term, Ford, G.M. and Stellantis would have to raise car prices to maintain their profits. Their competitors will follow suit to take advantage of the opportunity to earn more money, he said. "This is going to make cars more expensive," Mr. Brauer added.
G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement on Monday that the tentative agreement "reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S."
Potentially the most far-reaching effect of the strike could be on manufacturing workers not represented by the U.A.W. The contracts the union negotiated are the latest in a series of prominent victories for organized labor, including Hollywood writers, UPS workers and even some university employees.
Mr. Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies like Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will "organize like we've never organized before," Mr. Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the U.A.W. to deploy the same hardball tactics that Mr. Fain used against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to pre-emptively give workers raises.
"This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect," said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25 percent pay increase over the next four and a half years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top U.A.W. wage would rise to more than $ 40 over the life of the new contracts, from $ 32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford's case, workers at battery factories that the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The U.A.W. said its new contract with G.M. would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automakers' costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
"Everybody had their pencils out, and I'm quite certain the deal wouldn't have been signed if they weren't confident they could remain competitive," said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Mr. Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Mr. Biden's brief stint on a U.A.W. picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Mr. Biden -- that the contract hinders automakers' competitiveness -- is unlikely to become manifest before next year's election.
The union's contracts with the three automakers, covering nearly 150,000 workers, expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at G.M.'s plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies' most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade S.U.V., the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco S.U.V.
G.M. said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $ 800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford's deal with the U.A.W. would shave about one percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, like a decline in consumer's ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
"I don't think the U.A.W. in a vacuum is going to be the big problem," Mr. Narayan said. "There are other problems these companies have."
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $ 900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, Calif.; Sparks, Nev.; and Buffalo. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company's advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers, who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, G.M. and Stellantis.
"We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for E.V.s," Ms. Barra said last week.

A six-week wave of strikes that hobbled the three largest U.S. automakers has put workers on track for new contracts that will deliver the biggest pay raise workers will receive in decades while avoiding a protracted work stoppage that could have damaged the economy.
General Motors was firming up a deal with the United Auto Workers union Monday that was expected to mirror agreements the union reached in recent days with Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler. The terms will be costly for the automakers as they undertake a switch to electric vehicles, while setting the stage for labor strife and demands for higher pay at nonunion automakers such as Tesla and Toyota.
The tentative agreements, which must still be ratified by union members, also appeared to be a win for President Joe Biden, who had risked political capital by picketing with striking workers at a GM facility in Michigan last month.
“They have reached a historic agreement,” Biden said Monday after speaking with UAW President Shawn Fain. The deals, he said, “reward autoworkers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.”

“This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect,” said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. GM reached a tentative agreement on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deal before it was made public. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.

Fain has portrayed the tentative agreements as a signal for the union to begin organizing drives at Tesla, which dominates the fast-growing electric car business, and foreign-owned companies such as Toyota, Honda and BMW that have large nonunion operations in the United States. The union will “organize like we’ve never organized before,” Fain said Sunday.
Companies without unions can expect the UAW to deploy the same hardball tactics that Fain used against Ford, GM, and Stellantis, including rhetorical attacks on multimillion-dollar executive pay and hourly wages that have failed to keep pace with high inflation.
Even if those union campaigns fail, as they often have in the past, they may prompt some employers to preemptively give workers raises.
“This agreement is going to have a trickle-down effect,” said Helen Rella, who specializes in employment litigation at Wilk Auslander, a New York law firm.
Ford agreed on a tentative pact on Wednesday. Stellantis followed on Saturday. Details of all the agreements had not yet been published, but they include a 25% pay increase over the next 4 1/2 years and provisions to make sure the raises are not eaten up by inflation.
The top UAW wage would rise to more than $40 over the life of the new contracts, from $32 an hour. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $84,000 a year.
The agreements provide at least some protections to workers as electric vehicles replace gasoline models, and jobs at battery factories supplant jobs making components for combustion engine vehicles.
In Ford’s case, workers at battery factories the company plans to build in Tennessee and Michigan would be covered by the terms of the union contract. (Ford suspended work at the Michigan plant in September, saying it was not sure it could manufacture batteries there at a competitive price.)
The UAW said its new contract with GM would cover workers at Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture with LG Energy Solution. One Ultium factory, in Ohio, is up and running, and two others are under construction in Tennessee and Michigan.
The increases in hourly wages would add to the automaker’s costs when they already pay their workers more than Tesla and most foreign automakers. But the burden would be manageable, analysts said.
“Everybody had their pencils out and I’m quite certain the deal wouldn’t have been signed if they weren’t confident they could remain competitive,” said Steve Patton, mobility sector leader for consulting firm EY.
The agreements appear to be victories on multiple fronts for Biden, who has yoked his economic message to his success at delivering for union workers.
Biden’s brief stint on a UAW picket line last month was a first for a sitting president. He has promised that union workers would benefit from tax credits and other incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The incentives are available only for cars made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
The biggest risk to Biden — that the contract hinders automakers’ competitiveness — is unlikely to become manifest before next year’s election.
The union’s contracts with the three automakers covering nearly 150,000 workers expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 workers to walk off the job at factories and spare-parts warehouses across the country. In the most recent escalation on Saturday, shortly after the union reached a deal with Stellantis, the UAW told workers to go on strike at GM’s plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, which makes several sport utility vehicle models.
The strike has halted the production of some of the companies’ most profitable vehicles, including the Cadillac Escalade SUV, the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Ford Bronco SUV.
GM said last week that the strike had lowered its earnings by about $800 million, before interest and taxes, with part of the impact coming in the third quarter and most in the fourth quarter.
Ford’s deal with the UAW would shave about 1 percentage point off the company's profit margin, said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. But he said the carmakers faced bigger challenges, such as a decline in consumer’s ability to buy new vehicles and a slowdown in the growth of electric vehicle sales.
“I don’t think the UAW in a vacuum is going to be the big problem,” Narayan said. “There are other problems these companies have.”
A Ford executive said last week that the new contract would raise production costs by up to $900 a vehicle. The company said it would provide more details once workers ratified the contract.
The three large U.S. automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories in an effort to catch up to Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, and has factories there and in Fremont, California; Sparks, Nevada; and Buffalo, New York. In addition to lower labor costs, the electric car company‘s advantages include selling cars directly to customers rather than through dealers who take a slice of the profit from each sale of a car made by Ford, GM and Stellantis.
“We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for EVs,” Barra said last week.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers union announced the deal with Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram. It also expanded its strike against G.M.
The United Automobile Workers union announced on Saturday that it had reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
The agreement came three days after the union and Ford Motor announced a tentative agreement on a new contract. The two deals contain many of the same or similar terms, including a 25 percent general wage increase for U.A.W. members as well as the possibility for cost-of-living wage adjustments if inflation flares.
"We have won a record-breaking contract," the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "We truly believe we got every penny possible out of the company."
Shortly after announcing the tentative agreement with Stellantis, the union expanded its strike against General Motors, calling on workers to walk off the job at the company's plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. The plant makes sport utility vehicles for G.M.'s Cadillac and GMC divisions.
Under the tentative new contract with Stellantis, Mr. Fain said, the company has agreed to reopen a plant in Belvidere, Ill., to produce a midsize pickup truck and to rehire enough workers to staff two shifts of production.
The union also won commitments to keep an engine plant in Trenton Mich., open, and to keep and expand a machining plant in Toledo, Ohio. According to the union, these moves will create up to 5,000 new U.A.W. jobs.
The union also won the right to strike if the company closes any plant and if it fails to follow through on its promised investment plans, Mr. Fain said.
"If the company goes back on their words on any plant, we can strike the hell out of them," he said.
Mr. Fain said Stellantis workers would now return to their jobs.
In a statement, Stellantis said, "We look forward to welcoming our 43,000 employees back to work and resuming operations to serve our customers."
The tentative agreement with Stellantis will require approval by a union council that oversees negotiations with the company, and then ratification by U.A.W. members. The council will meet on Thursday, Mr. Fain said.
The deal with Stellantis means that only General Motors has not yet reached an agreement with the U.A.W.
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry, said the new contracts impose higher labor costs on the Detroit manufacturers as they are ramping up production of electric vehicles and are competing with rivals who operate nonunion plants.
"The Detroit Three enter a new, dangerous era," he said. "They have to figure out how to transition to EVs and do it with a cost structure that puts them at a disadvantage with global competitors."
The union's contracts with the three automakers expired on Sept. 15. Since then, the union has called on more than 45,000 autoworkers at the three companies to walk off the job at factories and at 38 spare-parts warehouses across the country.
The most recent escalation of the strike at Stellantis came on Monday when the U.A.W. told workers to go on strike at a Ram plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., that makes the popular 1500 pickup truck. The strike has halted the production of Jeep Wranglers and Jeep Gladiators at a plant in Toledo, Ohio, and 20 Stellantis parts warehouses.
For decades, the union has negotiated similar contracts with all three automakers, a method known as pattern bargaining. Like the contract it hammered out with Ford, the tentative Stellantis deal would lift the top U.A.W. wage from $ 32 an hour to more than $ 40 over four and a half years. That would allow employees working 40 hours a week to earn about $ 84,000 a year.
Stellantis, G.M. and Ford began negotiating with the U.A.W. in July. The companies have sought to limit increases in labor costs because they already have higher labor costs than automakers like Tesla, Toyota and Honda that operate nonunion plants in the United States.
The three large U.S. automakers are also trying to control costs while investing tens of billions of dollars to develop new electric vehicles, build battery plants and retool factories.
Stellantis, which is based in Amsterdam, was created in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, the French automaker. The company's North American business, based near Detroit, is its most profitable.
Stellantis surprised analysts recently by posting much stronger profits than G.M., which is the largest U.S. automaker by sales. Stellantis earned 11 billion euros ( $ 11.6 billion) in the first half of the year while G.M. made nearly $ 5 billion.

How a Union Came to Push A Harder Line: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Shawn Fain owes his rise within the United Automobile Workers to a group determined to make the union far more confrontational toward automakers.
When Shawn Fain sought the presidency of the United Automobile Workers union last year, he ran on a platform that promised: "No corruption. No concessions. No tiers."
That pledge encapsulated many members' frustrations with years of union scandal and concessions to the three big Detroit automakers, including the creation of a lower tier of wages for newer employees. The platform helped propel Mr. Fain to the top job -- where he has led a mounting wave of walkouts in recent weeks to demand more favorable contract terms.
But the platform largely predated Mr. Fain's candidacy. It was devised by a group called Unite All Workers for Democracy, which was officially formed in 2020 as a caucus -- essentially, a political party within the union.
The group set out to topple the ruling party, known as the Administration Caucus, which had run the union for more than 70 years. In 2022, Unite All Workers hashed out its party line, recruited candidates and ramped up a campaign operation to elect them.
When the dust settled, the slate had won half the seats on the union's 14-member executive board, with Mr. Fain, previously a union staff member, as president. Unite All Workers' role helps explain why the union has taken such a hard line with the automakers.
"We had a platform we ran on, and we're trying to push that platform forward," said Scott Houldieson, a founder of the group and a longtime Ford Motor worker in Chicago. "Shawn has been really upfront about what we're trying to accomplish."
The first fruits of that approach may have emerged Wednesday, when negotiators for the union and Ford agreed on terms for a new four-year contract, including a wage increase of roughly 25 percent over the four years, according to the union.
"We hit the companies to maximum effect," Mr. Fain said in a Facebook livestream. The deal is subject to ratification by the company's union workers.
Since at least the 1980s, U.A.W. members have formed groups to challenge the union's top officials, or at least prod them to be more confrontational with automakers. The efforts took on added urgency in 2007, when the union accepted tiers as a way to stabilize the automakers' financial footing. (General Motors and Chrysler later filed for bankruptcy anyway; Ford avoided it.)
But the Administration Caucus always held a trump card: The union leadership wasn't elected directly by members. Rather, future leaders were effectively chosen by existing leaders, then approved by delegates to a convention every four years.
That changed after a corruption scandal in which two recent U.A.W. presidents were charged with embezzlement in 2020. As part of a consent decree with the federal government, members voted in a referendum on whether to directly elect union leaders. Unite All Workers, which was pressing for the change, waged an all-out campaign to persuade union members to support "one member one vote."
When the initiative passed by nearly a two-to-one ratio, Unite All Workers, whose members paid an annual fee, was poised to become a kingmaker of sorts in the union's 2022 elections. The group had a budget of over $ 100,000, two full-time staff members and hundreds of volunteer organizers.
"It was obvious that we could use the same infrastructure" of staff and volunteers to compete in the election, said Mike Cannon, a retired U.A.W. member who serves on the Unite All Workers steering committee. "The only question at that point was, were we going to have any candidates?"
Unite All Workers announced that anyone who wanted to join its campaign slate would have to fill out a detailed questionnaire and attend at least one meeting with its members.
The group wanted to ensure that the candidates it backed were committed to running the union with extensive input from rank-and-file members, and to driving a much harder bargain with employers. It wanted an end to wage tiers, which it said divided and demoralized workers, and a focus on organizing new members, especially among electric vehicle and battery workers.
Among those responding to the call was Mr. Fain, then a staff member in the union division responsible for Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram. During his interview process, Mr. Fain explained how, as a local official in Indiana in 2007, he had helped lead opposition to the two-tier wage structure the union had agreed to, and how he had argued for more favorable contract terms after joining the headquarters staff.
Some members of the group were skeptical that an employee of the old guard could be a reformer. But other U.A.W. dissidents vouched for him. "I knew the claims were legit," said Martha Grevatt, a longtime Chrysler employee on the steering committee of Unite All Workers.
The group backed Mr. Fain and six other candidates for the union's 14-member executive board, and all seven won.
As president, Mr. Fain has appointed critics of the former leadership as his top aides, including one who served on the Unite All Workers steering committee. Board members, including Mr. Fain, have attended some of the group's monthly membership meetings and taken part in one of its WhatsApp chats.
Many of the group's priorities became demands in the union's contract negotiations, and Mr. Fain has indicated that he hopes to use momentum from the strike to organize nonunion companies like Tesla and Honda, a key objective of Unite All Workers.
But for all the connections between the group and the union leadership, they are not one and the same.
Some board members who ran on the Unite All Workers slate have at times taken positions in tension with the group's priorities. In recent weeks, Margaret Mock, the union's second-ranking official, has expressed concern to fellow board members about the walkout's cost to the union's budget. At a special board meeting last week, she offered a proposal intended to scale back spending on organizing during the strike, according to two people familiar with the meeting. The board set aside the proposal; Ms. Mock did not respond to a request for comment.
For its part, Unite All Workers considers itself accountable to rank-and-file members, not an extension of the leaders it helped elect. On a tentative deal with any of the three large automakers, Unite All Workers plans to appoint a task force to provide an assessment of the proposal to the union's members. The group's members will then decide whether to support it.
"I would say it's not automatic that the caucus endorses" an agreement, said Andrew Bergman, who serves on the Unite All Workers steering committee.
Still, as a practical matter, the group is highly unlikely to oppose an agreement, since Mr. Fain has forcefully pressed for its core priorities.
"For years, we've been playing defense at every step, and we've been losing," Mr. Fain said in a video streamed online on Friday, explaining why the strike would continue. "When we vote on a tentative agreement, it will be because your leadership and your council thinks we've gotten absolutely every dollar we can." This week, the union expanded the strike to the largest U.S. factories at Stellantis and General Motors.
The approach has raised concerns among employers and business groups. John Drake, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that the Detroit automakers could struggle to remain competitive after the strike, and that Mr. Fain appeared to be overreaching in extracting concessions.
"It feels like there's not really a strategy here," Mr. Drake said. "It's like pain is the goal."
The best analogy for Unite All Workers may be to a group called Brand New Congress, created by supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont independent, to help elect congressional candidates beginning in 2018.
Not long after the 2016 presidential election, Brand New Congress urged an obscure New York bartender and activist named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to challenge a longtime incumbent in a Democratic congressional primary. A sister group provided her with training and campaign infrastructure. After she won, two people involved with the groups joined her staff.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has since become far more prominent than those early backers, and in principle she could take positions at odds with their progressive stands. But in practice, it's unlikely. The worldview is embedded in her political identity.
Mr. Fain's story is similar: a once-obscure progressive who was catapulted to a position of power by a group of insurgents and was determined to enact their shared principles once he got there. Except that, in backing him and his colleagues, Unite All Workers helped win not just a few legislative seats, but the reins of an entire union.
After Vail Kohnert-Yount, a Unite All Workers steering committee member, seconded Mr. Fain's nomination for president at the union's convention last year, he spoke to her about relying on government assistance as a new parent decades ago.
"I remember thinking this guy has not forgotten where he came from -- he's very much stayed that person," Ms. Kohnert-Yount said. "We did our best to endorse a candidate we believed in."

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

When Shawn Fain sought the presidency of the United Auto Workers union last year, he ran on a platform that promised: “No corruption. No concessions. No tiers.”
That pledge encapsulated many members’ frustrations with years of union scandal and concessions to the three big Detroit automakers, including the creation of a lower tier of wages for newer employees. The platform helped propel Fain to the top job — where he has led a mounting wave of walkouts in recent weeks to demand more favorable contract terms.
But the platform largely predated Fain’s candidacy. It was devised by a group called Unite All Workers for Democracy, which was officially formed in 2020 as a caucus — essentially, a political party within the union.
The group set out to topple the ruling party, known as the Administration Caucus, which had run the union for more than 70 years. In 2022, Unite All Workers hashed out its party line, recruited candidates and ramped up a campaign operation to elect them.
When the dust settled, the slate had won half the seats on the union’s 14-member executive board, with Fain, previously a union staff member, as president. Unite All Workers’ role helps explain why the union has taken such a hard line with the automakers.
“We had a platform we ran on, and we’re trying to push that platform forward,” said Scott Houldieson, a founder of the group and a longtime Ford Motor worker in Chicago. “Shawn has been really upfront about what we’re trying to accomplish.”
The first fruits of that approach may have emerged Wednesday, when negotiators for the union and Ford agreed on terms for a new four-year contract, including a wage increase of roughly 25% over the four years, according to the union.
“We hit the companies to maximum effect,” Fain said in a Facebook livestream. The deal is subject to ratification by the company’s union workers.
Since at least the 1980s, UAW members have formed groups to challenge the union’s top officials, or at least prod them to be more confrontational with automakers. The efforts took on added urgency in 2007, when the union accepted tiers as a way to stabilize the automakers’ financial footing. (General Motors and Chrysler later filed for bankruptcy anyway; Ford avoided it.)
But the Administration Caucus always held a trump card: The union leadership wasn’t elected directly by members. Rather, future leaders were effectively chosen by existing leaders, then approved by delegates to a convention every four years.
That changed after a corruption scandal in which two recent UAW presidents were charged with embezzlement in 2020. As part of a consent decree with the federal government, members voted in a referendum on whether to directly elect union leaders. Unite All Workers, which was pressing for the change, waged an all-out campaign to persuade union members to support “one member one vote.”
When the initiative passed by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio, Unite All Workers, whose members paid an annual fee, was poised to become a kingmaker of sorts in the union’s 2022 elections. The group had a budget of more than $100,000, two full-time staff members and hundreds of volunteer organizers.
“It was obvious that we could use the same infrastructure” of staff and volunteers to compete in the election, said Mike Cannon, a retired UAW member who serves on the Unite All Workers steering committee. “The only question at that point was, were we going to have any candidates?”
Unite All Workers announced that anyone who wanted to join its campaign slate would have to fill out a detailed questionnaire and attend at least one meeting with its members.
The group wanted to ensure that the candidates it backed were committed to running the union with extensive input from rank-and-file members and to driving a much harder bargain with employers. It wanted an end to wage tiers, which it said divided and demoralized workers, and a focus on organizing new members, especially among electric vehicle and battery workers.
Among those responding to the call was Fain, then a staff member in the union division responsible for Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram. During his interview process, Fain explained how, as a local official in Indiana in 2007, he had helped lead opposition to the two-tier wage structure the union had agreed to and how he had argued for more favorable contract terms after joining the headquarters staff.
Some members of the group were skeptical that an employee of the old guard could be a reformer. But other UAW dissidents vouched for him. “I knew the claims were legit,” said Martha Grevatt, a longtime Chrysler employee on the steering committee of Unite All Workers.
The group backed Fain and six other candidates for the union’s 14-member executive board, and all seven won.
As president, Fain has appointed critics of the former leadership as his top aides, including one who served on the Unite All Workers steering committee. Board members, including Fain, have attended some of the group’s monthly membership meetings and taken part in one of its WhatsApp chats.
Many of the group’s priorities became demands in the union’s contract negotiations, and Fain has indicated that he hopes to use momentum from the strike to organize nonunion companies like Tesla and Honda, a key objective of Unite All Workers.
But for all the connections between the group and the union leadership, they are not one and the same.
Some board members who ran on the Unite All Workers slate have at times taken positions in tension with the group’s priorities. In recent weeks, Margaret Mock, the union’s second-ranking official, has expressed concern to fellow board members about the walkout’s cost to the union’s budget. At a special board meeting last week, she offered a proposal intended to scale back spending on organizing during the strike, according to two people familiar with the meeting. The board set aside the proposal; Mock did not respond to a request for comment.
For its part, Unite All Workers considers itself accountable to rank-and-file members, not an extension of the leaders it helped elect. On a tentative deal with any of the three large automakers, Unite All Workers plans to appoint a task force to provide an assessment of the proposal to the union’s members. The group’s members will then decide whether to support it.
“I would say it’s not automatic that the caucus endorses” an agreement, said Andrew Bergman, who serves on the Unite All Workers steering committee.
Still, as a practical matter, the group is highly unlikely to oppose an agreement, since Fain has forcefully pressed for its core priorities.
“For years, we’ve been playing defense at every step, and we’ve been losing,” Fain said in a video streamed online Friday, explaining why the strike would continue. “When we vote on a tentative agreement, it will be because your leadership and your council thinks we’ve gotten absolutely every dollar we can.” This week, the union expanded the strike to the largest U.S. factories at Stellantis and GM.
The approach has raised concerns among employers and business groups. John Drake, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that the Detroit automakers could struggle to remain competitive after the strike and that Fain appeared to be overreaching in extracting concessions.
“It feels like there’s not really a strategy here,” Drake said. “It’s like pain is the goal.”
The best analogy for Unite All Workers may be to a group called Brand New Congress, created by supporters of progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to help elect congressional candidates beginning in 2018.
Not long after the 2016 presidential election, Brand New Congress urged an obscure New York bartender and activist named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to challenge a longtime incumbent in a Democratic congressional primary. A sister group provided her with training and campaign infrastructure. After she won, two people involved with the groups joined her staff.
Ocasio-Cortez has since become far more prominent than those early backers, and in principle, she could take positions at odds with their progressive stands. But in practice, it’s unlikely. The worldview is embedded in her political identity.
Fain’s story is similar: a once-obscure progressive who was catapulted to a position of power by a group of insurgents and was determined to enact their shared principles once he got there. Except that, in backing him and his colleagues, Unite All Workers helped win not just a few legislative seats, but the reins of an entire union.
After Vail Kohnert-Yount, a Unite All Workers steering committee member, seconded Fain’s nomination for president at the union’s convention last year, he spoke to her about relying on government assistance as a new parent decades ago.
“I remember thinking this guy has not forgotten where he came from. He’s very much stayed that person,” Kohnert-Yount said. “We did our best to endorse a candidate we believed in.”

After Wave of Walkouts, U.A.W. and Ford Reach a Tentative Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deal, subject to approval by union members, could ease the way for deals with General Motors and Stellantis and end a growing wave of walkouts.
The United Automobile Workers and Ford Motor have reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year labor contract, the union announced Wednesday, nearly six weeks after the union began a growing wave of walkouts against the three Detroit automakers.
The union said the deal included a roughly 25 percent pay increase over four years, cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closures. It called on striking Ford workers to go back to work while the tentative agreement awaits ratification.
Shawn Fain, the union president, said in a livestream on Facebook that the accord would be submitted to the U.A.W. council that oversees relations with Ford at a meeting in Detroit on Sunday. If the council approves, the union will submit the contract terms to the company's 57,000 union workers for their verdict.
"We made history," Mr. Fain said. "We told Ford to pony up, and they did." He said the terms included an immediate 11 percent wage increase upon ratification.
Ford issued a brief statement that said in part, "We are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the U.A.W. covering our U.S. operations."
The union continues to negotiate with General Motors and Stellantis, whose brands include Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
"We know it breaks records," Mr. Fain said of the tentative agreement with Ford. "We know it will change lives." But he underlined that it was up to union members to deliver the ultimate verdict.
Two weeks ago -- when it said it had reached the limit of what it could afford without hurting its business -- Ford offered to increase wages 23 percent, adjust pay in response to inflation and cut the time for new hires to rise to the top wage, to four years from eight. The other companies have made similar offers.
But the U.A.W. pressed for greater concessions, ratcheting up the walkouts and aiming them at factories producing some of the automakers' most profitable models.
"This is a major victory for the union after years of erosion by inflation, division by wage tiers and other real issues in the workplace that made people angry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets a standard for other workers throughout the economy."
President Biden, who had championed the union's cause and joined a picket line on a visit to Michigan last month, hailed the accord. "I applaud the U.A.W. and Ford for coming together after a hard-fought, good-faith negotiation and reaching a historic tentative agreement," he said.
The union said the agreement would ultimately lift the top wage to more than $ 40 an hour, giving a member working 40 hours a week a base pay of more than $ 83,000, not including overtime and profit-sharing bonuses, which were more than $ 14,000 in 2022.
The current top wage is $ 32 an hour, or about $ 67,000 a year based on a 40-hour week.
Recent hires who make considerably less than the top wage will see their pay nearly double over the life of the contract, the union said.
The tentative deal with Ford could increase pressure on the other companies to reach an agreement with the union. In the past, once the union reached a deal with one automaker, tentative agreements with the others quickly followed. But that history may not be as relevant now because the U.A.W. had never struck all three companies simultaneously until this year.
Altogether, about 45,000 workers at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis are on strike across the country, including 8,700 workers at Ford's Kentucky truck plant in Louisville, the company's largest, and almost 10,000 others at Ford factories in Illinois and Michigan.
The companies are investing billions in a transition to battery-powered vehicles, a financial commitment that they say makes it harder for them to pay substantially higher wages. Last week, Ford's executive chairman, William C. Ford Jr., said the union's demands risked damaging the ability of Detroit automakers to compete against nonunion companies like Tesla and foreign rivals.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the others are loving the strike, because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," he said. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The U.A.W. makes a different case: that success in its contract battle with the Big Three will give it momentum to organize autoworkers at other companies as well.
It began its walkouts when the companies' union contracts expired in mid-September. It won immediate support from Mr. Biden, who called on the automakers to "ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts" and briefly joined workers on a picket line at a G.M. plant near Detroit late last month.
The union initially demanded a 40 percent wage increase over four years -- an amount that union officials have said matches the raises the top executives at the three companies have received over the last four years. Those raises are also meant to compensate for more modest increases the autoworkers received in recent years and concessions the union made to the companies beginning in 2007.
In addition, the union called for an end to a system that pays new hires just over half of the top wage of $ 32 an hour. It demanded adjustments that would nudge wages higher to compensate for inflation. And it wanted a reinstatement of pensions for all workers, improved retiree benefits and shorter work hours.
G.M. and Stellantis faced the most recent escalation of the U.A.W. walkouts when the union called out 6,800 workers at a large Ram pickup truck plant in Michigan on Monday and 5,000 workers at a G.M. plant in Arlington, Texas. That factory makes large sport utility vehicles including the Chevrolet Tahoe, the GMC Yukon and the Cadillac Escalade.
"Ford knew what was coming for them on Wednesday if we didn't get a deal," Mr. Fain said. "That was checkmate."
On Tuesday, G.M. reported a third-quarter profit of $ 3.1 billion, a 7 percent decline from a year earlier, owing in part to the strike. Ford is scheduled to announce its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Autoworkers Widen Strike To Key Plant For S.U.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Automobile Workers on Tuesday expanded its strike to General Motors' largest U.S. plant a day after striking at a Ram truck plant.
The United Automobile Workers union shut down production at General Motors' largest U.S. factory on Tuesday, significantly stepping up pressure on the large U.S. automakers as signs multiplied that the six-week strike is taking a toll on profits.
The union told 5,000 workers at G.M.'s plant in Arlington, Texas, to stop working on the same day that the automaker announced a drop in its third-quarter profit and said U.A.W. work stoppages, which have also hit Ford Motor and Stellantis, had cost it $ 800 million so far.
The strike in Arlington continued the union's strategy of targeting some of the carmaker's most profitable vehicles. The Texas factory makes large sport utility vehicles including the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade.
Before the Tuesday expansion, there had been signs that the union and G.M. were close to an agreement. Some analysts said the union's decision to raise the stakes was part of an endgame strategy to squeeze the last dollar from the company.
The U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, "has been saying he still had some levers to pull to push the companies, and now he's pulling them," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "So I think this is the union's final push to the companies, saying, 'Let's get this deal done."'
But it is also possible the companies and the union are still far from striking deals and the U.A.W. is demonstrating that it still has plenty of cards to play.
"My gut feeling is that they're not close and this is trying to impose more cost and say, 'Look, you guys have to get closer to what we want or we'll keeping doing this,"' said Patricia Anderson, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.
On Monday, the union struck a Ram pickup truck plant, the largest U.S. factory operated by Stellantis, which also owns Jeep and Chrysler. The U.A.W. has also struck Ford Motor's largest plant, in Louisville, Ky., which produces large pickup trucks and the Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.
"Another record quarter, another record year; as we've said for months: record profits equal record contracts," Mr. Fain said in a statement. "It's time G.M. workers, and the whole working class, get their fair share."
G.M. executives had said earlier on Tuesday that they hoped to reach a tentative agreement with the union soon. The Texas walkout dimmed those hopes.
The longer the strike lasts, the greater the risk it will become a drag on the U.S. economy, or make it harder for consumers to find the vehicles they want.
The automakers have been keen to point out the ripple effects that the strikes are having on other workers. Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler and Jeep, said on Tuesday that it laid off 525 workers at two Michigan factories, in Sterling and Warren, that make parts for Ram pickup trucks that are not needed while the assembly line is shut down by the strike.
All told, Stellantis has temporarily laid off more than 2,000 workers because of the strikes. Ford has laid off more than 3,000 workers because of the strike, according to the company. G.M. has laid off about 2,500, including about 140 at a factory in Ohio who made parts for the factory in Arlington and were let go on Tuesday. Another 3,000 workers at G.M. suppliers are temporarily out of work because of the strike, according to the company.
"We are disappointed by the escalation of this unnecessary and irresponsible strike," G.M. said in a statement. "It is harming our team members who are sacrificing their livelihoods and having negative ripple effects on our dealers, suppliers and the communities that rely on us."
G.M., the largest automaker based in the United States, said on Tuesday that the strike was partly to blame for a 7 percent decline in profit from a year earlier. The company reported that it earned $ 3.1 billion from July through September. Including the Texas factory, the strike has idled three of the company's vehicle plants and 18 spare-parts warehouses.
Before the U.A.W. expanded the strike, G.M. said Tuesday that work stoppages had lowered its earnings before interest and taxes by about $ 200 million in the final weeks of the third quarter and by about $ 600 million since the fourth quarter started on Oct. 1. The automaker estimated that the strike could cost it $ 200 million a week, though that number will likely grow now that workers at the Texas plant are on strike.
"They've demanded a record contract -- and that's exactly what we've offered for weeks now: a historic contract with record wage increases, record job security and world-class health care," the company's chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a letter to investors. "It's an offer that rewards our team members but does not put our company and their jobs at risk."
G.M. has offered workers a 23 percent increase in pay over four years, lifting the standard wage for veteran employees to more than $ 40 an hour from $ 32; newer workers earn a lower rate. Employees working 40 hours a week at the top rate would earn about $ 84,000 a year, not including extra pay for overtime or profit-sharing bonuses, which have topped $ 10,000 in the past two years.
Ford and Stellantis have made similar offers.
The union had initially demanded raises of 40 percent, saying that more modest increases will not make up for the erosion in living standards that its members have suffered from inflation and from concessions they made in past contracts.
Mr. Fain has taken a more confrontational approach to negotiations than his predecessors. He has portrayed talks with G.M., Ford and Stellantis as the first step in a broad effort to organize workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda and other companies which do not have unions at their U.S. factories.
In a video streamed online on Friday, Mr. Fain said that G.M., Ford and Stellantis had not yet put their best offer on the table. "Despite all the bluster about how much the companies have stretched," he said, "there's clearly still room to move."
Ms. Anderson noted that Mr. Fain was newly elected, in March, and that there was a risk he could have miscalculated. "The U.A.W. president is new and not very experienced," she said. "He may be holding out for an unrealistic settlement that just may be costly for both parties, and ending up where they could have settled today."
Striking the automakers' largest and most profitable plants sends a signal to union members that the U.A.W. leaders have done everything in their power to get the best deal, Mr. Wheaton of Cornell said.
"This shows the members that, 'Look, we took out their biggest moneymakers and pushed them hard as we could,"' he said. "Then, if there is a tentative deal, they can tell the members: 'You better ratify this. Don't vote this down."'
This month, nearly 4,000 U.A.W. members at Mack Trucks voted down a tentative agreement that the U.A.W. negotiated with the company, a subsidiary of Volvo Trucks, and went on strike. Union officials are now seeking to secure better terms from the company.
The calendar is probably also an important consideration. Mr. Fain and the union's negotiators have to be careful about asking workers to go into the colder months and the holiday season with only the $ 500 a week in strike pay, Mr. Wheaton said.
"Walking a picket line in November in Detroit is no fun," he said.

Full text: As a 25-year-old junior executive at the car company that bears his last name, William Clay Ford Jr. had a bracing introduction to labor negotiations when a union official demanded that he stand up and vouch that he was made of the same stuff as his great-grandfather Henry Ford.
Mr. Ford, now the company's executive chair, harked back to the moment in an interview this week about how he and his company are navigating one of their most difficult labor negotiations in decades.
The United Automobile Workers union has shut down three Ford plants, including its largest, and other plants and distribution centers at General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler. The union's new president, Shawn Fain, has said he is prepared to call workers out at more plants if his demands for big raises, better benefits and job security are not met. He has referred to the companies as "the enemy," and has said the union is fighting "corporate greed" and standing up to the "billionaire class."
In a speech this week, Mr. Ford said the strikes were helping nonunion automakers like Tesla, Toyota and Honda. Mr. Fain responded that workers at those companies were future U.A.W. members.
In an interview after his speech, Mr. Ford said he had been counseling his executives not to let Mr. Fain's words get to them and focus on getting a deal done. Mr. Ford also recalled his first difficult conversation with a union official.
In 1982, Mr. Ford said, his father invited him to sit in the room for talks with the U.A.W. As a newcomer, he was not allotted a seat at a table where about 50 union negotiators sat on one side and an equal number of Ford executives on the other.
Sitting against the wall, he was approached by an older union representative. "You, stand up," the man said. "What are you made of? I knew your great-grandfather and your grandfather. I knew what they were made of. What the hell are you made of?"
Mr. Ford said he had replied sheepishly that he had never known his great-grandfather and grandfather but that he shared their values. Similar confrontations followed daily -- "I lived in terror of going to work," Mr. Ford said.
Then about a week later, the union officials invited him to a local bar. "Come with us," Mr. Ford said they had told him. "You passed the test."
This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.
Have you been involved in any talks that are comparable to the current negotiations?
No, but every negotiation is different, and every leader is different. What I keep saying to our executives is: 'Don't take this personally. A lot of it is theater. The most important thing is get the deal done. The rhetoric doesn't matter.' Every negotiation is a roller coaster. Some are not pleasant, and some sting. Don't overreact. And when it's all over, we are still one team again, and have to go forward.
Are you going to be on the same team at the end of these talks?
I believe we will. I know many on their negotiating team personally, and some of them, I play hockey with them and consider them very close friends.
You've said the real competition is not U.A.W. vs. Ford but the U.A.W. and Ford against Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the Chinese automakers. Do you think the union's leadership agrees with that?
I hope so, because if they don't, it will be catastrophic. They can have disagreements with us and bargain hard, but we are not the enemy. I will never consider our employees the enemy. I think the employees know who the real competition is, and they will come together with us when this is over. We made a conscious decision to add jobs here in America when our competitors were moving production to Mexico.
Would the offer you have on the table now put Ford at a significant disadvantage to other automakers?
It certainly won't be an advantage. We could live with the deal we have proposed, but just barely. If you go beyond that, we are going to have to start making hard decisions in terms of investments and future products.
Shawn Fain has said the workers have fallen behind while the automakers and executives like Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, and Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, have prospered. How do you respond?
Everyone's going to have their own viewpoint on executive compensation, and I totally get that. But I also know what the market is for top talent. You have entertainers and athletes who are making more than Jim Farley and Mary Barra. But that's what the market is, and the company with the best talent wins, period.
There were some years in the lean years when I took no pay, and I would do it again if I had to.
You have three plants shut down by the strike. How is that affecting your operations?
It's messy, and it's going to become messier. The most immediate effects will be on the suppliers. The supply base is very fragile. It barely survived Covid, and is not all the way back, so a prolonged strike will start collapsing the supply base, and then making anything in this country will be difficult.
Manufacturing is a matter of national security, and we saw that during Covid. And I hope with all my heart we never get into another war, but if we did, this industry would be critical to defending our nation, as it was in World War I and World War II. Other industries can make small numbers of things. The auto companies can turn that into tens of thousands of things.
"I never thought I would see the day when our products were so heavily politicized, but they are." -- William Clay Ford Jr.
What's your outlook on the U.S. economy?
I think it's fragile. Inflation is taking its toll. The consumer is still spending, but we're watching it very carefully. On the other hand, there's still strong employment, and we are seeing our sales hold up. There are conflicting signals, for sure.
Let's talk about electric vehicles. About 18 months ago, you launched the F-150 Lightning pickup. It seemed like electric vehicle sales were going to take off. But now Ford is slowing production of that truck. What happened?
E.V. sales are still up 50 percent this year, so sales are growing very fast. But we've also seen a politicization of E.V.s. Blue states say E.V.s are great and we need to adopt them as soon as possible for climate reasons. Some of the red states say this is just like the vaccine, and it's being shoved down our throat by the government, and we don't want it. I never thought I would see the day when our products were so heavily politicized, but they are.
The other is prices. Electric vehicles are expensive. We know prices will come down, and as that happens, we will have a bigger ramp-up of E.V.s. Keep this in mind: The most valuable company that our industry has ever seen is Tesla, and it's growing. That's a very instructive point when people say E.V.s are not desired.
Are you concerned about some of Donald Trump's comments? He just came into Michigan and said that the transition to electric vehicles is going to result in almost all auto production moving to China.
I don't want to personalize this, because, frankly, we have to pick a path forward and our lead times are longer than political lead times. So we can't overreact to one bit of rhetoric or another. We have to deal with the most likely scenario, and how we can create the most value for our company, so we are pushing ahead with E.V.s because we do believe they have great application for a lot of people. And once people drive E.V.s, they will see that it's a great experience.
Electric vehicles are expensive. Did Tesla's price cuts have a big effect on your business?
That's what we have seen with every new technology that has been adapted. You come down the cost curve pretty quickly as batteries get better.
With our first-generation E.V.s, the Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, they were done with a lot of internal combustion engineering in them. The next generation, which will start coming quite quickly, was developed with a clean sheet of paper. When you do that you can really start taking cost out, and then you can start pricing them accordingly.
Tesla has been leading the price cuts, because they can with their scale. That's something we are actually counting on in the future. And we will have products that compete and make money in that world.

Full text: Mr. Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor, said nonunion automakers would make gains against Michigan automakers because of strikes by the United Automobile Workers union.
The monthlong strike by the United Automobile Workers and the union's demands for substantial pay and benefits increases risk damaging the U.S. auto industry, hurting its ability to compete against nonunion foreign rivals, the executive chairman of Ford Motor said on Monday.
The fight should not be seen as the U.A.W. against Ford, or its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Stellantis, said William C. Ford Jr., the great-grandson of the company's founder Henry Ford, noting that at times U.A.W. officials have referred to the automakers as the union's "enemy."
"It should be Ford and the U.A.W. against Toyota, Honda, Tesla and all the Chinese companies that want to enter our home market," Mr. Ford said at the company's Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and the others are loving the strike, because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," the executive chairman said. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
Mr. Ford's remarks alluded to a period several decades ago when the U.A.W. won increasingly rich contracts that were later seen by many industry experts as having hobbled the three Michigan automakers in the face of competition from Japanese and European carmakers. Ford came to the brink of collapse, and G.M. and Chrysler -- now part of Stellantis -- had to seek bankruptcy protection after the 2008 financial crisis.
"Ford's ability to invest in the future isn't just a talking point," Mr. Ford said. "It is the absolute lifeblood of our company. And if we lose it, we will lose to the competition. Many jobs will be lost."
In a statement, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said Mr. Ford should "stop playing games" and meet the union's demands, or "we'll close the Rouge for him." Mr. Fain added that the U.A.W. was not fighting the company but "corporate greed."
"If Ford wants to be the all-American auto company, they can pay all-American wages and benefits," Mr. Fain said. "Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda and others are not the enemy -- they're the U.A.W. members of the future."
Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have been negotiating new labor contracts with the U.A.W. since July. Over the past month, the union has called on workers at a few plants to go on strike. The action has idled three Ford plants, two G.M. factories and one Stellantis plant. Workers at 38 G.M. and Stellantis spare-parts warehouses are also on strike.
The strategy is intended to increase pressure on the companies to meet the union's demands for significantly higher wages, shorter working hours and expanded pensions, and to end a system that pays new hires just over half of the top U.A.W. wage of $ 32 an hour.
The companies have offered wage increases of more than 20 percent over the next four years and certain other measures in line with the union's demands, but the U.A.W. is pressing for greater concessions.
Last week, the union called for a strike by 8,700 workers at Ford's Kentucky truck plant in Louisville, the company's largest.
Ford executives said last week that the company had made a record offer to the union and that sweetening the deal would hurt the automaker's ability to invest in electric vehicles and other new models and technologies.
Mr. Ford, who has had a role in every round of negotiations with the U.A.W. since 1982, said the talks had reached "a crossroads" and warned that labor contracts that burdened the automakers with heavy costs could affect the U.S. economy.
"The price of failure should be clear to everyone," he said. "Let's come together and reach an agreement, so we can take the fight to the real competition."

The Costs of Car Ownership Are Straining Finances: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For millions of Americans, cars are a necessity -- to get to work, to carry children around, to buy food. In recent memory, they've also never been as expensive to own.
According to AAA, the average annual cost in the first five years of new-car ownership rose to $ 12,182 this year, from $ 10,728 last year, reflecting increased purchase prices, maintenance costs and finance charges. That's 16 percent of the median household income, before taxes. (The figure includes depreciation.)
What does that look like in the aggregate? About 92 percent of households have at least one car available to them, and 22 percent have at least three. That comes out to about 223 million personal vehicles, and trillions of dollars a year in spending. By contrast, only $ 79 billion was spent on public transportation in 2019 for both capital and operating expenses.
On a personal level, America's dependence on automobiles means hefty bills, the risk of dangerous crashes and stress. And now, even with strong wage growth and elevated savings in recent years, high sticker prices and escalating interest rates are starting to take a toll: The share of borrowers moving into delinquency jumped in late 2022 and early 2023. Personal vehicles often become workers' largest expense, on par with housing, child care and food.
To understand how car owners are coping, we asked five of them to lay out the expenses associated with their cars. They're a lot higher than people sometimes bargain for. For most, there is no alternative. Brent McCulley is a 33-year-old Realtor in Pompano Beach, Fla., whose family of four requires two cars, making the cost of transportation its largest expense.
Mr. McCulley had been getting along all right in Newark, with one Kia Soul among him, his wife and their young daughter. It was stressful, shuttling the toddler to day care and then getting to his office by 8 a.m., but they made it work with enough public transportation to handle in-between trips.
Florida was a different story. Mr. McCulley was born there and always wanted to return, so they moved to Pompano Beach in early 2022. By that time, after some car swaps, they were driving a 2022 Kia Forte, which he leased for $ 294 per month. They had a baby boy and fewer transit options, so they needed to go car shopping again.
"She could walk to Aldi and get groceries," Mr. McCulley said of his wife. "But beyond that, there's only so much you can do."
Mr. McCulley's credit score had taken a hit after he took on debt to finance the move. So he bought a 2019 Kia Sorento from Carvana at a 12 percent interest rate, which would have required paying $ 7,645 in interest over the course of the loan. A few months later, his credit had improved enough for him to refinance at a 6.6 percent rate, which left the monthly payments at $ 577.
That's only a little more than the average monthly payment for used cars, which reached $ 533 in the second quarter this year, according to TransUnion. The average payment for new cars is $ 741. Both are record highs.
Insurance on both of those cars in Florida comes to $ 459. Gas adds $ 200 or so, bringing the total to around $ 1,530 a month. That's about as much as their rent.
And there's maintenance. After spending five years with a 1992 Buick Century that would break down every other week, Mr. McCulley likes to pay more for new or late-model vehicles because they tend to have fewer issues. Still, the Sorento has required about $ 3,000 in maintenance over the past year -- the front brakes had to be replaced, then the back brakes, and then a flat tire.
Mr. McCulley expects this to be a lucrative year at work, with commissions that should amount to about double Pompano Beach's median household income. But with all their expenses -- including the resumption of mandatory student loan payments, and his son's day care -- they're budgeting carefully. His wife decided to take a job at a veterinarian's office to cover all the bills.
For Mr. McCulley, it's an illustration that even for people who look comfortably middle class, car expenses contribute to a feeling of being overwhelmed.
"Whether you're a millionaire trying to figure out how to allocate your taxes, or whether you're making minimum wage," Mr. McCulley said, "it's all struggle in different kinds of ways." Troy Massey is a 29-year-old Amazon driver in Jacksonville, Fla., who needs a car to go even a few miles but keeps getting underwater on car loans.
A few years ago, debts had piled up while Mr. Massey was attending the University of Central Florida; he lost his financial aid and had to drop out. Juggling too many bills, he fell behind on the loan for his 2013 Honda Civic. In the fall of 2021, it was repossessed -- but because he still owed $ 4,800, the loan balance, he had to keep making payments on a car he didn't own.
Mr. Massey spent most of 2022 without a vehicle. It was technically feasible; he lived only a few miles from where he worked, at Walmart. But the bus wasn't reliable, and when he tried to walk or bike, he'd end up soaked in sweat or a sudden downpour. After a while, he'd had enough.
"I just ended up biting the bullet and saying, 'I need to get another car,"' Mr. Massey said. "I know what happened to the last one, but it's a necessity. If we had some kind of rail system or something like that, it'd be fine. But we don't."
This time, though, getting a car was even more expensive. The cheapest reliable car he could find, a Toyota Corolla with 89,000 miles, cost $ 18,240 including taxes and fees. With a 15.2 percent interest rate and an extended warranty, that left him with monthly payments of $ 451. Looking for insurance, he couldn't find anything less than $ 323 a month for the most basic plan.
Soon after, he switched from Walmart to a Winn-Dixie and took a second job working part time at Amazon, a 35-minute drive from his apartment. Gas for those commutes cost about $ 40 per week, bringing the monthly total to nearly $ 1,000, along with occasional maintenance, like the $ 100 for his last oil change and $ 27 to fix a slowly leaking tire.
"For someone who's making a decent income, that might not be as hard," Mr. Massey said. "But for someone like me who's in the middle of trying to change careers making $ 15.50 an hour, it hits you like a truck."
Mr. Massey thought about selling his Corolla and trying to find something even cheaper. The problem is, he still owes about $ 16,000 on the car, and its book value is only about half that, so he'd have to pay off the difference -- again.
That's an increasingly common experience, as the average used-car loan at origination has reached 123 percent of the vehicle's market value, according to TransUnion. And although overall delinquency on auto loans is low, delinquencies have been climbing quickly since interest rates started increasing in 2022.
In August, he switched to a job driving full time for one of Amazon's delivery contractors making $ 18.75 an hour, which comes to about $ 3,000 a month before taxes. Rent for his apartment with roommates is $ 700, leaving little for food and the credit card bills he's still trying to pay off.
Mr. Massey is building his software programming portfolio so he can start applying for jobs that pay more -- at least enough to afford his car. Jennifer Owings is a 48-year-old school administrator in New York City whose two- to three-hour round-trip commute costs more than $ 1,000 a month.
Ms. Owings loves her job, as an assistant principal at a public elementary school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She also loves her home on Staten Island, a condominium with a pool that she bought after a divorce a few years ago, and the community she has developed there.
She does not, however, love the commute -- or how much it costs.
She gets in her 2017 Subaru Outback, which she's paying off in $ 328 installments, and leaves at 5:10 a.m., when the 13 miles over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and down the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway are mostly clear (but include tolls totaling $ 175 a month). The afternoon commute is tricky; if she waits too long, it can take two hours. "Any Friday in June, forget about it," Ms. Owings said.
Some expenses are occasional, like maintenance, which Ms. Owings estimates at $ 50 a month on average. So far insurance has covered major damage, like the crash in 2021 that put the car in the shop for weeks, but it costs $ 232 a month. Even minor needs add up, like registration this year, which was $ 138. She's also enrolled in a monthly unlimited carwash plan, which costs $ 23.95.
Parking is the only thing that's free, and some older staff members at her school even drive from Long Island. "I'd say the under-30 crew probably doesn't have their own cars because they can't afford to -- it's too expensive," Ms. Owings said.
She could take a pay cut and return to teaching in a school closer to her house on Staten Island, and save some of the $ 200 a month she spends on gas. But a good boss, leadership opportunities and a school she likes are hard to give up. And public transportation?
"It would actually be faster to take my own kayak -- or to run," said Ms. Owings, who competes in marathons. Instead, as much as she enjoys having the time to catch up with friends, spending continuous hours in a car every day has given her hip pain. "Other people have old sports injuries," she said. "I have a commuting injury." Aydee Joya is a 56-year-old Uber driver living in Arlington, Va., who barely breaks even after accounting for all her expenses.
Technically, Ms. Joya's car is her job, but sometimes it feels as if she's working just to pay for it.
Ms. Joya immigrated from El Salvador as a child and worked for 26 years as a bilingual family assistant in public schools. When her job was eliminated in 2018, a friend told her that driving for taxi apps was a good way to make money on her own schedule, so she started driving for Uber in her 2014 Nissan Rogue.
It worked out all right for a while, and she enjoyed driving. But Ms. Joya quickly learned how many costs are involved in ferrying people around, along with the $ 235 she spends in gas per week.
First came a spent battery, followed by oil changes, tires punctured by potholes, seats soiled by passengers' vomit. In July and August, routine maintenance, including a tire alignment and transmission flush, came to $ 1,433.
"There are things that people don't know that are involved with their car," Ms. Joya said. "We use the brakes all the time. You need to do a lot of repairs, not only tires, not only oil change. All the things inside the car get damaged."
As many ride-hailing drivers do for their protection, she installed a camera in the car at her expense. County property taxes on her vehicle come to $ 566 per year, tolls add about $ 32 a month, and she faces occasional speeding tickets.
Insurance costs $ 603 for six months. In 2022, despite often driving 12 hours a day, she said she made only $ 12,000 after expenses.
In early 2023, as she drove to pick up a passenger, her car was rear-ended. The Nissan was totaled, and Ms. Joya was left with slicing back pain that has made it difficult to drive for long stretches.
Now she drives a 2020 Honda HR-V with a monthly loan payment of $ 536. To make matters worse, she said, Uber isn't paying as much on her fares as it used to. (Uber said drivers' average earnings per hour that they were engaged with a passenger -- that is, not counting time between fares -- had risen since 2019.)
"I'm spending my own money for Uber," while the company makes the profit, Ms. Joya said.
Ms. Joya has thought about moving on from Uber, and at the urging of her husband -- a retired construction worker who worries about her being out late, with several high-profile reports of violence toward ride-hailing drivers recently -- earned a certificate to become a clinical medical assistant. But she hasn't found a job yet, so she keeps driving. Cyndy Knighton is a 58-year-old transportation engineer for the City of Tukwila, Wash., who suffered several car accidents over the past year and a half.
Transportation didn't cost that much for Ms. Knighton, who drove a paid-off 2009 Nissan Altima hybrid -- until April 2022, when a teenager driving on a learner's permit made a left turn in front of her. She broke a wrist and her sternum in the collision, and the car was totaled.
An insurance payout covered the cost of a 14-year-old Subaru and immediately needed repairs, but the vehicle switch subjected her to spiking gasoline prices that she had mostly avoided with her hybrid; the new car required about $ 163 per month to fuel.
In search of a longer-term solution, Ms. Knighton decided to order a new hybrid Toyota Highlander that could handle her steep driveway even during the rare snow and transport her four Samoyeds, which she breeds and occasionally enters in dog shows.
That car, however, got snarled in pandemic supply chain issues. The 2022 edition was converted into a 2023, with a slightly higher base price. Then in March, Ms. Knighton was hit again -- her Subaru was rear-ended on Interstate 5 heading into Seattle, resulting in a concussion and another wrecked vehicle.
This time, with used cars in short supply, she paid about $ 8,200 -- more than the $ 6,200 insurance payout -- to buy a 2001 Highlander with poor gas mileage. To add additional insurance protection, she's now paying $ 158 a month in premiums.
Treatment for her injuries has racked up more than $ 86,000 in medical bills, which her employer's health insurance has covered, other than her $ 750 in co-payments. In September, after more than a year of wrangling with her car insurance company, she finally heard she would receive insurance payouts worth $ 80,000 after lawyers' fees.
That will be enough to buy the new Highlander outright, at $ 62,350 including taxes. But Ms. Knighton would never have chosen to finance a new car that way. Aside from the pain and continuing physical therapy, the psychic trauma of repeated accidents takes its own toll. Small shocks on the road -- like when she had to slam on the brakes recently, sending one of her dogs into the windshield -- can bring on tears.
"I get the irony, that I'm a transportation professional and I'm afraid to drive," Ms. Knighton said. "To have that lurking there, that could break through at any random time for any reason, is debilitating. It's an emotional, intellectual cost that is intangible."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The impish persona and insouciant attitude of the Formula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda have overturned stereotypes. The next step? Showing he can keep up with rivals.
The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula 1 race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.
Yet at a fan event in central Tokyo last week, Mr. Tsunoda appeared jovial as he shared the stage with several rivals. When a moderator asked him to teach his fellow drivers a few words of the local language, Mr. Tsunoda took the microphone and chirped, "We are all slower than Yuki" in Japanese, drawing a laugh from the hundreds of fans hoisting their cellphones for photos.
It was in keeping with an impish persona, and, atypically for a top-level Japanese athlete, a foul mouth and devil-may-care attitude that has inspired a cult following and an international appeal that outstrip his accomplishments so far in F1.
When he made his debut in 2021, he was the youngest driver on the F1 grid and, as it happens, the shortest (he still is, at a reported 5 feet 3 inches). With his baby face, Mr. Tsunoda, 23, quickly gained an incongruous reputation for cursing volubly on the radio that drivers use to give feedback to engineers and mechanics -- audio traffic that is also broadcast to fans during races.
Clips of him shouting "Shut up!" and other less printable outbursts went viral on social media, and his colorful reference to a "traffic paradise" that angered him on the track became a meme among fans.
In the wildly popular Netflix series "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," Mr. Tsunoda was shown farting, being lackadaisical about strength training and announcing "I want to go first poo" before a massage.
In his first year, some fans questioned whether he had earned the right to act that way. "People would think, 'Why is he shouting a lot in the radio even if he is not performing really well?"' Mr. Tsunoda said during an interview over Zoom a few weeks before the Japanese Grand Prix.
But just as Hideo Nomo, one of the earliest Japanese players in Major League Baseball, upended stereotypes about Asian masculinity, Mr. Tsunoda may help topple other racial clichés.
While Asians are often characterized as disciplined and obedient, Mr. Tsunoda's behavior shows that they "are allowed to have this full range of emotions and dispositions, even if what you're saying has to be bleeped out," said Christina Chin, associate professor of sociology at California State University, Fullerton.
Mr. Tsunoda's global exposure has coincided with a resurgence of Formula 1 racing in Japan, which last boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the European-dominated sport, Mr. Tsunoda is the first Japanese driver to race in the elite circuit since Kamui Kobayashi left in 2014.
Last weekend, 220,000 fans attended the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka over three days of practice, qualifying and racing, the highest number since 2006. Fans in T-shirts bearing the logos of teams like Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari jockeyed with "Yuki Go Go" banners in the stands.
Even Mr. Tsunoda's former English tutor, Junko Tasaki, 51, showed up wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a maple leaf design from Mr. Tsunoda's AlphaTauri team helmet and carrying a large cardboard cutout of the driver's face.
"I had no interest in F1 before I met him," Ms. Tasaki said. For the record, she added, "I didn't teach him to say 'shut up' or the F-word."
Just before climbing into his car on race day, Mr. Tsunoda consulted with several engineers and paused for a last-minute selfie with Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire fashion retail entrepreneur. The day turned somber for Mr. Tsunoda when he finished 12th, outside the sacred top 10 where team points are scored. His best finish in any of the 16 races this season so far was 10th place.
One spot in front of him on Sunday was Liam Lawson, the younger backup driver rumored to be in contention to replace Mr. Tsunoda next year. But going into the race weekend, AlphaTauri and Honda, the Japanese carmaker that supplies engines and financial backing for the team, announced that Mr. Tsunoda would continue to drive for them next year.
Speaking to Japanese reporters after the race, Mr. Tsunoda rubbed his fist in his right eye socket and lamented not placing higher in front of local supporters.
Mr. Tsunoda's rise to Formula 1 started in the pits of go-kart racing near his home in Sagamihara, a suburb outside Tokyo, when he was 4. At age 5, he won the Japanese series championship for his age group.
"I didn't think of it as raising him to be a driver, as much as having fun together," Nobuaki Tsunoda, 60, Mr. Tsunoda's father, said during an interview in a garage office crammed with custom-built bicycles, a vintage Honda S2000 sports car and a row of his son's helmets. "I always said if you want to stop, you can stop."
Moving up to single-seater racing was more than his family could afford. His father, who had business connections with Honda, suggested he try out for the carmaker's racing school, which accepted him.
By 2018 -- the year Honda started building engines for Red Bull, the parent team of AlphaTauri -- Mr. Tsunoda had won the championship of a lower circuit, Formula 4.
Honda's backing has been crucial for Mr. Tsunoda. "F1 takes a lot of money," said Masahiro Owari, a Japanese sportswriter. "I think a lot of the reason he is on the team is because of Honda's support."
When Mr. Tsunoda was promoted to F1, he first moved to Milton Keynes, England, racing for AlphaTauri. Before his second F1 race in 2021, he crashed during a qualifying session, and his driving deteriorated over subsequent races. Since then, the team hired him a psychologist, he toned down the swearing and his driving improved.
He said he didn't consider therapy a punishment. "I take it like they wanted to support me as much as possible to be a better driver," he said.
AlphaTauri did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Beyond racing, Mr. Tsunoda said he wants to open a restaurant after winning a world championship. He didn't enjoy the food in Milton Keynes, he said, but since traveling more and moving to Italy, where AlphaTauri is based, he has eaten more palate-pleasing meals. He envisions a fusion menu with items like Wagyu beef tacos.
The first time his parents visited him at his home in Faenza, his mother, Minako Tsunoda, hoped to eat a meal in an Italian restaurant. Instead, she said, Mr. Tsunoda asked her to fix him ozoni, soup with sticky rice cakes, and sekihan, rice with red beans.
"I was not really a foodie guy" in Japan, he said. "Probably because I didn't recognize how good Japanese food is compared to other cuisine."

SUZUKA, Japan — The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula One race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.

Strikes and Deep Roots: 'Good Stories in Detroit': [National Desk]

Full text: As electric vehicles usher in a new era for the car economy and workers strike against rooted manufacturers, Neal E. Boudette is in Motor City to cover it all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler -- at the same time.
The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.
Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.
In an interview, Mr. Boudette spoke about the evolution of the industry, its symbolism in the United States and what this strike could mean for other automakers. This interview has been edited and condensed.
President Biden visited a picket line in Michigan this week, which has been described as unprecedented for a sitting president. Does this strike feel different from U.A.W.'s strike at General Motors in 2019, or ones before that?
A lot of the strikes in the past 20 years have been symbolic more than strategic. This year, it's a totally different dynamic. The union has a very strong negotiating position. The car companies are making tons of money, and workers have not received raises that have kept up with inflation. The workers have a lot of support from the public.
There have been strikes in the past that were very contentious and even resulted in street clashes. But in the 21st century, there hasn't been a strike like this.
You worked in Germany before coming to Detroit. How do the settings compare?
Detroit is Motor City. The whole region has this very strong connection to automobiles. There's a century-long history and a great deal of culture built around the automobile. The Detroit Red Wings -- their logo is a winged wheel.
It was less so in Germany. I was based in Frankfurt, not an auto center. Opel was a little bit outside of Frankfurt, and Mercedes was south of Frankfurt. B.M.W. was down in Munich; Volkswagen was up north in Wolfsburg. Each of those towns is a little like Detroit, but you didn't have the concentration that you have in Detroit.
How has the evolution of electric vehicles changed your beat?
The biggest trend is electrification, and there are many different aspects of it. Aside from the fact that you have to get these cars designed and developed and produced, there's a social aspect to it. We need chargers all over the place, and charging a car is a different social experience than filling up your gas tank.
Then there's the climate aspect. The evolution of the industry to electronic vehicles has been called the biggest transition the industry has seen since the introduction of the moving assembly line.
The beat is multifaceted now. Before the financial crisis, it wasn't quite like that. There was a technology race, but it was a very limited technology race. And now it's taking on a much greater breadth.
What affects will the strike have on the industry?
Eventually the union and automakers will come up with an agreement. And then the next big question will be: How much of a burden does this contract put on these companies? Their competitors -- Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Kia -- are foreign companies who operate nonunion factories. Most of their workers make considerably less than the top U.A.W. wage.
In recent years, U.A.W. tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a Nissan plant in Mississippi, and the workers voted down union representation. They didn't want to rock the boat.
But there's a lot of power on the side of workers these days. I think it's possible workers in the South say: We're making $ 22 an hour. The workers in Detroit are making $ 32 an hour. We should be in the union.
As an auto industry reporter, are you a big car guy?
It's funny, I'm not. I'm interested in cars, but I'm not a big car person. I drive a Chevy Malibu, believe it or not.
Cars are interesting products to cover. There's no other country in the world where there are as many pop songs and movies about cars. The Beach Boys' "409"; that David Hasselhoff TV show, "Knight Rider." It's a whole TV show built around a car.
There are good stories in Detroit. Sometimes it's a matter of explaining things to readers. We did a lot of that in the past year on the transition to E.V.s. There are also really interesting personalities to write about. That's what keeps me going.

Full text: For arguably the most technically gifted trumpeter of his generation, a lot of Ambrose Akinmusire's breakthroughs actually come from letting go of standards and structures.
Take the moment about 10 years ago when, shortly after becoming friends with his lifelong creative idol, Joni Mitchell, Akinmusire found himself in a bathroom at her Los Angeles home, playing into a microphone. She'd suggested that he record trumpet for a new version of her song "Borderline," and he was struggling to find a part that fit.
"I wasn't getting it right. And she was like, 'I know what you need: You need an egg shaker,"' he said recently in a video interview, still a touch amazed to be telling this story. Mitchell started rattling the shakers wildly, way outside the time signature. His hopes darkened. "But I played the track with her doing that, and for some reason it locked it in for me," Akinmusire said. Suddenly, "I was able to play."
And there was the time, just after the pandemic began, when Akinmusire decided to finally take the advice of Bennie Maupin -- a multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock -- who had once told him to try improvising with only a drummer. "You can get to some new stuff if you just set up with a drummer and practice," Maupin had told him. So in 2020, when life slowed to a standstill, Akinmusire started getting together with the young drummer Timothy Angulo at a grocery store parking lot near where he lived in Oakland, Calif. Five or six days a week for over a year, they would set a timer and improvise freely for a solid hour.
"I don't think I've ever grown more as a musician than in that time," said Akinmusire, 41, speaking from a messily ordered room in the Berkeley home he now shares with his partner, the poet and novelist Shabnam Piryaei, and their young son.
Lately Akinmusire has been making some of the most intimate, spellbinding music of his career. In June he self-released "Beauty Is Enough," a solo trumpet album, gentle of breath and tender of phrase, recorded at a Paris cathedral. And in early December, Nonesuch Records will release "Owl Song," an achingly spartan LP, on which Akinmusire leads a trio featuring the guitarist Bill Frisell and the drummer Herlin Riley through a handful of line-drawn original tunes.
Frisell, a 72-year-old jazz eminence and a regular collaborator with Akinmusire, said he's bowled over by the trumpeter's restraint these days. "There's this clarity in everything that he plays," Frisell said recently. "The architecture of it has this incredible power." Even in its simplicity, Akinmusire's trumpet can feel almost dangerously tender: "like an exposed nerve," Frisell said.
If his style has grown increasingly spare, the same cannot be said of his workload. Akinmusire recently held down residencies at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and at SFJazz, where he convened the Riley-Frisell trio for the first time; he's been writing the score for the Starz show "Blindspotting," which is written by his old Berkeley High School classmate Daveed Diggs; he recently completed an hourlong electronic composition to accompany a dance piece by Aszure Barton; he is working on the music for a Will Smith-produced podcast on hip-hop; he is completing a commission for chamber orchestra; and he has two more albums already in the pipeline, due for release on Nonesuch next year.
Starting this fall, all of that will have to fit around Akinmusire's new role as artistic director of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz Performance at U.C.L.A.
A product of the academic age in jazz, Akinmusire's creative life has been intertwined with the Hancock institute nearly from the start. He grew up nurtured by Oakland's local jazz scene and the music of his family's church and put in a formative early stint in the saxophonist and composer Steve Coleman's band, then enrolled in the two-year program at what was known at the time as the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. He won its king-making trumpet competition in 2007, with a style so elliptical and distinct -- glancing on Fats Navarro and Lee Morgan and Terence Blanchard, but not mimicking anyone -- that it quickly changed the game for young trumpeters in New York.
"Watching him develop over the years has been really exciting," Herbie Hancock, the institute's chairman, said in a statement when the appointment was announced in July.
Akinmusire could represent a contemporary jazz ideal: the scholarly composer-improviser, working across media while keeping a number of small groups together, refining a personal inflection on his instrument all the while. But the closer he gets to institutional leadership, the more he tends to pull away from the passive role of ambassadorship. After a decade with Blue Note, jazz's most iconic label, he said he wanted to enjoy not knowing exactly "what type of records I was going to make," and the genre-blind Nonesuch seemed like a place to be agnostic.
"Heart Emerges Glistening" was released in 2011 to wide acclaim, and Akinmusire became the No. 1 rising star artist in the DownBeat critics' poll. And his life seemed to go a little screwy. "People are starting to interact with me a little weird, my friends are being strange," he remembered thinking. "I don't want any part of this." So he moved to Los Angeles, where the jazz scene is smaller and more spread out, and did some hibernating. He stopped writing music for a while, leaned on Piryaei a bit. And he reconnected with Mitchell, whom he'd met, as it happens, via the institute.
He first ran into her backstage after his winning performance at the trumpet competition. "I thought I was about to faint, because I thought I was seeing things," he said. She told him she'd made everyone in the dressing room stop talking during his set; she'd loved his playing. Then she asked who his favorite artists were. "I was like: You," Akinmusire said. "And she's like, 'Yeah, I thought so!"' Mitchell guessed the exact tracks of hers that he liked best, including his very favorite, "Jericho." (She includes Akinmusire in an appendix titled "Stuff Joni Likes or Even Loves" in Michelle Mercer's book "Will You Take Me as I Am: Joni Mitchell's 'Blue' Period." He is near the top of the list, between "some Dylan" and Friedrich Nietzsche.)
Soon after moving to Los Angeles, he reached out to her. They started spending afternoons together, taking rides in his Honda Civic to pick up Italian food or playing music at her place. Akinmusire began to see a future for himself that might exist both in and outside of jazz.
As we spoke I noticed him using "creative music" more often than jazz. "Creative is one thing that it has to be for me. And the other thing is beautiful," he said. "I really believe in creativity, I believe in innovation, I believe in submitting to something higher than yourself."
He has been thinking about how to bring this ethic into his teaching, especially at a titular jazz institute. "When we're teaching jazz history, maybe we should start from current day," he said, looking for anyone who's "creating creative music." This would mean taking jazz out of its historical packaging, and paying attention to where contemporary ears are at -- while also challenging them.
He envisioned a class that might invite students to hear Noname's new album, "Sundial," and dissect its component parts. "Starting from something like that, and walking it back to Louis Armstrong, really incrementally," he said. "I think it would allow younger people to feel some type of ownership, like they can relate to this music."

3 Automakers And U.A.W. Resume Talks: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United Auto Workers said it had "reasonably productive conversations with Ford" but did not mention G.M. or Stellantis.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers on Saturday resumed negotiations on a new labor contract as a targeted strike entered its second day.
The union is striking against all three manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis -- but for now has limited the work stoppages to one plant at each of the companies: a Ford plant in Michigan, a G.M. plant in Missouri and a Stellantis plant in Ohio.
"We had reasonably productive conversations with Ford today," the union said in a statement. It made no mention of its talks with G.M. and Stellantis.
On Friday Ford said it had told 600 workers who are not part of the strike not to report to work, and G.M. said the work stoppage could force it to lay off about 2,000 workers at a plant in Kansas that gets parts from the Missouri factory.
In a statement on Saturday, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said the automakers' hints at possible layoffs were intended to "squeeze our member to settle for less" than the union has demanded.
"With their record profits, they don't have to lay off a single employee," he said.
The union is seeking a substantial pay increase, an expansion of pension plans to cover all workers, company-paid retiree health care and shorter work weeks. It also seeks an end to the "tiered" wage system in which new hires start at a little more than half the standard union wage and have to work eight years before reaching the top level.
In its initial list of demands, the U.A.W. called for a 40 percent wage increase, saying that matches the average pay increase the chief executives of the three companies have gotten over the last four years.
On Saturday, Stellantis -- the parent of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram -- said its most recent offer provided for an immediate 10 percent raise and additional increases that would lift wages a total of 21 percent over the life of the new contract, which is typically four years.
The company also said it offered to allow inflation-based wage adjustments. Under its proposal, new hires would rise to the top wage -- currently $ 32 an hour -- over four years instead of eight. Temporary workers, who now make $ 16.67 an hour, would move to about $ 21 an hour, Stellantis said.
"It's a very fair, highly competitive offer," Mark Stewart, chief operating officer of Stellantis's North American division, said in a conference call.
"We clearly understand we've been in an inflationary environment," Mr. Stewart said. "We understand we need to make changes to reflect what's happened since the last contract." At the same time, he continued, the company has to make sure it can compete with rivals that operate nonunion plants, including Tesla and foreign-owned automakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen.
"We've got to have a viable industry," Mr. Stewart said. "At the end of the day, we have to be able to compete."
G.M. and Ford have made similar offers on wages and reducing the climb to the top wage to four years, but all three companies have rejected many of the union's other demands related to pensions, health care, and job security.
Mr. Stewart also said Stellantis made a proposal to provide "job security" for about 1,350 people who lost their jobs earlier this year when Stellantis idled a plant in Belvidere, Ill. He declined to detail the company's offer and would not say if it included having the Belvidere plant produce new vehicles, a step that would signal it planned a full reopening of the factory.
That offer only remained on the table until the strike began, however.
Later on Saturday, Mr. Fain released a statement: "Belvidere Assembly was a profitable plant that just a few years ago supported around 5000 workers and their families. Now that number is zero, and Stellantis wants to keep playing games." He added, "Our attitude is: Save Belvidere."
Reopening that plant is one of the most important goals for Mr. Fain. He was elected to his post earlier this year on a promise to take a harder and more confrontational approach than his predecessors.
Four years ago, the U.A.W. went on strike for 40 days against G.M. and hoped to push the company to reopen a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that G.M. had tagged for closing. In the end, the union agreed to a deal that allowed the company to shutter the factory.

UAW Strike Looms Over Detroit Auto Show

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to find their way to showrooms. Despite those efforts, the union called a strike at three factories starting Friday.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike would almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer.

What the Wildfire Stole From One Maui Family: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A 7-year-old boy, his mom and grandparents tried to flee Hawaii's deadliest wildfire in over a century, and ran into impossible challenges.
The wind had never felt so fierce.
Folau Tone steadied himself as a gale whipped through his street in Lahaina. Trying to nail down the rattling tin roof on his family's home, he gave up as fragments were stripped away.
In West Maui, power lines were crashing down, and the electricity was out across a large swath of the island. Outdoor furniture and debris were flung across yards.
Folau's wife had already left for her job at a hotel, but their four children had stayed behind. It was Aug. 8, what would have been the first day of school. Classes were canceled because of the power outage.
The gusts did not deter his mother, Faaoso, who stood outside fussing over a pot of cassava root while another pot burbled with fish stew. She liked cooking in the open air and had long ago set up a makeshift kitchen with propane burners under a tent.
At 70, Faaoso enjoyed overseeing a home that bustled, happy to live with children and grandchildren over the years. Her husband, Maluifonua, 73, was retired, having suffered a back injury when a linen cart slipped while he was working at a resort.
Folau and his family moved in seven years ago, joining his sister Salote, 39, and her son, Tony Takafua. The siblings helped pay the mortgage.
At about 2 p.m., Folau showered and was preparing to leave for his job as a bartender when he received word that the restaurant was not going to open. He figured that he and his kids would hole up for the day.
But smoke began to swirl outside their home, a white bungalow with blue trim. Neighbors came outside to peer up at the mountains, their shouts drowned out by the wind. Some headed for their cars.
Folau, 44, had evacuated under threat of fire before, and he told his children to pack a change of clothes. The smoke soon thickened and darkened the sky. Folau found his footsteps quickening, his voice growing urgent.
His daughter Liliana, 14, jumped into the front seat of their silver truck, a Nissan Titan. Siosiua, 9, and Auralia, 5, crawled in the back seat. So did their 2-year-old brother, Keuli, and Nala, their Labrador mix.
Salote and Tony, 7, hopped into the white Honda Civic that she had recently purchased. Her parents climbed in the back. The plan was to follow Folau and meet at his wife's hotel.
Before leaving, Folau grabbed the two pots of food his mother had made and rushed to place them in the trunk of Salote's car. It would be nice to show up with a meal if there was no working electricity.
A new life on Maui
Maluifonua and Faaoso Tone had once been farmers in Tonga where they grew taro and breadfruit and raised horses, cows and goats. They were often seen side by side in the field, an unusually inseparable pair.
In 1995, the couple planned to move to San Francisco to join a family member whose stories had made them dream of an American life. On the way, they stopped to visit Faaoso's brother on Maui and decided to stay for good because the island reminded them of home. They had four children at the time and would soon adopt a fifth.
Maluifonua took a job as a dishwasher at a tavern called the Rusty Harpoon, working so late that he would miss the last bus and have to walk the four miles home.
He and his wife found comfort in the Polynesian community and were active in the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They attended socials and barbecues and spent afternoons at the congregation's farm, tending to rows of yam plants and banana trees.
Maluifonua was a natural leader, and friends requested that he coordinate the kitchen at weddings and parties where it was not unusual to welcome a few hundred people. Faaoso was quieter, more comfortable looking after the household. Many looked forward to her version of lu pulu, which involved steaming corned beef or lamb with coconut milk in taro leaves.
The couple often watched over the children of relatives or neighbors, offering relief to numerous working parents. "They never complained about people bringing their kids, they were always willing," Folau said.
Their modest house was near the ocean on a street lush with plumeria and coconut trees, and it became a landing place for relatives who had just moved to Maui.
Folau was their middle child and, after his older brother moved to Utah, the only son on the island. He had been a shy 15-year-old when he left Tonga and enrolled at Lahainaluna High School. There, he excelled at math and considered going to college.
But Folau remembered watching his older sister contributing her McDonald's paychecks to the house. He thought it best to join the work force and help with his parents' bills.
Over the years, Folau juggled jobs as a dishwasher, cook and server. He bartended, worked security, greeted travelers at zip-line tours.
It was not a life of regret. He felt a solemn sense of responsibility for the family.
A frantic escape
Inside his truck, Folau did not see the fire, but could feel the encroaching heat as he gripped the steering wheel. He started down Kuhua Street. Salote followed. The neighborhood was shrouded in gray, and wind was hurling embers, leaves and dirt in the air.
A fallen mango tree blocked access to the main thoroughfare that could get them out of the area. Vehicles were changing direction, jamming the road. Folau turned onto Aki Street, but drivers motioned that there was no outlet there, either. He turned back to Kuhua Street. Cars were trying to maneuver around one another but getting nowhere. He was trapped.
"Dad, get us out of here!" Liliana, his daughter, begged.
Alongside the street ran a metal fence. Another truck began ramming into it, futilely trying to break it down. Finally, the driver got out and started running, leaving his vehicle behind.
Folau scanned for another means of escape. "At the time, I wasn't thinking of anything -- just feeling that the kids were there and just trying to get them somewhere safe," he said.
He found himself back by the fallen mango tree. Maybe, Folau thought, he could wedge his truck against the side of the fence, force his wheels over the branches and break through to the other side.
Nearby homes began to ignite. The inside of Folau's truck grew hotter. He could barely see through the windshield. His children clung to one another and screamed.
"I just heard my kids crying. And then I just went for it."
He gunned the engine. His sister Salote, he hoped, was close behind.
'I love you to the end of me'
Salote Tone had a bold personality that some could find brash. But she tried not to spend time worrying about what people thought of her. She considered herself a work in progress and had empathy for anyone with a personal struggle.
"She could be sassy in people's eyes, but if you got to know her, she was really humble," her friend Fipe Fononga, 41, said. "She was my ride or die. If I'm in trouble or need help, she was there."
Salote helped Fipe land a job at a rental car agency. When Fipe had difficulty affording rent, Salote invited her to live with the family, sharing her bedroom.
"She never judged people, she tried to offer inspiration," said her friend Tiffany Tevaga, who wrestled with alcoholism for years and spent time in prison for assault. After Tiffany turned things around and began a home business braiding hair, Salote was her right hand, booking appointments and posting advertisements.
"Oh, she was so proud of me," Tiffany, 35, said. "I like to say I'm the muscle -- and Lote was the heart."
Salote had been a manager at Cheeseburger in Paradise, a well-known hangout, but eventually managed vacation-home rentals.
She loved to be social, staying out until sunrise with her girlfriends -- avoiding venues where she might find herself under the watchful eye of her big brother Folau.
When her son was born, Salote's world grew smaller and more focused. Tony became her shadow, her "Boobear" and "lil mini," and she was unabashed in her affection for him.
"I love you to the end of me, and I can never thank you enough for being my lifesaver," she wrote in April on her Facebook page.
The two spent days at the beach where Tony jumped off cliffs. He had a passion for football and video games, and liked riding electric bikes around the neighborhood with his cousins. He smiled whenever posing in a ta'ovala, his traditional Tongan dress, and often went to church with his grandparents. More than once, Tony raised money for children with heart problems, adding what he had earned from the tooth fairy and chores around the house.
During the first weekend of August, he and his mother visited Oahu where Tiffany was offering free braiding for a lower-income community. Salote joined in, brushing people's hair while her son clung to her side. They returned to Maui on the night of Aug. 7, although they had nearly missed their flight while scrambling to find Tony new football cleats.
He was starting second grade at Princess Nahienaena Elementary School the next day.
A valley of cinders
As flames tore through the heart of Lahaina, those elsewhere on Maui had little immediate information.
Folau's wife, Sabrina, was working the front desk at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas about four miles away, and trying to calm guests complaining about the power outage. Smoke was twisting through the sky outside.
Sabrina, 44, began receiving texts from her eldest, Liliana. But cell service was shoddy, and each message was one word.
"mom"
"please"
"answer"
Sabrina took a break to drive to Folau's restaurant and was relieved he had not shown up. It meant he was very likely with their children.
Finally, around 5 p.m., her husband appeared in the lobby, his face ashen. Guests were around, so he quietly told her to walk outside.
There she saw that the front and sides of his truck were scraped and battered. An electrical wire was tangled underneath. Liliana grabbed her and cried. Her other children and the dog were safe inside the truck.
An administrator at the hotel would later recall the scene as one of the first clues that something was terribly wrong in Lahaina.
Folau was anxious to retrace his steps to search for his sister's car, but the roads were impassable. Calls and texts went unanswered. Across the island, thousands had been displaced and separated. Sabrina's manager offered the family a hotel room for the night.
By morning, Folau had still not heard from his parents or Salote. The next day, he found a way to get into the burn area with his brother-in-law and a friend.
They saw a valley of cinders and burned dreams. Most of the homes were ash and rubble, some marked only by concrete steps to nowhere. Folau's own home had disappeared into dust, nothing left to be saved.
Cars with melted tires dotted the street, their metal frames nearly unrecognizable.
But one had a bent hood as if it had slammed into something. It also held a devastating detail: two scorched metal pots.
'Where is Tony?'
It has been more than a month since the fire, and dozens of victims have yet to be identified. The authorities count the total lives lost at 115, but many residents are convinced there are more. And there are still 66 names on a list of the missing.
Forensic experts and search teams combed through the rubble for weeks looking for any semblance of human remains. Families who have provided their DNA still wait for closure.
Folau knew before the officials: Faaoso, Maluifonua, Salote and Tony had died in their car. Three generations taken by flames they could not outrun. Tony would have celebrated his eighth birthday next month, the youngest victim to be identified so far.
Survivors have deep trauma and complicated mental scars. There are those who cannot speak of what they saw. And plans to restart their lives are outlined in grief.
Folau and his family are staying at a hotel as they figure out what comes next. Wherever they land, the household will feel incomplete.
Siosiua, his 9-year-old, has not yet come up with a good answer when other kids innocently ask, "Where is Tony?"
Folau is grateful to be there for his son in these moments after spending so much of his life working. It has been good to focus on fatherhood.
Like many, he is struggling with the weight of unwarranted guilt. Why his car made it out but his sister's did not. Whether he could have swung around and made sure they pulled through.
His siblings and friends assure him that he is not to blame. His own children speak of his heroism. The way they see it, Folau was their protector, a father fueled by love and desperation racing them out of a terrifying blaze.
And his wife knows the unbearable alternative: "If he had gone back, we would have lost them all."

LAHAINA, Hawaii — The wind had never felt so fierce.
Folau Tone steadied himself as a gale whipped through his street in Lahaina. Trying to nail down the rattling tin roof on his family’s home, he gave up as fragments were stripped away.
In West Maui, power lines were crashing down, and the electricity was out across a large swath of the island. Outdoor furniture and debris were flung across yards.
Folau’s wife had already left for her job at a hotel, but their four children had stayed behind. It was Aug. 8, what would have been the first day of school. Classes were canceled because of the power outage.
The gusts did not deter his mother, Faaoso, who stood outside fussing over a pot of cassava root while another pot burbled with fish stew. She liked cooking in the open air and had long ago set up a makeshift kitchen with propane burners under a tent.
At 70, Faaoso enjoyed overseeing a home that bustled, happy to live with children and grandchildren over the years. Her husband, Maluifonua, 73, was retired, having suffered a back injury when a linen cart slipped while he was working at a resort.
Folau and his family moved in seven years ago, joining his sister Salote, 39, and her son, Tony Takafua. The siblings helped pay the mortgage.
At about 2 p.m., Folau showered and was preparing to leave for his job as a bartender when he received word that the restaurant was not going to open. He figured that he and his kids would hole up for the day.
But smoke began to swirl outside their home, a white bungalow with blue trim. Neighbors came outside to peer up at the mountains, their shouts drowned out by the wind. Some headed for their cars.
Folau, 44, had evacuated under threat of fire before, and he told his children to pack a change of clothes. The smoke soon thickened and darkened the sky. Folau found his footsteps quickening, his voice growing urgent.
His daughter Liliana, 14, jumped into the front seat of their silver truck, a Nissan Titan. Siosiua, 9, and Auralia, 5, crawled in the back seat. So did their 2-year-old brother, Keuli, and Nala, their Labrador mix.
Salote and Tony, 7, hopped into the white Honda Civic that she had recently purchased. Her parents climbed in the back. The plan was to follow Folau and meet at his wife’s hotel.
Before leaving, Folau grabbed the two pots of food his mother had made and rushed to place them in the trunk of Salote’s car. It would be nice to show up with a meal if there was no working electricity.
A New Life on Maui
Maluifonua and Faaoso Tone had once been farmers in Tonga where they grew taro and breadfruit and raised horses, cows and goats. They were often seen side by side in the field, an unusually inseparable pair.
In 1995, the couple planned to move to San Francisco to join a family member whose stories had made them dream of an American life. On the way, they stopped to visit Faaoso’s brother on Maui and decided to stay for good because the island reminded them of home. They had four children at the time and would soon adopt a fifth.
Maluifonua took a job as a dishwasher at a tavern called the Rusty Harpoon, working so late that he would miss the last bus and have to walk the 4 miles home.
He and his wife found comfort in the Polynesian community and were active in the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They attended socials and barbecues and spent afternoons at the congregation's farm, tending to rows of yam plants and banana trees.
Maluifonua was a natural leader, and friends requested that he coordinate the kitchen at weddings and parties where it was not unusual to welcome a few hundred people. Faaoso was quieter, more comfortable looking after the household. Many looked forward to her version of lu pulu, which involved steaming corned beef or lamb with coconut milk in taro leaves.
The couple often watched over the children of relatives or neighbors, offering relief to numerous working parents. “They never complained about people bringing their kids, they were always willing,” Folau said.
Their modest house was near the ocean on a street lush with plumeria and coconut trees, and it became a landing place for relatives who had just moved to Maui.
Folau was their middle child and, after his older brother moved to Utah, the only son on the island. He had been a shy 15-year-old when he left Tonga and enrolled at Lahainaluna High School. There, he excelled at math and considered going to college.
But Folau remembered watching his older sister contributing her McDonald’s paychecks to the house. He thought it best to join the workforce and help with his parents’ bills.
Over the years, Folau juggled jobs as a dishwasher, cook and server. He bartended, worked security, greeted travelers at zip-line tours.
It was not a life of regret. He felt a solemn sense of responsibility for the family.
A Frantic Escape
Inside his truck, Folau did not see the fire, but he could feel the encroaching heat as he gripped the steering wheel. He started down Kuhua Street. Salote followed. The neighborhood was shrouded in gray, and wind was hurling embers, leaves and dirt in the air.

He was trapped.

UAW Strike Looms Over Detroit Auto Show

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to make their way to showrooms.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
“We’re seeing movement from the companies, but they’re still not willing to agree to the kinds of raises that will make up for inflation on top of decades of falling wages,” Fain said Wednesday evening in a video on Facebook.
He added that workers at all three companies were prepared to strike and stay away from their factory stations as long as it took to win big gains. The UAW has never struck the three companies simultaneously before.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike will almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer, and hoped to have a deal that would avert a strike.

Full text: The world's largest carmaker dominates the sales of hybrid cars but has been slow to sell all-electric vehicles, alienating some customers and hurting sales.
Rachel Culin considered herself a Toyota loyalist, one of millions of people who appreciated the company's reliable and fuel-efficient hybrids. But she recently bought an electric Chevrolet Bolt to replace her Toyota Prius because the Japanese automaker had been too slow when it came to selling electric vehicles.
"Where are the options for those people who love Toyota?" Ms. Culin, a resident of Mesa, Ariz., said. "It's really sad."
Once the leading brand for environmentally conscious car owners, Toyota has failed to keep up with changing consumer preferences and a push by governments around the world to greatly reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change.
The company and the Japanese auto industry are facing the biggest business challenge they have confronted since becoming global giants in the 1980s. How they respond could determine whether they remain at the top of the auto industry or become afterthoughts.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, is the nucleus of power for the country's large auto industry. It has alliances with smaller automakers like Subaru and Mazda and wields enormous influence over government officials and industry groups. The company is also a major employer in the United States, with nearly 30,000 workers in Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and other states.
Its business decisions can have far-reaching economic and environmental implications. Toyota arguably did more to improve fuel efficiency and cut emissions than any other established automaker by pioneering hybrid cars that augment a gasoline engine with a battery and an electric motor. But having staked so much on hybrids, it has moved slowly to cars that produce no tailpipe emissions.
That has opened room for Tesla and BYD, a Chinese automaker, to challenge Toyota's dominance by offering appealing and affordable battery electric cars. Toyota has lost market share in the United States, and its sales in China have fallen.
Japanese carmakers have been here before. But last time they were the insurgents.
In the 1970s, with fuel prices soaring, Americans began replacing gas-guzzling cars with small, fuel-efficient Japanese models, challenging the dominance of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
Toyota's manufacturing methods became synonymous with manufacturing efficiency, and many factories adopted what became known as the "Toyota way" or "Toyota method."
Today, Toyota is the one learning from rivals. The company is adopting techniques from Tesla. In China, it has teamed up with BYD in the hope of absorbing its electric motor and battery technology.
"The stage of the battle has changed," said Sanshiro Fukao, a senior research fellow at the Itochu Research Institute, and "the Japanese auto industry in particular has been very slow to act."
Toyota may no longer be able to take its time.
During the pandemic, the global automotive market passed a milestone that caught the world's major automakers flat-footed. In 2022, sales of electric vehicles surged nearly 70 percent to 7.7 million, surpassing those of hybrid-electric vehicles for the first time as demand skyrocketed in China, according to IDTechEx, a market research consultancy.
Toyota remains highly profitable, earning $ 8.9 billion in the quarter that ended on June 30. Last year, it sold 10.5 million vehicles, eight times as many as Tesla. But fewer than 1 percent of the cars it sold were fully electric vehicles.
The absence of electric vehicles has been especially costly in China, the world's largest car market. In July, Toyota's sales in China were down over 15 percent from a year earlier.
In the United States, Toyota's sales have increased, but less than other automakers. From June to August, the company's share of the passenger car market slipped to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Cox Automotive.
The story is much the same for other Japanese automakers like Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Even Nissan, which began selling the Leaf electric car in 2010, has fallen behind, failing to produce a car that could rival Tesla's Model 3 in range, performance or design. Nissan accounted for less than 2 percent of the electric car market in the United States in the first half of the year. In China, it expects sales could drop by almost a quarter in the current fiscal year.
In May the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit organization, rated the 20 largest automakers on their progress toward zero emissions. Five of the six companies with the lowest scores were Japanese: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki.
Foreign automakers in China produced electric models designed to placate regulators rather than appeal to consumers, said Christopher Richter, senior research analyst at CLSA, an investment firm.
"They didn't make them as great as they could, and they were behind the learning curve," he said.
Toyota has tacitly acknowledged that it has fallen far behind Tesla and BYD. The decision in January by the Toyota scion Akio Toyoda to step down as chief executive was widely seen as a recognition that the company needed new leadership to navigate the transformation of the auto industry.
The sense of urgency was compounded by the Shanghai auto show in April, said Tatsuya Otani, a journalist who has spent decades reporting on the Japanese auto industry.
Chinese vehicles at the show featured onboard controls and entertainment options that made them look more like iPhones on wheels than traditional cars. Japanese executives were stunned to see how much progress their Chinese rivals had made, Mr. Otani said.
Toyota declined to make executives available for interviews.
The only all-electric Toyota sold in the United States is the bZ4X, a sport utility vehicle that the company recalled last year because faulty bolts could cause the wheels to fall off -- an embarrassing misstep. In China, the company also offers an electric sedan, the BZ3. (Toyota's Lexus division sells one fully electric model in the United States and two in some countries.)
On returning from Shanghai, Toyota executives ordered employees to rush out a presentation on the company's plans for its electric vehicle production. Toyota shared the plan less than two weeks before the company's annual meeting, where shareholders, angered by the slow progress on battery-powered cars, proposed a resolution pushing the company to disclose its climate change lobbying.
The measure did not pass, but the rare expression of dissent was an indication of how Toyota, once praised as a paragon of clean tech, had fallen out of favor.
"They just are not moving quickly enough to E.V.s at a time when that is where the market and the planet are going," said Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, which owns more than $ 100 million in Toyota stock through its pension funds and backed the resolution.
The company has disputed that characterization, arguing that hybrid cars can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions more and faster than battery electric vehicles, which remain too expensive for many buyers.
Factoring in a cleaner manufacturing process for hybrid cars and the limited availability of critical battery materials, such as lithium, hybrids are a safer short-term bet, Toyota executives have said in recent public statements.
In Washington, the company has called for less stringent auto emission limits, saying in July that a proposed new standard "underestimates key challenges including the scarcity of minerals to make batteries, the fact that these minerals are not mined or refined in the U.S., the inadequate infrastructure and the high cost" of electric vehicles.
"When they do math, the effect on the environment is far greater for hybrids," said Jeffrey Liker, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on Toyota. "In addition to that, they make a whole lot more money."
Sales of all-electric vehicles are growing faster than hybrids. But some analysts predict that hybrid sales will surge as would-be electric vehicle buyers worry that the public charging network is inadequate and unreliable. If that happens, Toyota's strategy could be vindicated.
Anita Rajan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in the United States, said Japanese automakers were biding their time until they could make electric cars that were as reliable and affordable as the gasoline vehicles.
"I don't know if there's a benefit in being first to market with these vehicles," Ms. Rajan said. "I think it's how you're entering the market and the thoughtfulness that you show for your customers."
In Toyota's home market, consumers have shown little appetite for battery electric cars, and the government has been reluctant to aggressively push for change in a profitable industry.
That could be a problem for Japanese carmakers, which have traditionally honed their technology at home before marketing it abroad, said Kazutoshi Tominaga, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which has worked with Japan's trade ministry to shape national electric vehicle policy.
"If Japan, as a market, doesn't shift to electrification, we don't have a place to test the product," he said.
Yet BYD has opened 10 dealerships in Japan and plans to have 100 by the end of 2025. The company went so far as to release a video in August calling on Chinese automakers to "demolish the old legends," widely interpreted as a reference to Japanese and Western automakers.
On a recent Sunday, prospective buyers waited patiently to take a BYD S.U.V. for a spin around the Tokyo neighborhood Ikebukuro. Salespeople were quick to point out the car's eligibility for thousands of dollars in subsidies from Japan's trade ministry, which has allocated $ 90 billion to promote battery electric cars.
Two nearby Toyota showrooms were largely empty.
Customers are "satisfied" with the current options, said Masaki Nagasawa, the deputy manager of a Toyota dealership in Tokyo. "For people who are wavering, subsidies are an incentive to buy," but most customers are anxious about electric cars' range and prefer hybrids, he said.
Toyota has said it is working on new production techniques and innovative battery technology that would increase its cars' range and reduce the time it takes to charge them. The company has said that its lineup will include 10 new all-electric vehicles by 2026 and that it will aim to sell 3.5 million of them annually by 2030.
Speaking on Wednesday in Tokyo after the unveiling of a new luxury plug-in hybrid vehicle, Simon Humphries, who is in charge of branding and design and is a director on Toyota's board, said the company was releasing new electric options "month by month, year by year."
But, he added, while there is an "urgency" to introduce new battery-powered cars, "there's urgency in every segment."
Electric vehicle companies are moving fast.
Tesla is on track to sell nearly two million electric cars this year and is building a factory in Mexico, where it is expected to make a car that sells for around $ 25,000. In the United States, the company's Model 3 sedan already sells for about as much as a comparably equipped Toyota Camry after federal and state incentives are taken into account.
BYD is rapidly expanding outside China, including in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Its extensive electric lineup includes models that are cheaper than Toyota's most affordable sedans and a mammoth luxury S.U.V. that sells for around $ 150,000.
Just as Apple, Google and Samsung quickly displaced Nokia and BlackBerry in the mobile phone business, some analysts say, Tesla and BYD could be so far ahead in making electric cars by 2026 that Toyota might struggle to catch up.
But Japanese officials are more sanguine.
People own cars longer, so the transition will not be as fast as with cellphones, said Naoki Kobayashi, a deputy director of the trade ministry's automobile division.
He acknowledges that Toyota faces a big challenge, but, he added, "unlike with smartphones, we've still got time."

For Some Jobs, Walmart Will Start Cutting Pay
Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, is making adjustments to its pay scale that will mean some new store workers, like those fetching online orders, begin at a lower hourly pay rate than they would have a few months ago. The change, which became effective in July and was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, will create consistency in starting hourly pay across individual stores, said a spokeswoman, Anne Hatfield. The exception would be jobs that require a higher skill set, like those in the deli, bakery and auto care departments. Ms. Hatfield said there would be no pay cuts for current employees. Walmart Inc. announced in January that U.S. workers would get pay raises the following month, increasing starting wages to between $ 14 and $ 19 an hour. Starting wages currently ranged between $ 12 and $ 18 an hour, depending on location. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Honda Says It Will Adopt Tesla Chargers for E.V.'s
Honda will join Ford, G.M. and other electric vehicle makers in adopting Tesla's charging technology, the company announced Thursday. The company said it would use Tesla's fast-charging port for its E.V. models that go on sale in North American starting in 2025. Ford and General Motors announced similar deals with Tesla in June, and electric truck maker Rivian followed suit later that month. Analysts say that Tesla's North American Charging Standard connector and cord are much lighter and easier to handle than the Combined Charging System used by the rest of the auto industry. Tesla has about 17,000 Supercharger stations in the U.S. There are about 54,000 public charging stations in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy, but many charge much more slowly than the Tesla stations. As more and more automakers switch to Tesla's connector, experts say it appears Tesla is on its way to becoming the industrywide standard. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Online Gig Work Grows, But With Few Protections
Online gig work is growing globally, particularly in the developing world, creating an important source of employment for women and young people in poorer countries where jobs are scarce, according to a World Bank report released Thursday. The report estimates the number of global online gig workers at as many as 435 million people and says demand for gig work increased 41 percent between 2016 and the first quarter of 2023. That increase is generating concern, though, among worker rights advocates about the lack of job protections in the gig economy. While location-based gig services like Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit require labor like moving and delivery, online gig assignments can be largely done at home. Namita Datta, lead author of the report, said online gig work provided women and underprivileged youth "a very interesting opportunity to participate in the labor market." ASSOCIATED PRESS

High Hopes for a 'Prodigy' Designer's Debut: [Style Desk]

Full text: Peter Do held up a pair of Helmut Lang jeans by their pockets, pulling them against his waist. The denim was off-white, splattered with white paint and softened with age. I'd already reached out to feel the fabric, pinching it between my fingers, when Mr. Do said that he'd never washed them.
"Maybe that's kind of gross to some people," he said. "I'm just scared of destroying them."
Ten years ago, he'd bought them at a vintage store for about $ 300, he said, and now he was showing them off in the Helmut Lang headquarters, in the meatpacking district of Manhattan. Mr. Do had arrived at the company in May, fresh-faced at 32 and ready to revive the brand as its creative director.
Mr. Do felt attached to the jeans in the way people often do to denim that simply fits very well. He wore them while interviewing for the job and, after he got it, decided to recreate the long slim cut in his new collection.
This is essentially Mr. Do's objective: He wants to reintroduce Helmut Lang, once considered among the coolest, cleverest, most modern labels in fashion, and not just "for the sake of doing it," he said. "Even when I'm not at the brand anymore, I hope I built a strong enough foundation that it goes on."
Mr. Lang, a self-taught designer from Austria, was early to selling luxury jeans. Beginning in Paris in the mid-1980s, he became known for clothes that were utilitarian and witty. He popularized slender, androgynous suits. He used sheer layering and cutouts to suggest sex in a kind of unsexy way, the anti-va-va-voom, like a nipple popping out of a men's tank top.
It can be hard to feel interesting while getting dressed -- to push the envelope of style without feeling like you're wearing a costume or sacrificing a tailored fit -- but Mr. Lang made it easier. At least for those who could afford his clothes (dresses and jackets started at about $ 700, or $ 1,740 today).
Yet after Mr. Lang left the company in 2005, and despite efforts by its new owners and several new designers, the brand never recaptured its Y2K-era relevance.
Mr. Do is now feeling the pressure to deliver. He will introduce his first Helmut Lang collection on Friday, and it is the most anticipated show of New York Fashion Week. Although if any young designer can revive the label, it's him -- or so the thinking goes. "I'm running on adrenaline," Mr. Do said, six days before the runway show, sitting on a bench on the waterfront outside his apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. It was a perfect morning. The sun inched over the high-rise condos, casting a shadow across half of Mr. Do's face.
It was an apt image: As a designer, he had been split in half this year, dividing attention between Helmut Lang and his namesake label, which plans to have a runway show in Paris and release a Banana Republic collaboration this month.
This is what often happens when celebrated emerging designers are successful: self-bifurcation. They build up their own labels, sometimes from scraps, then get recruited to run bigger brands with in-house ateliers and merchandising teams and corporate overlords. They delegate more but sleep less. Earlier this summer, Mr. Do began carrying two cellphones, one for each job.
"I feel like I'm crashing at some point," he said. Still, he smiled.
'Like a Lightning Rod'
On the note of Mr. Do's smile: He doesn't typically show it in public. He wears a face mask when being photographed or attending industry events. Not while working in the studio, however, or while walking his dog, Uni, a Shiba Inu, around his neighborhood with his longtime roommate Lydia Sukato, the operations director at Peter Do, and his boyfriend Matthew Jamison, the design director at Le Labo Fragrances.
Mr. Do only hides in public. It is a less extreme emulation of one of his heroes, Martin Margiela, the avant-garde designer who declined photographs entirely (along with interviews and post-show runway bows).
Still, when people now ask Mr. Do why he wears a mask, he has somewhat lost the plot.
"There isn't one single answer that I can give," he said, acknowledging a slight Streisand effect. "I just wanted people to talk about the work and dissect the work. I don't really understand why it's such an important thing. Maybe it backfired."
Maybe not. There's ample discussion of Mr. Do's work among his online fan base, including on TikTok, which seems like an evolution of Mr. Do's early adoption of Tumblr, where he posted his work while still a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology. (On Tumblr, he met many of the friends he would team up with and hire in 2018, when Peter Do was founded.)
Mr. Do is known for dramatic, elegant silhouettes: billowing shirtdresses and oversize blazers and coats with exposed backs, often in neutral or muted colors, as if designed under the assumption that a bold shape can outshout a bold color on any day. Despite the enthusiasm for the brand among young fashion people, these are not clothes for cool kids. Peter Do offers a grown-up, intellectual glamour, made to last forever. (They're priced that way, too: Dresses and jackets exceed $ 3,000; jeans run more than $ 800.)
"He came onto the scene like a lightning rod," said the designer Phillip Lim, who founded his brand in New York almost 20 years ago. "Was he born with tailoring chalk in his hands?"
Mr. Do, more confessional millennial than ironic zoomer, once compared designing a collection to making pho with his father, a former army chef who brought his family to Philadelphia from Vietnam when Mr. Do was 14.
"It took hard work and lots of patience," Mr. Do wrote in a letter to the attendees of his spring 2022 runway show. "There were hours of simmering and waiting to reduce all to a perfect and clear broth." Mr. Do began cooking more for his brother and mother, a nail technician, after his father died when Mr. Do was a teenager. His mother, who still lives in Philadelphia, later sold her salon; the brothers, both now living in New York, send her some money every month.
While Mr. Do was considering taking the job at Helmut Lang -- he'd also been weighing an opportunity with another luxury brand, though he wouldn't reveal the name of the house -- he sought advice over dinners with Mr. Lim and Ruba Abu-Nimah, a creative director, formerly of Tiffany & Company.
"This poor, poor brand, Helmut Lang, had just been beaten and battered to oblivion," said Ms. Abu-Nimah, who still sometimes wears a white suede vintage Helmut Lang hoodie, albeit on days when there is close to zero percent risk of getting it dirty. "He will be able, I'm pretty sure, to take things out of the archive and re-contextualize them for 2023, 2024. I think that's actually a very difficult thing to do. Clearly no one else has managed to do it"
Classic Cars
One of the largest private collections of Helmut Lang's work is owned by a New York City stylist named David Casavant, who began acquiring the pieces -- upward of 500 of them, he estimates -- as a teenager.
Dua Lipa has worn one of those nipple-revealing tanks from Mr. Casavant's archive; Rihanna has worn ripped jeans; Solange has worn a harness. But generally the most requested pieces are Mr. Lang's high-quality basics.
"As basic as it gets: a sheer tank top or T-shirt or crop top," said Mr. Casavant, who was surprised to find this was also the case at a sale he organized with Dover Street Market last year. "The jeans sold like crazy. I think people keep coming back to that because it can be weirdly hard to find something so simple now, but done the right way."
Mr. Do recognizes that part of his job at Helmut Lang is to continue offering these high-quality wardrobe staples.
"Beyond the show, beyond the fantasy that you're going to sell, at the end of the day, these are beautiful functional products that people even outside of fashion, like my mom, can enjoy," he said. The prices will start at $ 95 for T-shirts and tank tops, climbing to about $ 3,000 for specialty outerwear items. The sizes will range from 3XS to 3XL.
Helmut Lang, which is owned by Fast Retailing, a conglomerate that also owns Uniqlo and Theory, has tried to commercialize excitement around the Lang archives before. In 2017, Helmut Lang began reissuing small capsule collections of old pieces, like a silver moto jacket from 1999 and paint-splattered bluejeans from 1998. At the time, these capsules were released alongside new designs made by Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air, then Helmut Lang's "designer in residence."
When Mr. Do went into the archives, he was struck by Mr. Lang's "go big or go home" approach to color, he said. One thing the designers have in common is a perception that their color palettes are super-minimal, drenched in black or bleached in white.
There was no color in Peter Do's fall 2023 collection. But at Helmut Lang, he has embraced color -- color-blocking in particular, in a way that seems reminiscent of Phoebe Philo's Céline, where Mr. Do worked as an assistant designer for two years after being awarded the LVMH Graduate Prize in 2014.
One recurring color in the new collection is taxicab yellow. Mr. Lang famously advertised on the tops of taxicabs. Mr. Do printed out photos of those ads, crushed and crumpled and deconstructed them, then transferred the results onto chiffon minidresses, prewrinkled slinky pants and denim jackets.
Mr. Do also sent vintage seatbelts to a factory, ordering recreations in magenta. A long version can wrap around a sharp-shouldered blazer -- part harness, part military sash -- while a short version can be buckled across the tops of shoes. The effect is reminiscent of some Helmut Lang looks from 1994, in which slices of magenta peeked out from underneath black layers, running along the sides of pants or dolloped on the shoulders of a tank top.
In short, cars were on Mr. Do's mind. Even while exploring someone else's archive, he was mining his own personal memories.
"When I first moved to Philadelphia, when I was 14, that was the first time I was suddenly in cars a lot," he said. "My dad had a van for construction jobs. My mom had a Honda, and she'd drive me to school."
Growing up in Vietnam, he would mostly bike or walk, he said. In the United States, cars represented a new sense of freedom and flexibility that he felt like people took for granted. "Everyone has a car, it's very normal," he said. "I look at cars as something really magical and beautiful, still to this day."
Although Mr. Do has never learned how to drive.
'A New Label'
On his first day at Helmut Lang, Mr. Do sat in a meeting meant to help him get to know his new team.
He recalled that one woman said, matter-of-factly: "'You're going to change the logo."'
"'Well, slowly, yeah," Mr. Do replied. "'There's a new direction, and I want a new label that signifies a new chapter."'
The woman just nodded, Mr. Do remembered, and he asked her what was wrong. "She was like, 'You're like my fifth creative director. I've been through this five times."'
It was a reminder of how quickly designers can be churned through a game of musical chairs that never really ends.
"This industry can be quite unforgiving with expectations," Phillip Lim said. "As talented as Peter is -- like a prodigy -- he's a human being. It takes time."
The expectations are undeniably high; the Helmut Lang show is the first on the official New York Fashion Week calendar. "We always like to open with a bang, and we think this is a big bang moment," said Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. "You want to come out with Beyoncé."
Mr. Do isn't a fixture on the industry's social circuit. He doesn't often go to parties or dinners, unless contractually obligated. Ms. Abu-Nimah referred to him as "the anti-industry guy."
"All he cares about is making beautiful things," she said. "He's almost very naïve. And when I use the word 'naïve,' I use it in the most positive sense. He's like a soft rebel."
Mr. Lang wasn't so different. He kept the fashion industry at arm's length. Even at the height of his career, when he was nominated for three major awards by the CFDA, he did not bother to show up to the ceremony, preferring, according to a 2000 profile in The New Yorker, to stay working in his studio that night.
When he was offered the top design job at Balenciaga in 1997, he turned it down in favor of making jeans under his own name. "It's about America," he said at the time. "It's not about couture."
When he left his brand in 2005, Mr. Lang left fashion entirely, shifting into a career as an artist. (Through his studio, he declined to comment for this article.) He once told The New Yorker that "in Europe they still respect the privacy of the artist. Here, when you have success, it's like you belong to the public."
Mr. Do worries about the day he might belong to the public. He already gave up his name to his brand -- much like Mr. Lang, who will forever be associated with fashion despite not working in the industry for the last 18 years. Mr. Do refers to his namesake label as "PD," instead of speaking of himself in third person.
His time is not his own. One night recently, he said, he arrived home so exhausted from work that he found himself zoning out while his boyfriend, who wears a silver "Do" necklace around his neck, was talking about his own job. "I'm so sorry," Mr. Do said he told him. "I want to be there for you, but my battery is so low. Can we talk about this tomorrow?"
"I like my private life," Mr. Do said on the waterfront. "I like to walk my dog in peace. I want to be in a restaurant and have a meal and be a normal person.
"For me, that always freaks me out, that someday maybe that freedom will be taken away," Mr. Do said, returning to the issue of concealing his face with a mask.
"It's something that I have left that I have for myself. And I want to protect it as long as I can."

Peter Do held up a pair of Helmut Lang jeans by their pockets, pulling them against his waist. The denim was off-white, splattered with white paint and softened with age. I’d already reached out to feel the fabric, pinching it between my fingers, when Do said that he’d never washed them.
“Maybe that’s kind of gross to some people,” he said. “I’m just scared of destroying them.”
Ten years ago, he’d bought them at a vintage store for about $300, he said, and now he was showing them off in the Helmut Lang headquarters, in the meatpacking district of Manhattan. Do had arrived at the company in May, fresh-faced at 32 and ready to revive the brand as its creative director. Do felt attached to the jeans in the way people often do to denim that simply fits very well. He wore them while interviewing for the job and later decided to recreate the long slim cut in his new collection.
This is essentially Do’s objective: He wants to reintroduce Helmut Lang, once considered among fashion’s coolest, cleverest, most modern labels, and not just “for the sake of doing it,” he said. “Even when I’m not at the brand anymore, I hope I built a strong enough foundation that it goes on.”
Lang, a self-taught designer from Austria, was early to selling luxury jeans. Beginning in Paris in the mid-1980s, he became known for clothes that were utilitarian and witty. He popularized slender, androgynous suits. He used sheer layering and cutouts to suggest sex in a kind of unsexy way, the anti-va-va-voom, like a nipple popping out of a men’s tank top.
It can be hard to feel interesting while getting dressed — to push the envelope of style without feeling as if you’re wearing a costume or sacrificing a tailored fit — but Lang made it easier. At least for those who could afford his clothes (dresses and jackets started at about $700, or $1,740 today).
Yet after Lang left the company in 2005, and despite efforts by its new owners and several new designers, the brand never recaptured its Y2K-era relevance.
Do is feeling the pressure to deliver. He will introduce his first Helmut Lang collection Friday, and it is the most anticipated show of New York Fashion Week. Although if any young designer can revive the label, it’s him — or so the thinking goes. “I’m running on adrenaline,” Do said, six days before the runway show, sitting on a bench on the waterfront outside his apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. It was a perfect morning. The sun inched over the high-rise condos, casting a shadow across half of Do’s face.
It was an apt image: As a designer, he had been split in half this year, dividing attention between Helmut Lang and his namesake label, which plans to have a runway show in Paris and release a Banana Republic collaboration this month.
This is what often happens when celebrated emerging designers are successful: self-bifurcation. They build up their own labels, sometimes from scraps, then get recruited to run bigger brands with in-house ateliers and merchandising teams and corporate overlords. They delegate more but sleep less. This summer, Do began carrying two cellphones, one for each job. “I feel like I’m crashing at some point,” he said. Still, he smiled.
‘Like a Lightning Rod’
On the note of Do’s smile: He doesn’t typically show it in public. He wears a face mask when being photographed or attending industry events. Not while working in the studio, however, or while walking his dog, Uni, a Shiba Inu, around his neighborhood with his longtime roommate, Lydia Sukato, the operations director at Peter Do, and his boyfriend, Matthew Jamison, the design director at Le Labo Fragrances.
Do only hides in public. It is a less extreme emulation of one of his heroes, Martin Margiela, an avant-garde designer who declined photographs entirely.
Still, when people ask Do why he wears a mask, he has somewhat lost the plot. “There isn’t one single answer that I can give,” he said, acknowledging a slight Streisand effect. “I just wanted people to talk about the work and dissect the work. I don’t really understand why it’s such an important thing. Maybe it backfired.”
Maybe not. There’s ample discussion of Do’s work among his online fan base, including on TikTok, which seems like an evolution of Do’s early adoption of Tumblr, where he posted his work while still a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
Do is known for dramatic, elegant silhouettes: billowing shirtdresses and oversize blazers and coats with exposed backs, often in neutral or muted colors, as if designed under the assumption that a bold shape can outshout a bold color on any day. Despite the enthusiasm for the brand among young fashion people, these are not clothes for cool kids. Do offers a grown-up, intellectual glamour, made to last forever. (They’re priced that way, too: Dresses and jackets exceed $3,000; jeans run more than $800.)
“He came onto the scene like a lightning rod,” said designer Phillip Lim, who founded his brand in New York almost 20 years ago. “Was he born with tailoring chalk in his hands?”
Do, more confessional millennial than ironic zoomer, once compared designing a collection to making pho with his father, a former army chef who brought his family to Philadelphia from Vietnam when Do was 14. “It took hard work and lots of patience,” Do wrote to the attendees of his spring 2022 runway show. “There were hours of simmering and waiting to reduce all to a perfect and clear broth.” Do began cooking more for his brother and mother, a nail technician, after his father died when Do was a teenager. His mother, who still lives in Philadelphia, later sold her salon; the brothers, both now living in New York, send her money every month.
While Do was considering taking the job at Helmut Lang — he’d also been weighing an opportunity with another luxury brand — he sought advice over dinners with Lim and Ruba Abu-Nimah, a creative director, formerly of Tiffany & Co.
“This poor, poor brand, Helmut Lang, had just been beaten and battered to oblivion,” said Abu-Nimah, who still sometimes wears a white suede vintage Helmut Lang hoodie, albeit on days when there is close to zero percent risk of getting it dirty. “He will be able, I’m pretty sure, to take things out of the archive and re-contextualize them for 2023, 2024. I think that’s actually a very difficult thing to do. Clearly no one else has managed to do it.”
Classic Cars
One of the largest private collections of Helmut Lang’s work is owned by New York City stylist David Casavant, who began acquiring the pieces — upward of 500 of them, he estimates — as a teenager. Dua Lipa has worn one of those nipple-revealing tanks from Casavant’s archive; Rihanna has worn ripped jeans; Solange has worn a harness. But generally the most requested pieces are Lang’s high-quality basics.
“As basic as it gets: a sheer tank top or T-shirt or crop top,” said Casavant, who was surprised to find this was also the case at a sale he organized with Dover Street Market last year. “The jeans sold like crazy. I think people keep coming back to that because it can be weirdly hard to find something so simple now, but done the right way.”
Do recognizes that part of his job at Helmut Lang is to continue offering these high-quality wardrobe staples.
“Beyond the show, beyond the fantasy that you’re going to sell, at the end of the day, these are beautiful functional products that people even outside of fashion, like my mom, can enjoy,” he said. The prices will start at $95 for T-shirts and tank tops, climbing to about $3,000 for specialty outerwear items. The sizes will range from 3XS to 3XL.
Helmut Lang, which is owned by Fast Retailing, a conglomerate that also owns Uniqlo and Theory, has tried to commercialize excitement around the Lang archives before. In 2017, Helmut Lang began reissuing small capsule collections of old pieces, like a silver moto jacket from 1999 and paint-splattered bluejeans from 1998. At the time, these capsules were released alongside new designs made by Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air, then Helmut Lang’s “designer in residence.”
When Do went into the archives, he was struck by Lang’s “go big or go home” approach to color, he said. One thing the designers have in common is a perception that their color palettes are super-minimal, drenched in black or bleached in white. There was no color in Peter Do’s fall 2023 collection. But at Helmut Lang, he has embraced color — color-blocking in particular, in a way that seems reminiscent of Phoebe Philo’s Céline, where Do worked as an assistant designer for two years after being awarded the LVMH Graduate Prize in 2014.
One recurring color in the new collection is taxicab yellow. Lang advertised on the tops of taxicabs. Do printed out photos of those ads, crushed and crumpled and deconstructed them, then transferred the results onto chiffon minidresses, prewrinkled slinky pants and denim jackets.
Do also sent vintage seatbelts to a factory, ordering recreations in magenta. A long version can wrap around a sharp-shouldered blazer — part harness, part military sash — while a short version can be buckled across the tops of shoes.
In short, cars were on his mind. Even while exploring someone else’s archive, he was mining his own personal memories. “When I first moved to Philadelphia, when I was 14, that was the first time I was suddenly in cars a lot,” he said. “My dad had a van for construction jobs. My mom had a Honda, and she’d drive me to school.”
Growing up in Vietnam, he would mostly bike or walk, he said. In the United States, cars represented a new sense of freedom and flexibility that he felt like people took for granted. “Everyone has a car, it’s very normal,” he said. “I look at cars as something really magical and beautiful, still to this day.”
But Do has never learned to drive.
‘A New Label’
On his first day at Helmut Lang, Do sat in a meeting meant to help him get to know his new team. He recalled that one woman said, matter-of-factly, “‘You’re going to change the logo.’”
“‘Well, slowly, yeah,” Do replied. “‘There’s a new direction, and I want a new label that signifies a new chapter.’”
The woman just nodded, Do remembered, and he asked her what was wrong. “She was like: ‘You’re like my fifth creative director. I’ve been through this five times.’”
It was a reminder of how quickly designers can be churned through a game of musical chairs that never really ends.
“This industry can be quite unforgiving with expectations,” Lim said. “As talented as Peter is — like a prodigy — he’s a human being. It takes time.”
The expectations are undeniably high; the Helmut Lang show is the first on the official New York Fashion Week calendar. “We always like to open with a bang, and we think this is a big bang moment,” said Steven Kolb, the CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “You want to come out with Beyoncé.”
Do isn’t a fixture on the industry’s social circuit. He doesn’t often go to parties or dinners, unless contractually obligated. Abu-Nimah referred to him as “the anti-industry guy.”
“All he cares about is making beautiful things,” she said. “He’s almost very naïve. And when I use the word ‘naïve,’ I use it in the most positive sense. He’s like a soft rebel.” Lang wasn’t so different. He kept the fashion industry at arm’s length. Even at the height of his career, when he was nominated for three major awards by the CFDA, he did not bother to show up at the ceremony, preferring, according to a 2000 profile in The New Yorker, to stay working in his studio that night.
When he was offered the top design job at Balenciaga in 1997, he turned it down in favor of making jeans under his own name. “It’s about America,” he said at the time. “It’s not about couture.”
When he left his brand in 2005, Lang left fashion entirely, shifting into a career as an artist. (Through his studio, he declined to comment for this article.) He once told The New Yorker that “in Europe they still respect the privacy of the artist. Here, when you have success, it’s like you belong to the public.”
Do worries about the day he might belong to the public. He already gave up his name to his brand — much like Lang, who will forever be associated with fashion despite not working in the industry for the past 18 years. Do refers to his namesake label as “PD,” instead of speaking of himself in third person.
His time is not his own. One night recently, he said, he arrived home so exhausted from work that he found himself zoning out while his boyfriend, who wears a silver “Do” necklace around his neck, was talking about his own job. “‘I’m so sorry,’” Do said he told him. “‘I want to be there for you, but my battery is so low. Can we talk about this tomorrow?’”
“I like my private life,” Do said on the waterfront. “I like to walk my dog in peace. I want to be in a restaurant and have a meal and be a normal person.
“For me, that always freaks me out, that someday maybe that freedom will be taken away,” Do said, returning to the issue of concealing his face with a mask. “It’s something that I have left that I have for myself. And I want to protect it as long as I can.”

U.A.W. and Big 3 Face Sizable Gap To Avoid a Strike: [National Desk]

Full text: With their contract expiring Sept. 14, the United Auto Workers and the companies are far apart in talks. A walkout could take a big economic toll.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers have less than two weeks to negotiate a new labor contract, and a strike of some sort seems increasingly likely.
The union's president, Shawn Fain, has primed rank-and-file members to be prepared to walk off the job if the union's long list of demands for improved wages and benefits are not met.
A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. G.M. workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three -- a step the union has never taken but one Mr. Fain has said he is willing to call for this year -- could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
"If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation," said Patrick Anderson, the chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Mich.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an E.V.-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tailwind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Biden has declared that "the U.A.W. deserves a contract that sustains the middle class" and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the U.A.W. has withheld an endorsement of his re-election bid so far, partly because of concern over the union's share of E.V.-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire on Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Mr. Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline -- the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the U.A.W. presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
"President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there's going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike," said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. "The U.A.W. leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it's pretty unlikely there won't be a strike."
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $ 859 million and manufacturers' losses of $ 989 million, according to estimates by Mr. Anderson's firm.
In August, Mr. Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making a third less than veteran workers. Mr. Fain suggested as much as a 40 percent wage increase, noting that the chief executives of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
"The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be," Mr. Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Mr. Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were "insulting" to the U.A.W.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9 percent wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker's income by 15 percent over the four-year contract. Mr. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker's income over a long period.
The U.A.W. and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Mr. Fain said that G.M. and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union's proposals, and that the U.A.W. had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
"I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I'm fed up," he said. "Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will."
G.M. said it was "surprised by and strongly refutes" the charges in the N.L.R.B. complaint. "We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress," Gerald Johnson, G.M.'s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was "disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining," the company said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement."
In recent weeks, workers have organized several dozen rallies and other gatherings to prepare for picketing. "I think the membership is energized," said Christine Bostic, a battery tester at a G.M. electric vehicle plant in Detroit. "The facts are on our side. If it comes to a strike, I'm ready for that."
To soften the impact of a stoppage, the union has amassed a strike fund of $ 825 million. It plans to pay striking workers $ 500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums while they are out of work.
In recent days, Mr. Fain has joined the union's negotiating teams in their talks with each of the automakers, an unusual step. Normally, the U.A.W. president does not take a direct role until the final days or hours of negotiations.
On Wednesday, he took part in discussions with Stellantis, where tensions between the two sides have been high. When Stellantis responded to Mr. Fain's demands with a list of cost concessions it wanted from the union, Mr. Fain took to Facebook to denounce them, dropping the document into a wastebasket.
Decades ago, when the U.A.W. had more than a million members and the Big Three -- G.M., Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis -- had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the United States economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. G.M., Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 U.A.W. workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40 percent of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.
But the union entered this year's talks in a much stronger negotiating position than it had in years. In the past, the Detroit companies were struggling badly against foreign rivals that operate nonunion plants in the South, like Toyota and Honda, and had a significant cost advantage. In most of the last several contracts, G.M., Ford and Stellantis had to get concessions on wages and benefits to survive.
Over the last 10 years, however, all three companies have rung up record profits, thanks in part to the concessions they won from the union as well as the shift in consumer preferences to high-margin trucks and large sport utility vehicles.
In the first half of this year, Ford made $ 3.7 billion and G.M. made $ 5 billion. Stellantis reported profits of 11 billion euros (about $ 11.9 billion).
In the past, the U.A.W. has chosen one company -- it was G.M. four years ago -- as the "target" to focus on in the talks. Mr. Fain has said the union could target all three companies this time around, but many analysts think the union will eventually choose Stellantis. In addition to the strains between the company and the union, their talks involve a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that Stellantis has idled and that the union wants the company to reopen.
Getting Stellantis to reopen the plant is a critical task for Mr. Fain. Four years ago, G.M. closed a plant in Ohio and the U.A.W. failed in its efforts to push the company to reopen it. In his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Fain promised members that his tougher approach would prove successful this time.
The union could get a hand in this battle from the federal government. On Thursday, the Energy Department said it had made $ 2 billion in grants and $ 10 billion in loans available to auto companies to convert existing factories that build gasoline-powered cars and trucks into plants that produce hybrid and electric vehicles.
Stellantis, like G.M. and Ford, aims to introduce several more electric models over the next few years and will probably have to retool some plants to make them. It is already building a battery plant in Indiana for its E.V. push.
Mr. Fiorani suggested that Stellantis could decide to overhaul the Belvidere plant to make electric models. "Stellantis could find a product to go in there," he said. "For the U.A.W. to truly win something, though, it has to be electric vehicles that Stellantis would plan on making for several years."

A strike against one of the companies, especially a prolonged stoppage, could send an economic jolt through several Midwestern states and crimp the profits of General Motors, Ford Motor or Stellantis. GM workers walked out for 40 days in 2019 before reaching an agreement.
A strike against all three — a step the union has never taken but one Fain has said he is willing to call for this year — could have a noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.
“If that happens, even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation,” said Patrick Anderson, the CEO of the Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Michigan.
The talks are playing out as automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to transition to electric vehicles, which require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The terms of the new contract will determine how both autoworkers and the companies fare in an EV-centric industry.
At the same time, significant wage and benefit gains could provide a tail wind for a union movement that has been gaining strength across several industries.
There are political stakes as well. President Joe Biden has declared that “the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class” and has named a White House liaison to the union and the automakers. But the UAW has withheld an endorsement of his reelection bid so far, partly because of concern over the union’s share of EV-related jobs created with federal subsidies.
An agreement before the contracts expire Sept. 14 is still possible, and talks could continue beyond that date without a walkout. But Fain has repeatedly said he views Sept. 14 as a deadline — the day a strike could begin. He was elected to the UAW presidency last year as an insurgent, ousting the incumbent on a vow to take a more combative and confrontational approach in the talks than his recent predecessors.
“President Fain has declared war, and that usually means there’s going to be a battle, and that battle would be a strike,” said Sam Fiorani, the vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions, a market researcher. “The UAW leadership is in a position now where they have to prove to the members that they are fighting for them, so it’s pretty unlikely there won’t be a strike.”
The auto industry as a whole, including foreign-owned companies with operations in the United States, makes up about 3% of the country’s gross domestic product. A 10-day strike against the three Detroit automakers would result in total wage losses of $859 million and manufacturers’ losses of $989 million, according to estimates by Anderson’s firm.
In August, Fain sent each company a list of demands, including higher wages, improved benefits, a resumption of regular cost-of-living wage bumps to ward off the impact of inflation and an end to a wage structure that leaves newer hires making one-third less than veteran workers. Fain suggested as much as a 40% wage increase, noting that the CEOs of each of the companies had their compensation packages rise substantially in the last four years.
He also called for contract provisions that would require the automakers to pay workers to do community service if their plant closes, describing it as a way to deter the companies from shuttering factories and to protect towns and local economies from being ravaged by the loss of a major employer.
“The manufacturers can absolutely afford some of those demands, but the more they get, the less competitive the companies are going to be,” Fiorani said.
In a video message streamed on Facebook on Thursday, however, Fain said the union and the automakers remained far apart. Ford, he said, offered wage increases and other provisions that were “insulting” to the UAW.
In a statement, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase and one-time lump-sum payments that, combined, would increase a worker’s income by 15% over the four-year contract. Fain said lump-sum payments helped but did not improve a worker’s income over a long period.
The UAW and Ford are also at odds over profit-sharing bonuses, the use of temporary workers, cost-of-living wage increases, retiree health care and several other matters.
Fain said that GM and Stellantis had not provided counteroffers to the union’s proposals and that the UAW had filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the two companies were not negotiating in good faith.
“I know this update is infuriating, and believe me when I say I’m fed up,” he said. “Our goal is not to strike. Our goal is to bargain a fair contract, but if we have to strike to win economic and social justice, we will.”
GM said it was “surprised by and strongly refutes” the charges in the NLRB complaint. “We have been hyper-focused on negotiating directly and in good faith with the U.A.W. and are making progress,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s vice president of global manufacturing, said in a statement.
Stellantis was “disappointed to learn that Mr. Fain is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining,” the company said in a statement. “We will vigorously defend this charge when the time comes, but right now, we are more focused on continuing to bargain in good faith for a new agreement.”
In recent weeks, workers have organized several dozen rallies and other gatherings to prepare for picketing. “I think the membership is energized,” said Christine Bostic, a battery tester at a GM electric vehicle plant in Detroit. “The facts are on our side. If it comes to a strike, I’m ready for that.”
To soften the impact of a stoppage, the union has amassed a strike fund of $825 million. It plans to pay striking workers $500 a week and cover their health insurance premiums while they are out of work.
In recent days, Fain joined the union’s negotiating teams in their talks with each of the automakers, an unusual step. Normally, the UAW president does not take a direct role until the final days or hours of negotiations.
On Wednesday, he took part in discussions with Stellantis, where tensions between the two sides have been high. When Stellantis responded to Fain’s demands with a list of cost concessions it wanted from the union, Fain took to Facebook to denounce them, dropping the document into a wastebasket.
Decades ago, when the UAW had more than 1 million members and the Big Three — GM, Ford and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis — had almost no foreign competition, a strike by the union could shut down a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
Today, the union is much smaller. GM, Ford and Stellantis employ about 150,000 UAW workers, and those companies make only a little more than 40% of the cars and trucks sold in the U.S. market.
But the union entered this year’s talks in a much stronger negotiating position than it had in years. In the past, the Detroit companies were struggling badly against foreign rivals that operate nonunion plants in the South, like Toyota and Honda, and had a significant cost advantage. In most of the last several contracts, GM, Ford and Stellantis had to get concessions on wages and benefits to survive.
Over the last 10 years, however, all three companies have rung up record profits, thanks in part to the concessions they won from the union as well as the shift in consumer preferences to high-margin trucks and large SUVs.
In the first half of this year, Ford made $3.7 billion and GM made $5 billion. Stellantis reported profits of 11 billion euros (about $11.9 billion).
In the past, the UAW has chosen one company — it was GM four years ago — as the “target” to focus on in the talks. Fain has said the union could target all three companies this time around, but many analysts think the union will eventually choose Stellantis. In addition to the strains between the company and the union, their talks involve a plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that Stellantis has idled and that the union wants the company to reopen.
Getting Stellantis to reopen the plant is a critical task for Fain. Four years ago, GM closed a plant in Ohio, and the UAW failed in its efforts to push the company to reopen it. In his campaign for the presidency, Fain promised members that his tougher approach would prove successful this time.
The union could get a hand in this battle from the federal government. On Thursday, the Energy Department said it had made $2 billion in grants and $10 billion in loans available to auto companies to convert existing factories that build gasoline-powered cars and trucks into plants that produce hybrid and electric vehicles.
Stellantis, like GM and Ford, aims to introduce several more electric models over the next few years and will probably have to retool some plants to make them. It is already building a battery plant in Indiana for its EV push.
Fiorani suggested that Stellantis could decide to overhaul the Belvidere plant to make electric models. “Stellantis could find a product to go in there,” he said. “For the UAW to truly win something, though, it has to be electric vehicles that Stellantis would plan on making for several years.”

Full text: Many carmakers and charging companies are switching to the Tesla plug for electric vehicles. Why are they doing that, and what will it mean?
With a push from Congress, automakers and charging companies are planning to install tens of thousands of fast chargers on American highways capable of refueling electric cars in half an hour or less.
That's good news for anyone who owns an electric car or is thinking about buying one. But it's also confusing because of a debate about what kind of plugs those new chargers and cars will use now and in the future.
Ford Motor, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and other automakers plan to abandon the plugs their electric cars use today for those designed by Tesla. But they won't begin selling cars with the Tesla plugs until 2025.
Until then, cars like the Ford Mustang Mach-E or Chevrolet Bolt will come with technology that may eventually become obsolete, the equivalent of Betamax videocassette recorders.
What plugs do electric cars use today?
There are two main kinds of plugs. The most widely used was developed by Tesla, which dominates the electric car business, and, so far, works only with the company's cars. It's known as the North American Charging Standard.
Cars made by most other manufacturers use a plug known as the Combined Charging System. Any electric car charger that is funded in part by the federal government under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has to be able to charge cars that use the CCS plug.
Many established automakers are switching from CCS to the North American plug, which will allow their owners to use a portion of Tesla's network of fast chargers -- 12,000 -- and feel more confident about finding a place to refuel. Tesla has roughly 20,000 fast chargers in the United States, or about two-thirds of such chargers.
The established manufacturers will offer adapters that allow Tesla chargers to deliver power to cars with CCS receptacles in early 2024. Then, in 2025, new cars sold by the automakers will use Tesla plugs without adapters.
With so many big automakers switching to the Tesla standard, CCS's days might be numbered in the United States. Of course, cars built for CCS plugs will stay on the road for years, which means that charging stations will need adapters or offer both kinds of plugs for the foreseeable future.
Why are automakers switching to the Tesla plug?
Established carmakers are switching to Tesla's system mainly because it is more widespread than what they are using today and appears to work better.
Tesla's charging network is often found in locations that don't have CCS chargers. Many auto experts and drivers also say Tesla chargers are more reliable, and the company's plug is smaller, lighter and easier to handle than the CCS plug.
In addition, Tesla has designed its system so that drivers can plug into one of its chargers and walk away. The chargers recognize each Tesla car and bill its owner's credit card automatically.
The performance of the charging networks operated by other companies is notoriously uneven. Charging procedures vary. Some chargers require drivers to plug in and then open an app on their phones. Others want customers to open an app first. Some chargers accept credit cards, but others don't.
Drivers of electric cars that are not Teslas often complain about broken or finnicky chargers -- complaints validated by independent studies.
How much does charger location matter?
It matters a lot.
Perhaps Tesla's biggest advantage is that it has been at this for a long time. It has secured choice locations at popular shopping centers and along busy highways.
As a result, newer charging companies are often at a disadvantage. Many of them have had to place some chargers in areas that lack restrooms or restaurants. Stopping at some chargers, in empty parking lots, can feel unsafe.
In July, BMW, G.M., Honda and four other automakers announced that they would jointly install 30,000 chargers in the United States and Canada. These chargers will have both plugs.
Does the CCS plug have any advantages?
Yes, these plugs can charge any electric car, including Teslas if drivers are carrying adapters, which often come with their cars.
But the reverse is not true -- the vast majority of Tesla chargers can charge only Teslas. Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, said in February that he intended to open his company's charging network to cars made by other automakers. As of late August, only about a dozen of the company's U.S. charging stations, all in California, New York or Texas, were available to other cars.
CCS technology is not dominated by one company. While Tesla has promised to hand oversight of its plug to an independent body, the company and Mr. Musk have often been confrontational when dealing with other businesses and government agencies. That's why some auto experts believe that established automakers could regret relying on Tesla.
While charging companies that offer CCS plugs have struggled to offer reliable and easy-to-use services, there are many of them. Several, including EVgo and Electrify America, operate nationwide and compete with one another on price and service. Tesla is more insulated from competition, though that will change as more companies offer chargers with the plugs its cars use.

11 Fatal Minutes in the Jacksonville Shooting: [National Desk]

Full text: The sheriff's office identified the three victims and the gunman who fatally shot himself in the attack on Saturday, which authorities are investigating as a hate crime.
In the span of 11 terrifying minutes, a gunman targeting Black people killed two shoppers and an employee at a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Fla., a rampage that the authorities are investigating as a hate crime and that has reverberated through a community that has long coped with the legacy of racism.
The shooting on Saturday, on the same day that the nation commemorated the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington, prompted somber vigils and renewed vows for unity from residents and officials, but also a tense appearance by the governor in a city that in recent years has dealt with a series of hateful incidents and a continuing dispute over Confederate monuments.
"We have three people who are dead because they are Black," State Senator Tracie Davis, a Jacksonville Democrat, said at a vigil on Sunday morning. "Shopping. In our community. Gunned down. Because they were Black."
The three victims were identified on Sunday by Sheriff T.K. Waters of Jacksonville as Angela Michelle Carr, 52; Anolt Joseph Laguerre Jr., known as A.J., 29, who worked at the store; and Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 19. The sheriff identified the gunman as Ryan Christopher Palmeter, a white 21-year-old from neighboring Clay County and gave a chilling timeline of how the shooting had unfolded.
Ms. Carr, an Uber driver, had dropped off a friend at the store just before she was killed, said her son, Chayvaughn Payne.
"She would give her shirt off her back for people," Mr. Payne, 30, said, describing Ms. Carr as someone who would invite people to cookouts and other family events.
"This is really hard to process," he added. "To lose a mother for nothing."
The gunman, wearing a shirt over a tactical vest, as well as a mask and gloves, began his rampage at around 1:08 p.m. on Saturday by shooting 11 times into a car parked outside the Dollar General, killing Ms. Carr, the sheriff said in a news conference.
The assailant went into the store, turned right and killed Mr. Laguerre before chasing some customers out, though it was unclear why. He returned and killed Mr. Gallion, who had entered through the front door with his girlfriend. The gunman then chased and shot at a woman, though he did not injure her.
When sheriff's deputies arrived, at about 1:19 p.m., they heard a single gunshot, which was most likely the gunman killing himself, Sheriff Waters said.
"When a person grabs a hold of a gun with hateful intentions, it's very difficult to stop that from happening," he said.
The gunman had no criminal record, though the authorities had held him for an involuntary, 72-hour psychiatric evaluation in 2017, when he was 15, the sheriff said. A year earlier, the police received a domestic violence call involving him and his brother.
The gunman legally bought the two weapons he used in the shooting -- a Glock handgun and an AR-15-style rifle -- in April and June, Sheriff Waters said.
Psychiatric evaluations under a Florida law known as the Baker Act do not show up in background checks unless the person has been committed for treatment.
Shortly before the shooting on Saturday, the gunman was spotted putting on the tactical vest in a parking lot at Edward Waters University, a small and private historically Black institution. A campus security guard saw him, and the gunman drove away in a gray Honda Element. The guard reported the gunman's suspicious presence to a nearby sheriff's deputy, Sheriff Waters said.
Two people were in proximity to the gunman in the Edward Waters parking lot, but he did not go after them, the sheriff said, cautioning against assumptions that the university might have been the intended target.
Still, the sheriff said it was clear that the gunman sought Black victims. Most -- but not all -- of the customers he ordered out of the store were white, the sheriff said at the news conference. In an interview, Sheriff Waters said the gunman did not shoot at one person inside the store who was also white.
"I know for a fact that he did not like Black people," said Sheriff Waters, who is Black. "He made that very clear."
Toward the end of the shooting, the gunman texted his father, instructing him to use a screwdriver to get into his room at home, the sheriff said. On the gunman's laptop, his family found a last will and testament and a suicide note as part of more than 20 pages of racist writings, Sheriff Waters said in the interview. The family then called the Clay County Sheriff's Office, though by then the shooting was over.
A police car was parked outside the family home in Orange Park on Sunday. Residents of the quiet, suburban neighborhood declined to speak about the family, and relatives could not be reached for comment. Police records indicate that the gunman's older brother is serving a prison sentence for an armed robbery in 2017.
According to what appears to be an account of the gunman's on X, formerly known as Twitter, he attended Oakleaf High School. In November 2019, he posted a photo of an acceptance letter from Flagler College. A spokeswoman said on Sunday that he was not currently a student.
The Justice Department is investigating the attack as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism. In March, the F.B.I. released an analysis of hate crime incidents in 2021 -- the last year data was fully available -- which said that hate crimes overall had increased by more than 11 percent since 2020. According to the data, anti-Black hate crimes made up the largest "bias incident category," with 31 percent of all single-bias incidents in 2021.
Jacksonville, a city of nearly 1 million people, where about 30 percent of residents are Black, has a long history of racism. Sunday marked the 63rd anniversary of Ax Handle Saturday, when white supremacists severely beat a group of mostly Black civil rights activists. Mayor Donna Deegan and other local officials planned to attend a commemorative ceremony in the afternoon, before a vigil for the Dollar General shooting victims.
Last year, on the morning of Sept. 11, a neo-Nazi group unfurled swastika flags and antisemitic banners on an Interstate 95 overpass. And earlier in 2022, homeowners in two neighborhoods found fliers with hate speech littering their driveways.
Last October, an extremist group displayed antisemitic messages around Jacksonville, including at TIAA Bank Field ahead of a Florida-Georgia college football game. Other hateful messages appeared on an Interstate 10 overpass and along another highway.
The Republican-held City Council has declined to remove a Confederate monument from a park, despite pleas from the mayor and a former mayor, who is a Republican, to do so.
"We're still fighting the same fight, but some days it feels like we're going backwards," Ms. Deegan said at the Sunday morning vigil.
In May, Ms. Deegan, a Democrat, was elected to lead Jacksonville, Florida's largest city, where Republican mayors had been in power for all but four of the last 30 years. Among her administrative appointments was a chief of diversity, equity and inclusion -- a $ 185,000-a-year position that a committee of the City Council voted to defund on Thursday, citing budgetary concerns.
Ms. Deegan blamed state politics under Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican running for president, who has enacted laws rolling back diversity and inclusion policies -- and whose administration came under withering criticism for rejecting the curriculum of an Advanced Placement African American studies class and rewriting African American history courses.
Mr. DeSantis, who sees public education as too liberal, attended a vigil unannounced on Sunday evening that drew about 150 people. The crowd booed loudly when he was introduced to speak, and a councilwoman had to step in and ask people to listen. After he spoke, he was booed again.
He said earlier on Sunday in Tallahassee that he had talked with Jacksonville officials and with the administration of Edward Waters to ensure the university had adequate security.
"Perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable, and targeting people due to their race has no place in the state of Florida," he said.
The morning vigil, at Saint Paul A.M.E. Church of Jacksonville, was attended by at least four Edward Waters University students. A professor described students as still too overwhelmed to talk about the shooting.
The choir sang "Amazing Grace" as some of those in attendance wiped away tears.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Resort Hotels Become Havens for Hawaii Fire Survivors: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People who lost their homes in last week's fire increasingly are being housed in hotels a few miles away.
They raced away from the wildfire tearing through the town of Lahaina last week with just what they could carry, then survived anywhere they could on Maui: in their cars, on friends' couches, in shelters or in tents by the side of the road.
But after more than a week, as shelters have started to close, many survivors have begun moving with government help into a more comfortable option: hotels with golf courses on one side and sandy beaches on the other in a West Maui resort district a few miles from where 2,200 buildings were burned to dust, or made unsafe to inhabit.
The hotel rooms are covered by state and federal temporary housing programs at no cost to the survivors. The American Red Cross, which is running the mostly FEMA-funded hotel program, said it has secured 750 rooms where survivors can live for as long as they need. The shelters, which housed more than 2,000 people the day after the fires broke out, now hold a few hundred people a day.
"Our goal is that by early next week, anyone who was a resident of the affected area and has an uninhabitable home will be placed into a hotel room," Brad Kieserman, vice president for disaster operations and logistics at the American Red Cross, said on Thursday. "We will be able to keep folks in hotels for as long as it takes to find housing solutions."
Mr. Kieserman said officials expect that to be seven to eight months.
Long-term housing for disaster victims is one of the government's greatest challenges, and Maui's distance from the continental United States and a housing shortage makes it even harder. But officials expect to have longer-term housing in place by the spring.
In the parking lots of a gymnasium serving as a shelter and a megachurch distributing food, displaced people gathered on Thursday to register, then move into a situation they could barely fathom, trading homes and apartments full of irreplaceable family keepsakes and belongings for unfamiliar hotel rooms and condos.
"We're all still so shocked," said Beth Zivitski, 36, who had been staying with her boyfriend near Lahaina. "We're not really ready for a new home."
As she finished a lunch of pulled pork that she had just been given by aid workers, Ms. Zivitski explained how FEMA confirmed her eligibility to stay in one of the government-funded hotels by looking at aerial photographs showing ash where she and a handful of roommates once called home. She lamented the loss of everything from her grandmother's jewelry to prescription glasses and spare keys for the Honda she used to escape that suddenly seemed to mean more than it did before the fires.
If she could confirm that the water at the hotel was safe to use and drink, Ms. Zivitski said she figured she would go.
Many of the hotels in Kaanapali have already been taking care of the fire's victims, starting with their own employees. In the first few days, as hotel guests fled with encouragement from the government, those who lost their homes and had nowhere else to go -- or who could not get past the area's road closures -- stayed. Housekeeping staff members cleaned to keep busy. Hotel restaurants closed and in some cases food was shared communally, on trays in lobbies left sweltering by a lack of air conditioning caused by downed electric lines.
By Wednesday, with the roads reopened, the handful of hotels that were expected to play host to both government officials and displaced residents seemed to be caught between their island-getaway past and emergency-aid present. Most hotels had security guards out front.
A single FEMA trailer sat in a loading dock at the Sheraton. The only shops within walking distance -- mostly selling gear for tourists, not groceries -- were still closed, and at one hotel, Starlink Wi-Fi had been set up with a password that referred to beer.
While some fire victims have complained about bureaucratic snags and onerous demands for paperwork, families moving to the hotels seemed especially uncertain about what would come next. Ashley Yamamoto, waiting for hotel check-in details in the parking lot of a Pentecostal church, said she was happy to give up a crowded shelter for a hotel, but with four children in tow, she wondered how they would get to school and whether there would be friends nearby.
"I'm just going with it," she said. "I'm not in a rush to put them in school anyway -- mostly for mental reasons."
At the FEMA-funded hotels, the survivors will receive the same support they found in the shelters -- meals, medical and mental health support, grief counseling, help finding missing loved ones, and financial assistance, the American Red Cross said.
For many, it was just a first step toward recovery. Officials and residents generally agree that it could take months or even years to regain a broader sense of normalcy after the catastrophe of the fires.
County officials have announced plans to speed up the rebuilding process, temporarily waiving property taxes, but many local residents worry that a rushed effort will produce a form of generic suburbia that disrespects the historic roots of the town -- a home of Hawaiian kings in the 19th Century, with many homes passed down by native families for generations.
Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii said he would consider a temporary ban on sales of any properties damaged in the fire, to "make sure no one is victimized by a land grab."
But for now, renters and owners moving to hotels expressed relief, even as the circles under their eyes and constant phone checking signaled anxiety.
"We just need to find someplace," said Som Chai, 28, as he approached FEMA officials with his parents and a folder with paperwork documenting the home they lost.
Kiilani Kalawe, 19, sitting in a small sedan nearby after lining up a room with her boyfriend and former Lahaina roommates, said she hoped a hotel would keep her mind from spinning.
"It helps to distract our brains from everything," she said. "At least we know we'll be safe."

But after more than a week, as shelters have started to close, many survivors have begun moving with government help into a more comfortable option: hotels with golf courses on one side and sandy beaches on the other in a West Maui resort district a few miles from where 2,200 buildings were either burned to dust or made unsafe to inhabit.
The hotel rooms are covered by state and federal temporary housing programs at no cost to the survivors. The American Red Cross, which is running the mostly Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded hotel program, said it has secured 750 rooms where survivors can live for as long as they need. The shelters, which housed more than 2,000 people the day after the fires broke out, now hold a few hundred people a day.
“Our goal is that by early next week, anyone who was a resident of the affected area and has an uninhabitable home will be placed into a hotel room,” Brad Kieserman, vice president for disaster operations and logistics at the American Red Cross, said Thursday. “We will be able to keep folks in hotels for as long as it takes to find housing solutions.”
Kieserman said officials expect that to be seven to eight months.
Long-term housing for disaster victims is one of the government’s greatest challenges, and Maui’s distance from the continental United States and a housing shortage makes it even harder. But officials expect to have longer-term housing in place by the spring.
In the parking lots of a gymnasium serving as a shelter and a megachurch distributing food, displaced people gathered Thursday to register, then move into a situation they could barely fathom, trading homes and apartments full of irreplaceable family keepsakes and belongings for unfamiliar hotel rooms and condos.
“We’re all still so shocked,” said Beth Zivitski, 36, who had been staying with her boyfriend near Lahaina. “We’re not really ready for a new home.”
As she finished a lunch of pulled pork that she had just been given by aid workers, Zivitski explained how FEMA confirmed her eligibility to stay in one of the government-funded hotels by looking at aerial photographs showing ash where she and a handful of roommates once called home. She lamented the loss of everything from her grandmother’s jewelry to prescription glasses and spare keys for the Honda that she used to escape that suddenly seemed to mean more than it did before the fires.
If she could confirm that the water at the hotel was safe to use and drink, Zivitski said she figured she would go.
Many of the hotels in Kaanapali have already been taking care of the fire’s victims, starting with their own employees. In the first few days, as hotel guests fled with encouragement from the government, those who lost their homes and had nowhere else to go — or who could not get past the area’s road closures — stayed. Housekeeping staff members cleaned to keep busy. Hotel restaurants closed, and in some cases, food was shared communally, on trays in lobbies left sweltering by a lack of air conditioning caused by downed electric lines.
By Wednesday, with the roads reopened, the handful of hotels that were expected to play host to both government officials and displaced residents seemed to be caught between their island-getaway past and emergency-aid present. Most hotels had security guards out front.
A FEMA trailer sat in a loading dock at the Sheraton. The only shops within walking distance — mostly selling gear for tourists, not groceries — were still closed, and at one hotel, Starlink Wi-Fi had been set up with a password that referred to beer.
While some fire victims have complained about bureaucratic snags and onerous demands for paperwork, families moving to the hotels seemed especially uncertain about what would come next. Ashley Yamamoto, waiting for hotel check-in details in the parking lot of a Pentecostal church, said she was happy to give up a crowded shelter for a hotel, but with four children in tow, she wondered how they would get to school and whether there would be friends nearby.
“I’m just going with it,” she said. “I’m not in a rush to put them in school anyway — mostly for mental reasons.”
At the FEMA-funded hotels, the survivors will receive the same support they found in the shelters — meals, medical and mental health support, grief counseling, help finding missing loved ones, and financial assistance, the American Red Cross said.
For many, it was just a first step toward recovery. Officials and residents generally agree that it could take months or even years to regain a broader sense of normalcy after the catastrophe of the fires.
County officials have announced plans to speed up the rebuilding process, temporarily waiving property taxes, but many local residents worry that a rushed effort will produce a form of generic suburbia that disrespects the historic roots of the town — a home of Hawaiian kings in the 19th century, with many homes passed down by native families for generations.
Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he would consider a temporary ban on sales of any properties damaged in the fire, to “make sure no one is victimized by a land grab.”
But for now, renters and owners moving to hotels expressed relief, even as the circles under their eyes and constant phone checking signaled anxiety.
“We just need to find someplace,” said Som Chai, 28, as he approached FEMA officials with his parents and a folder with paperwork documenting the home they lost.
Kiilani Kalawe, 19, sitting in a small sedan nearby after lining up a room with her boyfriend and former Lahaina roommates, said she hoped a hotel would keep her mind from spinning.
“It helps to distract our brains from everything,” she said. “At least we know we’ll be safe.”

Railroad Regulator Blasts Norfolk Southern's Safety
Norfolk Southern made improvements after one of its trains derailed, caught fire and spilled toxic chemicals near an Ohio town, but the company is nowhere near the "gold standard for safety" it is striving to be, according to federal regulators.
Instead, the Federal Railroad Administration said, the railroad was too often only willing to meet minimum safety requirements.
The agency released its 143-page report on the Atlanta-based railroad's safety culture Wednesday. The agency has been working on the report for months since thousands of people had to evacuate their homes after the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.
Poor communication and mistrust between employees and managers are hindering Norfolk Southern's efforts to improve safety, the report also said. The agency questioned whether the company's training for employees and managers is adequate. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Strong Vehicle Demand Propels Honda's Sales
Honda reported Wednesday that its April to June profit more than doubled on healthy sales of its motorcycles and cars, as the Japanese company also received a perk from favorable exchange rates.
Honda Motor Co. said its fiscal first quarter profit totaled 363 billion yen, or $ 2.5 billion, up from 149 billion yen. Quarterly sales jumped 21 percent to 4.6 trillion yen, or $ 32 billion.
Honda, which makes the Fit subcompact, Honda e electric car and Gold Wing motorcycle, said its profitability improved, especially in North America, where production recovered.
Honda is banking on growth in E.V.s in the U.S. market, where it recently announced it was joining six other companies in the creation of a high-powered charging network across North America.
Honda said it sold 901,000 vehicles in the latest quarter, up from 815,000 a year earlier. It also sold more motorcycles worldwide at nearly 4.5 million, up from 4.2 million. ASSOCIATED PRESS
AVIATION
Temporary Flight Cuts Are Extended by F.A.A.
United States regulators said on Wednesday that they would extend temporary cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City-area airports and Washington National Airport through Oct. 28, citing air traffic controller staffing issues.
The Federal Aviation Administration agreed in March to the request of Delta Air Lines and United Airlines to temporarily return up to 10 percent of slots and flights at New York-area airports and Washington National Airport through Sept. 15.
Airlines sought an extension of the waiver on Monday, saying air traffic staffing levels in a key New York air traffic sector have not "meaningfully improved."
Airlines can lose their slots if they do not use them at least 80 percent of the time.
The F.A.A. said it was working closely with a major air traffic controller union on a long-term solution to low staffing levels in New York. REUTERS

Auto Union Is Preparing For a Fight: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Auto Workers leader vowed to be tougher than his predecessors in contract talks. His initial demands attach big numbers to that promise.
Detroit may be headed for a tumultuous labor showdown.
The United Auto Workers union has made a bold opening bid in negotiations for new four-year collective bargaining agreements with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Its new president, Shawn Fain, has declared that the 150,000 hourly workers employed by the companies are prepared to strike to achieve the union's goals.
The U.A.W. presented the automakers with a list of demands, including a 40 percent wage increase -- premised on the compensation gains that the union says the companies' chief executives have made over the four years since the last contract talks.
And with the pivot to electric vehicles, the union wants guarantees that workers hired at the automakers' new E.V. battery plants will be covered by the U.A.W. national contracts, or at least given contracts with comparable wage and safety terms.
"I know these demands sound ambitious, but the Big Three are making record profits, so I also know they can easily afford it," Mr. Fain said in an interview. "We have to be a lot more aggressive to negotiate better agreements, to set a standard that raises people up to a middle-class life."
In addition to higher pay, the demands include regular cost-of-living wage increases, pension plans for a greater number of workers and a job security plan for workers when plants are shuttered. The U.A.W. also hopes to push Stellantis to reopen a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that was idled this year, putting 1,350 people out of work.
And it wants a workweek comprising four eight-hour days on the assembly line and a fifth day with eight hours of paid time off -- essentially a 32-hour week. Mr. Fain said many workers typically worked 50 or 60 hours a week, leaving little time for family activities or rest.
In a statement, G.M. said that it expected a new contract to provide increased wages, and that it was "important to protect U.S. manufacturing and jobs in an industry that is dominated by nonunionized competition." But the U.A.W.'s demands, the company added, "would threaten our ability to do what's right for the long-term benefit of the team."
Ford said it aimed to work with the U.A.W. on "creative solutions," without elaborating. Stellantis said it intended to "fairly reward" its workers but warned that any agreement must not "jeopardize our ability to continue investing" in new vehicles and technologies.
The automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles but have yet to see significant sales or profits from them. The union is concerned that the move to E.V.s could cost thousands of jobs because electric vehicles generally require fewer workers to produce than traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry, said he expected that the union would score some gains -- up to a point. "I think there will be substantial wage increases, and I think the companies can afford higher wages," he said.
But he said the automakers were likely to resist other union demands, like the shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees or the ability to strike over plant closings. "The companies can't afford anything that puts them in a straitjacket," Mr. Gordon said. "With the E.V. transition, they are going to need flexibility to adjust plants and maybe even close plants."
Mr. Fain, an insurgent who upset the incumbent president in an election this year on a vow to bring a tougher approach to negotiations, shrugged off the notion that the union's demands would put the companies at a cost disadvantage against rivals like Toyota, Honda and Tesla, which operate nonunion plants in the United States.
"These companies are very competitive," he said of the Detroit manufacturers, noting that each had reported substantial profits over the past 10 years, and that most of their profits come from North America. In the first half of the year, Stellantis made a record 10.9 billion euros, about $ 12 billion. G.M. generated $ 5 billion in profit in the same period.
Union officials frequently note that for many years before the companies' renaissance, the U.A.W. agreed to lower pay, less costly retirement provisions for new hires and other concessions that helped the automakers regain their competitive edge after falling into dire straits and even -- for G.M. and for Stellantis's predecessor, Chrysler -- bankruptcy.
The companies' bottom lines, along with their leaders' pay, have become a rallying cry for the U.A.W. The union estimates that the chief executives -- Mary T. Barra of G.M., Jim Farley of Ford and Carlos Tavares of Stellantis -- collectively saw about a 40 percent rise in total compensation in the past four years.
In 2022, Ms. Barra received a compensation package, including salary, stock awards and bonuses, worth $ 29 million, according to financial filings. Mr. Farley's package was worth $ 21 million, and Mr. Tavares's €23.5 million.
"I think they should apply the same compensation principles to the workers that the C.E.O.s apply to themselves," Mr. Fain said. (Stock awards and bonuses, unlike wages and salaries, can vary and even decline depending on share price and company performance.)
The current agreements, which lapse Sept. 14, were reached in 2019 only after a six-week strike at G.M. -- the company that the union designated in that cycle as its negotiating target. This time, Mr. Fain says all three companies are targets.
His supporters say it may be difficult to achieve some of the union's main goals without walking out again, especially the demand that workers at electric vehicle battery plants are entitled to the same pay, benefits and safety standards as U.A.W. members at other factories.
Several battery plants are joint ventures between the Big Three and foreign battery manufacturers. A provision making it relatively easy to unionize plants owned entirely by the automakers does not apply to workers at jointly operated plants, nor would those plants automatically come under the autoworkers' national contracts if they did unionize. The battery plants are often in lightly unionized states where organizing can be difficult.
Auto company officials have said they rely on joint ventures to gain access to the expertise of other manufacturers and to help raise the enormous sums of capital such projects require.
Under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the federal government is providing loans to ease the cost of building the battery plants, as well as tax credits to lower the cost of the battery packs they will make.
Mr. Fain said the government should require recipients of these loans and credits to provide middle-class wages for workers. At $ 16.50 an hour, some workers at an E.V. battery plant operated by G.M. in Ohio "are scraping by and working two jobs," he said. (The plant's starting wage is $ 16.50, rising to about $ 20 after seven years. Under G.M.'s national contract, the wage is $ 17 for new hires and increases to $ 32 after eight years.)
Union officials argue that failing to bring battery workers up to the standards of the national agreements will eventually undermine the U.A.W. by allowing automakers to circumvent the union.
"I think it's existential -- it's a demand that we can't bend on," said Scott Houldieson, chairperson of Unite All Workers for Democracy, a reform group within the union that assembled the slate of candidates that Mr. Fain and other new leaders ran on.
When asked whether the union could strike the automakers over the issue, Mr. Houldieson, a worker at a Ford assembly plant in Chicago, added: "Are they going to take it to the wall? We will. We'll take it to the wall because it's our existence."

Full text: Out on the road with nowhere to plug in -- that's the greatest fear of many would-be electric vehicle buyers and why they're staying on the sidelines. And that's why a group of automakers is planning to build 30,000 fast charging points in North America.
The joint venture by seven carmakers -- BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis -- would nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States. Those chargers can replenish a drained battery in 10 to 30 minutes.
While most E.V. owners typically charge their vehicles at home overnight, they need fast charging stations for longer trips. But the chargers can be far-flung in sparsely populated areas.
At the moment, Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States. Last month, Ford Motor and G.M. struck a deal that would allow them to adopt Tesla's charging technology, and separately Tesla has pledged to make more of its chargers available to other car brands. The collaboration announced on Wednesday would give the automakers an option other than Tesla for charging.
Installing so many charging stations will be costly -- $ 1 billion -- and will take until the end of the decade to complete, though some chargers will be in place around the middle of next year.
But major carmakers have already invested billions to produce electric vehicles and want to ensure that the vehicles catch on. Shoring up charging infrastructure may be a necessary to getting car buyers over a major psychological hurdle.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," said Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M.
"We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold."
Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, on whether the central bank plans to continue raising interest rates after its latest increase on Wednesday.
"People write me off whenever I say I'm an influencer, and I'm like, 'No, I really feel I could be making the difference here."'

"It's a team effort as far as bringing fresh blood into the public service."

Full text: The long-anticipated automation revolution has begun. Robots are ready to operate forklifts and do laundry. It's not as scary as it sounds.
Digit drew a crowd, even here, in a convention center full of robot aficionados.
A humanoid warehouse worker, Digit walked upright on goatlike legs and grabbed bins off a shelf with muscular arms made from aerospace-grade aluminum. It then placed the boxes on an assembly line and walked back to the shelf to search for more. The crowd, which had assembled at ProMat, the premier trade show for the manufacturing and supply chain industry, held up phones and watched, a little quiet, wondering if at some point the robot would teeter and fall. It did not.
Digit, made by Oregon-based Agility Robotics, is the kind of technology that people have worried about for generations: a machine with the strength and adroitness to rival our own, and the ability to take our jobs, or much worse. Then ChatGPT came online, and suddenly the fear was of something smarter rather than stronger -- malevolent bots rather than metallic brutes.
The automaton is still coming. It might not be ready to take over the Amazon warehouse yet, but the long-anticipated robot revolution has begun, accelerated in large part by the pandemic and the thunderous growth of e-commerce. Machines like Digit are ready to take over a vast swath of physical labor, from operating forklifts to doing the laundry.
Ron Kyslinger thinks this is a good thing. Mr. Kyslinger, an engineer who has spearheaded automation for some of the largest retailers in the world, including Amazon and Walmart, is passionate about the potential of robots to improve the quality of life for workers. Robots free humans from boredom, repetition, physical strain and productivity limits that can put their jobs at risk, he believes. He also believes that Americans have a prejudice against automation because of movies like "The Terminator," inhibiting them from adapting to technology in ways both beneficial and inevitable.
Mr. Kyslinger, 56, is currently a consultant for companies hoping to increase automation, and his services are in high demand. Known for his ability to see the big picture not just in a warehouse full of whirring machines but across the global landscape of automation, he is blunt and methodical, and can be somewhat robotic himself in his personal manner. He is often hired to diagnose problems and tell a board or chief executive how it really is.
And how it really is right now, in Mr. Kyslinger's opinion, is that the world is on the brink of enormous changes when it comes to the presence of robots at work.
"I don't think people really understand where we are," he told me. "We're just scratching the surface."
Use of robots by big brands, retailers and movers of goods accelerated significantly after 2019. According to the Association for Advancing Automation, robot orders in North America jumped 42 percent during the pandemic after essentially being flat over the previous five years.
The shift has taken place largely out of sight, inside an archipelago of windowless warehouses across the Southeast and Midwest, helping companies to avoid inflaming the taboo against replacing human workers with machines. Some are reluctant to even discuss automation.
Americans have long felt ambivalent toward automation. The country that invented such job-killers as the dishwasher and the combine also produced the likes of Philip K. Dick and James Cameron, artists whose dystopian visions helped breed lasting anxiety toward robots.
Over the last few years, significant resources have been thrown at making robots profitable -- and this is paying off. More companies are competing to solve the problems that have traditionally come with automation, and many are succeeding.
"People are finally making money," said Samuel Reeves, chief executive of FORT Robotics, a Philadelphia start-up focused on robot safety. "You've got legit work being done by mobile autonomous robots. And that's only in the past two or three years."
Interest skyrocketed during the pandemic and helped create relatively low-cost automation systems that companies can install very quickly, said Ash Sharma, managing director of Interact Analysis, which surveys trends in automation.
"We've seen billions of dollars flying into this sector," he said.
Yet the use of robots in most countries remains relatively low, suggesting that a true reckoning with their social impact lies ahead.
The United States ranked ninth in robot density in 2021, down from seventh in 2020, according to the International Federation of Robotics. By contrast, in East Asia, where the aging of populations has long bred fears of worker shortages, robots have been embraced.
The United States has its own problems with aging workers, however, especially in heavy industries like manufacturing, where baby boomers form an outsize part of the work force.
"The pandemic took somewhere between one and a half to three million people out of work," said Joseph Campbell, senior marketing manager for Universal Robots. "A lot of boomers who were planning to work past 65 said 62 is good enough. It's scary."
If a transition to a robotic work force is underway, managing it is likely to fall to a small group of industry veterans such as Mr. Kyslinger. Almost 20 years ago, he was one of a small number of robot boosters who built the paradigm, and to see it today through his eyes is to see where it may be headed next.
He has his concerns -- about people, not robots.
In it for 'what's best for humanity'
At ProMat, which took place over four days in March inside Chicago's McCormick Place convention center, Digit was the undisputed star. The scene looked, for the most part, like a kid-friendly science fiction movie, a robot bazaar where the machines move slowly, say excuse me and execute limited tasks like picking up objects and dropping them.
However, some robots sat inside plexiglass cages. "You don't want to go in there," Mr. Kyslinger said, pointing at one. "That thing will knock you on your butt."
ProMat's 51,000 attendees -- a glad-handing throng of well-groomed, middle-aged white male faces attached to monogrammed backpacks and fancy sneakers -- ambled from one exhibit to the next like visitors at a zoo. The crowd included buyers from major retailers and consumer goods companies, as well as venture capitalists and engineers.
At one booth for a robot "picker," I told one of the few women seemingly within miles that I was writing an article about a guy named Ron. "Oh, really," she said, looking fatigued. "There are a lot of Rons here."
Mr. Kyslinger floated through this milieu like a celebrity entering a restaurant, barely able to move without being accosted. "Welcome to Ron's world," one attendee whispered to me above the whine of micro-motors. "Ron's the O.G. of automation," another said. Mr. Kyslinger blushed at the attention.
"I don't love talking about me," he said a bit gruffly. He had agreed to share his passion for and concerns about automation in the interest of "what's best for humanity."
Mr. Kyslinger, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and was a curveball-throwing right-hander for the University of Pittsburgh, majored in computer science in college. Practice was at 5 a.m., so he got up at 3:30 and went to the computer lab.
After graduating in 1989, he went into the automotive world, where, starting as a controls engineer, he spent 23 years working for Chrysler, Ford and Honda. Car companies were among the first to embrace automation, replacing humans with crude, often dangerous robots on assembly lines.
In the 1980s, robots were a rare example of the U.S. car industry's using technology to think ahead. But in some ways, industry experts believe, they set robotics back.
"Everything we sold was to take labor out," said Mr. Campbell of Universal Robots. "Everything was to replace a worker. That was the impression, and at that point it was the truth."
For Mr. Kyslinger, who today lives near Myrtle Beach, S.C., working for a Japanese car company was a formative experience. He admired what he saw as Japanese culture's disciplined approach to complex problems and wrote a master's thesis on the different working environments at Honda and Ford.
In 2011, Mr. Kyslinger moved to an industry trying even more aggressively to automate industrial workspaces: food distribution. At C&S Wholesale Grocers, the nation's largest grocery distributor, he designed a warehouse in which robots traveling 30 miles per hour filled up pallets destined for supermarkets.
C&S is a little-known company that has a hand in transporting an outsized portion of the nation's food. ("If it belongs on a supermarket shelf, it's probably moving through a C&S warehouse right now," the New Hampshire-based company likes to say.) Under Mr. Kyslinger, C&S pioneered warehouses with so few human workers that they came close to the industry goal of "lights out," meaning the ability to operate in darkness, minus human eyes.
Today Mr. Kyslinger says lights out is "getting really close." As we walked the floor of Promat, he identified robots that were closing the gap with humans and in some cases outperforming them.
Squashing Q-Tips
On the whole, Mr. Kyslinger is not easily impressed. He called the robot trade show full of "bits and pieces of the future -- many parts make my brain hurt."
Nevertheless, somewhat begrudgingly, he pointed out some highlights: A robotic arm with a kind of gripper that approached the versatility of human fingers. A visual sensor that had made progress in discerning the glare on a plastic wrapper from an object it contained. A sorter that excelled at finding the ideal geometry inside a cardboard box for items of different shapes, whether "toothpaste, tuna fish or a teddy bear."
Mr. Kyslinger seemed more interested in explaining what robots can't do. As a former computer programmer, he was decidedly unfazed by ChatGPT, the chatbot powered by artificial intelligence.
"People are looking for it to be the Holy Grail," he said, "but it's only as good as the people who programmed it."
At another booth, we watched a "cobot" -- short for collaborative robot -- as it placed items inside a droid-like "autonomous mobile robot" zipping to and fro. Cobots are supposed to be harmless, but this machine's Japanese manufacturer, Fanuc, a longtime provider of robotic arms to carmakers, had put it inside a cage anyway.
Its writhing octopus-like appendages were hypnotic, but as soon as we started watching it, one of its "end effectors" (robot-speak for hands) failed to grip a box of Q-Tips and dropped it on the floor, where the autonomous mobile robot ran over it.
"See?" Mr. Kyslinger said. The cobot was shut down so an attendant could enter the cage and remove the now-flattened Q-Tips. Mr. Kyslinger called this not a defect but an "edge case," the kind of routine mistake that makes human intervention inevitable. It showed why getting to "lights out" in e-commerce will be a struggle.
"They probably taught the robot how to do this thousands of times in their lab," he said. "Then they bring it out here and it still misses."
We walked on, with Mr. Kyslinger being greeted at every turn. At one booth he stopped in his tracks. By now we had passed robotic lift trucks stacking boxes, robot sentry dogs with thermal and acoustic sensors, and robots unloading trailers. (At Automate, another industry event, we watched a Fanuc robotic arm twirl around 2,200-pound objects as if they were pizzas.) None of those moments, however, really made Mr. Kyslinger's pupils widen.
"That catches my eye," he suddenly said. It was a Shelby Cobra, made in 1967 and retrofitted for racing. A car.
'Fear of our own creation'
One of Mr. Kyslinger's many consulting clients wandering the ProMat floor was Samuel Reeves, a roboticist from Philadelphia. Mr. Reeves, now 40, began working on a company he called Humanistic Robotics in the mid-2000s, shortly after he graduated from college. It was devoted to land mine removal, the kind of extreme task that robots have long been assigned. Humanistic Robots used a construction vehicle to build a 10,000-pound minesweeping robot that could move on its own.
"And we were immediately terrified of it," Mr. Reeves said. He then founded FORT Robotics, "born of our fear of our own creation." He expressed the same kind of terror and regret that artificial intelligence creators have been voicing.
FORT Robotics is a "robotic-controlled platform," according to Mr. Reeves, and one of only a few companies focused on preventing robots from mauling workers, which Mr. Reeves called "a disaster waiting to happen."
"In the last generation of automation, people were just really trying to get machines out there that worked," Mr. Reeves said. "There have to be huge innovations to improve safety so that machines can run autonomously and faster around humans -- and at a lower price point." He added that "safety-rated scanners are incredibly expensive -- like $ 10,000 a pop."
Mr. Kyslinger echoed Mr. Reeves's concerns.
"I've seen robots go horribly wrong," he told me. In one warehouse owned by a company he advised, a robot essentially clobbered a worker, breaking several bones. A technician had accidentally disabled its safety features.
"Human error causes problems, not robot error," Mr. Kyslinger said, noting that airplane crashes have declined sharply since autopilot was introduced. "The robot does what it's told to do -- no more, no less."
"People think of 'The Terminator,"' he added, "but that stuff can't happen when you have safety protocols." Such protocols can include "bifurcating" a robot's safety controls so that two humans would have to agree to the sort of change that would put workers near the robot at risk.
Safety concerns have made cobots one of the fastest-growing segments of industrial automation. A cobot "can hit you, but it can't hurt you," Mr. Kyslinger said. "It knows you're there. It senses you're there and stops."
Robots show up
In 2018, before the pandemic unleashed a torrent of pressure on companies to automate, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commissioned a task force on "The Work of the Future."
The task force concluded that "no compelling evidence suggests that technological advances are driving us toward a jobless future." On the contrary, it anticipated "more job openings than workers to fill them." Nevertheless, it argued, "the implications of robotics and automation for workers will not be benign."
"The pandemic laid bare vulnerabilities that have come from hollowing out U.S. manufacturing capabilities," said one of the task force's co-chairs, Elisabeth Reynolds, an M.I.T. lecturer who went on to serve as a special assistant for manufacturing and economic development on the National Economic Council. "Automation is going to help us make the transition to an advanced manufacturing center, while helping with a long-term shortage of workers."
Another co-chair, Prof. David Mindell, agreed, calling the recent changes potentially positive for workers but only if the widespread incorporation of robots leads to the creation of "new industries and new kinds of jobs."
"Sixty percent of the jobs in the Department of Labor database did not exist in 1940," Mr. Mindell said over Zoom. "You know, web designer, massage therapist, dog walker, aerodynamic simulations engineer. We have to make sure that we're continuing to create those kinds of jobs."
At ProMat, Mr. Kyslinger and I eventually came to Digit, the humanoid warehouse worker. We watched Digit work itself into a crouch so it could pick up a bin near the floor.
"You don't want people bending over to lift from down there," Mr. Kyslinger said. "That's where injuries occur, in their backs, in their necks."
Still, the machine was moving slowly -- slower than most humans. Mr. Kyslinger studied its movements, seemingly unimpressed. "A lot of algorithms go into that," he said. "Humans do those things without even thinking."
But, he added, to be an improvement over humans, machines don't need to be faster.
"Robots show up every day," he said.

Its writhing octopus-like appendages were hypnotic, but as soon as we started watching it, one of its “end effectors” (robot-speak for hands) failed to grip a box of Q-Tips and dropped it on the floor, where the autonomous mobile robot ran over it.
“See?” Kyslinger said. The cobot was shut down so an attendant could enter the cage and remove the now-flattened Q-Tips. Kyslinger called this not a defect but an “edge case,” the kind of routine mistake that makes human intervention inevitable. It showed why getting to “lights out” in e-commerce will be a struggle.
“They probably taught the robot how to do this thousands of times in their lab,” he said. “Then they bring it out here and it still misses.”
We walked on, with Kyslinger being greeted at every turn. At one booth he stopped in his tracks. By now we had passed robotic lift trucks stacking boxes, robot sentry dogs with thermal and acoustic sensors, and robots unloading trailers. (At Automate, another industry event, we watched a Fanuc robotic arm twirl around 2,200-pound objects as if they were pizzas.) None of those moments, however, really made Kyslinger’s pupils widen.
“That catches my eye,” he said. It was a Shelby Cobra, made in 1967 and retrofitted for racing. A car.
‘Fear of Our Own Creation’
One of Kyslinger’s many consulting clients wandering the ProMat floor was Samuel Reeves, a roboticist from Philadelphia. Reeves, now 40, began working on a company he called Humanistic Robotics in the mid-2000s, shortly after he graduated from college. It was devoted to land mine removal, the kind of extreme task that robots have long been assigned. Humanistic Robots used a construction vehicle to build a 10,000-pound minesweeping robot that could move on its own.
“And we were immediately terrified of it,” Reeves said. He then founded FORT Robotics, “born of our fear of our own creation.” He expressed the same kind of terror and regret that artificial intelligence creators have been voicing.
FORT Robotics is a “robotic-controlled platform,” according to Reeves, and one of only a few companies focused on preventing robots from mauling workers, which Reeves called “a disaster waiting to happen.”
“In the last generation of automation, people were just really trying to get machines out there that worked,” Reeves said. “There have to be huge innovations to improve safety so that machines can run autonomously and faster around humans — and at a lower price point.” He added that “safety-rated scanners are incredibly expensive — like $10,000 a pop.”
Kyslinger echoed Reeves’ concerns.
“I’ve seen robots go horribly wrong,” he told me. In one warehouse owned by a company he advised, a robot essentially clobbered a worker, breaking several bones. A technician had accidentally disabled its safety features.
“Human error causes problems, not robot error,” Kyslinger said, noting that airplane crashes have declined sharply since autopilot was introduced. “The robot does what it’s told to do — no more, no less.”
“People think of ‘The Terminator,’” he added, “but that stuff can’t happen when you have safety protocols.” Such protocols can include “bifurcating” a robot’s safety controls so that two humans would have to agree to the sort of change that would put workers near the robot at risk.
Safety concerns have made cobots one of the fastest-growing segments of industrial automation. A cobot “can hit you, but it can’t hurt you,” Kyslinger said. “It knows you’re there. It senses you’re there and stops.”
Robots Show Up
In 2018, before the pandemic unleashed a torrent of pressure on companies to automate, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commissioned a task force on “The Work of the Future.”
The task force concluded that “no compelling evidence suggests that technological advances are driving us toward a jobless future.” On the contrary, it anticipated “more job openings than workers to fill them.” Nevertheless, it argued, “the implications of robotics and automation for workers will not be benign.”
“The pandemic laid bare vulnerabilities that have come from hollowing out U.S. manufacturing capabilities,” said one of the task force’s co-chairs, Elisabeth Reynolds, an MIT lecturer who went on to serve as a special assistant for manufacturing and economic development on the National Economic Council. “Automation is going to help us make the transition to an advanced manufacturing center, while helping with a long-term shortage of workers.”
Another co-chair, professor David Mindell, agreed, calling the recent changes potentially positive for workers but only if the widespread incorporation of robots leads to the creation of “new industries and new kinds of jobs.”
“Sixty percent of the jobs in the Department of Labor database did not exist in 1940,” Mindell said over Zoom. “You know, web designer, massage therapist, dog walker, aerodynamic simulations engineer. We have to make sure that we’re continuing to create those kinds of jobs.”
At ProMat, Kyslinger and I eventually came to Digit, the humanoid warehouse worker. We watched Digit work itself into a crouch so it could pick up a bin near the floor.
“You don’t want people bending over to lift from down there,” Kyslinger said. “That’s where injuries occur, in their backs, in their necks.”
Still, the machine was moving slowly — slower than most humans. Kyslinger studied its movements, seemingly unimpressed. “A lot of algorithms go into that,” he said. “Humans do those things without even thinking.”
But, he added, to be an improvement over humans, machines don’t need to be faster.
“Robots show up every day,” he said.

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

Full text: It was a sign that the auto industry was overcoming its biggest challenges in recent years. General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, reported on Wednesday that it had its best quarter for new-car sales in more than two years.
G.M. said it had sold 691,978 vehicles from April through June -- a 19 percent jump from a year earlier.
Like other automakers, G.M. faced shortages of computer chips and other parts in the pandemic, which sent up the cost of vehicles, forced factories to shut down and left car dealers with sparse lots. Sales fell in part because there were fewer cars to sell.
And though demand remained high -- higher than automakers could keep up with, in many cases -- some customers deferred new-car purchases or opted for used cars because of the second obstacle automakers encountered. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to tame inflation, auto loans became more expensive and put new cars out of reach for some.
But now, automakers -- Honda, Kia and Ford among them -- are having an easier time restocking dealer lots as the chip shortage has eased. And strong jobs reports and rising wages have left consumers in a better position to buy cars.
The industry isn't out of the woods yet -- central bankers expect two more rate increases by the end of the year and plan to keep rates high until they wrestle down inflation.
But Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the research firm Cox Automotive, called the quarterly sales figures "the beginning of returning to normal." "Everyone knows the music is about to stop."

Ford's U.S. Sales Rose 10% in Second Quarter
Ford Motor said Thursday that its new-vehicle sales rose 10 percent in the three months of April through June, thanks to robust demand for trucks. The automaker sold 531,662 motor vehicles, up from 483,688 in the second quarter last year, as sales of pickups, delivery vans and heavy trucks increased 26 percent. The gain in truck sales more than offset a decline of nearly 3 percent in sales of electric vehicles. Ford sold 14,843 battery-powered cars and trucks in the quarter, down from 15,273 a year earlier. It has had to slow production to upgrade assembly lines. The upgrade work mainly affected the Mustang Mach-E, whose sales declined 21 percent in the second quarter. Ford also sold 4,466 F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks in the quarter. That was more than double the total from a year earlier and the second-highest quarterly total since the truck went on sale. On Wednesday, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai and Kia reported increases of 14 percent or more. Overall, automakers sold more than 4.1 million cars and trucks in the second quarter, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm, an increase of 16 percent from a year earlier. The total, however, was about 400,000 fewer cars than the industry typically sold in the second quarter before the coronavirus pandemic. Sales remain below their prepandemic levels because parts shortages have forced automakers to produce fewer vehicles for much of the last three years. The supply of computer chips, which have been particularly hard to get, has improved in recent months. NEAL E. BOUDETTE

Amazon's iRobot Deal Is in E.U.'s Cross Hairs
Amazon's $ 1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot may reduce competition and strengthen Amazon's position as an online marketplace provider, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Thursday. The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation and will decide by Nov. 15 whether to clear or block the deal for iRobot, the robot vacuum cleaner maker. "We continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage," an Amazon spokesperson said. Antitrust enforcers around the world have increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquiring smaller rivals, concerned about the accumulation of data by a few companies, and big players leveraging their dominance into new markets. The acquisition announced last August that it would add iRobot's Roomba robot vacuum to Amazon's portfolio of smart devices, which include the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices and wall-mounted smart displays. IRobot made its first Roomba robot vacuum in 2002. Amazon has previously said the vacuum cleaner market is very competitive, with lots of Chinese players. "The commission is concerned that the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners and to strengthen its position as online marketplace provider," an E.U. executive said. The Amazon spokesperson also said the company could "offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers." REUTERS

New-Car Sales Take Off As Chip Shortage Eases: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors, Toyota and other automakers sold more trucks and sport utility vehicles as supply chain problems eased and demand remained strong despite rising interest rates.
Some of the country's biggest automakers reported big sales increases for the second quarter on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the auto industry was bouncing back from parts shortages and overcoming the effects of higher interest rates.
General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, said it sold 691,978 vehicles from April to June, up 19 percent from a year earlier. It was the company's highest quarterly total in more than two years.
Automakers have struggled in the last two years with a shortage of computer chips that forced factory shutdowns and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. More recently, rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive, causing some consumers to defer purchases or opt for used vehicles.
"I'm not saying we are on the cusp of exciting growth here," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a research firm. "But we are now at a turning point where the auto market returns to more balance. It's the beginning of returning to normal."
The easing of chip shortages has allowed automakers to restock dealer lots, making it easier for car buyers to find the models and features they want, Mr. Smoke said. At the end of June, dealers had about 1.8 million vehicles in stock, nearly 800,000 more than at the same point in 2022, according to Cox data.
Sales have also been helped by strong job creation and rising wages, Mr. Smoke said.
At the same time, however, higher interest rates and higher car prices have put new-car purchases out of reach of many consumers. In the first half of the year, the average price paid for a new vehicle was a near-record $ 48,564. The average interest rate paid on car loans in the first six months of 2023 was 7.09 percent, up from 4.86 percent a year earlier, according to Cox. The average monthly payment in the first half was $ 784, up from $ 691.
"Demand will be limited by the level of prices and rates, which are not likely to come down enough to stimulate more demand than the market can bear," Mr. Smoke said.
Cox estimated that total sales of new cars and trucks rose 11.6 percent in the first half of the year, to 7.65 million. The firm now expects full-year sales to top 15 million, which would be a rise of 8 percent.
Several automakers reported solid quarterly sales on Wednesday. Toyota said its U.S. sales rose 7 percent, to 568,962 cars and light trucks. Stellantis, the company that owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other brands, reported a 6 percent rise, to 434,648 vehicles.
Honda, which had been severely hampered by chip shortages, said its sales rose 45 percent to 347,025 cars and trucks. Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean automakers, each sold more than 210,000 vehicles, posting gains of 14 percent and 15 percent.
Electric vehicles remain the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Rivian, a maker of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, said on Monday that it delivered 12,640 in the second quarter, a 59 percent jump from a year earlier. And on Sunday, Tesla reported an 83 percent jump in global sales in the second quarter.
Cox estimated that more than 500,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year, and that more than one million would be sold in 2023, setting a record for battery-powered cars and trucks in the country.
Tesla, which does not break out its sales by country, remains the largest seller of E.V.s in the U.S. market. Cox estimated that the company sold more than 161,000 electric cars in the second quarter in the United States. Ford Motor, which offers three fully electric models., reports its quarterly sales on Thursday.
G.M. sold more 15,300 battery-powered cars and trucks, but nearly 14,000 were the Chevrolet Bolt, a smaller vehicle that the company will stop making at the end of the year. The company also sold 1,348 Cadillac Lyriq electric S.U.V.s and 47 GMC Hummer pickup trucks. Chevrolet will soon start delivering a new electric Silverado pickup truck, which uses the same battery technology as the Lyriq and Hummer.

Tesla Sales Are Up 10% As Perks Fuel Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Incentives and price cuts made Tesla electric cars cheaper than comparable gasoline models. But the company faces growing competition in China, a key market.
Tesla sales rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in the second quarter as the company led by Elon Musk benefited from government incentives and price cuts that made its electric cars less expensive than comparable gasoline models.
Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles from April through June, up from 423,000 vehicles in the previous quarter, the company said on Sunday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in the second quarter rose 83 percent as the company expanded production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin.
The sales figures exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and showed that Tesla was able to overcome the effect of higher interest rates, which raise monthly payments for people who buy cars on credit.
Tesla was the first of the automakers to report its sales numbers. Sales of most major car brands probably rose sharply in the last quarter, analysts say. Supply chain issues have improved, making it easier for carmakers to get the components they need and for buyers to find the cars they want. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that U.S. new vehicle sales will rise more than 8 percent this year from 2022.
Rules that took effect this year allowed buyers of Tesla vehicles to qualify for $ 7,500 in federal tax credits. With the credit, the least expensive Model 3 sedan sells for less than $ 33,000, cheaper than similar luxury sedans sold by Mercedes-Benz and BMW that run on gasoline and in line with mass market cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
Owners of electric cars also benefit from fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, and electricity is generally cheaper per mile than gasoline.
Tesla is the dominant maker of electric cars in the United States, with a market share of 62 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. But its share has slipped from more than 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 as established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have begun offering more electric models.
In China, a bigger car market than the United States or Europe, Tesla faces intense competition from local manufacturers that have newer model lineups, like BYD. On average, electric vehicles by Chinese manufacturers have been in showrooms a bit more than a year, according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, went on sale in 2020.
Chinese manufacturers also offer interior and exterior styling and entertainment and information systems that better cater to local tastes, AlixPartners noted, citing consumer surveys.
While Tesla sales have continued to climb, the company's profitability has suffered because it has had to cut prices to prop up demand. Tesla made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, down from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of 2022.
Many investors are betting that Tesla's growth will accelerate as demand for electric vehicles grows, and the company begins selling the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, later this year. Tesla's agreement to let other carmakers, including Ford and G.M., use its charging network could also become a new source of revenue.
Tesla's share price has more than doubled this year although it remains well below its peak in 2021, when the company was worth more than $ 1 trillion.
The carmaker said on Sunday that it would publish its financial results for this year's second quarter on July 19.

Assemblyman Injured at Armstrong Center: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry had just spoken at the opening of the Louis Armstrong Center in Queens when a man ran through the crowd and collided with him, witnesses said.
In a jarring interruption to a day of celebration, Assemblyman Jeffrion L. Aubry of Queens was knocked over and injured Thursday morning at the opening ceremony of the new Louis Armstrong Center in Queens by a man who ran through the crowd after exiting his car, witnesses said.
Assemblyman Aubry had just spoken at the center's opening when the man collided with him. Mr. Aubry's head appeared to be bleeding, they said, and he was taken away on a stretcher with his head bandaged.
Aaron Prashad, 41, an emergency medical technician, said that he had watched as a man driving a silver Honda pulled onto the curb and accelerated toward the crowd, getting close to people before going into reverse and jumping out of the car as police officers approached. The man then sprinted through the crowd, he said, as officers gave chase.
"He was definitely going to drive through," said Mr. Prashad, who was born and raised in Queens.
Mary Claire Miskell, a publicist who works with the Armstrong Center, said she felt the man brush past her as he ran near the front of the crowd. She said Mr. Aubry was walking down from the stage, where he had just given a speech, when the man collided with him.
"They made basically full-body contact chest to chest and it knocked him over," Ms. Miskell said.
Mr. Aubry was taken to Elmhurst Hospital.
"The Assemblymember was treated and released from Elmhurst Hospital for a laceration over his eye," Tyquana Rivers, a political consultant who works with Mr. Aubry, said in a statement Thursday evening. "He is in great spirits and doing well."
She said he had been celebrating the opening of the Louis Armstrong Center when he was "involved in an unfortunate incident where a man collided into him while being pursued by the N.Y.P.D." and that he was "only upset because he missed the rest of the long awaited celebration."
The police said Friday that Tzyah Bryant, 23, of Staten Island had been arrested after the incident, saying that he had attempted to buy a pair of sneakers with counterfeit money earlier, leading him to flee in the car when he was challenged.
They said he was arrested on charges of forgery, petit larceny, resisting arrest and reckless endangerment.
The new center is across the street from the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Corona, Queens, where Armstrong, the jazz great, lived with his wife, Lucille, until his death in 1971. The center has an exhibit space and will be the home of the Louis Armstrong Archive, a collection of 60,000 items. It has a 75-seat theater for performances, lectures, films, and other educational experiences.
As people near the front cleared for emergency workers to help Mr. Aubry, Regina Bain, the executive director of the Louis Armstrong House Museum, urged everyone to remain calm. "If you are a praying person please pray for Jeff Aubry right now," she said.
While several emergency medical technicians bandaged Mr. Aubry and helped him to his feet, Ms. Bain led the crowd in singing the chorus "Come by here, my Lord."
Mr. Aubry was taken away on a stretcher, and the ceremony resumed with a speech by State Senator Jessica Ramos, who was in tears as she began her speech.
"Jeff Aubry is more than an institution -- he is a treasure of this community," she said. "So I apologize if I'm a little emotional but seeing him hurt hurts me and it hurts all of us."
Ms. Bain, the museum's executive director, said the assembled members of the community had tried to support Mr. Aubry -- "We did that through music and we did that through prayer," she said -- while also keeping the fleeing man in their thoughts.
"We are part of the community, in all facets of it," she said. "This building is meant to serve all of it."

With Economic Upswing, Japan Is Luring Investors: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese stock market is up nearly 30 percent this year, far ahead of the S&P 500, as firms bet that changes in how companies are run might just finally last.
The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, stood in front of the cameras in 2014 and said he was going to shake up the staid ways companies operated in Japan. It was a tall order. Shellshocked by years of economic malaise that followed the bubble of the 1980s, Japanese executives had clung to the status quo for years. Raises for employees and returns for shareholders were scarce. The consequence was an economy that barely grew.
Now, there are signs of a significant shift in how the country's corporations are run, changes that are helping to breathe life into the economy. In recent months, Canon shareholders have demanded a diverse board of directors, Citizen Watch has said it would buy back up to a quarter of its shares, and the owner of Uniqlo has promised its workers raises of up to 40 percent. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has implored companies to be "conscious" of their share prices.
Mix in a surprisingly solid economy this year, a weak currency, ultralow interest rates -- while many of the world's biggest economies are raising them -- and a plug from Warren E. Buffett and you have the world's best performing major stock market.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index has jumped nearly 30 percent this year, far outstripping the gains for the S&P 500, the benchmark in the United States. The Nikkei has not been this high since the early 1990s, when Japan was slumping into what is known as the Lost Decade.
Some observers are quick to warn that investors have been burned in the past by being overly optimistic about a change in boardroom attitudes in Japan. But company profits are improving, and Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is basking in a postpandemic glow: Inflation has finally returned, consumer spending is rising and foreign tourists are back.
"The fundamental economic conditions in Japan, including corporate earnings, are better than in the U.S., Europe and China," said Yuichi Murao, a top executive at Nomura Asset Management in Tokyo. "In terms of G.D.P. growth, Japan is going to outperform."
The increase in Japan's gross domestic product for the first three months of the year was revised sharply up last week, to an annual rate of 2.7 percent from an initial reading of 1.6 percent. The overall picture remains mixed because the bump that came from more spending by companies was geared more to restocking the shelves and warehouses, not demand from customers. Private consumption, a gauge of how much people are spending, weakened slightly.
Still, domestic demand remains strong, Mr. Murao said. Expectations are high that it will rise further, along the lines of the so-called revenge spending that other countries saw after their lockdowns ended. Japan was among the last countries to lift restrictions, and while the number of tourists is still much lower than what it was before 2020, overseas visitors are streaming in.
"They are spending much more money than before," partly because of the weak yen, Mr. Murao said. The yen has fallen to the lowest level since the 1990s against the U.S. dollar.
Japan has also made strides against two perennial problems, with wages and inflation improving in recent months. Consumer prices, excluding fresh food, rose 3.4 percent in April, the highest level in decades. Rising inflation is more welcome in Japan than it is in the United States and Europe because it has been mired at such low levels for so long, and the Japanese central bank has indicated it will stick with monetary easing.
But the inflation has largely been driven by postpandemic supply shortages, said Chong Hoon Park, the head of economic research for Japan and South Korea at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul. "It's not driven by wage growth," Mr. Park said, adding he expects inflation to drop next year below the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
The challenge is to sustain and broaden the increase in incomes that segments of the economy have witnessed recently. A survey by a business group found that large companies agreed to raise salaries an average of 3.9 percent this year, the highest rate in decades.
The government is focused on raising wages and making it easier for workers to switch jobs in pursuit of higher pay. Last week, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida repeated that his economic priorities included "structural wage increases and labor market reform."
Another leader in pushing for a change in corporate thinking is the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In March, the exchange laid out a plan that would force companies trading below their book value to increase their stock prices. Some of the easiest ways to do so is to pay bigger dividends and buy back more stock. While it's unclear when the exchange will start the policy, behemoths like Toyota and Honda, which has said it plans to buy back stock this year, are likely to have to make changes. (Toyota shares are up 27 percent and Honda's 50 percent this year.)
The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday to 33,502, a new high for the year.
The shift to get companies to pay more attention to profits and stock prices has been evident to Seth Fischer, a hedge fund manager who has publicly agitated for change at Japanese companies for more than a decade, perhaps most memorably by urging Nintendo to get its games on mobile phones.
"We see dramatic changes in senior executives' behavior," Mr. Fischer, the founder of Oasis Capital, said from Hong Kong.
One example Mr. Fischer points to is Canon, the camera and optical equipment company. Shareholders reprimanded its chairman and chief executive, nearly ousting him from the board, for a lack of gender diversity among directors. And the continuous prodding to invest more of the money they hold in reserve has led to Japanese corporations to announce a record $ 70 billion in buybacks in the year that ended in March, according to the Nikkei newspaper. Dividends for the current year are likely to hit another record, topping $ 100 billion. All of these moves combine to put money into the real economy.
Then there is the endorsement from Mr. Buffett, who said recently that he had increased his holdings in the Japanese conglomerates Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. In April, he told Nikkei that he planned to invest more in Japanese companies. Foreign investors have poured money into Japanese stocks since then, some shying away from China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise.
Mr. Fischer is among the bullish. And as companies take actions to improve their value, he said, they will help the overall economy of Japan by increasing incomes.
"Investors have finally gotten notice that there is a sea change opportunity in Japan," he said.

Treat Williams, 71, Dynamic Star Of 'Hair' and 'Everwood,' Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His many other roles included a detective turned informant in "Prince of the City." He was killed in a motorcycle accident in Vermont.
Treat Williams, who drew wide attention with distinctive performances in the film version of "Hair" in 1979 and the police drama "Prince of the City" two years later before settling into a steady career in film and television that included a four-season run on the WB series "Everwood," died on Monday in a motorcycle accident in Dorset, Vt. He was 71.
Mr. Williams was killed shortly before 5 p.m. when an S.U.V. that was southbound on Route 30 near the Vermont-New York border turned left into a parking lot and into the path of the Honda motorcycle driven by Mr. Williams, the Vermont State Police said in a statement.
Mr. Williams was "unable to avoid a collision and was thrown from his motorcycle," the statement said.
Mr. Williams, who was wearing a helmet, was pronounced dead at a medical center in Albany, N.Y., after being airlifted there, the state police said. The 35-year-old man whose vehicle hit Mr. Williams was not hospitalized.
Mr. Williams was a familiar face in the movies and on TV, accumulating some 130 credits while also occasionally working on the stage. It was a stage performance that landed him his breakout role in "Hair" -- he was a replacement player in the lead role of Danny Zuko in the long-running Broadway production of "Grease" in the 1970s, and when the film director Milos Forman saw him in that show, he invited him to take the role of the hippie Berger in his film of "Hair," based on the rock stage musical of the 1960s.
Berger was a mop-topped rebel, and Mr. Williams had some help from the makeup department in creating his portrayal.
"All that hair in 'Hair' wasn't my own," he told The New York Times in 1980. "A lot of it was woven into my own hair right at the scalp. If I moved the wrong way in my sleep, I'd pull it and make my scalp bleed."
His energetic performance impressed critics.
"As his name might indicate," Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, "Treat Williams is one of the better things 'Hair' has to offer. Mr. Williams, who plays the leader of the film's small and bedraggled band of hippies, is the only one of the players who really suggests the spirit of euphoria upon which the original 'Hair' meant to capitalize."
Mr. Williams's performance in "Hair" drew the attention of Sidney Lumet, who was preparing to direct "Prince of the City," a fictionalized version of the story of Robert Leuci, a New York City detective who exposed corruption in the police department. Mr. Lumet told Newsweek in 1981 that Mr. Williams's performance in "Hair" displayed "a life force, a kind of inner energy, bouncing off the screen." He cast him in the lead role in "Prince of the City," a demanding one.
"Williams is almost always onscreen," Roger Ebert, film critic for The Chicago Sun-Times, wrote, "and almost always in situations of extreme stress, fatigue and emotional turmoil. We see him coming apart before our eyes."
Such performances landed Mr. Williams on the cover of Newsweek in December 1981. He was pictured alongside William Hurt and Elizabeth McGovern. The headline was "A New Breed of Actor."
"Versatility is a mark of the new breed," the accompanying article said, "and Treat Williams is one of its most versatile." About the time "Prince of the City" was being released, it noted, Mr. Williams was stepping into the role of the Pirate King in "The Pirates of Penzance" on Broadway, replacing Kevin Kline, who had won a Tony Award for his portrayal.
Versatility kept Mr. Williams working steadily for the next four decades. He played doctors, law enforcement officials, various villains, assorted military officers, lovable father figures. In "Confirmation" (2016), an HBO docudrama about the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Clarence Thomas, he played Senator Edward M. Kennedy. One of his most recent movies was "Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square," a holiday film for Netflix in which he played opposite Ms. Parton and sang a song she wrote, "Memories."
Richard Treat Williams was born Dec. 1, 1951, in Stamford, Conn. "Treat" is a Welsh name that has been in his family for generations. His father, Richard, was a World War II veteran who later worked for the Merck pharmaceutical company and elsewhere. His mother, Marian (Andrew) Williams, owned a sailing and swimming school on Long Island Sound.
Mr. Williams moved with his family to Rowayton, Conn., as a young child, he told Vermont magazine in a 2021 interview.
"Looking back on my younger years," he told the magazine, "I had an idyllic childhood, but I didn't initially realize how idyllic it truly was until I grew older."
Mr. Williams began acting in seventh grade. Later, at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, he quit the football team to focus on acting. He also performed with a group called the Actors' Company at the Fulton Opera House in Lancaster, Pa., where one of his earliest performances was in the Anthony Newley role in "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off," in March 1971, when he was a sophomore in college.
"The part is one which taxes the talents of any performer -- part mime, part actor and part singer," Sam Taylor wrote in a rave review in The Lancaster New Era. "Williams displayed all of these ingredients in full supply."
Mr. Williams graduated from Franklin and Marshall in 1973 and was soon working in New York. In 1975 he appeared in a revival of William Inge's "Bus Stop" at the Equity Library Theater in Manhattan; his first film role came that year as well, in a police drama called "Deadly Hero," as part of a cast that also included James Earl Jones.
For a brief moment after the box-office failure of a 1980 film comedy called "Why Would I Lie?" that he was in, Mr. Williams, a pilot, soured on acting and started flying planes for a company in Los Angeles.
"I wasn't working with people I wanted to work with," he told The Times in 1981. "I was very frustrated."
But then Mr. Lumet called to offer him "Prince of the City."
Among his later career highlights was "Everwood," a WB television series about a New York neurosurgeon who starts a new life with his family in the mountains of Colorado after his wife dies in a car accident. The show debuted in 2002.
More recently, Mr. Williams played a retired detective on the 2022 HBO series "We Own This City."
Information about Mr. Williams's survivors was not immediately available.
Hours before he died, Mr. Williams, who lived in Manchester Center, Vt., posted a photo on Twitter that he appeared to have taken from the seat of his lawn mower.
"Mowing today," he wrote. "Wish I could bottle the scent."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I never thought I'd be experiencing the heartache and joys of raising three small children, alone, at 62.
I yelled at the children to get into the car. Allie, 6, was taking her time, dragging her book bag. Jordan, 4, was whining for me to carry him. I had to yank Jax, 9, who had paused to write "ballz" on the dewy car with his index finger.
My grandchildren are my world. But at 62, I can't believe I'm raising them alone.
The youngest, Jordan, still has that preemie pallor. With big eyes and an impish smile, he's both a cuddler and a spitter. Out of the three grandchildren, he talks about his missing mommy the most. Maybe that's where the spitting comes from; inside that little body is the anger of a two-humped beast.
The night he realized my daughter wasn't coming to tuck him in, he started crying and wouldn't stop. I cuddled and kissed him, even as the others fell asleep in their sorrow. But not Jordan. He was furious and aggrieved. Born breech, he had never intended to leave his mother. His love for her was umbilical.
I tried cajoling with promises, bribing with sweets, barking commands. It ended with both of us sobbing.
I had only meant to safekeep them until my daughter and her husband could get back on their feet, but when they drifted deeper into instability, the children finally came to live with me.
That first night, I got up from the bed where the oldest two huddled like puppies and lifted the weeping toddler into my arms. Outside in the humid night, I strapped Jordan into the car seat and drove away into the darkness. At times he would stop crying, but just when I thought he had finally dozed off, he would start up again. It was 20 minutes before I realized he was fighting sleep because he thought I was taking him to his mother.
One morning, having gotten the children in the car for school and day care, I tried to open the door and realized that they had locked me out. I had started up my aging Honda on the driveway, wanting to ease them from their warm beds to warm seats, and they repaid me by barricading themselves in as I trailed behind with my travel mug.
I didn't want to rage outside where the neighbors could hear me. As they kept laughing, I tried not to cry. Eventually, they let me in, and my smoky gloom filled the car.
I am angry about being an old woman raising three little children. I am angry that I have to be up at 6 a.m. in the cold, unable to turn over and sleep another hour, even on weekends. I am angry when they're mean and ungrateful.
"ZsaZsa, we're sorry," Jax said. (I have forbidden them from calling me "grandma.")
Allie started sniveling with regret.
Jordan peeped, hypervigilant, from his car seat: "ZsaZsa, are you happy at us?"
At day care, I plucked Jordan from the car. Pretending to be chipper, I revved him up for the day ahead. He likes his class, but his only friend is Miss Amy. I delivered him in time for the morning circle, told him he was going to have a good day and slipped away.
When I got back into my car, I couldn't help but peer into the oversized, black SUV parked beside me, where a woman sat bowed behind the wheel with a new baby in her arms. She looked like a baby herself, her hair pulled back severely to show her fresh features and caramel skin. She was wearing Army fatigues.
The picture of sacrifice. This mother was spending the last tender moments of the morning holding her precious child close, a camouflaged Madonna in prayer. Was she about to be deployed?
I was mesmerized by this young mother sitting in the parking lot, unable to leave her child in someone else's arms.
I started to look for her every time I dropped off Jordan, wondering if she knew something. Maybe her child was born with a countdown -- the soldier mother who knew just how much time she had, and that's why she was sitting so intensely every morning, holding, cradling, praying, humming.
She always took the closest spot to the door, parking her tank-like car where others must go around it. Everyone else was waving, yapping, herding children into day care. Even the whiny, sobbing children got shoveled inside.
On another morning, I had a Zoom call at 9 and wasn't ready. I had dropped off the other two children, but when I got to the day care, damn if there wasn't a line of cars. Had the entire city overslept?
When it was finally my turn, I pulled into the space beside the giant SUV. Yes, there she was, the soldier mother, coddling her treasure. Couldn't she see that we were all in a hurry? If she was going to have a prayer service every morning, why didn't she park to the side to free up the spot for those of us who have somewhere to be?
"Come on, Jordan," I said, picking him up because I didn't have time for his dawdling. I rolled my eyes at the soldier mother.
But of course, she didn't see me. She only had eyes for her baby.
After the daylight-saving time change, the children wouldn't get up. Just when I thought I had cracked the morning code, the game shifted. I let Jax skip brushing his teeth and let Allie wear her pajama top to school. Jordan had the surprised look of a clown shot from a cannon. I could barely function.
My nerves prickled when I again spied the monstrous SUV, the one that telegraphs "My cargo is more special than yours." My blood was coursing like lava, but I tried to ignore her. Just to prove I'm a good mother, too, I let Jordan wear a pink mask to school because pink is his favorite color. I prayed that other children hadn't learned how to be cruel yet. I kissed him and patted his butt as he took Miss Amy's hand.
But I couldn't stop the churning in my stomach. On my way out, I paused by the office. I needed to report the woman who parks her big car right at the door for God knows how long every morning, blocking access for the rest of us who need to get in and out. Shouldn't they at least pull her aside and tell her to be more considerate of others?
But no one was in the office. When I got to my car, the soldier mother was still sitting there, car running, babe in arms.
The rest of the week, I found myself lingering inside the day care after dropping off Jordan, reading the bulletin board, asking questions of the staff. It took me a while to realize that I was trying to run into her. I needed to hear the tenor of her voice, size her up.
But she has been trained to sense an enemy lying in wait. I left without an encounter.
At a recent drop-off, rain was coming down in horizontal sheets, and I cursed myself. The forecast had called for intermittent downpours, but I was in such a rush, I forgot Jordan's raincoat.
"It's crazy out here!" I said, a little worried about the lack of visibility, the loss of traction, the blurred white lines, the trucks bearing down on us. Please God, I prayed, don't let me have an accident with my sweet grandchild in the car.
"I love the rain," Jordan said, peering at the beads pummeling the window, "because I like rainbows."
When we got to day care, I pulled into the spot right in front of the door. I was jittery, the rain still gunning down. I couldn't move. Fears had been unleashed by the cloudburst: What will happen if I get too old to take care of everyone? What if I abandon them again by dying?
Jordan looked around, not sure what was happening. "Can I take off my seatbelt?" he said.
I took a deep breath. "Yes, but we're not getting out yet."
He clambered into the front seat, and I cradled him close in our little foxhole. The cars behind me queued up as the parents waited for a spot to unload their children. But I couldn't move.
I love him so much; it feels like he's melded into my bones. Where would my little ones be if I hadn't been able to catch them?
Outside, the rain wasn't letting up.
"When can I go to Miss Amy?" Jordan said. But his body was snuggling closer as we withstood the battering rain.
"Let's just sit here a minute," I said, hunkering down. "Maybe if we wait long enough, everything will blow over."

Demolition of Collapsed Building Is Halted With People Still Missing: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Residents of Davenport, Iowa, protested plans to quickly remove the damaged building. Rescue workers pulled one resident to safety hours after officials said they were unaware of anyone still trapped.
On Monday morning, hours after part of a century-old apartment building crumbled onto a downtown street, officials in Davenport, Iowa, said they were not aware of anyone still trapped in the rubble.
That afternoon, as cleaved-off brick from the unsteady structure left the insides of units exposed, the city announced that its Fire Department had turned over control of the site and that recovery work had begun. Demolition, they said, was "expected to commence" the next day.
But by nightfall on Memorial Day, it was clear that Davenport leaders had badly miscalculated: After protesters gathered at the site, rescue crews found a resident inside the building and pulled her to safety.
"The immediate question I know people are asking is, 'How did she get there? And why wasn't she found earlier?"' Mayor Mike Matson said Tuesday as officials acknowledged that more people remained missing. "I am totally transparent with you. I do not know. We do not know."
The partial collapse of the six-story building near the Mississippi River, and the handling of its aftermath, infuriated residents who questioned whether more could have been done to prevent the collapse and who said the city moved far too hastily to declare the rescue operation complete.
Dozens gathered outside the building on Tuesday, some carrying signs with messages like "Save Lives Not Property." At least five people with ties to the building remained unaccounted for on Tuesday, officials said, including at least two who were believed to have been inside. No deaths had been confirmed.
Like in New York City, where the collapse of a parking garage with unresolved safety violations killed one person earlier this year, and in Surfside, Fla., where the 2021 collapse of a condo building killed 98 people, there had been warnings about problems at 324 Main Street in Davenport, a city of 100,000 residents situated about halfway between Des Moines and Chicago.
In January, Davenport officials said, a complaint about the building led to brick work, though the structure, home to dozens of units and residents, was deemed structurally sound by an outside engineer. Months later, they said, another report led to permits being issued for repairs, which were underway at the time of the collapse.
Aaron Aguilar, who visited the site of the collapse on Monday, said he used to live at 324 Main and had performed maintenance work there. The structure was badly damaged by a severe storm in August 2020, Mr. Aguilar said, and some residents had to evacuate for a time after that. He said the collapse appeared to have taken place in a part of the building near the worst of the storm damage.
"I cried this morning when I found out what happened," Mr. Aguilar said in an interview, adding that he still knew people who lived there.
Attempts to reach the property owner on Tuesday were not successful. The authorities said an investigation would take place.
Officials in Davenport defended their handling of the collapse on Tuesday, noting that rescue crews rushed to the scene on Sunday and saved several people despite significant personal risk. In the hours that followed, search-and-rescue teams from across Iowa, including trained dogs, had arrived and had found no sign of anyone still buried in the pile.
"Our continuous evaluation of what to do or not to do happened in real time," Mr. Matson said Tuesday when he was pressed about why the city had announced plans to start demolition when, it turned out, people were still missing.
With demolition plans on hold, the next steps remained uncertain. Structural engineers and rescue crews said the building was perilously unsteady, doomed to fall on its own at some point, and that even making another sweep would be perilous.
"It's extremely difficult: You can't run up to a pile of bricks and rocks and just start throwing things off, as much as we want to," said Jim Morris, an assistant fire chief and the city's fire marshal. "We want to get everybody out and we want to do it right now."
Later in the day, rescue workers entered the building and emerged with six cats, two snakes and a lizard whose owners had provided photos and told them where they were located.
The pets all looked to be in good health, said Erika Gunn, the executive director of the local humane society, who waited outside to examine the animals. "We are excited and relieved," she said.
But there was no immediate news on the status of the missing residents.
Amy Anderson, who said her family member Ryan Hitchcock was among the missing, asked for calm and respect as crews studied the building and prepared to resume searching.
"I plead with our community just to let the city do their job right now," said Ms. Anderson, who described Mr. Hitchcock's Christian faith and said he would not want anyone to be injured searching for him. "It is an absolute no-win situation but this is the best plan of attack and we don't want anyone else hurt."
Outside the apartment building, Branden Colvin Jr., 18, said he was "still holding out hope" about his father, Branden Colvin Sr., who remained missing.
The elder Mr. Colvin had returned to the building from work around noon Sunday, visited a neighbor and then returned to his unit to take a nap, family members said.
No one had seen him since. His black Honda Accord remained parked outside.

Newgarden Overtakes Ericsson to Win Indy 500: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Josef Newgarden finally captured his long-awaited Indianapolis 500 on Sunday and gave team owner Roger Penske his 19th victory and first since buying Indianapolis Motor Speedway, making an audacious pass of defending race winner Marcus Ericsson during a frantic 2.5-mile sprint to the finish.
After the race was red-flagged for the third time in the closing laps, Newgarden was moved from fourth to second by race control. The two-time IndyCar champion, who had been 0 for 11 in "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing," took advantage of it by slingshotting around Ericsson on the restart and holding him off through the last two turns for the win.
Newgarden brought his Chevrolet-powered car to a stop on the front stretch, jumped out and found a hole in the fence, diving into part of a crowd estimated at more than 300,000 to celebrate. Then, Newgarden climbed the fence to mimic longtime Team Penske driver and four-time Indy 500 winner Helio Castroneves.
"I'm just so thankful to be here. I started out as a fan in the crowd, and this place is amazing, regardless of where you're sitting," Newgarden said after pouring a bottle of whole milk over his head. "Everyone kept asking why I hadn't won this race, and they look at you like you're a failure if you haven't won it. I knew I was capable. I knew I could."
Ericsson finished second in a Honda for Chip Ganassi Racing, and he immediately criticized the decision by IndyCar to have the green flag fly on the first lap out of the pits and set up a one-lap run to the checkers.
"I think it was an unfair and dangerous way to end the race," Ericsson said. "I think I did everything right behind the wheel."
Newgarden and Ericsson were followed by Santino Ferrucci.
Alex Palou, the pole sitter and race favorite for Chip Ganassi Racing, finished fourth and Alexander Rossi was fifth on what was an otherwise disappointing day for Arrow McLaren.

For 2 Men, Broken Limbs Are Ticket to U.S.: [National Desk]

Full text: At a large shelter in El Paso, two people from different countries had something in common: broken limbs that had allowed them to stay in the United States.
For Erwin Gomez, 25, of Venezuela, it was an arm. For Merejildo del Orbe, 39, of the Dominican Republic, it was a leg. Because of their injuries, they were taken to local hospitals after they had crossed into Texas from Mexico.
At Annunciation House, a large shelter in El Paso, migrants from South America and the Caribbean filled rooms with bunk beds.
Mr. Gomez was urgently trying to enter the United States before Title 42 lifted. Having been previously expelled after turning himself into U.S. officials, and having tried unsuccessfully to get an appointment with the authorities through a mobile app, he decided to climb the border wall.
"We knew that people entering unlawfully after Title 42 might be deported or detained for a long time," he said, sitting on a bottom bunk inside the shelter, Annunciation House. "We decided to trust in God, and sneak across."
Mr. Gomez, a sergeant in the Venezuelan Army, set out with three friends in the wee hours of the night last week. On the way down the wall, he slid and fell to the ground, shattering his left arm.
Hours later, at sunrise, the Border Patrol caught up with his group. Mr. Gomez's friends were arrested and returned to Mexico. But Mr. Gomez's broken arm meant a trip to the hospital instead.
"My bad luck turned into good luck," Mr. Gomez said, cradling his arm.
When he recovers, Mr. Gomez plans to join a sister and brother-in-law in Dallas. "I was hoping to work construction, but with this arm, I will have to do other work," he said. "But I am prepared to do any work."
Nearby, in another bed, was Mr. del Orbe, whose lower left leg rested in a plastic boot, pins sticking out of his foot and shin.
He had sold his silver Honda Civic and taken loans to pay a smuggling network $ 16,000 to ferry him from the Dominican Republic to New York City, he said.
On the Mexican side of the border, near Ciudad Juárez, he and six other migrants were guided to the border wall. A smuggler placed a tall, metal construction ladder against the 30-foot-high barrier and instructed them to climb up and then slide down the other side grasping a rope that had been flung over structure, he said.
But Mr. del Orbe fell, breaking his left leg. With just one good leg, he said he walked eight hours, until he encountered the Border Patrol. He was "petrified" they would send him back, he said.
Instead, they took him to a hospital. Now, he's preparing to undergo surgery on his leg, and then continue his journey to the Bronx.
"I know this suffering was worth it," he said, scrolling through his phone to show photos of his family. "I can't wait to legalize my status and bring my wife and three children."

Full text: Residents in Davis reported seeing the man, 21, pacing in a park not far from where one of the fatal stabbings occurred. The attacks left two men dead and one woman injured.
DAVIS, Calif. -- A 21-year-old man, who was a University of California, Davis, student until last week, has been arrested in connection with a harrowing series of three stabbings in the college town, the police announced on Thursday.
The man, Carlos Dominguez of Davis, was booked on suspicion of murder after residents on Wednesday called the police with more than a dozen reports that they had seen a slight, young man who fit witnesses' description of the suspect, wandering near the park where one of the attacks happened, the police said.
Mr. Dominguez was carrying "a hunting-style knife" when he was taken into custody on Wednesday, the police said. He was initially held on a weapons charge before he was arrested Thursday afternoon on two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.
The announcement, which occurred just hours after a memorial service for one of the stabbing victims, was met with relief in the city of about 70,000 people west of Sacramento. The three stabbings over five days had shocked the residents of Davis, where the last reported homicide occurred in 2019.
"A murderer is off the streets and our families will sleep easier tonight," Will Arnold, the mayor, said. "Now the work begins, in earnest, to heal as a community, to take back our shared spaces and to move forward as one."
On the street where the police said Mr. Dominguez shared a house with several roommates, neighbors said they were still processing the news that they had been living near a young man who is accused of killing fellow community members. They said Mr. Dominguez and his roommates hosted frequent parties and worked out in the garage with the door open but otherwise did not socialize much with the neighborhood, where most residents are not students.
"I'm still coming to grips," said Richard Houck, 82, whose home was behind police tape for most of the day while officers executed a search warrant at Mr. Dominguez's address, a rental that Mr. Houck said had been occupied for years by a series of students.
"It can happen anywhere," he said in an interview after the arrest. "It can happen right next door to you, right?"
Mr. Dominguez, who was also known as Carlos Reales Dominguez, was a third-year biological sciences student at U.C. Davis who "was separated for academic reasons" on April 25, according to the university.
It is unclear whether Mr. Dominguez knew any of the three victims, Darren Pytel, the city's police chief, said.
The first was David Henry Breaux, 50, a Stanford University graduate who slept outdoors and was known to locals for a yearslong project in which he gathered and curated definitions of compassion. He was found dead at about 11:20 a.m. on April 27 in a park where he routinely talked to residents at the city's farmers' market. Colloquially known as "the Compassion Guy," Mr. Breaux had been stabbed "many, many times," Chief Pytel said in a City Council meeting this week.
Two days after that first attack, Karim Abou Najm, 20, a student majoring in computer science at U.C. Davis, was killed on a bike path after an altercation in a neighborhood park at 9:14 p.m. on Saturday. A witness who lives near the path told the police that he had overheard a disturbance and rushed to the scene to find the student bleeding from multiple stab wounds. He described seeing a young, curly-haired man scrambling to get away on the victim's bike.
As authorities expedited DNA analysis of evidence found at the two crime scenes, a woman in a homeless encampment east of the city's downtown reported a third attack late Monday, saying she had been stabbed repeatedly through the wall of her tent.
The woman, Kimberlee Guillory, survived, the police said, adding that she remained hospitalized and was alert and improving. The victim and nearby witnesses described the assailant as a curly-haired young man in dark clothing who had been lurking near the encampment.
"We believe that all three are connected, and we have evidence and information that they are," Chief Pytel said.
It was unclear on Thursday whether Mr. Dominguez had any representation. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Yolo County Superior Court.
According to a LinkedIn profile, he graduated in 2020 from an Oakland high school after interning for two years with local mentoring programs for students interested in a career in medicine. One program, the Oakland Health Pathways Partnership, featured an interview with him on its website under a truncated version of his name in which he said that hoped someday to become a doctor.
"I got into health care to help my grandmother -- she has type 2 diabetes," Mr. Dominguez, then a student at Castlemont High School, is quoted as saying in the interview. "Maybe people think it's boring or it's scary if you're a surgeon and you see all that blood, but saving someone's life makes you feel good about yourself."
Before the arrest, anxiety mounted in the leafy cul-de-sacs, Little League fields and residence halls of Davis, a city where locals normally feel safe enough each summer to keep their windows open to capture the "Delta breeze" that blows from San Francisco Bay. This week, local businesses closed early, university events were canceled, and evening classes shifted to remote instruction.
The small Davis police force set up a tip line, moved to extended shifts and enlisted the help of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to help process hundreds of reports.
Then on Wednesday afternoon, calls came in about someone matching the description of the suspect. Carter Carlson, 23, an employee at the elementary school abutting the park where Mr. Najm died, said he was placing flowers on a makeshift memorial along the bike path when he noticed a lone figure, with a disheveled appearance, on the nearby play area behaving strangely. He called the police.
"He was pacing back and forth on a child's bridge between two playgrounds," said Mr. Carlson.
He added that when another man entered the park, talking on his cellphone, the young man noticed and began to meander away, walking toward a local strip mall. Mr. Carlson hopped into his Honda Civic, he said, and followed him until he lost sight of him.
Shortly after, he said, he saw several police cars and, eventually, at about 5 p.m., police officers leading the man away.
A native of Davis, Mr. Carlson credited not only the police, but the community itself for the arrest.
"Everyone has been very shaken, and everyone has taken this very hard," he said, "but this community has really come together to support those who have been so unfortunately attacked."

McDonald's Groups FinedFor Child Labor Violations
Two 10-year-olds are among 300 children who worked at McDonald's restaurants illegally, a Labor Department investigation of franchisees in Kentucky found.
Agency investigators found the 10-year-olds received little or no pay at a McDonald's in Louisville, the Labor Department said. The three franchisees were fined $ 212,000 in total.
One of them, Louisville's Bauer Food L.L.C., which operates 10 McDonald's locations, employed 24 minors under the age of 16 to work more hours than legally permitted, the agency said. Among those were two 10-year-old children. The agency said the children sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m., but were not paid.
The franchise owner-operator, Sean Bauer, said the two 10-year-olds were visiting their parent, a night manager, and weren't employees.
The Walton, Ky.-based Archways Richwood L.L.C. and Louisville-based Bell Restaurant Group I L.L.C. were also fined. ASSOCIATED PRESS

French Authority RejectsRestoring Retirement Age
France's top constitutional body rejected on Wednesday an effort by opposition lawmakers to undo a law to raise the retirement age to 64, deeming that a proposal did not meet the needed criteria. The law was pushed by President Emmanuel Macron, right.
It was the second time that the Constitutional Council has rejected the plan to restore the retirement age to 62, notably via a possible referendum or new bill. Had it passed muster, the process called for would be long and wouldn't stop Mr. Macron's unpopular law from taking effect.
Opposition lawmakers, mainly from the left, sought a complex process to reject the law, which was enacted last month.
The Constitutional Council's role was to assess whether the opposition's request meets the legal conditions for a potential referendum. Had it been accepted, supporters would have had nine months to collect signatures from at least 4.8 million, or 10 percent, of French voters. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google Plans to Add2 Data Centers in Ohio
Google plans to build two more data centers in Ohio to help power its artificial intelligence technology and other tools, the company and state officials announced Wednesday.
With one data center already up and running near Columbus, the two new locations will bring Google's total investment in Ohio to more than $ 2 billion, officials said.
Ohio is seeing a wave of big investments by the technology industry.
Intel is building a $ 20 billion chip factory just east of Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea are building a $ 3.5 billion battery plant between Columbus and Cincinnati that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub.
The area around Columbus also is home to data centers operated by Facebook and Amazon.
The two new Google data centers will be built in Columbus and Lancaster. ASSOCIATED PRESS

On the Deadliest Streets of New York: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Vision Zero, the initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, seems to have stalled, if the reoccurring tragedies on a single Brooklyn avenue are any proof.
Although violent crime has declined in New York City this year, the month of April has been brutal in another sense. Fifteen traffic deaths were logged in the first 24 days, one of them having occurred on a notorious stretch of Atlantic Avenue that divides Brooklyn Heights from Cobble Hill, where several other lives have also been lost. On April 16, a 31-year-old woman, Katherine Harris, was crossing Atlantic at Clinton Street, where she had the right of way, when she was struck and killed by a speeding 27-year-old driver, who was charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, driving while impaired and refusing to take a breathalyzer.
This was the same intersection where Martha Atwater, a 48-year-old writer, producer and mother, was killed as she was leaving a bakery 10 years ago and a Honda S.U.V. jumped the curb. Two years after that, in 2015, Muyassar Moustapha, the 66-year-old owner of a beloved Middle Eastern grocery on Atlantic, was struck and killed by a Mercedes in the same spot, right near his store.
"These big streets running two lanes in both directions," said Jon Orcutt, a consultant who served as policy director for the Department of Transportation during the Bloomberg administration, "are really the killing fields of the city."
Mr. Orcutt was instrumental in drafting the Vision Zero Action Plan, one of Bill de Blasio's first major initiatives, a plan set in motion in 2014 that sought to eliminate traffic fatalities entirely within 10 years. The goal was established after an especially tragic period; the city counted 299 deaths in 2013, and one in particular left an enduringly chilling imprint. Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old boy weeks away from his bar mitzvah, was retrieving a ball that had rolled onto Prospect Park West one fall afternoon when he was struck and killed by a Chevy van.
Toward the end of 2014, as part of the mayor's agenda, the speed limit on most city streets was reduced to 25 miles an hour. During its first five years, Vision Zero brought the installation of more than 360 speed bumps and major bike lane and pedestrian plaza projects; it also increased by more than sevenfold the number of intersections in which pedestrians were now given a head start to cross, in advance of turning cars. Despite the implementation of these and many other measures, over the long term the raw numbers have not been encouraging. Last year saw 257 traffic fatalities in the city; just one fewer than there had been nine years ago, when Vision Zero began.
The pandemic managed both to confirm and undermine New York's reputation as the most walkable city in the country. We walked to go places, to achieve equilibrium, to escape, to commune, to protest. The writer David Sedaris sometimes found himself walking 20 miles a day. In a dangerous convergence of trends, persistent fears of public transportation pushed car ownership upward while the stresses of Covid life were causing people to drink more. Speeding and reckless driving were the leading causes of traffic deaths, and in 2021 they reached their highest point in the Vision Zero era. Nationally, there were more pedestrian deaths in 2021 than there had been in 40 years. Covid has receded but some of the dangerous habits it produced obviously have not. A proposed law in the New York State Legislature would lower the permissible level of alcohol in the bloodstream, a measure that some studies have shown acts as an effective deterrent against driving drunk.
Under Vision Zero, the Department of Transportation was tasked with identifying "priority corridors" -- those stretches where pedestrian deaths and serious injuries are most concentrated. One of them was Atlantic Avenue: not merely a few blocks but the whole 10 miles of it, from the western end at Brooklyn Bridge Park to Jamaica, Queens. Since 2020, there have been four deaths on the westernmost mile alone. So far this year, traffic injuries have increased on Atlantic between Fourth and Bedford Avenues by roughly a third over the same period in 2022.
Recently, I asked Mr. Orcutt to walk part of the western tip of Atlantic with me, explain the root of the problems and what might be done to solve them. Atlantic is Brooklyn's primary east-west artery, functionally a highway that runs through a series of increasingly dense residential neighborhoods, where construction during the past several years has been more and more active.
We began our analysis on the southwest corner of Atlantic and Hicks Street at the beginning of rush hour, when a steady stream of cars and trucks were aggressively turning left from Hicks, sometimes cramming into three lanes, to make their way onto Atlantic's one-lane entrance ramp to the Brooklyn Queens Expressway typically swerving into the crosswalk. Mr. Orcutt pointed out a proliferation of trucks that were so big they were not legally allowed to pass through many streets in the city, especially in the midst of so many dining sheds that worked to obscure drivers and pedestrians from one another.
Curb extensions that position those crossing the street to be more visible to drivers, while also shortening their distance on the street, were needed, he said. The blocks on Atlantic are long, and he recommended the installation of additional crosswalks in the middle of the blocks. One possible means of mitigating congestion, he continued, was to contain retail deliveries to a night shift and leave one lane closed, reserving it only for parking during the designated period. "At night you would have only one lane in each direction," Mr. Orcutt said, "which would curb your ability to drive like a jerk."
There was also an urgent need for more stringent enforcement. Walking eastward, we saw a cop jaywalking and the driver of an S.U.V. backing into the middle of Atlantic Avenue to make a three-point turn as if he were in a Wal-Mart parking lot.
Three days after Katherine Harris was killed, a group of elected officials and community leaders sent a letter to the transportation commissioner, Ydanis Rodriguez, calling for these and other changes.
American car culture breeds certain kinds of entitlement that are not easily subject to regulation. Rates of roadway death are lower in Canada, France and Finland than they are in the United States, where individualism is the reigning religion and aggression is the natural order. In 1924, then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover organized a conference to deal with what officials were calling the "the homicidal orgy of the motor car." One idea was to form "cooperative organizations," otherwise known as "vigilance committees" that could work with police departments to promote road safety. Maybe now, in the age of social media and its addiction to public shaming, it's an idea whose time has finally come.

Canada Outbids U.S. for Volkswagen Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the assistance was needed to offset incentives offered by the United States.
Volkswagen's first North American battery plant for electric vehicles will be built in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Canadian politicians made it clear on Friday that the country had effectively been in a bidding war with the United States.
"We put up a lot of money," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in St. Thomas, Ontario, where six assembly lines covering 370 acres will be built. "Everyone wanted this."
Volkswagen announced last month that it would put its first battery plant outside Europe in Canada, but provided few details. On Friday, Canada and the province of Ontario said they would give the company a combined 1 billion Canadian dollars -- about $ 750 million in U.S. currency -- to construct the factory, which will cost 7 billion Canadian dollars overall.
A separate agreement will provide 8 billion to 10 billion Canadian dollars in subsidies over the next decade to match benefits that Volkswagen would have received under the Inflation Reduction Act if it had put the factory in the United States. That amount is tied to battery production.
Mr. Trudeau, speaking at a railway museum in front of a steam locomotive and two electric Volkswagen models, said that while it was impossible for Canada to broadly match U.S. industrial subsidies, the deal with Volkswagen had come out of a policy decision by Canada to strategically challenge its neighbor.
Volkswagen considered about a dozen other places in North America for the plant, which it said would eventually employ 3,000 people and make enough batteries annually for one million vehicles.
"Congratulations from our side for outperforming the competition and bringing this gigafactory to St. Thomas," said Frank Blome, the chief executive of PowerCo, Volkswagen's battery subsidiary. "That wasn't easy."
The Volkswagen plant will be the second major battery operation in Ontario. Last year, the automaker Stellantis and the South Korean company LG Energy Solution announced a factory in Windsor, where Stellantis has a large assembly plant that Chrysler built. That factory, which will employ 2,500 people and start production next year, also received substantial government subsidies toward its cost of 5 billion Canadian dollars.
Volkswagen will become the sixth automaker with large operations in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, and the first to establish operations there since Honda and Toyota arrived in the 1980s. St. Thomas was once home to a heavy-truck plant owned by Daimler of Germany as well as a Ford Motor factory that, in its final years, assembled cars primarily used as police cruisers and taxis. Both were closed by 2011 and not replaced by other industries.
After the initial announcement last month, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada, criticized the government for subsidizing Volkswagen.
"This money belongs to Canadians," he wrote on Twitter. "Not to a foreign corporation. Not to Justin Trudeau."
But Andreas Schotter, an associate professor of international business at Western University in London, Ontario, and a former financial executive with Volkswagen North America, said subsidies were the reality for countries seeking to maintain their automotive industries.
"It's a good thing, but with a high risk," he said, noting that policy shifts, particularly in the United States, could slow the transition to electric vehicles or that other technologies, like hydrogen fuel cells, could dislodge batteries over time.
While St. Thomas, which is midway between Detroit and Toronto, is in the center of Canada's automotive corridor, it is a considerable distance from Volkswagen's North American factories in Tennessee and Mexico. It is, however, just down the road from a factory where General Motors recently began building electric delivery vans and a Toyota factory that makes hybrid crossovers.
Over time, Dr. Schotter said, the new factory may end up supplying batteries to other companies.

U.S. Brands Gain Edge With Tax Breaks for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

Full text: Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Mr. Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a G.M. transmission factory in Toledo, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Mr. Belmer says he is excited. G.M. is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
G.M., Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $ 50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Mr. Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. "It's going to be a little bit of a learning curve," he said at the Toledo factory. "But our guys are well equipped to handle this."
Mr. Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. G.M., Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It's an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
"This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception," said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents G.M. workers in Toledo.
Mr. Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is "an expiration date on those facilities and those communities," Mr. Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city has lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, since the 1970s, a process that accelerated after G.M. closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, which produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans, in 2019. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose sport utility vehicles.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about one million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before G.M. closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its work force.
"Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people," said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to start-ups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of G.M. and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old G.M. plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an "electric vehicle academy" established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren's tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for G.M. in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where "nobody knew me, because we had so many new people."
Mr. Franklin represents the optimistic view -- that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos that it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
"We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven't seen in decades," Mr. Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware that the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out, so far. G.M. sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It's not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won't benefit from the new jobs.
Mr. Johnson, whose parents worked for G.M., encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding, and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown.
"There are going to be opportunities coming," he said, "and I desperately don't want to see the next generation of our children miss out."
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
G.M. is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won't need. The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $ 760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, G.M. will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. "We're taking the employees with us."
The G.M. factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that's all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
G.M. has an advantage, Mr. Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. "We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure," he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. "Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs."
Other auto executives prefer to start fresh. Volkswagen's new Scout Motors unit looked at sites in Ohio and other states to produce electric pickup trucks and S.U.V.s, but chose to build a $ 2 billion factory in South Carolina.
It's cheaper and easier to build from scratch, said Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Scout. "You're not juggling this classic dynamic of a legacy internal combustion engine plant where you need to inject a new electric vehicle," he said.
Ohio is in intense competition with other states to attract investment. But Midwestern states, including Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, have been less successful than states in the South where Republican political leaders have courted investment aggressively -- even as they denounce the Democratic policies that helped create the boom.
Since 2020, automakers have announced investments of $ 51 billion in electric vehicle and battery production in the South, compared with $ 31 billion in states in the Great Lakes region, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
Southern states tend to have lower labor costs, in part because most auto plants there are not unionized. This could pose a problem for the United Auto Workers and President Biden, who want the switch to electric vehicles to create more high-paying union jobs. It could well be that most of the new electric car and battery jobs will end up in the South, where unions face political opposition, and not in the Midwest, where unions have political clout -- and where most of the jobs lost in combustion engine vehicles once were.
Ohio has some things going for it. In March, Honda Motor said it would convert one of two assembly lines at its decades-old plant in Marysville, near Columbus, to build electric vehicles. Honda, a Japanese company, is also building a battery factory about an hour away, in Jeffersonville, with LG Energy Solution.
In Ohio, Honda employs more than 14,000 people making cars and motors, and the company's plans will show whether electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline cars, will create or destroy jobs.
For the next several years, the transition will probably create jobs as carmakers make both gasoline and electric vehicles. Bob Nelson, the executive vice president of American Honda Motor, noted that, at the moment, there was a shortage of skilled labor. "We're going to need everybody," he said in Marysville, where Honda makes Accord sedans.
What happens later is less certain. "When you don't have the complexity that we're used to, with engines and transmissions and mufflers and radiators and exhaust systems and all those components that aren't going to be there anymore," said Bruce Baumhower, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents employees of auto suppliers in Ohio, "it makes me wonder what's left."
Dana Incorporated, based in Maumee, near Toledo, is also grappling with that question. Dana's employees -- more than 40,000 of them -- make axles, drive shafts and other parts. Electric vehicles need axles but typically do not need long drive shafts because the motors can be placed close to the wheels.
James Kamsickas, Dana's chief executive, has spent time in China and has been struck by the proliferation of electric vehicles there. Recognizing the threat to some of Dana's products, Mr. Kamsickas acquired several firms with expertise in electric motors and other technology.
Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric-car batteries that G.M. plans to use. Most of Dana's orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio's economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. "You don't have a choice," Mr. Kamsickas said. "Sooner or later, you'd be a melting iceberg."

TOLEDO, Ohio — Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a GM transmission factory in Toledo, Ohio, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Belmer said he is excited. GM is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
GM, Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. “It’s going to be a little bit of a learning curve,” Belmer said at the Toledo factory. “But our guys are well equipped to handle this.”
Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. GM, Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It’s an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
“This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception,” said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents GM workers in Toledo.
Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is “an expiration date on those facilities and those communities,” Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, after GM closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, in 2019, that produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose SUVs.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about 1 million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before GM closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its workforce.
“Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people,” said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to startups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of GM and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old GM plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an “electric vehicle academy” established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren’s tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for GM in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where “nobody knew me, because we had so many new people.”
Franklin represents the optimistic view: that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
“We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven’t seen in decades,” Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out so far. GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It’s not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won’t benefit from the new jobs.
Johnson, whose parents worked for GM, encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown. “ There are going to be opportunities coming,” he said, “and I desperately don’t want to see the next generation of our children miss out.”
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
GM is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won’t need.
The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, GM will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. “We’re taking the employees with us.”
The GM factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that’s all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
GM has an advantage, Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. “We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure,” he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. “Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs.”
Other auto executives prefer to start fresh. Volkswagen’s new Scout Motors unit looked at sites in Ohio and other states to produce electric pickup trucks and SUVs but chose to build a $2 billion factory in South Carolina.
It’s cheaper and easier to build from scratch, said Scott Keogh, the CEO of Scout. “You’re not juggling this classic dynamic of a legacy internal combustion engine plant where you need to inject a new electric vehicle,” he said.
Ohio is in intense competition with other states to attract investment. But Midwestern states, including Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, have been less successful than states in the South where Republican political leaders have courted investment aggressively — even as they denounce the Democratic policies that helped create the boom.
Since 2020, automakers have announced investments of $51 billion in electric vehicle and battery production in the South, compared with $31 billion in states in the Great Lakes region, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
Southern states tend to have lower labor costs, in part because most auto plants there are not unionized. This could pose a problem for the United Auto Workers and President Joe Biden, who want the switch to electric vehicles to create more high-paying union jobs. It could well be that most of the new electric car and battery jobs will end up in the South, where unions face political opposition, and not in the Midwest, where unions have political clout — and where most of the jobs lost in combustion engine vehicles once were.
Ohio has some things going for it. In March, Honda Motor said it would convert one of two assembly lines at its decades-old plant in Marysville, near Columbus, to build electric vehicles. Honda, a Japanese company, is also building a battery factory about an hour away, in Jeffersonville, with LG Energy Solution.
In Ohio, Honda employs more than 14,000 people making cars and motors, and the company’s plans will show whether electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline cars, will create or destroy jobs.
For the next several years, the transition will probably create jobs as carmakers make both gasoline and electric vehicles. Bob Nelson, the executive vice president of American Honda Motor, noted that at the moment, there was a shortage of skilled labor. “We’re going to need everybody,” he said in Marysville, where Honda makes Accord sedans.
What happens later is less certain. “When you don’t have the complexity that we’re used to, with engines and transmissions and mufflers and radiators and exhaust systems and all those components that aren’t going to be there anymore,” said Bruce Baumhower, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents employees of auto suppliers in Ohio, “it makes me wonder what’s left.”
Dana Inc., based in Maumee, near Toledo, is also grappling with that question. Dana’s employees — more than 40,000 of them — make axles, drive shafts and other parts. Electric vehicles need axles but typically do not need long drive shafts because the motors can be placed close to the wheels.
James Kamsickas, Dana’s CEO, has spent time in China and has been struck by the proliferation of electric vehicles there. Recognizing the threat to some of Dana’s products, Kamsickas acquired several firms with expertise in electric motors and other technology.
Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric car batteries that GM plans to use. Most of Dana’s orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio’s economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. “You don’t have a choice,” Kamsickas said. “Sooner or later, you’d be a melting iceberg.”

General Motors Reports Raise in Quarterly Sales, Citing a Robust Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and several rivals cited robust demand in the first quarter. But affordability is a growing challenge for many buyers.
Automakers have mostly overcome the supply-chain challenges that upended production early in the pandemic. Now they are trying to weather a new challenge: higher borrowing costs for their customers.
General Motors and several other automakers reported on Monday that new-vehicle sales increased substantially in the first three months of the year, thanks to improved supplies of key components and firm demand from both consumers and commercial customers.
But the steady interest rate increases in the last 12 months have raised questions about whether the industry can maintain its sales momentum throughout 2023.
Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said higher rates were already starting to put new vehicles out of the reach of buyers with lower incomes or weaker credit scores.
According to Cox, "subprime" borrowers -- those with weaker credit profiles -- make up just under 6 percent of all new-car purchases, down from 18 percent five years ago. Car buyers paid an average interest rate of 8.95 percent last month, up from 5.66 percent in March 2022.
The average monthly payment on new vehicles was $ 784 in February, compared with $ 681 a year earlier, Cox calculated.
"Affordability challenges are limiting access to the vehicle market," Mr. Smoke said. "Higher interest rates are having a huge impact."
Sticker prices have also challenged buyers. Auto prices -- for new and used vehicles alike -- have been a prominent driver of inflation over the last two years, although there are signs they are cooling off. The average price for a new car or light truck in February was $ 48,763, according to Cox -- up from $ 46,297 a year earlier, but down from $ 49,468 in January.
Mr. Smoke said automakers got off to a strong start in January and February, but saw credit tighten somewhat in March after the banking industry was shaken by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
G.M. said its new-vehicle sales in the United States rose 18 percent in the first three months of the year, to 603,208 cars and trucks. Sales to consumers rose 15 percent and sales to rental, corporate and government fleet customers increased 27 percent.
In the last several months, G.M. has been able to keep its factories humming as a result of steadier supplies of computer chips and other critical parts. The company ended the quarter with 412,285 vehicles in dealer stocks, up slightly from what it had at the end of 2022, but nearly 140,000 more than it had a year earlier.
Honda Motor reported that its U.S. sales increased 7 percent to 284,507 cars and trucks, while Nissan saw a gain of 17 percent, to 235,818. Hyundai said its U.S. sales rose 16 percent to 184,449.
Toyota Motor, however, has continued to suffered from parts shortages that have left its dealers with slim inventories. Its first-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 469,558 cars and trucks. Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot SA, also reported a decline. Its sales fell 9 percent to 368,327 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is scheduled to report its latest sales figures on Tuesday.
G.M. has forecast a rapid increase this year in sales of electric vehicles; so far, it is off to an uneven start. The company sold 19,700 Chevrolet Bolt compacts in the first quarter, more than three times the total a year earlier, but other models have yet to make a splash.
Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric sport-utility vehicle, totaled just 968, and G.M. sold only two GMC Hummer E.V.s, down from 99 in the first quarter of 2022.
G.M. started production last summer at a new plant in Ohio that is supposed to provide battery packs for the Hummer E.V., the Lyriq and several other vehicles scheduled to arrive in showrooms this year. They include electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and the Chevy Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s.

Fewer E.V.s Will Qualify For Credits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The shooter was also killed after police officers responded on Monday morning at the Covenant School, the authorities said.
NASHVILLE -- A 28-year-old from Nashville fatally shot three children and three adults on Monday at a private Christian elementary school, officials said, leaving behind writings and detailed maps of the school and its security protocols.
In the latest episode of gun violence that has devastated American families and communities, the assailant opened fire just after 10 a.m. inside the Covenant School, in the affluent Green Hills neighborhood, where children in preschool through sixth grade had just begun their final full week of classes before Easter break.
The shooter, who the police identified as Audrey E. Hale, had entered the building by firing through a side door, armed with two assault-style weapons and a handgun, according to John Drake, the chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, and went to the second floor, firing shots before being killed by the police. Chief Drake said that the assailant was "at one point a student" at the school.
Surveillance video released by the police on Monday night showed the shooter drive up to the school in what the police described as a Honda Fit. In the clip, two sets of glass doors shatter from bullets before the assailant ducks into the building through the broken glass.
Wearing camouflage pants, a black vest and a backward red baseball cap, the assailant walks through rooms and hallways with a weapon drawn. At one point, the shooter can be seen walking in and out of the church office and down a hallway past the children's ministry, as the lights of what appear to be a fire alarm flash.
There was confusion about the gender identity of the assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Chief Drake said the shooter identified as transgender. Officials used "she" and "her" to refer to the shooter, but, according to a social media post and a LinkedIn profile, the shooter appeared to identify as male in recent months.
The police in Nashville identified the six victims as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9; Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian; and Katherine Koonce, 60. Dr. Koonce was the head of school, according to the school website. Hallie Scruggs was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to a biography published online by his former church in Dallas. Covenant Presbyterian is connected to the elementary school.
Chief Drake said it was too early to discuss a possible motive for the shooting, though he confirmed that the attack was targeted. The authorities were reviewing writings, and had made contact with the shooter's father, Chief Drake said.
"We have a map drawn out of how this was all going to take place," he said. "There's right now a theory that we may be able to talk about later but it's not confirmed, so we'll put that out as soon as we can."
The shooting shattered the wealthy enclave of Green Hills, a few miles south of downtown Nashville, where the small school and stone church sit atop a hill, nestled in a residential neighborhood filled with stately homes and lush landscaping. Founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, the Covenant School bills itself as "intentionally small" with about 200 students, according to its website, and a student-to-teacher ratio of 8 to 1. Tuition costs around $ 16,000 per year.
Sirens and the buzz of helicopters pierced the still of a sunny spring morning on Monday, sending residents of the area out of their homes to wait for news about the shooting or assurances that their children at neighboring schools had been released from lockdown. A few women gathered around a livestream of the news conference, gasping and shaking their heads.
"It's terrifying when you see parents running up the hill," said Lisa DeBusk, 43, who lives in Green Hills. She said she had considered sending her daughter to Covenant, calling it "the sweetest, most wonderful place."
"We're all resilient, but we shouldn't have to be in this," she added. "I never would have imagined this."
The police received a report of the shooting at 10:13 a.m. and heard gunshots on the second floor when they arrived at the school, a police spokesman, Don Aaron, said. Officers went there, saw the assailant shooting, and two of the officers opened fire, killing the assailant at 10:27 a.m. in a "lobby-type area" on the second floor, Mr. Aaron said. The school does not have a police officer guarding it, he said.
Kendra Loney, a spokeswoman for the Nashville Fire Department, said that schoolchildren and members of the school's staff were escorted out of the building after the shooting, and that a total of 108 people had been transported to the nearby Woodmont Baptist Church.
The pupils -- dressed in the school uniform of red and black polo shirts, plaid skirts and khaki shorts and pants -- held hands as they walked from the buses, escorted by the police, into a conference-like room inside the church. Elsewhere in the building, parents waited to learn if their children were safe.
Rachael Anne Elrod, the Metro Nashville School Board chair, said she was inside "the worst waiting room you can imagine" as officials set about reuniting children with their parents. Some, she said, were debating how to manage the rest of the day after such a traumatic morning.
"They are mostly figuring out how they are going to talk to their children going forward about this," Ms. Elrod said. "What is the next best step? What should they do next? Do we take them to get ice cream? Take them to the playground? Do we ask them what they saw? Do we not ask them what they saw? Do we bring them to school tomorrow? Is there school tomorrow?"
Rachel Dibble, whose children attend a different private school in Nashville, had also visited with Covenant families, some of whom she knew through youth sports.
"It has to stop," Ms. Dibble said of school shootings. "I want a politician to sit in a church with families and 250 kids downstairs that are white as a sheet and trembling and gray and yellow and green and blue because of the shock."
Speaking of the students, she added: "They started this morning, they had their cute little uniforms on, they probably had some Froot Loops. Their whole lives changed today."
There is no consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting; groups define it differently, depending on the circumstances. But the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks gun violence using police reports, news coverage and other public sources, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed or injured. As of late March, the archive has counted 130 mass shootings in the United States in 2023.
Calling the Nashville shooting "sick" and "a family's worst nightmare," President Biden again pushed Congress on Monday to enact gun-control legislation. He has repeatedly called for such a ban on assault weapons, including during his recent visit to Monterey Park, Calif., where a gunman killed 11 people at a dance studio in January.
"It's about time that we begin to make some progress," Mr. Biden said.
Even as school shootings become more frequent, the shooting at Covenant was unusual.
Many of the highest-profile school shootings in recent years have taken place at public schools, in part because there are far more public schools in the United States: nearly 100,000, compared with about 30,000 private schools.
Shootings at elementary schools are also relatively uncommon, making up less than 20 percent of all incidents of gun violence on school grounds, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. Most incidents of gun violence on school campuses, including active shooter incidents, happen at high schools.
After spending time in Woodmont Baptist, Melissa Trevathan, the owner of a counseling ministry, grieved the loss of Dr. Koonce, whom she said she had gotten to know through her work with children. Ms. Trevathan, who had come with Pippa, a therapy dog in training, to offer support, characterized Dr. Koonce as "very magnetic" and strong, and recalled her passion for education, sense of humor and love for adventure.
"She would go the ultimate in protecting her kids," Ms. Trevathan said.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A 28-year-old from Nashville fatally shot three children and three adults on Monday at a private Christian elementary school, officials said, leaving behind writings and detailed maps of the school and its security protocols.
In the latest episode of gun violence that has devastated American families and communities, the assailant opened fire just after 10 a.m. inside the Covenant School, in the affluent Green Hills neighborhood, where children in preschool through sixth grade had just begun their final full week of classes before Easter break.
The shooter, whom the police identified as Audrey Hale, had entered the building by firing through a side door, armed with two assault-style weapons and a handgun, according to John Drake, the chief of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, and went to the second floor, firing shots before being killed by police. Drake said the assailant was “at one point a student” at the school.
Surveillance video released by police Monday night showed the shooter drive up to the school in what police described as a Honda Fit. In the clip, two sets of glass doors shatter from bullets before the assailant ducks into the building through the broken glass.
Wearing camouflage pants, a black vest and a backward red baseball cap, the assailant walks through rooms and hallways with a weapon drawn. At one point, the shooter can be seen walking in and out of the church office and down a hallway past the children’s ministry, as the lights of what appear to be a fire alarm flash.
There was confusion about the gender identity of the assailant in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Drake said the shooter identified as transgender. Officials used “she” and “her” to refer to the shooter, but, according to a social media post and a LinkedIn profile, the shooter appeared to identify as male in recent months.
Police in Nashville identified the six victims as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9; Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian; and Katherine Koonce, 60. Koonce was the head of school, according to the school website.
Hallie Scruggs was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, the pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to a biography published online by his former church in Dallas. Covenant Presbyterian is connected to the elementary school.
Drake said it was too early to discuss a possible motive for the shooting, although he confirmed that the attack was targeted. Authorities were reviewing writings, and had made contact with the shooter’s father, Drake said.
“We have a map drawn out of how this was all going to take place,” he said. “There’s right now a theory that we may be able to talk about later but it’s not confirmed, so we’ll put that out as soon as we can.”
The shooting shattered the wealthy enclave of Green Hills, a few miles south of downtown Nashville, where the small school and stone church sit atop a hill, nestled in a residential neighborhood filled with stately homes and lush landscaping. Founded in 2001 as a ministry of the Covenant Presbyterian Church, the Covenant School bills itself as “intentionally small” with about 200 students, according to its website, and a student-to-teacher ratio of 8-1. Tuition costs around $16,000 per year.
Sirens and the buzz of helicopters pierced the still of a sunny spring morning on Monday, sending residents of the area out of their homes to wait for news about the shooting or assurances that their children at neighboring schools had been released from lockdown. A few women gathered around a livestream of the news conference, gasping and shaking their heads.
“It’s terrifying when you see parents running up the hill,” said Lisa DeBusk, 43, who lives in Green Hills. She said she had considered sending her daughter to Covenant, calling it “the sweetest, most wonderful place.”
“We’re all resilient, but we shouldn’t have to be in this,” she added. “I never would have imagined this.”

LG to Spend $5.5 Billion on Battery Factory in Arizona: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Investment plans for U.S. battery production have increased since President Biden signed a law that offers generous incentives for electric cars and green energy.
A South Korean battery manufacturer said it would quadruple its planned investment in a new factory in Arizona to meet growing demand from automakers that are trying to ramp up production of electric cars and trucks.
The company, LG Energy Solution, said it would invest $ 5.5 billion to build the complex near Phoenix, where it plans to make batteries for electric vehicles in 2025 and for energy storage systems the next year.
LG said its decision was driven in part by the Inflation Reduction Act, which became law in August and included federal incentives for the sale and production of electric vehicles and batteries in the United States. Customers of LG, which is one of the world's largest makers of batteries for electric cars and energy storage devices, include General Motors, Ford Motor, Honda and Tesla.
"We believe it's the right move at the right time in order to empower clean energy transition in the U.S.," Youngsoo Kwon, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.
The multibillion-dollar investment is the latest by battery and auto companies since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act.
Last month, Ford said it would build a $ 3.5 billion battery factory in Michigan, where it would use technology and services provided by the world's largest battery manufacturer, the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited, known as CATL. Ford is also building battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee with another South Korean company, SK On.
In December, the Department of Energy said it would lend $ 2.5 billion to Ultium Cells, a joint venture owned by General Motors and LG, to build battery factories in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan. Honda and LG are also investing $ 3.5 billion to build a battery plant in Ohio.
A wave of new factories is expected to increase battery manufacturing capacity in North America tenfold from 2021 to 2030, according to a recent report from the Argonne National Laboratory.
Building batteries in the United States could help lower electric vehicle prices by cutting transportation costs while reducing dependence on China, which dominates the battery supply chain. In addition, the Biden administration is trying to encourage domestic mining and processing of battery raw materials like lithium, as well as speed up construction of electric vehicle chargers along highways.

Bed Bath & Beyond
Still Has Stock Price Issue
Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond edged higher Tuesday, but the stock remained under $ 1, leaving the home goods retailer at risk of losing additional funding from the hedge fund Hudson Bay Capital Management, a pivotal investor.
Bed Bath & Beyond's stock dropped 21 percent on Monday to end at 81 cents after the company said late Friday that it was seeking shareholder approval for a reverse stock split. At the close of trading on Tuesday, it was up 1 percent at 82 cents.
The struggling retailer reached an amended agreement with Hudson last week to temporarily lower the stock price threshold to $ 1 until April 3, aimed at allowing for up to $ 100 million additional funding in April 2023.
Bed Bath & Beyond last month said it was planning to raise some $ 1 billion through a complex offering of preferred stock and warrants in an effort to avoid bankruptcy. The stock is down about 67 percent for the year. REUTERS
AUTOMOBILES
Steering Glitch Reported
On Newer Honda Civics
Auto safety regulators are investigating complaints from Honda Civic drivers that their steering can stick, causing a momentary increase in effort and increasing the risk of a crash.
The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers an estimated 238,000 Civics from the 2022 and 2023 model years.
The agency says it has 145 complaints about the problem, which happens mostly at highway speeds. The complaints came over the past 11 months.
NHTSA has no reports of crashes or injuries from the problem. The agency will determine how many vehicles are affected and how severe the problem is. A recall is possible.
Honda said that it will cooperate with the investigation, which is in its early stages. The company also is doing an internal review.
The company says most of the Civics should be under warranty, and that if any owner feels something is not right, they should contact their dealer.

Chinese Shopping App
Is Suspended by Google
Google has suspended the Chinese shopping app Pinduoduo on its app store after malware was discovered in versions of the app from other sources.
Google said in a statement Tuesday that it suspended the Pinduoduo app on the Google Play app store out of "security concerns" and that it was investigating the matter.
The suspension of the Pinduoduo app -- mainly used in China -- comes amid heightened U.S.-China tensions over Chinese-owned apps such as TikTok, which some U.S. lawmakers say could be a national security threat.
They allege that such apps could be used to spy on American users.
Pinduoduo is a popular e-commerce app in China which often offers discounts if users team up to buy multiples of an item. Google warned users Tuesday to uninstall any Pinduoduo app not downloaded from its own Play Store.

California Levee Failures Mount as Storms Continue Relentless Drive

PAJARO, Calif. — It began as a trickle, seeping through a 74-year-old earthen levee in Northern California, dribs and drabs of the Pajaro River, swollen with rain yet again on Friday night. Then pools bubbled up on beyond the levee walls, spreading toward darkened fields of strawberries and lettuce. Four miles downstream, the farmworker community of Pajaro slept.
Within half an hour, according to Mark Strudley, the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency’s executive director, sandbag crews were swarming the scene in “full flood fight.” But in the latest example of how California’s vast and aging infrastructure is being tested by this year’s onslaught of extreme winter weather, the crews could not keep up.
As they backed away, the river burst with a mighty roar through the worn-down levee, flooding freeways and farms, submerging the entire town of Pajaro and forcing thousands of residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties to flee.
“I have to start from zero,” Antonio Arroyo, a 58-year-old farmworker, said Tuesday as he sat in an evacuation center at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds with about 300 displaced residents from the same community, known for harvesting strawberries. He had been sleeping in a Honda minivan when firefighters rescued him from the rising floodwaters in Pajaro; the donated red sneakers, bluejeans, sweater and plaid shirt he was wearing were “all I have,” he said.
As a fresh atmospheric river ravaged California on Tuesday, causing high winds and flooding from Southern California to the Oregon border, water experts warned that the recent storms could be just a prelude to an even more challenging spring.
Already, the landscape is beyond saturated after a winter that has set or approached records for precipitation. By Tuesday afternoon, heavy rain reached the Los Angeles Basin, where officials warned residents to avoid driving through flooded roadways and fire authorities said they rescued eight people and eight dogs from the San Gabriel River in Azusa late Monday.
In the Bay Area and Central Coast, strong winds downed power lines and tall trees. More than 350,000 utility customers were without power at one point Tuesday, most of them customers of Pacific Gas and Electric in hard-hit Northern California, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks blackouts. Gusts of up to 74 mph were recorded at San Francisco International Airport, where operations were paused briefly after the FAA issued a ground stop.
Water from the Pajaro River breached a levee on Tuesday, forcing the closure of a portion of Highway 1 until the safety of bridges could be assessed.
More than 1,500 dams and some 14,000 miles of levees help control California’s waterways, according to federal statistics. And this year’s storms are capping the driest three years on record, noted Gary Lippner, deputy director of dam safety and flood management with the state’s Department of Water Resources.
“California,” he said, “has experienced true climate whiplash this year.”
Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California, a research organization, said the cumulative effect of this winter’s back-to-back storms had left California in “uncharted territory,” particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack was the largest recorded.
As the snowpack melts, he said, and dam managers are forced to release water from fast-filling reservoirs to make room for incoming rain, flood-prone communities could become overwhelmed.
“It is worth remembering that almost all of our flood management infrastructure is more than a half-century old and designed around the climate of the past,” Mount said Tuesday in an email.
“While we have had many discussions about adapting to droughts of the future — and are making progress — we are still in the most nascent stages of thinking about how to adapt to larger floods.”
Statewide, the winter storms have stressed the state’s infrastructure since January, particularly in low-lying, inland areas crisscrossed by rivers. Along the Cosumnes River near Sacramento, where more than a dozen levee breaches flooded roads and inundated homes during storms around New Year’s Day, communities are still recovering.
To the north of the state Capitol, the authorities who maintain the watershed that encompasses the Sacramento International Airport said that when one of their pumps exploded this year during a powerful storm system, they discovered that their equipment was so old that the manufacturer no longer carried the parts they needed to fix it.
”We managed to get it back online with a $600 part we found on eBay,” said Kevin L. King, the general manager of Reclamation District No. 1000, an agency formed to maintain levees and protect acreage from flooding. “We were within 12 to 24 hours of telling the airport to reroute flights because there would have been water flooding the runways.”
Strudley said that federal, state and local officials had talked since the 1960s about the need to shore up the water infrastructure around the Pajaro River, but the property values in the area were so low that they did not meet the threshold for repair under the cost-benefit formula that the federal government and the Army Corps of Engineers were using.
That approach, which systemically disadvantaged poorer communities, has begun to change, he said. A major project to upgrade and strengthen the local levees at an estimated cost of more than $500 million was underway when the storm hit, and the flood has prompted local officials to begin talks with the federal government about expediting its planned 2025 groundbreaking, Strudley said.
Even so, he added, the project is expected to take eight to 10 years.
In Watsonville, across the river from their community of Pajaro, displaced farmworkers said it was unclear how long they could hold out with both their homes and the fields they depend on for paychecks underwater. Some said they had been living in their cars for days, not knowing where to go.
The working-class agricultural region is tucked between the beaches of Santa Cruz that are popular with surfers, and the wealthy Monterey Peninsula known for its world-class Pebble Beach Golf Links. Often cloaked in fog near the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, workers in the Pajaro Valley pick strawberries and harvest lettuce and artichokes savored by the rest of the nation.
Marina Hernandez, 31, said she received a knock on the door just after midnight Saturday from a county worker saying her family had an hour to evacuate. She called her husband, who was working an overnight shift about 20 miles away at a garlic packing plant in Gilroy, and then quickly collected important documents, like birth certificates and Social Security cards.
But she said county officials did not tell her where to find shelter, so she and her family were living for a few days in their pickup truck. “All they said was: ‘Get out! Get out!’ But they didn’t tell us where to go. Nothing.”
Finally, after being sent away from the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds because the evacuation center was over capacity, she found her way Tuesday afternoon to a small shelter set up in the gymnasium of a veterans hall in Watsonville.
Sitting on a cot with her 14-month-old daughter as her 5-year-old son lay playing with his phone on another cot, Hernandez said she was sad and frustrated and had no idea the condition of her home.
Weeks might pass, she said, before she and her family could go back. Until then, she said, “I’m not able to do anything.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: PAJARO, Calif. -- It began as a trickle, seeping through a 74-year-old earthen levee in Northern California, dribs and drabs of the Pajaro River, swollen with rain yet again on Friday night. Then pools bubbled up on beyond the levee walls, spreading toward darkened fields of strawberries and lettuce. Four miles downstream, the farmworker community of Pajaro slept.
Within half an hour, according to Mark Strudley, the Pajaro Regional Flood Management Agency's executive director, sandbag crews were swarming the scene in "full flood fight." But in the latest example of how California's vast and aging infrastructure is being tested by this year's onslaught of extreme winter weather, the crews could not keep up.
As they backed away, the river burst with a mighty roar through the worn-down levee, flooding freeways and farms, submerging the entire town of Pajaro and forcing thousands of residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties to flee.
"I have to start from zero," Antonio Arroyo, a 58-year-old farmworker, said on Tuesday as he sat in an evacuation center at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds with about 300 displaced residents from the same community, known for harvesting strawberries. He had been sleeping in a Honda minivan when firefighters rescued him from the rising floodwaters in Pajaro; the donated red sneakers, blue jeans, sweater and plaid shirt he was wearing were "all I have," he said.
As a fresh atmospheric river ravaged California on Tuesday, causing high winds and flooding from Southern California to the Oregon border, water experts warned that the recent storms could be just a prelude to an even more challenging spring.
Already, the landscape is beyond saturated after a winter that has set or approached records for precipitation. By Tuesday afternoon, heavy rain reached the Los Angeles Basin, where officials warned residents to avoid driving through flooded roadways and fire authorities said they rescued eight people and eight dogs from the San Gabriel River in Azusa late Monday.
In the Bay Area and Central Coast, strong winds downed power lines and tall trees. More than 350,000 utility customers were without power at one point on Tuesday, most of them customers of Pacific Gas and Electric in hard-hit Northern California, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks blackouts. Gusts of up to 74 miles per hour were recorded at San Francisco International Airport, where operations were paused briefly after the F.A.A. issued a ground stop.
Water from the Pajaro River breached a levee on Tuesday, forcing the closure of a portion of Highway 1 until the safety of bridges could be assessed.
More than 1,500 dams and some 14,000 miles of levees help control California's waterways, according to federal statistics. And this year's storms are capping the driest three years on record, noted Gary Lippner, deputy director of dam safety and flood management with the state's Department of Water Resources.
"California," he said, "has experienced true climate whiplash this year."
Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow specializing in water at the Public Policy Institute of California, a research organization, said that the cumulative effect of this winter's back-to-back storms had left California in "uncharted territory," particularly in the southern Sierra Nevada, where the water content of the snowpack was the largest ever recorded.
As the snowpack melts, he said, and dam managers are forced to release water from fast-filling reservoirs to make room for incoming rain, flood-prone communities could become overwhelmed.
"It is worth remembering that almost all of our flood management infrastructure is more than a half-century old and designed around the climate of the past," Mr. Mount said on Tuesday in an email.
"While we have had many discussions about adapting to droughts of the future -- and are making progress -- we are still in the most nascent stages of thinking about how to adapt to larger floods."
Statewide, the winter storms have stressed the state's infrastructure since January, particularly in low-lying, inland areas crisscrossed by rivers. Along the Cosumnes River near Sacramento, where more than a dozen levee breaches flooded roads and inundated homes during storms around New Year's Day, communities are still recovering.
To the north of the State Capitol, the authorities who maintain the watershed that encompasses the Sacramento International Airport said that when one of their pumps exploded this year during a powerful storm system, they discovered that their equipment was so old that the manufacturer no longer carried the parts they needed to fix it.
"We managed to get it back online with a $ 600 part we found on eBay," said Kevin L. King, the general manager of Reclamation District No. 1000, an agency formed to maintain levees and protect acreage from flooding. "We were within 12 to 24 hours of telling the airport to reroute flights because there would have been water flooding the runways."
Mr. Strudley said that federal, state and local officials had talked since the 1960s about the need to shore up the water infrastructure around the Pajaro River, but the property values in the area were so low that they did not meet the threshold for repair under the cost-benefit formula that the federal government and the Army Corps of Engineers were using.
That approach, which systemically disadvantaged poorer communities, has begun to change, he said. A major project to upgrade and strengthen the local levees at an estimated cost of more than $ 500 million was underway when the storm hit, and the flood has prompted local officials to begin talks with the federal government about expediting its planned 2025 groundbreaking, Mr. Strudley said.

Thomas Donahue, Influential Leader of Organized Labor, Dies at 94: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A one-time doorman and bus driver, he became an assistant secretary of labor but fell short of his goal of being elected head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Thomas R. Donahue, the second in command to Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for 16 years, and briefly his interim successor in an era of relentless union membership declines and diminished influence by organized labor in American life, died on Saturday in Washington, D.C. He was 94.
He was suffering from several health issues and was hospitalized on Thursday after a fall, his wife, Rachelle Horowitz, said.
A Bronx janitor's son, Mr. Donahue worked as a baker, a bus driver and a doorman at Radio City Music Hall and later became a lawyer, an assistant secretary of labor in Washington and one of the most influential leaders of the postwar trade union movement.
In 1973, he succeeded Mr. Kirkland as executive assistant to George Meany, the old warrior who had merged the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1955 and was the newly formed organization's president.
In 1979, Mr. Donahue again succeeded Mr. Kirkland, this time as secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The position was one step below the presidency, labor's most powerful post. And when Mr. Kirkland was deposed as president by a revolt of constituent union leaders in August 1995, Mr. Donahue was named interim president, the heir apparent pending election at the federation's convention in October.
But the prize that Mr. Donahue had coveted for decades -- leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the policymaking umbrella organization for 78 unions and 13.3 million workers -- remained his for only three months.
Years of rank-and-file frustration with labor's decline boiled over at the convention, and the tide that had swept Mr. Kirkland away caught Mr. Donahue in its tow. Despite his pledge of institutional reforms, he was soundly defeated by an insurgent slate led by John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
"John Sweeney's victory over Thomas Donahue in the first contested election for the leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. yesterday reflected the labor federation's recognition that it must change or continue to shrivel," a New York Times day-after editorial said. "Mr. Donahue was shackled by the old craft-union legacy and came across as representing a failed status quo."
Mr. Donahue soon retired.
As Mr. Kirkland's lieutenant throughout the 1980s and early '90s, Mr. Donahue shared the scorn of disgruntled unionists as one industrial plant after another closed and the service economy grew rapidly with little union organization. Jobs went to foreign competition and to new processes, while strike after strike was lost, including one by the nation's air traffic controllers in 1981.
There were also major successes in the Kirkland-Donahue years. Autoworkers, mine workers, longshoremen, warehousemen and the Teamsters joined or rejoined the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The first woman was placed on the organization's executive council and the participation of Black and Hispanic people on the council was raised, though hardly enough to satisfy critics.
But the number of unionized workers fell to 15.5 percent from 24 percent of the American work force in the Kirkland-Donahue years. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political power also faded, as fights were repeatedly lost in Congress. A notable loss was the failure in 1993 to block passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which unions had opposed in anticipation of American job losses to Mexico.
Despite being subordinate to Mr. Kirkland, Mr. Donahue was an influential union leader. He oversaw A.F.L-C.I.O lobbying, petition drives and a $ 3.2 million budget for advertising and promotion campaigns. He helped build a working coalition between the federation and environmentalists, notably the Sierra Club and the National Toxics Campaign.
And he was a prominent A.F.L.-C.I.O. spokesman in the losing fight against NAFTA. He appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CNN's "Late Edition"; wrote articles, letters to editors and opinion pieces for leading newspapers; and testified before Congress at least nine times.
Mr. Donahue created programs that offered consumer benefits to millions of union members, including mortgage assistance, credit cards and supplemental medical insurance with discounts for vision and dental care. And he was instrumental in international union work, supporting the Solidarity movement against Poland's Communist regime and an investment boycott of apartheid South Africa.
Thomas Reilly Donahue Jr. was born in the Bronx on Sept. 4, 1928, the youngest of four children of Thomas and Mary (Purcell) Donahue, second-generation Irish American Catholics. His father's wages jumped when he became a unionized construction worker.
He attended Bronx parochial schools and graduated in 1944 from Mount St. Michael Academy, a Marist Brothers high school in the Bronx. He joined the Navy as World War II ended.
He married Natalie Kiernan in 1950. They had two children: Nancy and Thomas III, before divorcing in 1975. In 1979, he married Ms. Horowitz, director of political action for the American Federation of Teachers.
In addition to Ms. Horowitz, he is survived by his daughter, Nancy Donahue, and six grandchildren. His son died of a gastric hemorrhage in 2018.
Mr. Donahue began his labor career in 1948 as a part-time organizer for the Retail Clerks International Association. He earned a bachelor's degree in labor relations at Manhattan College in 1949.
Over the next eight years, he was a business agent, contract director and publications editor for the Service Employees International Union. He also studied economics at New York University and, after taking night classes for several years, received a law degree from Fordham University in 1956.
He worked in Paris from 1957 to 1960 for the Free Europe Committee, an American labor program that aided union exiles from Communist countries. On returning, he became an aide to the president of the Service Employees International Union for seven years, moving to Washington in 1963. He was an assistant secretary of labor in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration from 1967 to 1969.
Mr. Donahue jumped at the chance to become Mr. Meany's assistant four years later. He also began his long association with Mr. Kirkland, following him into the upper echelons of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to the pinnacle of union power.
After leaving the union in 1995, he remained in Washington, serving on the boards of foundations and government panels, including the National Endowment for Democracy and the State Department's advisory committee on labor diplomacy.
He rarely spoke publicly about his short presidency or the election defeat that ended his life in the union. But in a 1997 interview for a Library of Congress oral history project, Mr. Donahue touched on the matter.
"I lost," he said. "I lost with a great deal of dignity, I want you to know. But I lost!"

Beneath a Car's Chassis Lies a Thief's Treasure: [Metropolitan]

Full text: In New York City, thefts of catalytic converters, known as 'cats,' rose by nearly 5,000 in one year.
In December of 2021, David Aujero walked out of his home in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, got into his 2002 Honda Element, and turned on the ignition. The sound that came from his car was a rumbling roar, as if someone had swapped his engine with that of a dump truck. "I thought maybe the car had to warm up a little, but the sound was really loud," said Mr. Aujero, a video director for technology brands.
When he took his Honda to the repair shop, the mechanic knew what was wrong before Mr. Aujero stepped out of his car: His catalytic converter had been stolen. "It was the fourth case my mechanic had seen that week," he said.
Catalytic converters, or "cats" for short, are valuable because they contain precious metals that can be extracted and resold for up to $ 50 per gram. Nationwide, thefts of the device increased by well over 1,000 percent in 2019, according to a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
In New York City, reported thefts jumped from 2,070 to 7,000 between 2021 and 2022, according to a New York Police Department spokesman. The incidents were equally distributed throughout the city, with the highest overall numbers recorded in the Bronx, Queens, and south Brooklyn. Just this week, police officers interrupted a theft in progress -- the person apprehended was using a large power saw -- in Washington Heights.
Kevin Wright, a mechanic in Midtown, who said the problem had not been this bad in 20 years, blamed the pandemic. John Mouras, another mechanic in Greenpoint, agreed. "I figure it's a lot of people not having work and trying to find a way to survive financially," he said. But there is also evidence that the robberies have ties to organized crime. In November of last year, the Justice Department busted a nationwide ring of "thieves, dealers, and processors," seizing $ 545 million in assets from 21 people, including two men from Long Island.
The device, which looks like a metal hot water bottle, is found in the car's underbody and is part of its exhaust system. It has been standard in nearly every vehicle manufactured since 1975 because of the Clean Air Act. It converts harmful emissions like carbon monoxide into safe ones like steam through the use of a chemical catalyst (hence the name).
The magic ingredients of that chemical catalyst are the precious metals rhodium, palladium and platinum; the latter two cost between $ 30 and $ 50 per gram. Each converter contains several grams of each metal and can fetch as much as $ 1,000 at unscrupulous scrap yards. The converters can be clipped off a car with a battery-powered saw in minutes, and thieves can pick off entire rows of vehicles in under an hour.
Mimi Pak had her converter clipped from her 2012 Toyota Prius in the summer of 2022. She had driven to Astoria, Queens, from her home in New Jersey to visit a friend, parking on a quiet residential street for just a few hours. But when she came back and started up her car, a sudden, off-putting roar came from the tailpipe. "It sounded like a Harley Davidson revving right outside my window," said Ms. Pak, a teacher. "I waited for it to pass me on the street but realized that the sound was coming from my car."
Ms. Pak took her vehicle to a Toyota dealership to have the part replaced last August, but she was told it would be months until the part was available. Catalytic converters on hybrid cars are especially attractive to thieves, as their reduced emissions mean less wear on the palladium and platinum catalysts.
Global supply chain issues surrounding the precious metals have been an issue since the onset of the pandemic, and now there are concerns, stemming from the Russia-Ukraine War, that Russia, which supplies 40 percent of the world's palladium, according to Moody's analytics, could pull its supply off the market. "My converter got stolen in August, and I just got my car back in January," Ms. Pak said.
As a preventive measure, the New York Police Department has created a system in which car owners can etch a serial code into their catalytic converters and enter it into an online database. Still, that hasn't made thieves any less brazen. In 2021, Dan Segal and Lana Samad were preparing to drive across the country in a 1999 R.V. when their catalytic converter was stolen outside an auto body shop in the Bronx the night before they were scheduled to leave.
"We came back in the morning to pick up the R.V. and our mechanic was panicked. They had caught the whole thing on video," said Mr. Segal, a management consultant who now lives in Oakland, Calif. "It was just one guy with an electric saw at 4 a.m. who was in and out in less than a minute."

The incidents were equally distributed throughout the city, with the highest overall numbers recorded in the Bronx, Queens, and south Brooklyn. Just this week, police officers interrupted a theft in progress — the person apprehended was using a large power saw — in Washington Heights.
Kevin Wright, a mechanic in midtown who said the problem had not been this bad in 20 years, blamed the pandemic. John Mouras, another mechanic in Greenpoint, agreed. “I figure it’s a lot of people not having work and trying to find a way to survive financially,” he said. But there is also evidence that the robberies have ties to organized crime. In November of last year, the Justice Department busted a nationwide ring of “thieves, dealers, and processors,” seizing $545 million in assets from 21 people, including two men from Long Island.
The device, which looks like a metal hot water bottle, is found in the car’s underbody and is part of its exhaust system. It has been standard in nearly every vehicle manufactured since 1975 because of the Clean Air Act. It converts harmful emissions like carbon monoxide into safe ones like steam through the use of a chemical catalyst (hence the name).
The magic ingredients of that chemical catalyst are the precious metals rhodium, palladium and platinum; the latter two cost between $30 and $50 per gram. Each converter contains several grams of each metal and can fetch as much as $1,000 at unscrupulous scrap yards. The converters can be clipped off a car with a battery-powered saw in minutes, and thieves can pick off entire rows of vehicles in under an hour.
Mimi Pak had her converter clipped from her 2012 Toyota Prius in the summer of 2022. She had driven to Astoria, Queens, from her home in New Jersey to visit a friend, parking on a quiet residential street for just a few hours. But when she came back and started up her car, a sudden, off-putting roar came from the tailpipe. “It sounded like a Harley Davidson revving right outside my window,” said Pak, a teacher. “I waited for it to pass me on the street but realized that the sound was coming from my car.”
Pak took her vehicle to a Toyota dealership to have the part replaced last August, but she was told it would be months until the part was available. Catalytic converters on hybrid cars are especially attractive to thieves, as their reduced emissions mean less wear on the palladium and platinum catalysts.
Global supply chain issues surrounding the precious metals have been an issue since the onset of the pandemic, and now there are concerns, stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, that Russia, which supplies 40% of the world’s palladium, according to Moody’s analytics, could pull its supply off the market. “My converter got stolen in August, and I just got my car back in January,” Pak said.
As a preventive measure, the New York Police Department has created a system in which car owners can etch a serial code into their catalytic converters and enter it into an online database. Still, that hasn’t made thieves any less brazen. In 2021, Dan Segal and Lana Samad were preparing to drive across the country in a 1999 RV when their catalytic converter was stolen outside an auto body shop in the Bronx the night before they were scheduled to leave.
“We came back in the morning to pick up the RV, and our mechanic was panicked. They had caught the whole thing on video,” said Segal, a management consultant who now lives in Oakland, California. “It was just one guy with an electric saw at 4 a.m. who was in and out in less than a minute.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He pushed the company into North America and beyond, setting it on its path to becoming one of the world's most powerful automakers.
TOKYO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, the chief of the automotive giant Toyota, who led the company as it expanded production into North America in the 1980s and helped transform it into a global brand, died on Tuesday. The son of the company's founder, he was 97.
Toyota said in a statement that the cause was heart failure. It did not say where he had died.
In a decade at Toyota's helm, Mr. Toyoda marshaled his considerable skills in engineering, management, politics and diplomacy to put the company on the path to passing General Motors as the world's largest automaker.
The accomplishment was all the more impressive because he took charge of Toyota at the height of U.S.-Japan trade tensions, in 1982, when Japanese cars had become a powerful symbol of American fears of a rising Japan replacing the United States as the world's largest economic power.
Despite those tensions, Mr. Toyoda expanded his company's production into North America, first forming an alliance with General Motors in 1984 before opening the company's first American plant, in Kentucky, in 1988, yielding to American pressure to produce cars in the United States.
By the end of his tenure, he had expanded production globally, making the company truly international.
Mr. Toyoda took a pragmatic approach to relations between the United States and Japan -- then the world's first and second largest economies -- arguing that as Japan rose, it needed to work harder to ingratiate itself with its competitors, a message that he made part of Toyota's corporate philosophy.
After stepping down as Toyota's chief executive, in 1994, he became the head of Japan's most powerful business lobby, where he helped shape the country's efforts to fight the economic stagnation that began in the early 1990s.
Shoichiro Toyoda was born on Feb. 27, 1925, in Nagoya, an industrial port city in central Japan, the second of four children of Kiichiro and Hatako Toyoda. He enjoyed a privileged childhood: In a 2014 column for the newspaper Nikkei Shimbun, he recounted how his elementary school classmates had teased him when he revealed that he breakfasted with his family's "maidservant."
His father founded Toyota Motor in 1937, spinning it off from an automatic loom manufacturer started by his father, Sakichi. The "d" in Toyoda was changed to a "t" in the company name because it was thought that it looked better when written in Japanese.
During World War II, Mr. Toyoda began studies at Nagoya University. He was passed over for the military draft because his major, engineering, was considered vital for the war effort, he wrote in the Nikkei article. When the war ended, he enrolled in a graduate program in Tohoku University and later received a doctorate from Nagoya University.
In 1950, a debt-racked Toyota split into two companies, one for manufacturing, which Kiichiro Toyoda ran, and the other for sales. Faced with a festering labor dispute, Kiichiro Toyoda was forced to resign, temporarily ending the family's leadership of the company. He died soon after.
Shoichiro Toyoda joined the company at 27 as director of the inspection department. Early in his career he played a key role in Toyota's first foray into the United States, signing off in 1957 on the export of the company's Crown model after taking it on an American road trip, which included a cheeky stop in front of Ford's headquarters in Detroit.
But American drivers rejected the car, complaining of its weak engine. The failure made Mr. Toyoda "determined to develop a high-quality passenger car that would perform well anywhere in the world," he wrote in the Nikkei in 2014.
Despite the flub, he quickly rose in the company's ranks, partly because of his talent for engineering and business and partly because of his family's continued influence over the business. By 1982, when the two halves of the company reunited, he was at the top.
It was a period of both great promise and risk for the company. Japan had surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest automaker, and with inflation, unemployment and protectionist sentiment running high in America, Tokyo and Washington agreed on the first of many rounds of import restrictions on Japanese automobiles.
While Nissan and Honda established American factories, Mr. Toyoda led the company into a deal with General Motors, intended to help the company increase its American sales. In an interview with The New York Times, one company executive said the move was like offering "salt to our enemy," a reference to Japan's feudal period, when warlords would sometimes feed people in enemy territory. Car and Driver magazine ran the headline "Hell Freezes Over." The partnership ended soon after General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009.
Even as he competed with American companies, Mr. Toyoda pushed for Japanese companies to play a bigger role in the communities where they built their factories. In a 1990 speech, he encouraged Japanese industrialists to "contribute on the same level as Americans" by becoming active in local charitable organizations in the United States. (The Japanese government gave tax breaks to those that did.)
As Americans became enamored of Toyota's ultraefficient production practices, Mr. Toyoda started a management training center to help U.S. businesses. And he helped keep trade tensions down through concessions to Washington.
By 1992, when he stepped down as president to become the company's chairman, Toyota had plants in 22 countries and was competing with its former partner, General Motors, for the title of the world's largest automaker. It won that battle in 2008.
In 1994, as Japan's meteoric economic rise suddenly turned into a period of stagnation, Mr. Toyoda was appointed head of the business lobbying group Keidanren, where he spent four years pushing the country to reduce the many regulations that he believed hindered its growth.
He stepped down as Toyota's chairman in 1999 and became honorary chairman for life, a position from which he continued to influence the company's course. He was inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007.
He is survived by his wife, Hiroko, whom he married in 1952; a son, Akio; and a daughter, Atsuko.
Reflecting on his career in the 2014 article, Mr. Toyoda wrote, "I have worked single-mindedly to add at least a few new lines to the auto industry history books."

Scholar Suggests Mass Suicide for Japan's Old. Does He Mean It?: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Yusuke Narita says he is mainly addressing a growing effort to revamp Japan's age-based hierarchies. Still, he has pushed the country's hottest button.
His pronouncements could hardly sound more drastic.
In interviews and public appearances, Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor of economics at Yale, has taken on the question of how to deal with the burdens of Japan's rapidly aging society.
"I feel like the only solution is pretty clear," he said during one online news program in late 2021. "In the end, isn't it mass suicide and mass 'seppuku' of the elderly?" Seppuku is an act of ritual disembowelment that was a code among dishonored samurai in the 19th century.
Last year, when asked by a school-age boy to elaborate on his mass seppuku theories, Dr. Narita graphically described to a group of assembled students a scene from "Midsommar," a 2019 horror film in which a Swedish cult sends one of its oldest members to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff.
"Whether that's a good thing or not, that's a more difficult question to answer," Dr. Narita told the questioner as he assiduously scribbled notes. "So if you think that's good, then maybe you can work hard toward creating a society like that."
At other times, he has broached the topic of euthanasia. "The possibility of making it mandatory in the future," he said in one interview, will "come up in discussion."
Dr. Narita, 37, said that his statements had been "taken out of context," and that he was mainly addressing a growing effort to push the most senior people out of leadership positions in business and politics -- to make room for younger generations. Nevertheless, with his comments on euthanasia and social security, he has pushed the hottest button in Japan.
While he is virtually unknown even in academic circles in the United States, his extreme positions have helped him gain hundreds of thousands of followers on social media in Japan among frustrated youths who believe their economic progress has been held back by a gerontocratic society.
Appearing frequently on Japanese online shows in T-shirts, hoodies or casual jackets, and wearing signature eyeglasses with one round and one square lens, Dr. Narita leans into his Ivy League pedigree as he fosters a nerdy shock jock impression. He is among a few Japanese provocateurs who have found an eager audience by gleefully breaching social taboos. His Twitter bio: "The things you're told you're not allowed to say are usually true."
Last month, several commenters discovered Dr. Narita's remarks and began spreading them on social media. During a panel discussion on a respected internet talk show with scholars and journalists, Yuki Honda, a University of Tokyo sociologist, described his comments as "hatred toward the vulnerable."
A growing group of critics warn that Dr. Narita's popularity could unduly sway public policy and social norms. Given Japan's low birthrate and the highest public debt in the developed world, policymakers increasingly worry about how to fund Japan's expanding pension obligations. The country is also grappling with growing numbers of older people who suffer from dementia or die alone.
In written answers to emailed questions, Dr. Narita said he was "primarily concerned with the phenomenon in Japan, where the same tycoons continue to dominate the worlds of politics, traditional industries, and media/entertainment/journalism for many years."
The phrases "mass suicide" and "mass seppuku," he wrote, were "an abstract metaphor."
"I should have been more careful about their potential negative connotations," he added. "After some self-reflection, I stopped using the words last year."
His detractors say his repeated remarks on the subject have already spread dangerous ideas.
"It's irresponsible," said Masaki Kubota, a journalist who has written about Dr. Narita. People panicking about the burdens of an aging society "might think, 'Oh, my grandparents are the ones who are living longer,"' Mr. Kubota said, "'and we should just get rid of them."'
Masato Fujisaki, a columnist, argued in Newsweek Japan that the professor's remarks "should not be easily taken as a 'metaphor."' Dr. Narita's fans, Mr. Fujisaki said, are people "who think that old people should just die already and social welfare should be cut."
Despite a culture of deference to older generations, ideas about culling them have surfaced in Japan before. A decade ago, Taro Aso -- the finance minister at the time and now a power broker in the governing Liberal Democratic Party -- suggested that old people should "hurry up and die."
Last year, "Plan 75," a dystopian movie by the Japanese filmmaker Chie Hayakawa, imagined cheerful salespeople wooing retirees into government-sponsored euthanasia. In Japanese folklore, families carry older relatives to the top of mountains or remote corners of forests and leave them to die.
Dr. Narita's language, particularly when he has mentioned "mass suicide," arouses historical sensitivities in a country where young men were sent to their deaths as kamikaze pilots during World War II and Japanese soldiers ordered thousands of families in Okinawa to commit suicide rather than surrender.
Critics worry that his comments could summon the kinds of sentiments that led Japan to pass a eugenics law in 1948, under which doctors forcibly sterilized thousands of people with intellectual disabilities, mental illness or genetic disorders. In 2016, a man who believed those with disabilities should be euthanized murdered 19 people at a care home outside Tokyo.
In his day job, Dr. Narita conducts technical research of computerized algorithms used in education and health care policy. But as a regular presence across numerous internet platforms and on television in Japan, he has grown increasingly popular, appearing on magazine covers, comedy shows and in an advertisement for energy drinks. He has even spawned an imitator on TikTok.
He often appears with Gen X rabble-rousers like Hiroyuki Nishimura, a celebrity entrepreneur and owner of 4chan, the online message board where some of the internet's most toxic ideas bloom, and Takafumi Horie, a trash-talking entrepreneur who once went to prison for securities fraud.
At times, he has pushed the boundaries of taste. At a panel hosted by Globis, a Japanese graduate business school, Dr. Narita told the audience that "if this can become a Japanese society where people like you all commit seppuku one after another, it wouldn't be just a social security policy but it would be the best 'Cool Japan' policy." Cool Japan is a government program promoting the country's cultural products.
Shocking or not, some lawmakers say Dr. Narita's ideas are opening the door to much-needed political conversations about pension reform and changes to social welfare. "There is criticism that older people are receiving too much pension money and the young people are supporting all the old people, even those who are wealthy," said Shun Otokita, 39, a member of the upper house of Parliament with Nippon Ishin no Kai, a right-leaning party.
But detractors say Dr. Narita highlights the burdens of an aging population without suggesting realistic policies that could alleviate some of the pressures.
"He's not focusing on helpful strategies such as better access to day care or broader inclusion of women in the work force or broader inclusion of immigrants," said Alexis Dudden, a historian at the University of Connecticut who studies modern Japan. "Things that might actually invigorate Japanese society."
In broaching euthanasia, Dr. Narita has spoken publicly of his mother, who had an aneurysm when he was 19. In an interview with a website where families can search for nursing homes, Dr. Narita described how even with insurance and government financing, his mother's care cost him 100,000 yen -- or about $ 760 -- a month.
Some surveys in Japan have indicated that a majority of the public supports legalizing voluntary euthanasia. But Mr. Narita's reference to a mandatory practice spooks ethicists. Currently, every country that has legalized the practice only "allows it if the person wants it themselves," said Fumika Yamamoto, a professor of philosophy at Tokyo City University.
In his emailed responses, Dr. Narita said that "euthanasia (either voluntary or involuntary) is a complex, nuanced issue."
"I am not advocating its introduction," he added. "I predict it to be more broadly discussed."
At Yale, Dr. Narita sticks to courses on probability, statistics, econometrics and education and labor economics.
Neither Tony Smith, the department chair in economics, nor a spokesperson for Yale replied to requests for comment.
Josh Angrist, who has won the Nobel in economic science and was one of Dr. Narita's doctoral supervisors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his former student was a "talented scholar" with an "offbeat sense of humor."
"I would like to see Yusuke continue a very promising career as a scholar," Dr. Angrist said. "So my main concern in a case like his is that he's being distracted by other things, and that's kind of a shame."

Shocking or not, some lawmakers say Narita’s ideas are opening the door to much-needed political conversations about pension reform and changes to social welfare. “There is criticism that older people are receiving too much pension money and the young people are supporting all the old people, even those who are wealthy,” said Shun Otokita, 39, a member of the upper house of parliament with Nippon Ishin no Kai, a right-leaning party.
But detractors say Narita highlights the burdens of an aging population without suggesting realistic policies that could alleviate some of the pressures.
“He’s not focusing on helpful strategies such as better access to day care or broader inclusion of women in the workforce or broader inclusion of immigrants,” said Alexis Dudden, a historian at the University of Connecticut who studies modern Japan. “Things that might actually invigorate Japanese society.”
In broaching euthanasia, Narita has spoken publicly of his mother, who had an aneurysm when he was 19. In an interview with a website on which families can search for nursing homes, Narita described how even with insurance and government financing, his mother’s care cost him 100,000 yen — or about $760 — a month.
Some surveys in Japan have indicated that a majority of the public supports legalizing voluntary euthanasia. But Narita’s reference to a mandatory practice spooks ethicists. Currently, every country that has legalized the practice only “allows it if the person wants it themselves,” said Fumika Yamamoto, a professor of philosophy at Tokyo City University.
In his emailed responses, Narita said that “euthanasia (either voluntary or involuntary) is a complex, nuanced issue.”
“I am not advocating its introduction,” he added. “I predict it to be more broadly discussed.”
At Yale, Narita sticks to courses on probability, statistics, econometrics and education and labor economics.
Neither Tony Smith, the department chair in economics, nor a spokesperson for Yale replied to requests for comment.
Josh Angrist, who has won the Nobel in economic science and was one of Narita’s doctoral supervisors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his former student was a “talented scholar” with an “offbeat sense of humor.”
“I would like to see Yusuke continue a very promising career as a scholar,” Angrist said. “So my main concern in a case like his is that he’s being distracted by other things, and that’s kind of a shame.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Airline Group Asks F.A.A. To Extend 5G Deadline
A group representing major U.S. airlines has "strongly urged" the Federal Aviation Administration to extend a proposed deadline to June 2024 to retrofit airplane altimeters to ensure they are not susceptible to 5G wireless interference.
Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and others, also asked the F.A.A. to revise a proposed 5G safety directive "to reflect technical realities and the continued safe operation of many aircraft." The group warned that a "material number of aircraft" in U.S. fleets will not be modified by July and without changes it could "severely limit operations" and lead to flight delays and cancellations.
In January, the F.A.A. proposed requiring passenger and cargo aircraft in the United States have 5G C-Band-tolerant radio altimeters or approved filters by February 2024. The agency reiterated on Friday that it would evaluate all comments. REUTERS

Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Over Robinhood I.P.O.
A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the Robinhood online brokerage of misleading investors about its financials and growth prospects when conducting its 2021 initial public offering.
Judge Edward Chen of U.S. District Court in San Francisco found no proof that disclosures in Robinhood's I.P.O. materials were false or misleading, or that declines in key metrics shortly before the company went public in July 2021 were historically extraordinary.
He said Robinhood's warnings about future growth were "not particularly robust," but were sufficient.
"Plaintiffs thus failed to plead that Robinhood did not disclose 'material factors' that would make an investment in Robinhood speculative or risky," Judge Chen wrote.
Shareholders in the proposed class action said Robinhood had concealed "severe deterioration" in the two months before the California-based company's I.P.O. REUTERS

Honda's Profit Soars,
Led by Motorcycle Sales
Honda on Friday reported a 27 percent jump in its October to December profit, despite headwinds like shortages of computer chips and rising costs of raw materials.
The company, based in Tokyo, saw profit in the last quarter totaling 244.6 billion yen ( $ 1.9 billion), up from 192.9 billion yen the year before.
Quarterly sales rose 20 percent to 4.4 trillion yen ( $ 33.5 billion), as Honda sold more motorcycles around the world, compared to a year ago, while vehicle sales were little changed.
By region, Honda sold more vehicles in Japan and the U.S., but sales declined in China and other parts of Asia. Motorcycle sales grew across all major markets, including Japan, North America and the rest of Asia, especially Indonesia, India and Vietnam.
Like other automakers, Honda is stepping up in the push to offer more electric vehicles, as concerns grow about climate change. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Biden Aims Pitch at White Voters Without Degrees: [National Desk]

Full text: In his State of the Union address, the president signaled the opening of a yearslong push to persuade white working-class voters to return to the Democratic fold. Winning them over on cultural issues may be more difficult.
With his call for a "blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America," President Biden on Tuesday night acknowledged rhetorically what Democrats have been preparing for two years: a fierce campaign to win back white working-class voters through the creation of hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs that do not require a college degree.
Mr. Biden's economically focused State of the Union address may have avoided the cultural appeals to the white working class that former President Donald J. Trump harnessed so effectively, the grievances encapsulated by fears of immigration, racial and gender diversity, and the sloganeering of the intellectual left. But at the speech's heart was an appeal to Congress to "finish the job" and a simple challenge. "Let's offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not," he said.
In truth, much of that path was already laid by the last Congress with the signing of a $ 1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $ 280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $ 370 billion for low-emission energy to combat climate change.
Whether or not Mr. Biden can persuade a divided Congress to act on his remaining plans, the money from those laws has just begun to flow, and a surge of hiring is coming. Many of those jobs will be in the industrial battlegrounds that Democrats either took back from Mr. Trump in 2020 or will need in 2024, when endangered senators like Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin face re-election.
But Democrats will have to match those jobs against Republican appeals aimed at white grievances.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, ordered state agencies and universities this week to stop considering racial and ethnic diversity in hiring. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is waging a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while funding the shipping of migrants from the Mexican border to Democratic cities. The Republican-led House is holding hearings blaming illegal immigrants for the smuggling of fentanyl that is ravaging blue-collar cities and towns, though most of the arrests in the fentanyl trade have involved American smugglers.
Republicans openly mocked Mr. Biden's "Finish the Job" slogan, and among working-class voters, they have public opinion on their side. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, just 36 percent of Americans without a college degree approved of Mr. Biden's job performance, compared with 53 percent of college graduates. His approval on economic issues was even worse, with just 31 percent of voters without a degree approving of his handling of the economy.
"Finish the job? On what? Fueling inflation? Opening the border? Lowering wages? Emptying our energy reserves?" asked Tommy Pigott, the rapid response coordinator at the Republican National Committee.
Without doubt, Democrats have their work cut out for them. About two-thirds of eligible voters do not have four-year college degrees, and over the last decade, Democrats have lost ground with them, especially with less educated white voters. In 2020, Mr. Biden won 61 percent of college graduates, but only 45 percent of voters without a four-year college degree -- and just 33 percent of white voters without a four-year degree.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll in September, 59 percent of white working-class voters said Republicans were the party of the working class, compared with 28 percent who chose Democrats. Sixty-eight percent of these voters said they agreed more with Republicans than Democrats on the economy, while just 25 percent picked Democrats. Beyond economics, white working-class voters sided overwhelmingly with Republicans on building a border wall, opposing gun control, stopping illegal immigration and seeing gender as immutable and determined at birth.
Democrats, caught between those sentiments on social policy and the party's core constituencies of people of color, women and the college-educated, are hoping that tangible improvements in well-being can persuade white voters without a college education to focus on their economic interests.
"Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because choices we made in the last two years," Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. "This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives."
Democratic problems with the working class are not limited to white voters. Some blue-collar Black, Latino and Asian American voters have drifted toward Republicans, and Mr. Biden rolled out a range of economic appeals aimed broadly at people who are more sensitive to high prices.
He highlighted his efforts to lower insulin costs and cited pocketbook issues recognizable to almost any consumer -- what he called "junk fees." He identified "exorbitant" bank overdraft charges; credit card late fees; "resort fees" charged by hotels; change-of-service fees by cable and internet providers; and airline "surcharges."
"Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in," Mr. Biden said. "They add up to hundreds of dollars a month."
Other Democrats are taking a similar approach. On his first full day in office, Pennsylvania's new Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, signed an executive order declaring that thousands of state jobs would no longer require a four-year college degree.
And it might work. The Pew Research Center found recently that 71 percent of voters with no degree beyond a high school diploma said the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year, higher than any other issue.
To that end, Mr. Biden spoke of "a literal field of dreams" outside Columbus, Ohio, where a huge new Intel semiconductor plant is being built that will, he said, "create 10,000 jobs," including "7,000 construction jobs" and "3,000 jobs once the factories are finished." Already, unions in Ohio are ramping up training and apprenticeship programs that are explicitly favored by the federal semiconductor legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, and reaching out to women, teenagers, veterans and other workers who have traditionally been outside the organized labor movement to prepare for the semiconductor work.
"To the extent that manufacturing is characteristic of a lot of places that will become competitors for CHIPS investment, there's implicit orientation toward significant union history," said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "There are going to be significant numbers of noncollege jobs and a real opportunity for the economic inclusion of noncollege workers."
For Ohio, that Intel plant is only the beginning. Spurred by large tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Honda has announced a reworking of its Ohio plants to build electric vehicles and batteries. General Motors is retooling its plant in Toledo for electric vehicle production, and Arizona-based First Solar is dumping money into northern Ohio. In December, workers at a new E.V. battery plant outside Youngstown voted overwhelmingly to join the United Auto Workers, giving the unions a toehold in the rapidly growing battery industry.
The rebuilding of the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky to Ohio with money from the infrastructure law will employ construction workers in Cincinnati for six to 10 years. And explicit language in the federal laws mandates the payment of union-scale wages, the employment of union-trained apprentices and the purchase of American-made materials.
"We just can go on and on, but it's real, what the president has done," said Mike Knisley, executive secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, who was at the White House for the signing of the semiconductor bill. "Everybody's talked about it, Democrats and Republicans alike, but Biden delivered."
Beyond the Midwest, the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 81 in Syracuse, N.Y., is scrambling to bring in thousands of new members to work at Micron's chip plant under construction in upstate New York. Last week, Mr. Biden promoted major infrastructure projects in Baltimore, New York and New Jersey that will create tens of thousands of jobs, "every freaking one, union labor."
None of this guarantees that rank-and-file union workers -- or the 90 percent of privately employed workers who are not in a union -- will shift back to the Democrats. Mr. Biden's approval rating remains mired in the low 40s, and confidence in the economy is abysmal.
Even union workers seem to maintain skepticism. Josh Abernathy, the business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Eight in Toledo, complained bitterly that while his members had been used to build a First Solar panel fabrication plant outside the city, the contractor on the project had brought in workers from Croatia and other Eastern European countries to install and maintain the fabrication equipment, work that ultimately outpaced construction jobs.
Mr. Abernathy filed a formal protest with the Biden administration's Labor Department, saying that imported workers -- the kind of nonlocal hires the administration had vowed to stop -- were making $ 500 every two weeks and room and board.
"We had 150 electricians out there; don't get me wrong," he said. "But then we were equally matched with the installation of conveyor work when we were long gone."
Rusty Brown, who was an official with the Trump administration's Labor Department and is now with the anti-union Freedom Foundation, said the explicit requirement that federally funded infrastructure, semiconductor and clean energy projects pay union-scale wages would mean the wasting of taxpayer money.
"This is not at all the way a normal person would run a business," he said. "If somebody was mowing your lawn for $ 50 and someone else said he'd do it for $ 40, you'd do it. You just would."
But he acknowledged the power of provisions in federal legislation to mandate the employment of workers trained through "registered" apprenticeship programs -- more than half of which are run through the unions.
The Trump administration tried to encourage private industry to develop its own apprenticeship programs for workers without college degrees through regulation and exhortation but got nowhere, Mr. Brown said.
"It's something I wish companies would have taken more seriously," he said with a sigh.

With his call for a “blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America,” President Joe Biden on Tuesday night acknowledged rhetorically what Democrats have been preparing for two years: a fierce campaign to win back white working-class voters through the creation of hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs that do not require a college degree.
Biden’s economically focused State of the Union address may have avoided the cultural appeals to the white working class that former President Donald Trump harnessed so effectively, the grievances encapsulated by fears of immigration, racial and gender diversity, and the sloganeering of the intellectual left. But at the speech’s heart was an appeal to Congress to “finish the job” and a simple challenge. “Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not,” he said.
In truth, much of that path was already laid by the last Congress with the signing of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a $280 billion measure to rekindle a domestic semiconductor industry and the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $370 billion for low-emission energy to combat climate change.
Whether or not Biden can persuade a divided Congress to act on his remaining plans, the money from those laws has just begun to flow, and a surge of hiring is coming. Many of those jobs will be in the industrial battlegrounds that Democrats either took back from Trump in 2020 or will need in 2024, when endangered senators such as Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin face reelection.
But Democrats will have to match those jobs against Republican appeals aimed at white grievances.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, ordered state agencies and universities this week to stop considering racial and ethnic diversity in hiring. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is waging a campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts while funding the shipping of migrants from the Mexican border to Democratic cities. The Republican-led House is holding hearings blaming immigrants lacking permanent legal status for the smuggling of fentanyl that is ravaging blue-collar cities and towns, though most of the arrests in the fentanyl trade have involved American smugglers.
Republicans openly mocked Biden’s “Finish the Job” slogan, and among working-class voters, they have public opinion on their side. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, just 36% of Americans without a college degree approved of Biden’s job performance, compared with 53% of college graduates. His approval on economic issues was even worse, with just 31% of voters without a degree approving of his handling of the economy.
“Finish the job? On what? Fueling inflation? Opening the border? Lowering wages? Emptying our energy reserves?” asked Tommy Pigott, the rapid response coordinator at the Republican National Committee.
Without doubt, Democrats have their work cut out for them. About two-thirds of eligible voters do not have four-year college degrees, and over the last decade, Democrats have lost ground with them, especially with less educated white voters. In 2020, Biden won 61% of college graduates, but only 45% of voters without a four-year college degree — and just 33% of white voters without a four-year degree.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll in September, 59% of white working-class voters said Republicans were the party of the working class, compared with 28% who chose Democrats. Sixty-eight percent of these voters said they agreed more with Republicans than Democrats on the economy, while just 25% picked Democrats. Beyond economics, white working-class voters sided overwhelmingly with Republicans on building a border wall, opposing gun control, stopping illegal immigration and seeing gender as immutable and determined at birth.
Democrats, caught between those sentiments on social policy and the party’s core constituencies of people of color, women and the college-educated, are hoping that tangible improvements in well-being can persuade white voters without a college education to focus on their economic interests.
“Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because choices we made in the last two years,” Biden said Tuesday. “This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”
Democratic problems with the working class are not limited to white voters. Some blue-collar Black, Latino and Asian American voters have drifted toward Republicans, and Biden rolled out a range of economic appeals aimed broadly at people who are more sensitive to high prices.
He highlighted his efforts to lower insulin costs and cited pocketbook issues recognizable to almost any consumer — what he called “junk fees.” He identified “exorbitant” bank overdraft charges; credit card late fees; “resort fees” charged by hotels; change-of-service fees by cable and internet providers; and airline “surcharges.”
“Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in,” Biden said. “They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.”
Other Democrats are taking a similar approach. On his first full day in office, Pennsylvania’s new Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, signed an executive order declaring that thousands of state jobs would no longer require a four-year college degree.
And it might work. The Pew Research Center found recently that 71% of voters with no degree beyond a high school diploma said the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year, higher than any other issue.
To that end, Biden spoke of “a literal field of dreams” outside Columbus, Ohio, where a huge new Intel semiconductor plant is being built that will, he said, “create 10,000 jobs,” including “7,000 construction jobs” and “3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.” Already, unions in Ohio are ramping up training and apprenticeship programs that are explicitly favored by the federal semiconductor legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, and reaching out to women, teenagers, veterans and other workers who have traditionally been outside the organized labor movement to prepare for the semiconductor work.
“To the extent that manufacturing is characteristic of a lot of places that will become competitors for CHIPS investment, there’s implicit orientation toward significant union history,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “There are going to be significant numbers of noncollege jobs and a real opportunity for the economic inclusion of noncollege workers.”
For Ohio, that Intel plant is only the beginning. Spurred by large tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, Honda has announced a reworking of its Ohio plants to build electric vehicles and batteries. General Motors is retooling its plant in Toledo for electric vehicle production, and Arizona-based First Solar is dumping money into northern Ohio. In December, workers at a new EV battery plant outside Youngstown voted overwhelmingly to join the United Auto Workers, giving the unions a toehold in the rapidly growing battery industry.
The rebuilding of the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky to Ohio with money from the infrastructure law will employ construction workers in Cincinnati for six to 10 years. And explicit language in the federal laws mandates the payment of union-scale wages, the employment of union-trained apprentices and the purchase of U.S.-made materials.
“We just can go on and on, but it’s real, what the president has done,” said Mike Knisley, executive secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, who was at the White House for the signing of the semiconductor bill. “Everybody’s talked about it, Democrats and Republicans alike, but Biden delivered.”
Beyond the Midwest, the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 81 in Syracuse, New York, is scrambling to bring in thousands of new members to work at Micron’s chip plant under construction in upstate New York. Last week, Biden promoted major infrastructure projects in Baltimore, New York and New Jersey that will create tens of thousands of jobs, “every freaking one, union labor.”
None of this guarantees that rank-and-file union workers — or the 90% of privately employed workers who are not in a union — will shift back to the Democrats. Biden’s approval rating remains mired in the low 40s, and confidence in the economy is abysmal.
Even union workers seem to maintain skepticism. Josh Abernathy, the business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Eight in Toledo, complained bitterly that while his members had been used to build a First Solar panel fabrication plant outside the city, the contractor on the project had brought in workers from Croatia and other Eastern European countries to install and maintain the fabrication equipment, work that ultimately outpaced construction jobs.
Abernathy filed a formal protest with the Biden administration’s Department of Labor, saying that imported workers — the kind of nonlocal hires the administration had vowed to stop — were making $500 every two weeks and room and board.
“We had 150 electricians out there; don’t get me wrong,” he said. “But then we were equally matched with the installation of conveyor work when we were long gone.”
Rusty Brown, who was an official with the Trump administration’s Labor Department and is now with the anti-union Freedom Foundation, said the explicit requirement that federally funded infrastructure, semiconductor and clean energy projects pay union-scale wages would mean the wasting of taxpayer money.
“This is not at all the way a normal person would run a business,” he said. “If somebody was mowing your lawn for $50 and someone else said he’d do it for $40, you’d do it. You just would.”
But he acknowledged the power of provisions in federal legislation to mandate the employment of workers trained through “registered” apprenticeship programs — more than half of which are run through the unions.
The Trump administration tried to encourage private industry to develop its own apprenticeship programs for workers without college degrees through regulation and exhortation but got nowhere, Brown said.
“It’s something I wish companies would have taken more seriously,” he said with a sigh. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Adeed Fayaz, 26, had been shot on Saturday as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn in response to a Facebook Marketplace post.
A New York City police officer died from his injuries on Tuesday after he was shot while off duty during a robbery attempt as he tried to buy a car in Brooklyn, police officials said.
The officer, Adeed Fayaz, 26, a five-year veteran of the department, had been hospitalized at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn for three days since the shooting on Saturday night. Mr. Fayaz, an officer in the 66th precinct in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was married and the father of two young children, officials said.
"Police Officer Adeed Fayaz was a father, a husband, a son, and a protector of our great city," the police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said on Twitter in a post announcing his death.
Randy Jones, 38, of East Harlem, was arrested in connection with the shooting on Monday night and charged with murder and attempted robbery on Tuesday evening.
According to the police, the two men had arranged over Facebook Marketplace to meet so that Mr. Fayaz could purchase a Honda Pilot for $ 24,000. After Mr. Fayaz arrived at an address in East New York, Brooklyn, at around 6:50 p.m. on Saturday, along with his brother-in-law, Mr. Jones "jokingly" asked the men if they were carrying guns while walking them down a driveway, James Essig, the New York Police Department's chief of detectives, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Both men said no, Chief Essig said, and Mr. Jones then pulled Mr. Fayaz into a headlock, pointed a gun to his head and demanded money, he said. When Mr. Fayaz said that he didn't have any money, Mr. Jones pointed the gun at Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, Chief Essig said, giving the officer a chance to break free of the headlock.
At that point, the gunman fired and struck Mr. Fayaz in the head, Chief Essig said, and fled while continuing to fire at both men.
The brother-in-law was able to grab a firearm off Mr. Fayaz's hip and fired toward Mr. Jones at least six times as he fled, Chief Essig said.
The incident unfolded in "a matter of seconds," he said.
Using dashcam video from Mr. Fayaz's brother-in-law, officers were able to connect the 2011 BMW that Mr. Jones drove away in to his mother, Chief Essig said.
With additional video footage, Mr. Jones was located by officers at a Days Inn in Nanuet, N.Y., on Monday night along with his girlfriend and five children, he said.
When he was arrested, Mr. Jones was cuffed using Mr. Fayaz's handcuffs, Chief Essig said, adding, "We wanted him to know what he did to that officer, and that officer's cuffs were on him, and I think it sends a powerful message."
He said the department is looking into "a few other" Facebook Marketplace robberies -- one that happened in January close to where Mr. Fayaz was shot and others in Southeast Queens -- to see if there were any connections to Mr. Jones.

After Extended Talks, Ford, Joining Red Bull, Is Back in Formula One: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The automaker and the drinks manufacturer are joining forces on a high-powered team in the world's most popular motorsports series.
The whispers of a merger between Ford and Red Bull had been the talk of Formula One for months, an intriguing story line in a competition that knows the value of drama.
The dance went on for months: Ford suggesting its interest in returning to the series was genuine, and Red Bull open about its discussions with multiple manufacturers.
On Friday, the companies confirmed the loudest rumors were true: Ford is re-entering into Formula One to partner with Red Bull, currently the series's top team and the employer of its reigning champion, Max Verstappen. In the new arrangement, the American automaker and the Austrian drinks company will join forces to design a new power unit ahead of the 2026 season, and try to extend Red Bull's dominance of the world's most popular motorsports series.
A flashy New York launch confirmed the partnership, a collaboration in which Red Bull will tap Ford's expertise in electric vehicles before a fundamental shift in engine rules for the 2026 season, when teams must become reliant on 100 percent sustainable fuels and, crucially for Ford at least, greater electric power.
That looming shift has already lured the German car manufacturer Audi to Formula One. Porsche, which held talks with Red Bull, is considering joining the fray, as is General Motors. Ford, which left Formula One almost two decades ago, also was looking for a way back in.
"We talked to a lot of people, we met with a lot of people," said Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive. "And as soon as we landed on Red Bull, we knew this was the right opportunity."
Formula One racecars are propelled by what is known as a power unit, a complex bit of machinery that includes several components, including an internal combustion engine, electrical motors and a turbocharger. Red Bull had previously been supplied with power units by Honda. But it found itself facing a crisis -- and needing a new partner -- when Honda announced in 2020 that it would leave Formula One within a year.
An agreement has since been reached for the team to continue sourcing Honda engines through 2025, but the shock of losing its supplier focused minds at Red Bull and ended with it resolving to build its own version rather than buy one produced by, or shared with, a rival like Mercedes.
"The Ford discussion felt right from the word go," Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, said in an interview. Both he and Farley declined to provide financial details of their new partnership.
Red Bull, which already employs hundreds of people for its Formula One team, had decided it would go into the engine-building business in 2021, poaching top engineers from rivals, notably Mercedes, and setting up a new division at its factory outside of London. That operation, Red Bull Powertrains, will become the locus of the partnership with Ford.
For Ford, the new rules, particularly the emphasis on electricity, and sustainable fuels, led it to revise its position on Formula One, a sport that it left after deciding it could not justify the business case to remain. Ford sold its Jaguar racing team to Red Bull in 2004.
Ford's new involvement -- and, Farley made clear, its potential costs -- would not be as intensive as those borne by typical teams backed by automobile manufacturers like Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. "We wanted something more strategic," Farley said.
He called it "a very practical approach to entering Formula One," adding, "I can look my shareholders, the Ford family, in the eyes and say we're being very judicious and thoughtful."
Mark Rushbrook, the head of Ford's motorsports division, said Ford spoke with 10 Formula One teams, as well as some aspiring teams, before reaching a deal with Red Bull, a decision that executives said was eventually made late last year.
In an interview before the deal was announced, Farley and Horner both spoke of a division of labor and responsibilities, with Red Bull's expertise in aerodynamics seen as complementing Ford's research and multibillion-dollar investment in developing batteries and electric vehicles.
Farley described the partnership as "a tech exchange," but Ford may be just as excited about tapping into a new audience. Formula One, powered by new races and a popular Netflix series, is resurgent in the United States. Three races, including a first Las Vegas Grand Prix, will be held in America in the new season, more than in any other country on the globe-trotting circuit, and the hit Netflix series, "Drive to Survive," has made stars of its drivers and even team managers like Horner.
"I think, you know, that series opened America's eyes to Formula One," Horner said. "It brought in a whole new fan base, a young fan base, a much broader demographic, and it's had an incredible impact."
That is exactly the cohort that Farley and Ford are trying to reach as the company looks to grow its electric vehicle business. "We wanted to connect with a new group of consumers," he said.
Ford remains the third most successful engine manufacturer in Formula One history, but its last championship-winning car was driven by Michael Schumacher almost three decades ago. It knows as well as anyone how Formula One can be a fickle sport, and how rule changes can disrupt the fortunes of once dominant teams, a fact most recently confirmed by the decline of Mercedes, which until it was usurped by Red Bull in the last two seasons was the undisputed powerhouse of the grid.
By the time the Ford-Red Bull collaboration reaches the start line in 2026, the changes will be even more profound, and the potential for unpredictability even greater. Rushbrook described the changes as akin to "a clean slate" for the sport.
Red Bull's ability to ride rule changes successfully over its 16 years helped to shape Ford's thinking, he added. "They can really have the DNA or the culture inside their team to be the best and to be at the front," he said.
Farley said he is convinced that Ford has found a formula that works, one that will not require Ford to invest bottomless sums to keep pace with traditional factory-run teams.
"This is a different kind of wiring than the traditional relationships in the past," he said, "and one of the best bang for bucks in motorsports."

Activision Agrees to Pay $ 35 Million Settlement
Government regulators on Friday announced that the video game maker Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay $ 35 million to settle charges that it failed to maintain controls to collect and assess workplace complaints with regard to disclosure requirements and violated a federal whistle-blower protection rule.
The lack of necessary controls left Activision, the maker of Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft, "without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors," said Jason Burt, director of the S.E.C.'s Denver office.
In paying the settlement, Activision neither admitted nor denied the S.E.C.'s findings and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, the agency said.
Just over a year ago, Microsoft said it was paying a hefty $ 68.7 billion for Activision, but the deal is being held up by regulators in the U.S. and Europe over anti-competitive concerns. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Treasury Makes More E.V.s
Eligible for Tax Credits
The Treasury Department on Friday said that it was making more electric vehicles eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions.
The revised standards for E.V. tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum tax credit. Tesla's C.E.O., Elon Musk, met with top aides to President Biden last week to discuss the E.V. industry and the broader goals of electrification.
The decision raises the retail price cap for tax credits to $ 80,000 for G.M.'s Cadillac Lyriq, Tesla's five-seat Model Y, Volkswagen's ID.4 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Escape plug-in hybrid.
Ford and Tesla both said in recent weeks that they are cutting prices on some E.V. models in part to qualify for the new federal tax credit and spur buyer interest. ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTO SAFETY
U.S. Warns Honda Drivers
About Dangerous Airbags
Honda and the U.S. government are urging owners of about 8,200 older vehicles not to drive them until dangerous airbag inflators are replaced.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday issued a "Do Not Drive" advisory for the 2001 through 2003 vehicles with Takata inflators that have a high possibility of exploding and hurling shrapnel in a crash.
The safety agency says the risk to drivers and passengers is dire. If the inflators blow apart, they can shoot shrapnel toward a driver's face that could kill them or cause serious injuries.
The agency says the Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled previously but records show that repairs have not been made in the affected vehicles. Honda already has replaced 99 percent of the dangerous inflators.
"These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50 percent chance of rupturing in even a minor crash," the NHTSA's acting administrator, Ann Carlson, said in a statement.
Since 2009, the exploding airbags have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States.

Ford Lost $2 Billion in '22 As Two Investments Soured: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company's financial performance was hurt by its stake in Rivian, an electric truck company, and an autonomous car business.
Ford Motor said on Thursday that it lost $ 2.2 billion in 2022 as it wrote down the value of two big investments and struggled with high costs and supply chain problems.
The company wrote down its investments in Rivian, a young electric truck maker, by $ 7.4 billion and Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles, by $ 2.8 billion last year. Ford said on Thursday that it had almost completely sold its stake in Rivian. In October, Ford said Argo was winding down.
The automaker said its revenue had risen about 16 percent, to $ 158 billion, mainly because of higher car prices. The company sold 4.2 million vehicles worldwide, up from 3.9 million in 2021.
Ford has long struggled to reduce defects and recalls in its cars and trucks. Recalls can be expensive and time consuming, and company executives said on Thursday that they were working to improve the reliability of their vehicles.
"In simple terms, we need to improve quality and lower costs now," the company's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call.
Ford's performance was also hurt by a $ 600 million loss stemming from its joint ventures in China and about $ 12 billion in special expenses, including those related to Argo and Rivian, which has lost much of its value since it listed on the stock exchange in November 2021.
Excluding the special expenses, interest and taxes, Ford made a $ 10.4 billion profit last year, it said, roughly as much as in 2021.
"We should have done much better last year," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
In the last three months of the year, Ford had a $ 1.3 billion profit, a steep drop from a year earlier, when it booked a large gain from its stake in Rivian. Ford's revenue in the final three months of 2022 rose 17 percent, to $ 44 billion.
The company sold 1.15 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.1 million a year earlier but about 500,000 fewer than Ford had expected, Mr. Lawler said.
Ford's production has been slowed by the global shortage of computer chips, and Mr. Lawler said the company expected some disruptions to continue this year and a slight increase in production volume.
"In 2023, there is still going to be volatility on chips," he said. "On the older chips used in the auto industry, there is still capacity constraint."
Ford said it expected this year's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $ 9 billion and $ 11 billion.
Shares of Ford stock were down about 7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Ford said that its sales of cars and trucks in the United States increased 2 percent in January and that its sales of electric vehicles more than doubled in the month.
The automaker sold 145,070 cars and light trucks last month, up from 142,445 in January 2022, when a shortage of computer chips slowed production and left dealers with few vehicles to sell. At the end of January, Ford had 370,000 vehicles on dealer lots, up from 201,000 a year earlier, a strong signal that supply chain problems were easing.
Models responsible for the increase included pickup trucks, the Bronco sport utility vehicle and battery-powered models. Ford sold 2,264 electric F-150 Lightning pickup trucks, up from just 63 in January 2022, when the vehicle had just become available. It also sold 2,626 Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V.s, up 11 percent.
Ford halted production of the Mach-E in January while modifying its plant in Cuautitlán, just north of Mexico City, to increase output. Production will restart this month, the company said.
On Wednesday, Honda, Hyundai and Kia reported sales increases of 9 percent to 22 percent, also as a result of improved supplies of vehicles. But Toyota said its January sales fell 15 percent to 134,392 cars and trucks.

Scoring 30 Points a Game While Leading the League in Loyalty: [Sports Desk]

Full text: The Trail Blazers point guard has prized loyalty over easier paths to winning. And that's what makes him great.
Damian Lillard should get angry more often.
Through thick and thin with the only N.B.A. team he has known, Lillard, the Portland Trail Blazers' luminescent point guard, has always possessed a remarkable calm. Still, he is not above letting defeats get to him, as he showed after a recent meltdown loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.
"I'm confused why y'all asking me these questions right now," Lillard said in a news conference after his team coughed up a 25-point halftime lead. A reporter had asked Lillard about the state of his listing team. I followed up by asking how much more patience he had.
Lillard's voice sharpened, sending tension cracking through the room. It felt like his eyes were beaming lasers right through me.
"The struggles that we've had are obvious," he said, adding that he had been "transparent" about how Portland could improve.
He continued, calling the queries a "weak move" and indicating that he thought he was being baited into criticizing the makeup of his team as the league's trade deadline loomed. "Y'all putting me in a position to, you know, answer questions that I don't think is cool," he said.
Later, I had another interaction with Lillard, a brief moment of reconciliation that revealed his character. I'll get to that later. First, let's focus on all that is swirling, once again, around Portland's star.
Lillard is the N.B.A.'s most interesting outlier.
"He's one of a kind," said Chauncey Billups, who spent nearly two decades playing in the N.B.A. and is now the Blazers' second-year head coach.
Billups wasn't merely speaking about talent. Lillard is the rare basketball star who prizes loyalty to his city and team above all -- even if that means waiting and waiting, and waiting some more, for his team to become a championship contender.
"We understand how lucky we are to have him," Billups said. "Everyone in this city, and on this team, wants to win for Dame."
Problem is, the Blazers are the basketball equivalent of a sturdy Honda Accord. For almost all of Lillard's 11 seasons in the N.B.A., Portland has been a middling operation: good -- sometimes very good -- but never great.
It defies the norm for Lillard to remain on a team that seems stuck in neutral, while never demanding a trade or opting to leave.
Six times, the 32-year-old has been named an All-Star, and six times he has been chosen for an All-N.B.A. team. He was voted onto the league's 75th-anniversary team, meant to honor the 75 best players in league history. He won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 as a member of the U.S. men's national team. Cat quick, graceful, brimming with the kind of bold brio that is a hallmark of his native Oakland, Calif., Lillard recently passed Clyde Drexler to become Portland's leading career scorer.
And yet during Lillard's tenure in Portland, the Blazers have made the Western Conference finals only once. The current Blazers are talented -- and one of the league's youngest teams. Billups is learning on the job. If this team is to become a true contender in the loaded Western Conference, it may not be until Lillard is on the downslope.
Can we be OK with that?
The past week offered us a window into Lillard's world. A week ago Sunday: the 121-112 meltdown defeat by the Lakers.
Portland's postgame locker room felt like a morgue. In the concourse at Moda Center, the Blazers' saucer-shaped arena, fans let loose, dishing details to me about the team's legacy of losing. On a Facebook page for Blazers fans, the reviews were unsparing: "Lillard needs to go for his career to have any chance before it's too late. This team is DONE!!"
The next day, the Blazers thumped the San Antonio Spurs, 147-127. Lillard had 37 points and 12 assists.
Then came Wednesday. Peak Lillard. One for the books. In the Blazers' 134-124 victory over the visiting Utah Jazz, he scored 60 points, making an eye-popping 72 percent of his shots.
The remarkable thing was how easy it seemed. Lillard, averaging 30 points a game for the season, never once looked forced against the Jazz. He played what he described later as an "honest game," always making the right pass, moving the ball to the right spots, pulling up to shoot at exactly the right time. When Jazz players swarmed him, he looked like a buzzing hornet at a summer barbecue that everyone wants to stomp but nobody can catch.
Brilliant? You bet. According to ESPN, after taking into account combined marksmanship on shot attempts and free throws, it was the most efficient 60-point game in league history. Informed of this, Lillard was shocked, and all smiles.
"The most efficient 60-point game ever, for real?" he said. "That's crazy."
On Saturday, Lillard continued his torrid pace and again hit his season scoring average, but the injury-depleted Blazers fell meekly to the Toronto Raptors. He is doing all he can, to no avail. The Blazers sit at just 23 wins and 26 losses, mired in mediocrity, 12th out of 15 teams in the West.
Like many, I've often thought that Lillard's prime years were being wasted and that Portland should do right by him and find a way to move him to a contending team. He's nearing his mid-30s -- years when hardwood courts become quicksand for shifty point guards -- and a new breed of young stars is wreaking havoc across the N.B.A.
Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic and plenty of other 20-something talents are leavening the league with their skill and something close to Lillard's preternatural confidence.
N.B.A. life is only going to get more difficult for Lillard.
But I'm willing to reconsider the desire to see him leave Portland. To follow the common line of thinking, after all, is to place winning above all else. Sadly, that's the reasoning that has helped fuel the whipsaw superstar shuffle currently coursing through the N.B.A. LeBron James from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland and then to Los Angeles. James Harden from Houston to Brooklyn to Philadelphia. Example after example. I understand the "win above all else," "grass is greener everywhere but here" sentiment -- and I question it.
Winning is important, no doubt. But isn't there more to sports than victory?
More than any other N.B.A. star of his caliber, Lillard embodies the notion that the journey -- the often painful path toward getting better -- is the thing. It takes guts and patience and the ability to go against the grain. He has that. It also takes a certain kind of awareness that shows itself with deft passes and clutch shots and even in how players handle life off the court. Indeed, he seems to have that, too.
Remember how Lillard bristled at my question after the loss to Los Angeles? By chance, I found myself next to him in an arena hallway later.
He stopped me, shook my hand and looked me straight in the eye. He said he was sorry for his scolding reaction. The look on his face showed genuine sincerity.
"I didn't mean any personal disrespect," he said.
What stars would do that? Not many. "Sorry" isn't usually in the playbook. But not many are like Damian Lillard.

Full text: Moore, who has officially retired from the W.N.B.A., will be remembered for her brilliance on the court and her fight for justice away from it.
One of my clearest memories of Maya Moore has nothing to do with basketball, and nothing to do with her fight for justice.
It is a memory of watching her sing four years ago, in a choir at Passion City Church in Atlanta.
I do not recall the song, but I remember the impression she gave as she and the choir belted out a spiritual. Moore is perfectly comfortable settling in and finding a rhythm with the group. And she can also stand out and make a song her own.
That mix -- patiently one with the team and yet powerfully individual -- is a hallmark of a career that will undoubtedly end with enshrinement in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
It is the quality that animated her against-the-odds quest to free Jonathan Irons, the wrongfully convicted Missouri inmate serving 50 years for burglary and assault with a deadly weapon until Moore used her star power in a successful bid to gain his release. Then she married Irons, surprising even close chroniclers such as myself.
She carries those traits of communal leadership and independence into the next phase of her life. During a publicity tour for "Love and Justice: A Story of Triumph on Two Different Courts," a book she co-wrote with Irons, Moore announced Monday that she would never play high-level basketball again. At 33, a midcareer age for most players of her caliber, she is officially retiring. Her final game was a loss to the Los Angeles Sparks in the 2018 W.N.B.A. playoffs.
Moore, as always, took the script and made it her own.
"When I was playing, I always tried to bring energy, always tried to bring light and joy and intensity to what I was doing," she said after her announcement. "I hope people saw me as someone who gave all she had." She continued, noting another hope: that fans could also tell she had a healthy perspective about basketball and "where people fit into this journey of life."
What makes Moore stand out is the example she set away from basketball. By speaking up for justice before it was fashionable for athletes to do so, quitting the game to free Irons and continuing to fight for change in the judicial and prison systems, she became a beacon for others to follow.
Her retirement does not shock. It's not as if there have been social media posts in recent years showing her sweating through workouts at the gym. Notably private, when she popped up in public, she seemed perfectly content, Irons almost always at her side.
Now is the perfect time to take stock of her legacy. On the court, there were few like her.
She could score at will, rebound, pass, play defense and lead her team like a coach on the floor. She moved at her own pace, faster than the others or slower, depending on the moment. Either way, No. 23 seemed always to be in perfect time, and the results back that up.
Two N.C.A.A. titles starring for UConn. Two Olympic golds for the U.S. National Team. Four W.N.B.A. championships leading the Minnesota Lynx. Plenty of winning in international leagues and plenty of M.V.P. awards.
Off the court, well, she was even more extraordinary.
Walk away from a Hall of Fame-caliber career before turning 30 -- who does that?
Step out of the bright lights to take on what seemed like an impossible task -- gaining liberty for an inmate held in a maximum-security prison -- who does that?
Maya Moore, the one and only.
I followed her for weeks in 2019 as she worked to free Irons. There were interviews in restaurants and her church, in her Atlanta townhome, as we drove to visit an Atlanta shelter for struggling families and down No More Victims Road in the middle of Missouri to visit Irons in prison. What struck me most about Moore were her heart and mind.
At times, I admit, I found her a little frustrating. She seemed to answer questions only after pausing, slowing down and considering how she could be perceived. It took a while to understand that Moore's way of responding to a reporter reflected the careful way she did everything else. She mulls and ponders, mulls and ponders. Then she tells you she is mulling and pondering.
She would almost always deliver, speaking earnestly of her faith, philosophizing about the price of fame, how society is changing for better or worse, and the history of injustice toward Black people in the criminal justice system and beyond.
Raised by a single mother and a phalanx of extended family, she was taught since childhood to walk tall in the world while also standing apart from it. She was never going to follow the crowd. She was going to lead.
There's a tendency to think of Colin Kaepernick as the first prominent professional athlete to protest racial injustice during the fraught last decade. But before Kaepernick, Moore was helping lead her Lynx teammates in calls for change in the summer of 2016. The team wore black T-shirts over their jerseys. On the front were the phrases "Change Starts With Us. Justice and Accountability." On the back, "Black Lives Matter," along with the names Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two Black men shot to death by police that summer, and the Dallas police shield, honoring five officers fatally shot by a gunman who disrupted a peaceful protest of police brutality.
Moore faced a backlash, but she was undeterred. "I'd found my voice," she said.
Her willingness to be outspoken made perfect sense. It sprang from her faith. And from her connection with Irons, whom she had known since she was a teenager.
In the early years of Irons's imprisonment, Moore's great-uncle and godparents, deeply involved in prison ministry, took him under their wings and treated him like family. Eventually, the relationship between Maya and Jonathan would morph from something they described as siblinglike to something far more profound. She kept it quiet from almost everyone in her sphere, worried the attention would distract from the quest for Irons's freedom, but she fell in love with him while he was still incarcerated.
Through him, she knew well the price of injustice.
What's next for Moore? I can't say for sure, other than that I expect her to keep pushing for reform of the criminal justice system in her way, behind the scenes as often as in the public eye. She has most likely earned enough from playing and endorsements to be financially secure. (She hardly lives lavishly. When I checked in with her a while back, she spoke with joy of showing Irons Atlanta by driving around the city in her 2006 Honda Civic.)
She and Irons now have a son, Jonathan Jr., born early last year. She has said in interviews that they hope to grow their family.
"I'm stepping away to live a less famous life," she told me once. "A life where I am less visible than in my life as an athlete. Stepping away so I can do things that hopefully can be of service to the world in ways that might not be seen until they get done."
That was four years ago. It was true then and true now.

Robbie Knievel, 60, Motorcycle Daredevil Who Followed in His Father's Flight Paths: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He followed his father, Evel Knievel, into the high-flying world of motorcycle stunts, jumping the Grand Canyon and the fountains at Caesars Palace.
Robbie Knievel, a daredevil performer who soared into the sky on motorcycles, pulling off a series of spectacular airborne stunts like his father, Evel Knievel, died on Friday at his home in Reno, Nev. He was 60.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his older brother, Kelly Knievel.
Mr. Knievel, who was sometimes billed as Kaptain Robbie Knievel, followed his father into the high-flying, bone-shattering world of motorcycle stunt performances, landing more than 350 jumps over his death-defying 30-year career.
In one of his best-known jumps, in 1989, Mr. Knievel, decked out in a star-spangled white leather suit, vaulted 150 feet over the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. It was a kind of tribute to Evel Knievel, who had cleared the same fountains in 1967, only to land in a bone-breaking crash that horrified viewers, but that also added to his worldwide fame in the 1960s and '70s.
"When I made the jump and said, 'That was for you, Dad,' he ran up and hugged me, with tears in his eyes," Robbie Knievel recalled years later. "I had never seen him so emotional."
In 1998, Mr. Knievel soared more than 200 feet over 30 limousines at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. The next year, he jumped between the two Jockey Club hotel towers in Las Vegas with no net below, as pink and green fireworks exploded around him.
"This is crazy 'cause life is crazy," he told reporters afterward, The Las Vegas Sun reported.
Mr. Knievel hurtled over part of the Grand Canyon in 1999, breaking several ribs on the landing. That jump took place 25 years after his father had tried to clear the Snake River Canyon in Idaho on a steam-powered rocket, only to experience a parachute malfunction that sent him tumbling into the rocky chasm below.
Mr. Knievel also jumped over an oncoming steam train seconds before it struck his takeoff ramp and he flew over a row of military planes on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Intrepid in New York.
Robbie Knievel's jumps, like his father's, resulted in many cracked bones, including several vertebrae. "I am lucky I am still able to walk," he wrote in a 2019 essay about his relationship with his father, on the website fatherly.com.
Robert Edward Knievel was born on May 7, 1962, in Butte, Mont. He was the second-oldest of the four children of Linda (Bork) and Evel Knievel.
Evel Knievel died in 2007, at age 69, after years of failing health that included diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an incurable lung condition.
Enthralled by his father's derring-do, Robbie Knievel started riding motorcycles "when he was old enough to hang on to the handlebars," his brother said.
His first motorcycle was a Honda mini, which his father taught him to ride by putting him in a ditch, tying a rope around him and then yanking him off the seat if he accidentally twisted the throttle too far.
Before long, he was jumping over 10-speed bicycles and hanging a sign on the gate outside the family's house that read, "See Evel Knievel Junior jump for 25 cents," he wrote on fatherly.com.
At age 8, he performed his first show with his father, at Madison Square Garden, The two then toured across the United States and Australia together. Robbie Knievel would entertain crowds with "wheelie shows," he wrote in the essay, riding around on his back tire before his father's jumps.
He tried other jobs, such as laying tile and working in a sawmill and a bike shop, but he always returned to motorcycle jumping.
"I do it for the excitement and the quick money," he once said, adding, "I think I was born" to be a motorcycle stuntman.
He argued with his father as a teenager, and he left home at 19 to begin a solo career. But Evel Knievel remained an enduring influence.
Mr. Knievel wrote that before one of his first big jumps, over 10 parked vans, he became so anxious that he developed a fever, but he remembered his father's advice: "It's normal for you to be nervous. The bigger the crowd, the better you'll do."
Mr. Knievel's marriage to Lorin Lullo ended in divorce. In addition to his brother, Mr. Knievel is survived by two sisters, Tracey McCloud and Alicia Vincent; his daughters, Maria Collins, Krysten Knievel-Hansson and Karmen Knievel; and five grandchildren.
Mr. Knievel wrote that during the last years of his father's life, the two reminisced about "the crazy lives we'd lived, and how lucky we'd been time and time again."
"My dad struggled with the idea of passing the baton to me," he wrote. "He saw me as one of the many competitors who were trying to outjump him, but in reality I was his biggest fan."

Sales Dip on Chip Snags, but Ford Gains With E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's production was limited by a global chip shortage, but it made big gains in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
Ford Motor reported Thursday that its new-vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2022 as shortages of computer chips and other supply disruptions slowed its production of trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The automaker said it sold 1.85 million cars and light trucks in the United States last year, as well as 13,539 heavy trucks.
Ford's sales decline was in step with most other automakers. Overall, the industry sold about 13.8 million new vehicles in 2022, about one million fewer than in 2021, according to Edmunds, a market research firm. On Wednesday, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Stellantis reported significant declines in 2022 sales. General Motors was an exception: Its new-vehicle sales rose 2.5 percent, to 2.3 million vehicles.
For the last two years, automakers around the world have been hampered by a shortage of semiconductors, the tiny brains used in electronic devices that control a vehicle's engine, transmission, display screen and other major components. The chip shortage eased somewhat in 2022, but other supply problems were caused by Covid-19 outbreaks that at times interrupted production of key parts in China and Southeast Asia.
Supply issues limited the number of pickup trucks that Ford was able to produce, and sales of its F-Series trucks fell 10 percent, to 653,957 vehicles, although the F-Series remained the top-selling vehicle line in the U.S. market.
One bright spot for Ford was the introduction last spring of an electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The company said it sold 15,617 Lightnings in 2022, fewer than expected as it ramped up production of battery packs for the vehicle.
Ford also said it sold 6,500 electric delivery vans. Sales of an electric S.U.V, the Mustang Mach E, increased 45 percent, to 39,458 vehicles.
The company is counting on a surge in electric vehicle sales to drive growth this year. The automaker is building two battery plants in Kentucky and a third battery plant and a new electric truck plant in Tennessee.

Full text: A global semiconductor shortage is easing, which could allow carmakers to lift production this year. But higher interest rates could keep sales low.
Last year, sales of new cars and trucks fell to their lowest level in a decade because automakers could not make enough vehicles for consumers to buy. This year, sales are likely to remain soft, but for an entirely different reason -- weakening demand.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, which are intended to slow inflation, have made it harder and more expensive for consumers to finance automobile purchases, after prices had already risen to record highs.
Analysts expect that higher rates and a slowing economy will force some U.S. shoppers to delay car purchases or steer away from showrooms altogether in 2023 even if automakers crank out more vehicles than they did last year because they can get more parts.
"For over a decade, low interest rates have helped people buy the big cars that Americans like," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm. "Low rates from the Fed are what made those attractive offers for zero-percent financing and 72-month loans possible, but with the higher rates, it's a pretty unfriendly market for people buying a car."
Edmunds estimates that automakers will sell 14.8 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, which would be well below the sales that automakers became accustomed to in the previous decade.
Analysts expect the industry will have sold fewer than 14 million light trucks and cars last year in the United States once large automakers have reported their deliveries for the year. That would be a decline of more than one million from 2021. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the industry typically sold more than 17 million new vehicles a year.
If the dour estimates are confirmed, last year's sales total will rank as the lowest since 2011, when the industry had only just begun recovering from the financial crisis and sold 12.7 million new cars and trucks.
"It seems likely that rising interest rates are now constraining demand in the retail auto market," Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the market researcher Cox Automotive, said in a statement. "With record-high prices and elevated loan rates, the pool of potential new-vehicle buyers is shrinking."
Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, said its U.S. sales fell 13 percent in 2022. Honda reported a drop of by 33 percent, and Nissan's sales fell 25 percent. A main reason was the continuing shortage of computer chips, which forced manufacturers to slow or halt production at times over the last two years and left dealers with few vehicles to sell.
Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker by number of vehicles sold, said on Wednesday that its U.S. sales fell about 10 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles in 2022. But in an indication that the supply of chips and other parts improved toward the end of the year, the company said sales in the fourth quarter jumped 13 percent from a year earlier.
General Motors was one of the few automakers that bucked the industry trend, reporting a 2.5 percent increase in U.S. sales last year, to 2.3 million vehicles, putting it just ahead of Toyota after G.M. fell to second place for the first time in decades in 2021. G.M. said deliveries in the fourth quarter were up 41 percent.
Sales of G.M.'s electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, rose more than 50 percent to 38,120 for the year. The company also said sales of the GMC Hummer, an electric pickup truck that sells for more than $ 100,000, increased to 854. The company, which has said it aims to do away with internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, is counting on several new electric models to increase sales this year.
Another company that did relatively well was Hyundai, the South Korean automaker that sells cars under the Hyundai and Kia brands and that has also made a big push into electric vehicles. It's full-year sales fell just 2 percent, and its fourth-quarter deliveries jumped 29 percent.
Sales were strong for electric vehicles and for companies that specialize in that fast-growing business.
Tesla on Monday reported a 40 percent increase in its global sales for 2022, but its deliveries in the last three months of the year fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's stock, which ended down 65 percent last year, fell 12 percent on Tuesday. It rose 5 percent on Wednesday by the close of trading.
And Rivian, a smaller electric vehicle company, said on Tuesday that it fell several hundred vehicles short of its goal of producing 25,000 trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans in 2022.
Ford Motor is expected to report its sales on Thursday.
Automakers have been hampered by forces beyond their control for much of the past three years. The pandemic forced them to idle factories for two months in 2020. Then, starting in early 2021, they had to limit production because of the chip shortage.
The shortage has eased, and dealer inventories have improved but remain below normal levels. G.M. said its dealers had 410,000 cars in stock, about half the number before the pandemic.
Many automakers are also struggling to acquire enough batteries for their electric cars and trucks. Some people have been waiting months to buy certain models, like Ford's F-150 Lightning and G.M.'s Hummer pickup trucks.
Many consumers who want to buy new vehicles are also staying away from showrooms because the chip shortage has pushed prices higher. The Fed interest rate increases have also effectively made cars more expensive because many people must borrow money to buy a new vehicle.
According to Edmunds, U.S. consumers on average paid $ 47,681 for new vehicles in November, the most recent month for which data is available. That was a record high and up from $ 45,872 in November 2021. And the average monthly payment on car loans rose in the fourth quarter to $ 717 from $ 659, Ms. Caldwell said.
